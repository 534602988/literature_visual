Recognizing the challenges of small farming, China has promoted farmer professional cooperatives (FPCs) during the past two decades. The overall goal of this study is to analyze the emergence and current status of FPCs, the nature of recent policy initiatives and the role of government policies that have played in promoting recent trends. Based on a unique panel data from two rounds of national representative surveys of 380 villages in 2003 and 2009, this paper shows that while there was nearly no FPC in late 1990s, there were FPCs in 21% of China's villages and these FPCs provided services to about 24 million farm households in 2008. The determinants of FPC analysis show that the role of the government is of primary importance. Policy support measures and, most likely, the new legal setting in China after the passage of the 2006 FPC law, account for most of the growth of FPCs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Data from the Health and Retirement Study suggest that those approaching retirement age (early boomers ages 53 to 58 in 2006) have only 15.2 percent of their wealth in stocks, held directly or in defined contribution plans or IRAs. Their vulnerability to a stock market decline is limited by the high value of their Social Security wealth, which represents over a quarter of the total household wealth of the early boomers. In addition, their defined contribution plans remain immature, so their defined benefit plans represent sixty five percent of their pension wealth. Simulations with a structural retirement model suggest the stock market decline will lead the early boomers to postpone their retirement by only 1.5 months on average. Health and Retirement Study data also show that those approaching retirement are not likely to be greatly or immediately affected by the decline in housing prices. We end with a discussion of important difficulties facing those who would use labor market policies to increase the employment of older workers.","[Gustman, Alan L.; Tabatabai, Nahid] Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Gustman, Alan L.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Steinmeier, Thomas L.] Texas Tech Univ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Dartmouth College; National Bureau of Economic Research; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Gustman, AL (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",alan.l.gustman@dartmouth.edu; thomas.steinmeier@ttu.edu; Nahid.Tabatabai@Dartmouth.edu,,,,,,,21,36,47,2,17,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

The root cause lies in China's unique liberalization approach, that is, the combination of a complete liberalization of product markets and continued distortions in factor markets. Repressed costs of labor, capital, land, and resources artificially raise the profits of production, increase the returns to investment, and improve the international competitiveness of Chinese products. The asymmetric liberalization approach not only promoted economic growth, but also caused structural risks. It also contributed to global imbalances as well as regional integration.

We also find that women have to jump higher performance hurdles to promote across grades, but, within grades, their promotion probabilities are comparable to those of men.

We examine the competitive equilibrium properties and we solve for endogenous growth maximizing fiscal policy. We investigate the behavior of the government size and the growth rate to the sensitivity of time preference to public capital and the magnitude of public capital externality on production. We find that the Barro taxation rule [Barro, Robert J., Journal of Political Economy 98 (1990), 103-125], which states that the elasticity of public capital in the production function should equal the government size, is suboptimal. We show that the government does not necessarily have to increase income taxation following a rise in public capital intensity because of the externality of public capital on time preference and, in turn, on growth and the tax base of the economy.","[Dioikitopoulos, Evangelos V.] Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Kalyvitis, Sarantis] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece",University of Cyprus; Athens University of Economics & Business,"Dioikitopoulos, EV (通讯作者)，Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, POB 20537, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus.",evangelos.dioikitopoulos@aueb.gr,"Kalyvitis, Sarantis/AAI-4581-2021; Dioikitopoulos, Evangelos/AFH-9136-2022","Dioikitopoulos, Evangelos/0000-0002-6125-8211; Kalyvitis, Sarantis/0000-0002-7540-6019",,,,,50,4,4,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

The rationale of this methodology is to exclude a spurious technical regress from the macroeconomic perspective. In order to incorporate this in developing the index, a directional distance function and the concept of the successive sequential production possibility set are combined. With this combination, the conventional Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index is modified to give the sequential Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index. This index is employed in measuring environmentally sensitive productivity growth and its decomposed components of 26 OECD countries for the period 1970-2003. We distinguish two main empirical findings. First, even though the components of the conventional Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index and the proposed index are different, the trends of rates of average productivity growth are similar. Second, unlike in previous studies, the efficiency change is the main contributor to the earlier study period, whereas the effect of technical change has prevailed over time. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The one-, five- and twenty-day out-of-sample volatility forecasts of the GARCH-class models are evaluated using the superior predictive ability test and with more loss functions. Unlike Kang et al.

However, in general, the nonlinear GARCH-class models, which are capable of capturing long-memory and/or asymmetric volatility, exhibit greater forecasting accuracy than the linear ones, especially in volatility forecasting over longer time horizons, such as five or twenty days.

This paper uses a 12-quarter panel of course evaluations from the University of California, San Diego to discern whether a link between grades and effort investment holds up in a micro setting. Results indicate that average study time would be about 50% lower in a class in which the average expected grade was an A than in the same course taught by the same instructor in which students expected a C. Simultaneity suggests estimates are biased toward 0. Findings do not appear to be driven primarily by the individual student's expected grade, but by the average expected grade of others in the class.

We conclude that the movement away from fear of floating may not be explained by Bayesian or Robust policies. When the private sector anticipates the Central Bank's policy and endogenously determines the model, Central Banks may fall in a learning trap.

Using data for 154 countries for the period 1963-2007, we examine the short-run relationship between economic growth and moves toward and away from greater democracy. To address the potential endogeneity of economic growth, we use variation in precipitation, temperatures, and commodity prices as instruments for a country's rate of economic growth.

Brown and Matzkin (Econometrica 64:1249-1262, 1996) have shown that there are conditions that the data have to satisfy, if the observed prices are determined by the competitive equilibrium process, given the observed endowments, when there are no external effects in the economy's interactions. The results here show that the same conclusion does not apply, in general, if the economy exhibits externalities. On the other hand: (i) some restrictions exist if there exist at least two commodities on which the individuals' preferences are weakly separable; (ii) although extremely mild, restrictions exist too if one observed individual consumption for the economy that causes the external effects; and (iii) importantly, even if the previous two cases do not apply, restrictions exist when the externalities that exist are in the form of a public good.","[Carvajal, Andres] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Carvajal, Andres] Univ Warwick, CRETA, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick; University of Warwick,"Carvajal, A (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",A.M.Carvajal@Warwick.ac.uk,,,,,,,34,7,8,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

We construct laboratory markets with differentiated goods and costly buyer search in which sellers simultaneously post prices. The experiment varies the information on price or product characteristics that buyers learn under different timing assumptions (pre- and postsearch), generating four information treatments. Theory predicts that price information lowers the equilibrium price, but information about product characteristics increases the equilibrium price. That is, contrary to intuition, the presence of informed buyers may impart a negative externality on other uninformed buyers. Data support the model's negative externality result when sellers face a large number of robot buyers that are programmed to search optimally. Observed prices conform to the model's comparative statics and are broadly consistent with predicted levels. With human buyers, however, excessive search instigates increased price competition, and sellers post prices that are significantly lower than predicted.","Univ Richmond, Robins Sch Business, Dept Econ, Richmond, VA 23173 USA",University of Richmond,"Mago, SD (通讯作者)，Univ Richmond, Robins Sch Business, Dept Econ, Richmond, VA 23173 USA.",sdatta@richmond.edu,,"Mago, Shakun/0000-0001-9616-3151",,,,,32,3,3,0,9,UNIV NORTH CAROLINA,CHAPEL HILL,"SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL, CHAPEL HILL, NC 27514 USA",0038-4038,,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Differences in productivity between firms are the principal explanation offered by theory to explain heterogeneity with respect to international commerce. In particular, theory predicts that the least productive firms will produce for the domestic market only, while better performers engage in export activities, and the top firms establish foreign subsidiaries. This paper presents an empirical test of the relationship between productivity and patterns of international trade and production. Using German firm-level data from 1996 to 2002, we test the predicted rank ordering of productivity according to firms' trade pattern by examining the distribution functions of the three subsets of firms for stochastic dominance.

If government expenditure is introduced as a flow and the dynamic adjustment is fast, linearization may yield a reasonably good approximation to the true dynamics, even for fairly large policy shocks. If government expenditure assumes the form of a stock, leading to more sluggish adjustment, linearization may yield misleading predictions.

Resolving coordination failures is harder with randomly re-matched groups and the greatest success is achieved only upon payment of a performance bonus.","[Chaudhuri, Ananish; Paichayontvijit, Tirnud] Univ Auckland, Dept Econ, Auckland 1, New Zealand",University of Auckland,"Chaudhuri, A (通讯作者)，Univ Auckland, Dept Econ, 655 Owen G Glenn Bldg Level 6,12 Grafton Rd, Auckland 1, New Zealand.",a.chaudhuri@auckland.ac.nz; t.paichayontvijit@auckland.ac.nz,,,,,,,16,13,15,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

In the model, two countries export to a third country. Each exporting country is endowed with a set of differentiated products. Each government chooses the number of exporters for its country and the products that each exporter sells in the first period, and a tax policy in the second period. Firms choose prices or quantities independently in the third period. In the unique subgame-perfect equilibrium, both countries group all their products within a single firm-the national champion policy.

This study draws together results from multiple data sources to identify how the new accountability systems developed in response to NCLB have influenced student achievement, school-district finances, and measures of school and teacher practices. Our results indicate that NCLB brought about targeted gains in the mathematics achievement of younger students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds. However, we find no evidence that NCLB improved student achievement in reading. School-district expenditure increased significantly in response to NCLB, and these increases were not matched by federal revenue. Our results suggest that NCLB led to increases in teacher compensation and the share of teachers with graduate degrees. We find evidence that NCLB shifted the allocation of instructional time toward math and reading, the subjects targeted by the new accountability systems.","[Dee, Thomas S.] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Jacob, Brian A.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Virginia; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Dee, TS (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",,"Mills, Heather E/I-8209-2012","Dee, Thomas/0000-0001-7524-768X",,,,,42,47,227,0,22,BROOKINGS INST,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

Central Europe forms no exception. After the collapse of Communism in 1989 and the strong assertion of democracy at the local level, persons living near protected areas and elected officials from rural areas seem to have difficulty accepting the structures established for conservation purposes. A major factor in these conflicts has to do with disputes about land-use or between neighbors. Tensions also well up from a deeper level, from the contradiction between the viewpoints adopted in central European rural areas. A protected area defines a relationship between rural society and nature. It bears a dominant paradigm that orients rural development at the European scale and places the area to be protected at the core of strategies relating to the multifunctionality and sustainability of rural areas. Although this paradigm figures in most rural development strategies or, at least, is a facade for the strategies worked out by experts, all local actors do not necessarily share its values. Beyond their environmental dimension, the social conflicts surrounding protected areas shed light on tensions related both to the question of territorial governance and to the definition of global strategies of rural development in Europe.","Univ Lyon 3, Lab Environnment, CNRS, UMR 5600, F-69239 Lyon 02, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Institut National des Sciences Appliquees de Lyon - INSA Lyon; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Jean Moulin Lyon 3; Universite Lyon 2; CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE),"Depraz, S (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon 3, Lab Environnment, CNRS, UMR 5600, F-69239 Lyon 02, France.",samuel.depraz@univ-lyon3.fr,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,18,PRESSES UNIV FRANCE,PARIS CEDEX 14,"6 AVENUE REILLE, 75685 PARIS CEDEX 14, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

Two-way communication further improves payoffs in some games but is detrimental in others.

Both downturns featured global banking crises which were generated by boom-slump macroeconomic cycles. During both crises, world trade collapsed faster than world incomes and the trade decline was highly synchronized across countries. During the Depression income losses and rises in trade barriers explain trade's collapse. Owing to vertical specialization and more intense trade in durables, today's trade collapse is due to uncertainty and small shocks to trade costs hitting international supply chains. So far, the global economy has avoided the global trade wars and banking collapses of the Depression, perhaps owing to improved policy. Even so, the global economy remains susceptible to large shocks owing to financial innovation and technological change, as recent events illustrate.","[Grossman, Richard S.] Wesleyan Univ, Middletown, CT 06459 USA; [Grossman, Richard S.] Harvard Univ, Inst Quantitat Social Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Meissner, Christopher M.] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Meissner, Christopher M.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Wesleyan University; Harvard University; University of California System; University of California Davis; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Grossman, RS (通讯作者)，Wesleyan Univ, Middletown, CT 06459 USA.",rgrossman@wesleyan.edu; cmmeissner@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,74,16,17,0,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Capital is also perfectly mobile among the education sector, skilled labour using traded good sector and the nontraded good sector. However, land and unskilled labour are specific to another traded good sector. We analyse the effects of change in different factor endowments and reduction in tariff rate on skilled-unskilled wage inequality. We find that the effect of a change in different parameters on wage inequality depends on the factor intensity ranking between two skilled labour using sectors and on the relative strength of the marginal effects on demand for and supply of nontraded final good.

Using the province-level data in China, this paper shows that capital shares have a very significant and positive effect on per capita GDP. In particular, the differences in production functions explain 46.6% of the difference in per capita output between the East region and West region in China.

In particular, we investigate the out-of-sample forecasting performance of four volatility models - GARCH, EGARCH and APARCH and FIGARCH over January 2009 to October 2009. Forecasting results are somewhat mixed, but in most cases, the APARCH model outperforms the others. Also, conditional standard deviation captures the volatility in oil returns better than the traditional conditional variance. Finally, shocks to conditional volatility dissipate at an exponential rate, which is consistent with the covariance-stationary GARCH models than the slow hyperbolic rate implied by the FIGARCH alternative.

Unlike the classic marriage problem or college admissions problem, there need not exist a stable solution to the roommates problem. However, stability ignores the key physical constraint that roommates require a room and is therefore too restrictive. This motivates a new matching problem: matching agents subject to an initial assignment. A particularly important example is kidney exchange where after an assignment has been made, subsequent tests may determine that a patient and donor are incompatible. This paper introduces an efficient algorithm for finding a Pareto improvement starting from any status quo roommates assignment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This article analyses the Great Depression and the 2008 recession using recent developments in business cycle diagnostic procedures, and finds that the key to both episodes is understanding labour market distortions that resulted in the marginal product of labour being much higher than the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure. This finding stands in sharp contrast to the received wisdom, which focuses on the role of banking crises and capital market distortions.

I find that the 2007-2009 US recession differs substantially from other postwar US recessions, and also from the 2008 recession in other countries, in that lower labor input accounts for virtually all of the decline in income and output in the United States, while lower productivity accounts for much of other US recessions and the 2007-2009 recession in other countries. I also find that existing classes of models, including financial market imperfections models, do not explain the US recession. This is because the 2007-2009 recession is almost exclusively related to what appear to be labor market distortions that drive a wedge between the marginal product of labor and the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure, a topic about which current classes of financial imperfection models are largely silent. I discuss future avenues for developing this class of models, and I consider alternative hypotheses for the recession, including the view of John Taylor and others that economic policies intended to help manage the crisis, actually deepened the recession by increasing uncertainty and distorting incentives.",BUSINESS-CYCLE; GROWTH; PERSISTENCE; DYNAMICS; MODELS; INCOME; TRADE; COSTS; LABOR; TIME,,"[Ohanian, Lee E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Ohanian, Lee E.] Arizona State Univ, Ctr Adv Study Econ Efficiency, Tempe, AZ USA; [Ohanian, Lee E.] Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN 55480 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Federal Reserve System - USA,"Ohanian, LE (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",ohanian@econ.ucla.edu,,,,,,,66,66,79,0,28,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

In particular, I describe my attempts to found anonymous corporate vehicles without proof of identity and then to establish corporate bank accounts for these vehicles. (Transactions processed through the corporate account of such a shell company become effectively untraceable-and thus very useful for those looking to hide criminal profits, pay or receive bribes, finance terrorists, or escape tax obligations.) I solicited offers of anonymous corporate vehicles from 54 different corporate service providers in 22 different countries, and collated the responses to determine whether the existing legal and regulatory prohibitions on anonymous corporate vehicles actually work in practice.

Calculations here show that such targets could be achieved, based on technical and physical considerations, provided some key conditions are met. These key conditions include early participation by major sectors and regions in sufficiently stringent policy regimes. and a wide portfolio of mitigation options. Bio-energy and carbon capture and storage (CCS) play an important role in achieving low stabilisation targets. This would require optimistic assumptions with respect to the expansion of the area needed for food production, to allow space for bio-energy crops, and a significant increase in the efficiency of second-generation biofuels. The sensitivity analysis shows that if certain technologies are removed from the available portfolio, low targets - especially the 2.6 W/m(2) target - are no longer within reach.

One of the main advantages of acting adaptively is its stabilizing effect on dynamic equilibrium, associated with which are three favorable features: (a) non-destabilizing characteristics, (b) low-speed effectiveness and (c) the convexity of the stabilization regime in terms of the adaptive parameter. It is shown either in theory or by counter-examples that these advantages may not be preserved if the adaptive mechanism is applied to multidimensional processes. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the relevant phenomena are provided for two-dimensional dynamic processes with application to duopolistic dynamics. Our findings not only help to clarify hidden misconceptions and prevent potential abuse of adaptive mechanisms, but also illustrate the possible pitfalls arising from generalizing well-known characteristics of low dimensional and/or homogeneous agent models to high-dimensional and heterogenous agent models.

We provide theoretical evidence that the SOSM outcome may produce large welfare losses. Then we propose an efficiency-adjusted deferred acceptance mechanism (EADAM) that allows a student to consent to waive a certain priority that has no effect on his or her assignment. Under EADAM, consenting students cause themselves no harm, but may help many others benefit as a consequence. We show that EADAM can recover any welfare losses due to SOSM while also preserving immunity against strategic behavior in a particular way.

This paper argues that inventors' research collaboration networks reduce the uncertainty of firms about the match qualities of inventors prior to hiring. We estimate the effect of inventors collaboration networks on their productivity and mobility using the U.S. patent application database. It is found that networked inventors are more productive and have longer tenure than non-networked inventors. The evidence from fixed-effect regressions shows that the higher productivity and longer tenure of networked inventors are not solely attributable to unobserved ability of inventors or unobserved characteristics of firms. These results are consistent with the job match hypothesis between inventors and firms through their collaboration networks. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

(2) A natural person is less likely to employ a lawyer than a legal entity in medium and small districts, but not in large ones. (3) The self-rated cost of searching for a lawyer is lower in large districts than small ones.

Using a matched firm-worker data set, we estimate a long-run unconditional labor demand function, exploiting information on workers to correct for endogeneity in the determination of wages. We evaluate the employment and deadweight loss effects of observed employers' contributions imposed by labor laws (health insurance, training, and taxes) as well as of observed workers' deductions (social security and income tax). We find that nonwage labor costs reduce employment by 17% for white collars and by 53% for blue collars, with associated deadweight losses of 10% and 35% of total contributions, respectively. Since most firms undercomply with mandated employers' and workers' contributions, we find that full compliance would imply employment losses of 4% for white collars and 12% for blue collars, with respective associated deadweight losses of 2% and 6%.

It ignores the bottom-up distortions caused by allocative inefficiencies on the constrained side of the market. In this article we describe a simple graphical exposition of these bottom-up distortions.

In this paper, we seek to test this assumption by applying objective measures of health along with subjective measures and vignettes.

We show that this finding is sensitive with regard to the introduction of capital formation. While we are able to replicate the findings for the inflation inertia in a model with capital adjustment costs and variable capacity utilization, the output response to an interest shock is found to be too large and no longer hump-shaped in this case. In addition we find that the response of output to a technology shock can only be reconciled with empirical findings if either the adjustment of the utilization rate is very costly or there is only a modest amount of nominal rigidity in the economy.

VAR models for different countries are linked together via a trade matrix, as in Abeysinghe (2001). As expected, we find that oil producers (here, Russia and Canada) benefit from oil price shocks. For example, a large oil shock leading to a price increase of 50% boosts Russian GDP by about 6%. However, oil producers are hurt by indirect effects of positive oil price shocks, as economic activity in their exporter countries suffers. For oil consumers, the effects are more diverse. In some countries, output falls in response to an oil price shock, while other countries seem to be relatively immune to oil price changes. Finally, indirect effects are also detected for oil-consumer countries. Those countries, which trade more with oil producers, gain indirect benefits via higher demand from oil-producing countries. In general, the largest negative total effects from positive oil price shocks are found for Japan, China, the USA, Finland and Switzerland, while other countries in our sample seem to have fared quite well during recent positive oil price shocks. The indirect effects are negative for Russia, Finland, Germany and Netherlands. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Our measure of treatment expenditure is the hospital expenditure paid at the index admission (short term) and the sum of inpatient and outpatient expenditures paid in the subsequent year (long term). Our measure of health outcome is the probability of death in 1 and 12 months after the hospital's discharge. Our measure of competition follows the method developed by Kessler and McClellan that calculates the Herfindal index based on the predicted patient flows using exogenous variables (e.g., traveling distance to hospitals). Using data of patients hospitalized for new stroke and cardiac treatment between 1997 and 2001 in Taiwan, we find that an increase of market competition results in an insignificant impact on a patient's mortality. In terms of treatment expenditure, our results indicate that hospitals facing more competition incur higher expenditures, either the short- or long-term expenditure. Finally, we find evidence showing that an increase of treatment expenditure at admission is due to a raise of length of stay and treatment intensity per day as well as the usage of expensive equipment.

To this aim, I present a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with sticky prices, nominal wage rigidities and hiring costs. The comparison between this model and that of Blanchard and Gali highlights the non-trivial differences which exist in the way nominal wage and real wage rigidities drive the economy's dynamics. My conclusion is that models incorporating nominal wage rigidities and some degree of price stickiness provide a better account of macroeconomic dynamics than models with real wage rigidities.","Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Publ Econ, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Riggi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Publ Econ, Rome, Italy.",,,,,,,,56,7,8,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Our analysis reveals that the complete network, where each firm collaborates with all others, is uniquely stable. When R&D subsidies are not available, in addition to the complete network, the private partial and the private-hub star networks are Pareto efficient. However, the complete network becomes the unique Pareto efficient network when R&D is subsidized. This result is in contrast with earlier contributions in private oligopoly where under strong market rivalry a conflict between stable and efficient networks is likely to occur. It also highlights the role of a public firm as policy instrument in aligning individual incentives for collaboration with the objective of efficiency, independently of whether R&D subsidies are provided by the regulator.","Univ Surrey, Dept Econ, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England",University of Surrey,"Zikos, V (通讯作者)，Univ Surrey, Dept Econ, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England.",,,,,,,,27,15,16,0,13,UNIV NORTH CAROLINA,CHAPEL HILL,"SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL, CHAPEL HILL, NC 27514 USA",0038-4038,,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

First, such policies will likely be important in the coming decades as issues related to climate change and energy security come to the fore. Second, there are important lessons to be learned from a careful review of the actual performance of energy and environmental policies. We undertake a selective survey of the literature to highlight what is known about the efficiency of particular kinds of policies, laws, and regulations in these areas. This paper makes three key contributions. The first is to synthesize a large literature on energy and environmental policy in a way that can be easily digested by both non-experts and experts. The second contribution is to suggest that, if history is a guide, then we should not expect many interventions in these policy areas to come close to maximizing net economic benefits. The third is to suggest what might be needed for the development of more efficient energy and environmental policies.","[Anthoff, David] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland; [Hahn, Robert] Univ Manchester, Georgetown Ctr Business & Publ Policy, Sustainable Consumpt Inst, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Hahn, Robert] Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); University of Manchester; University of Oxford,"Anthoff, D (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.",david.anthoff@esri.ie; bob.hahn@gmail.com,"Anthoff, David/A-2105-2009",,,,,,109,31,38,0,58,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

We consider the Nash equilibria of a voluntary contributions to public goods game. Our main result is that, in general, the two partners either choose to contribute to different public goods or they contribute to at most one common good. The former case corresponds to the separate spheres case of Lundberg and Pollak (1993). The second outcome yields (local) income pooling. A household will be in different regimes depending on the distribution of income within the household. Any bargaining model with this non-cooperative case as a breakdown point will inherit the local income pooling.

The United Nations Standards of National Accounting recommended a new standard for the measurement of output from the public sector. Implementation has recently begun in many countries, in Europe based on a European Union directive. In the U.K. the Atkinson Review in 2005 came up with a series of recommendations. This article examines its recommendations concerning the definition and valuation of government outputs. For the non-market sector a market analog is recommended by the Review. However, several of its recommendations are inconsistent with that, championing social value as a basis for definitions and measurement. If taken seriously it will lead to arbitrary and politically controversial factors inserted into national accounts. The article highlights the norm that GDP is a measure of production, and advocates adhering to the market analog and following well recognized practices of national accounting.","MAPSEC, Managing Publ Sector, S-11242 Stockholm, Sweden",,"Murray, R (通讯作者)，MAPSEC, Managing Publ Sector, Drottningholmsvagen 1, S-11242 Stockholm, Sweden.",richard.murray@mapsec.se,,,,,,,21,4,4,0,14,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Several factors explain these differences: the political and institutional environment, inflation, economic and financial development, and the establishment of institutions that share information about borrowers. In contrast, the share of foreign-owned banks, the share of state-owned banks, and banking sector competition have no influence on credit maturity.

One group of low informed participants sequentially guess which of two states has been randomly chosen. In a matched pairs design, another group of high informed participants make similar guesses after having observed the guesses of the low informed participants. In the second experiment, participants' beliefs about the chosen state are elicited. In equilibrium, low informed players who observe an established pattern of identical guesses herd without regard to their private information whereas high informed players always guess according to their private information. Equilibrium behavior implies that information cascades emerge in the group of low informed participants, the belief based solely on cascade guesses is stationary, and information cascades are systematically broken by high informed participants endowed with private information contradicting the cascade guesses. Experimental results show that the behavior of low informed participants is qualitatively in line with the equilibrium prediction. Information cascades often emerge in our experiments. The tendency of low informed participants to engage in cascade behavior increases with the number of identical guesses. Our main finding is that information cascades are not fragile. The behavior of high informed participants differs markedly from the equilibrium prediction. Only one-third of laboratory cascades are broken by high informed participants endowed with private information contradicting the cascade guesses. The relative frequency of cascade breaks is 15% for the situations where five or more identical guesses are observed. Participants' elicited beliefs are strongly consistent with their own behavior and show that, unlike in equilibrium, the more cascade guesses participants observe the more they believe in the state favored by those guesses.","[Ziegelmeyer, Anthony] Max Planck Inst Econ, Strateg Interact Grp, Jena, Germany; [Ziegelmeyer, Anthony] Tech Univ Berlin, Fac Econ & Management, Berlin, Germany; [Koessler, Frederic] CNRS, Paris, France; [Koessler, Frederic] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Bracht, Juergen] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Winter, Eyal] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Econ, Jerusalem, Israel; [Winter, Eyal] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Ctr Study Rat, Jerusalem, Israel",Max Planck Society; Technical University of Berlin; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Paris School of Economics; University of Aberdeen; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Ziegelmeyer, A (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Econ, Strateg Interact Grp, Jena, Germany.",ziegelmeyer@econ.mpg.de; koessler@pse.ens.fr; juergen.bracht@abdn.ac.uk; mseyal@mscc.huji.ac.il,,"Winter, Eyal/0000-0002-4318-1759; KOESSLER, Frederic/0000-0001-7707-4217",,,,,31,19,24,2,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,,,EXP ECON,Exp.

Since mid-2007, SWFs have experienced significant portfolio losses, a decline in fund inflows, and enhanced scrutiny from their own governments. SWFs have been utilised for sovereign stabilisation programs and have helped finance troubled Western banks. SWFs and the IMF have also created a set of best practices known as the Santiago Principles. From these developments, many SWFs have moved to relatively shorter investment time horizons and more liquid holdings, revamped their transparency and management, experienced a temporary improvement in their images, begun to hold controlling stakes in major Western corporations, and have improved their coordination with institutional investors and other SWFs. Going forward, these changes, alongside the relatively strong post-crisis asset position held by SWFs in comparison to other asset vehicles, make SWFs well-positioned to play an even more prominent role in global finance.",,,,,,,,,,,21,9,9,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0818-9935,,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

We estimated a translog cost function with four factor consist of capital, labor, intermediate input and electricity over the 1980-2001. Our objective, taking in the consideration electricity as production input, was twofold: on the one hand, to estimate the price elasticity of electricity demand in manufacturing sector, and on the other hand to use cross-price and Morishima Elasticities of Substitution results for structural analysis regarding effects of electricity liberalization which initiated in 2001. Empirical result shows that electricity demand is relatively price sensitive (-0.85). Our result in terms of electricity price is consistent with the previous studies. While electricity-labor and electricity-capital inputs are complementary, results indicate the existence of substitution possibilities between electricity and intermediate input. This means that changes in electricity prices have impact on labor demand and investment demand. These results have important implications for public policy. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this setting, the price L(q) at period q can be defined as the expected liquidation value of the risky asset given players' past moves. This paper indicates that the asymptotics of this price process at equilibrium, as n goes to infinity, is completely independent of the natural trading mechanism used at each round: it converges, as n increases, to a Continuous Martingale of Maximal Variation. This martingale class thus provides natural dynamics that could be used in financial econometrics. It contains in particular Black and Scholes' dynamics.

Our results help explain why firms may pledge charitable donations, green production, or similar activities.

We derive two key properties for optimal estate taxation. First, the estate tax should be progressive, so that parents leaving a higher bequest face a lower net return on bequests. Second, marginal estate taxes should be negative, so that all parents face a marginal subsidy on bequests. Both properties can be implemented with a simple nonlinear tax on bequests, levied separately from the income tax. These results apply to other intergenerational transfers, such as educational investments, and are robust to endogenous fertility choices. Both estate or inheritance taxes can implement the optimal allocation, but we show that the inheritance tax has some advantages. Finally, when we impose an ad hoc constraint requiring marginal estate taxes to be nonnegative, the optimum features a zero tax up to an exemption level, and a progressive tax thereafter.","[Farhi, Emmanuel] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Farhi, Emmanuel] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Werning, Ivan] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Harvard University; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Farhi, E (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,26,63,70,1,33,M I T PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"238 MAIN STREET, STE 500, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1046 USA",0033-5533,,,Q J ECON,Q.

We applied recent developments in the threshold cointegration approach to investigate the presence of asymmetric dynamic adjusting processes between the prices of rapeseed oil, sunflower oil, and soybean oil, and the price of a mineral oil: diesel. The results presented suggest a two-regime threshold cointegration model only for the rapeseed oil-diesel price pair. Thus, the rapeseed oil price adjusts rapidly to its long-run equilibrium, determined by fossil diesel prices, but this adjustment is asymmetric: it differs if the divergence between the two prices is above or below a critical threshold. Consequently, rapeseed oil appears particularly exposed to external shocks deriving from global political scenarios, suggesting the reassessment of the high quota (80%) of EU biodiesel represented by this vegetable oil.

In the case of medical practice, numerous studies have found that geographic location exerts an inordinate influence on the choice of treatments and procedures. This paper shows how the presence of social influence on treatment decisions can help explain this phenomenon. We construct a theoretical model in which physicians treatment choices depend on patients' characteristics and on the recent choices of nearby peers either because there are local knowledge spillovers or because physicians want to conform to local practice patterns. In this setting, regional differences in the patient mix give rise to geographically divergent treatment patterns the treatment a patient receives depends on where she lives. Investigation of Florida data reveals significant geographic variation in treatment rates consistent with the predictions of our model. Implications for patient welfare are explored.

A common factor representation of relative price is used to understand the nature of the dynamic behavior of relative prices. This paper finds overwhelming evidence of convergence in relative prices with Atlanta, Chicago, and Los Angeles as the numeraire city. Further, with Boston, Cincinnati, Houston, San Francisco, Seattle, and St. Louis, the lack of convergence in relative prices is found to be driven by the nonstationarity of the common factor. In contrast, with New York, Philadelphia, and Portland, while the common factor is stationary, the idiosyncratic components are unit root processes. This paper further investigates the implications of the choice of numeraire city by estimating the half-life with different numeraire cities, after correcting for the small-sample and the time aggregation bias. These half-life estimates are smaller than those reported in previous studies and they vary depending on the choice of numeraire city. The relative price volatility seems to hold some promise for explaining why the choice Of numeraire city matters for the unit root results or the half-life estimates. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

(2) While a council of supervisors and regulators can play a useful role in dealing with macro prudential risks, it should not replace the central role of the Federal Reserve. (3) The virtually unlimited lending powers that the Fed has recently exercised in creating credit and helping individual institutions should he restricted in duration and subjected to formal Treasury approval backed by Congressional preauthorization of funds. (4) The Fed's capital rules for commercial banks need to he strengthened by replacing the existing risk-based capital approach with a broader definition of risk and the introduction of contingent capital.

Although preliminary, our findings suggest that earnings fluctuations do differ in magnitude across those groups, and that, moreover, their magnitudes vary in positive association with group-specific global and local slopes of the relevant experience-earnings profiles. Assuming that (1) differences in the observed magnitudes of earnings fluctuations are at least partly due to differences in the flexibility/rigidity of the market rates of earnings, and that (2) the flexibility/rigidity of those rates is a determinant of unemployment, it seems reasonable to expect that long-discovered systemic differences in unemployment across groups of employees with different degrees of schooling and experience (and, perhaps, across countries as well) might also be related in part to differences in experience-earnings profiles.","[Gabor, I.

However, it was the heavy securitization of the U.S. subprime mortgage market from 2003 to 2006 that spawned the toxic assets that triggered the disruptive collapse of the global bubble in 2007-08. Private counterparty risk management and official regulation failed to set levels of capital and liquidity that would have thwarted financial contagion and assuaged the impact of the crisis. This woeful record has energized regulatory reform but also suggests that regulations that require a forecast are likely to fail. Instead, the primary imperative has to be increased regulatory capital, liquidity, and collateral requirements for banks and shadow banks alike. Policies that presume that some institutions are too big to fail cannot be allowed to stand.

Our main economic result is that optimal contracts for bad searchers tend to be upward-sloping due to an adverse selection effect.

The data reveal that the relationships among East Asian stock markets are time varying. While stock market interactions are limited before the Asian financial crisis, we find that Hong Kong and Singapore respond significantly to shocks in most other East Asian markets, including Shanghai and Shenzhen, during this crisis. After the crisis, shocks in Hong Kong and Singapore largely affect other East Asian stock markets, except for those in Mainland China. Finally, considering the role of the USA shows that it strongly influences stock returns in East Asia - except for Mainland China - in all periods, while the reverse does not hold true.

Using a range of panel estimators which deals with the non-stationarity of time series components, individual heterogeneity and common unobserved factors. we show that the savings and investment (both expressed as ratios to GDP) are positively correlated for a sample of 28 Chinese provinces over the period of 1978 to 2006. According to the Feldstein-Horioka's argument (1980, Economic journal (90), pp.314-329), such a correlation can be interpreted as evidence of low capital mobility. In addition, by means of Granger causality test, we fail to provide consistent evidence to support the hypothesis of efficient capital allocation in China. Combining the results given above, it is believed that the capital may be inefficiently retained within the provincial confines. We conjecture that the intermarriage between financial power and local authorities is primarily responsible for this worrying phenomenon. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The game theory literature has only recently considered this distinction, and the conditions that stimulate the latter kind of meaningful learning in games are still unclear. Three experiments demonstrate that one kind of meaningful learning - acquisition of iterated dominance - Occurs in the absence of any feedback. We demonstrate that such feedback-free meaningful learning transfers to new strategically similar games, and that such transfer does not typically occur when initial games are played with feedback. The effects of withholding feedback are similar to, and Substitutable with, those produced by requiring players to explain their behavior, a method commonly employed in psychology to increase deliberation. This similarity suggests that withholding feedback encourages deeper thinking about the game in a manner similar to such self-explanation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The optimal single-equation and the maximum-likelihood system estimates of the model consistently support the predictions of the neoclassical exogenous and the post-neoclassical endogenous models of economic growth, and suggest the significant long-run effects of saving on income. The innovation accounting shows the bidirectional causality between saving and growth. The stylized evidence for the steady-state effects of saving on income suggests the need to accelerate domestic saving to finance capital accumulation and foster higher income and growth. Most of the saving comes from the surplus household sector, and the deficit private corporate and public sectors draw on household saving to meet their investment requirements and finance the resource gaps. A two-pronged approach with the incentive-based measures to induce the motivation to save and the productivity-based measures to increase income and strengthen the capacity to save, would be useful to generate higher saving and reinforce the acceleration of income and growth.

This paper develops a simple model to analyze this phenomenon. Our analysis focuses on an external demand decline-caused industry collapse. The model reveals that the combination of large-scale decline in external demand with a horizontal domestic supply curve causes the domestic export industry to undergo a sharp decrease in output in a short period of time, which further leads to a sharp decline in employment. The conventional stabilization policy is less effective in coping with this sudden industry collapse. The Chinese Government needs to formulate an appropriate structural industry stabilization policy to cope with the sudden industry collapse, and, in particular, to implement a direct employment aid program to deal with unemployment resulting from the industry collapse.","Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics,"Lai, PY (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",pi_lai@hotmail.com,,,,,,,18,6,6,0,10,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,FEB,2010,18.0,1,,,,,47,62,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2010.01180.x,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,545HK,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273722900003,0

Our historical analysis shows that China is still well short of the point in its developmental process where its growth might be reasonably expected to slow, or the energy, resource and carbon intensity of growth to recede. The study argues that the current trajectory of industrialization will have to be altered when China becomes more actively engaged in dealing with structural issues at home and abroad against the background of the unwinding of global imbalances. One profitable strategy that China might employ would be to approximate the incredibly fruitful mass-market integration efforts of the USA that eventually elevated it to its position of global primacy. The cyclical re-emergence of excess capacity in Chinese heavy industry, serious questions about the medium term ability of other major regions to accommodate further large gains in Chinese market share, and the stark conflict between the contemporary style of industrial development and the health of the biosphere indicate strongly that now is the time to catalyze the required adjustment and reform processes that will underpin sustainable long-run prosperity.","[McKay, Huw] Westpac Bank, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Song, Ligang] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Mckay, H (通讯作者)，Westpac Bank, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",hmckay@westpac.com.au; ligang.song@anu.edu.au,,"Song, Ligang/0000-0002-5700-2352",,,,,67,36,36,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,FEB,2010,18.0,1,,,,,1,32,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2010.01178.x,0.0,,,32,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,545HK,,Green Published,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273722900001,0

It employs annual data covering the period of 1977-2006. The ARDL cointegration test yields evidence of a long-run relationship between electricity consumption per capita and real GDP per capita.

Although the quality of the underlying data limits the precision of the estimates, the present paper aims at analysing the fundamental factors behind these evolutions. The analysis presented here assesses whether the observed price dynamics may be attributed to a pure expectation bubble phenomenon or to the large changes in financial and demographic factors. This is done by means of a structural model of the demand and supply sides of the housing market with an error-correction process. When taking into account a standard set of macroeconomic variables, our estimates imply that residential property prices in France and Spain were approximately 20% above the level explained by their fundamentals by the end of 2008. When demographic and financial factors such as the borrowing capacity are taken on board, the degree of overvaluation is drastically reduced. The adjustment path to equilibrium is slightly faster in France than in Spain, but both countries display significant downward rigidity in prices.","[Antipa, Pamfili; Lecat, Remy] Banque France, Direct Gen Etud & Relat Int, F-75049 Paris 01, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France,,pamfili.antipa@banque-france.fr; remy.lecat@banque-france.fr,"Lecat, Rémy/AAG-9907-2020","Antipa, Pamfili/0000-0002-8570-2217",,,,,34,7,7,0,7,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-642-15339-6,,,,2010,,,,,,,161,186,,10.1007/978-3-642-15340-2_8,0.0,,,26,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYS93,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300025200008,0

This article focuses on the demand side of this relationship, with emphasis on the newly established Australian PSWPS. The article raises questions concerning how, after an overview of New Zealand's Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) scheme and the Australian PSWPS, the advent of seasonal emigration from the Pacific will affect, and be affected by, existing employment and labour relations in the Australian horticultural sector. In this context, it examines information about undocumented workers in the Australian horticultural labour market and the degree they are impacting on the success of the pilot scheme.

After investments are made, firms may have to lay off workers, and will do so in inverse order of the profit that each worker generates. Greater skill investments, especially in specific human capital, contribute more to a firm's bottom line, so that workers who make those investments will be laid off last. We show that as long as workers' bargaining positions are not too weak, workers invest in specific human capital in order to reduce layoff probabilities. Indeed, workers over-invest in skill acquisition from a social perspective whenever their bargaining power is strong enough, even though they only receive a share of any investment. More generally, we characterize how equilibrium skill investments are affected by the distribution of worker abilities within firms, the probability that a firm will downsize, and the distribution of employment opportunities in the economy.","[Bernhardt, Dan] Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Mongrain, Steeve] Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Simon Fraser University,"Bernhardt, D (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",danber@illinois.edu; mongrain@sfu.ca,,,,,,,33,2,5,0,10,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0347-0520,,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

(1994), is widely used as a tool to signal whether pressure on a currency is softened or warded off through monetary authorities' interventions or, rather, a currency crisis has originated. In this article we show how the index is sensitive to some assumptions behind the aggregation of the information available (exchange rates, interest rates and reserves), especially when emerging countries are involved. Specifically, we address the way exchange rate variations are computed and the impact of different definitions of the reserves, and we question the constancy of the weights adopted. These issues compound with the choice of a fixed threshold when crisis episodes are identified through the EMP index. As a result, one should exert caution in subsequent econometric analyses where a dependent binary variable is built to identify crisis periods.","[Gallo, Giampiero M.] Univ Florence, Dipartimento Stat Giuseppe Parenti, I-50134 Florence, Italy; [Bertoli, Simone; Ricchiuti, Giorgio] Univ Florence, Dipartimento Sci Econ, I-50127 Florence, Italy",University of Florence; University of Florence,"Gallo, GM (通讯作者)，Univ Florence, Dipartimento Stat Giuseppe Parenti, Viale GB Morgagni 59, I-50134 Florence, Italy.",gallog@ds.unifi.it,"Gallo, Giampiero/AAV-6118-2021; Gallo, Giampiero/X-6025-2019; Ricchiuti, Giorgio/AHE-1031-2022","Gallo, Giampiero/0000-0003-3556-0238; Ricchiuti, Giorgio/0000-0003-1309-3165; Bertoli, Simone/0000-0002-6512-0834",,,,,25,11,12,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using data on the equity trades of the world's second largest pension fund in the first quarter of 2002, we show that trade timing, momentum, volatility and the type of broker intermediation are the major determinants of the risk of incurring high trading costs. Such risk is increased substantially by either high or low momentum and by strong volatility. Moreover, agency trades are substantially more risky in terms of trading costs than similar principal trades.

A. Hayek's contribution to economic science is broadly remembered as relating to the use of knowledge in society'' but his contribution to economics of knowledge are often summarized differently. We emphasize the contextual nature of the knowledge. Hayek says the market economy is capable of eliciting and utilizing in the process of coordinating economic activities. There is, however, a double meaning of context that we explore. Hayek developed his argument about the use of knowledge in the context of the socialist calculation debate, and the aspect of knowledge he came to focus on was the contextual nature of knowledge in human action in markets, politics, law, and society. This paper traces out the development of Hayek's focus on the epistemic foundations of the complex coordination in an advanced market economy and shows that his critique of classical and market socialism led to a refined, subtle approach to understanding spontaneous order. Furthermore, it is precisely Hayek's focus on the role of institutions in creating the conditions for the utilization and transference of knowledge through the price system that continues to shape the progressive research programs in economic science and public policy analysis that is his legacy.","[Boettke, Peter J.; Snow, Nicholas A.] George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,,,,,,,,,31,2,5,0,2,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-0-85724-261-7,ADV AUSTRIAN ECON,,,2010,14.0,,,,,,69,86,,10.1108/S1529-2134(2010)0000014007,0.0,,,18,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYS77,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300005000005,0

Within SACSIM an integrated activity-based disaggregate econometric model (DaySim) simulates each resident's full-day activity and travel schedule. Sensitivity to neighborhood scale is enhanced through disaggregation of the modeled outcomes in three key dimensions: purpose, time, and space. Each activity episode is associated with one of seven specific purposes, and with a particular parcel location at which it occurs. The beginning and ending times of all activity and travel episodes are identified within a specific 30-minute time period. Within SACSIM, DaySim equilibrates iteratively with traditional traffic assignment models. SACSIM was calibrated and tested for a base year of 2000 and for forecasts to the years 2005 and 2035, and was subjected to a formal peer-review. It was used to provide forecasts for the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) and continues to be used for various policy analyses. The paper explains the model system structure and components, the integration with the traffic assignment model, calibration and validation, sensitivity tests, model application and Federal peer review results. We conclude that it is possible to create and apply a regional demand model system using parcel-level geography and half-hour time of day periods. Experiences thus far have pointed to major benefits of using detailed land use variables and urban design variables, but also to new challenges in providing parcel-level land use inputs for future years.","[Griesenbeck, Bruce] Sacramento Area Council Govt, Sacramento, CA 95814 USA",,"Bradley, M (通讯作者)，524 Arroyo Ave, Santa Barbara, CA 93109 USA.",mark_bradley@cox.net; John_L_Bowman@alum.mit.edu; bgriesenbeck@sacog.org,,,,,,,20,81,101,0,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

We explore whether there are latent common factors that impact on the military expenditures of 15 countries in the MENA region and whether these factors can be interpreted. Unobserved common factors induce cross-sectional dependence and may lead to traditional panel-time series estimators being inconsistent. To identify these latent factors we apply principal component analysis. We evaluate the interpretation of the estimated factors using the multiple-indicator multiple-cause model. We find that there is a substantial evidence of cross-sectional dependence in the MENA region, induced mainly by two unobserved factors, but these factors are difficult to interpret.","[Cavatorta, Elisa] Univ London, Birkbeck Coll, Sch Econ Math & Stat, London WC1E, England; [Cavatorta, Elisa] Univ Verona, Dept Econ, I-37129 Verona, Italy",University of London; University of Verona,"Cavatorta, E (通讯作者)，Univ London, Birkbeck Coll, Sch Econ Math & Stat, Malet St, London WC1E, England.",ecavatorta@ems.bbk.ac.uk,,,,,,,29,3,3,1,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

The empirical result shows that the credit rating is proven to influence the efficiency of banks; (3) The efficiency scores improve in both investment grade (above tw BBB-) and speculation grade (under tw BBB-), when credit rating is taken into consideration.

The results are analyzed against realities on ground-level from a socio-economic perspective.","[Dimitriu, Maria Caracota] Acad Econ Studies, Fac Business Adm, Bucharest, Romania; [Savu, Blessy Mathew] Acad Econ Studies Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dimitriu, MC (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Fac Business Adm, Bucharest, Romania.",maria.dimitriu@inde.ro; blessysavu@gmail.com,,,,,,,12,2,3,0,7,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Inequality in disposable income and earnings net of taxes and transfers also increased, but much less than the increased inequality in pre-government earnings. These different developments are most likely explained by the generous Swedish welfare system. Consistent with these observations, we see no clear trend in consumption inequality. We also estimate stochastic processes for household earnings. A simple random-walk process captures much of the life-cycle dynamics. But we find clear evidence that the true earnings process is not a random walk. We demonstrate that some estimation methods result in severe upward bias in the estimated volatility of permanent shocks if serial correlation in temporary shocks is ignored. Our estimation results show that the increase in earnings inequality is almost entirely driven by an increase in residual earnings inequality. Moreover, this increase was mostly generated by an increased volatility of persistent shocks. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

As trust that is based on the self-commitment of the partners to behave in a non-opportunistic way (maxim-based trust) takes time to evolve and relies upon the cooperation experience of the partners, we expect that the positive performance impact of maxim-based trust grows over time. The purpose of this paper is to test the moderating effect of cooperation experience on the relationship between maxim-based trust and performance in the context of cooperating small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in two transformation economies (Czech Republic and Slovenia): Based on a sample of 1 24 SMEs, a moderated regression analysis reveals that trust and cooperation experience impact positively on performance. However, we could not detect a moderated relationship. We conclude that maxim-based trust may be an effective and efficent coordinating mechanism in the dynamic context of cooperating SMEs in transformation economies, but the absence of a moderating effect indicates that firms do not seem to increase the effects of maxim-based trust over time.","[Fink, Matthias] Austrian Acad Sci, APART, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Harms, Rainer] Univ Twente, Enschede, Netherlands; [Kessler, Alexander] FH Wien Univ Appl Sci WKW, Vienna, Austria",Austrian Academy of Sciences; University of Twente,"Fink, M (通讯作者)，Austrian Acad Sci, APART, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",matthias.fink@wu.ac.at; r.harms@utwente.nl; alexander.kessler@fh-wien.ac.at,"Harms, Rainer/Q-2189-2019",,,,,,56,1,2,0,19,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,2340-4264,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

Due to the long period studied, from 1986 to 2002, and the widely fluctuating business cycle during this period, we have a unique opportunity to analyze the cyclical pattern of job and worker flows. We especially look at the big downturn in the Swedish economy in the beginning of the 1990s. When workers are treated as homogenous, we find job reallocation to be countercyclical. However, when we estimate correlations for different educational groups, we find job reallocation to be countercyclical for the lowest educated, and acyclical for higher educated workers. Contrary to job flows, we find worker flows to be acyclical, with a strong procyclical pattern in hiring rates, and an acyclical pattern in separation rates. When decomposing worker flows into educational groups, the acyclical pattern is prevalent for all groups, except for the highest educated. For the highest educated, worker reallocation is strongly procyclical due to both more hirings and separations during up-turns. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

First, previous studies in credit rating analysis are reviewed. The disadvantage of the models used in these studies consists in the fact that it is difficult to extract understandable knowledge from them. This problem appears to be crucial also because the use of natural language is typical for the credit rating process. It can be solved by using fuzzy logic, enabling its user to model the meaning of natural language words. Therefore, the model based on the use of fuzzy logic is designed to classify US companies and municipalities into the credit rating classes obtained from notable rating agencies. The model includes data preprocessing, the selection process of input variables, and the design of various adaptive fuzzy rule-based systems for classification. The selection of input variables is realized using genetic algorithms. The objective of this process is to select only significant variables in order to improve the performance of adaptive fuzzy rule-based systems. Input variables are extracted from financial statements and capital markets in line with previous studies. These variables represent the inputs of adaptive fuzzy rule-based systems, while the credit rating classes stand for the outputs. The results show that the credit rating classes assigned to bond issuers can be classified with a high accuracy rate using a limited subset of input variables. Moreover, the use of fuzzy logic makes it possible to interpret the model properly. Thus, credit rating process can be replicated in an understandable way.","[Hajek, Petr] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Syst Engn & Informat, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,,petr.hajek@upce.cz,"Hajek, Petr/JYQ-5812-2024","Hajek, Petr/0000-0001-5579-1215",,,,,19,0,0,0,4,"UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,CESKE BUDEJOVICE, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZ-370 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-218-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,177,182,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS47,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287979900031,0

Our pairwise-difference approach exploits two common features of these models: (1) the monotonicity of the agent's decision (policy) function in the shocks, conditional on the observed state variables; and (2) the state-contingent nature of optimal decision making which implies that, conditional on the observed state variables, the variation in observed choices across agents must be due to randomness in the shocks across agents.

The military, as the first and only line of defense, has always had a great role in the expenditures of countries. Military expenditures changed through history, as has the very understanding of the armed forces which represented the military might of a country. Through the evolution of society many other priorities have emerged concerning state expenditures, but because of their focus on population defense, upholding peace and protecting the country borders as the first and primary forms of public goods, have the military expenditures kept their steadfastness through the entire human history. The globalized world we live in today has changed all this, especially when speaking about insuring the safety of our country against foreign and domestic threats. The development of technology and the globalization itself have drastically changed the concept of waging war and as a result influenced the very structure and level of military expenditures. The level of technology is one of the best indicators of a countries development, but also of the power of its military force. Naturally, military might is very hard to sustain without equally adequate economical power since a developed economy and a strong industry is exactly what enables the development of defense potentials of a country and it's financing.(1)",,,,,,,,,,,19,4,5,0,20,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIVERSITY PULA,PULA,"PRERADOVICEVA 1-1, PULA, 52 100, CROATIA",1331-677X,,,EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The model determines the relation between the financial markets and real goods markets in the world economy and their responses to various shocks under the home bias assumption. A positive domestic supply shock induces a positive return on the domestic asset markets and a deterioration of terms of trade that improves the foreign output and boosts the foreign asset markets. Demand shocks act in the opposite way. This model also analyses the impact of change in the relative price of nontradable to tradable goods on the terms of trade and asset markets. A higher productivity growth in tradable goods than in nontradable goods leads to a higher relative price of nontradable to tradable goods, which appreciates the real exchange rate, deteriorates the terms of trade, and depresses the domestic and foreign asset markets. A lower relative price of nontradable goods depreciates the real exchange rate, improves the terms of trade. and lifts both the domestic and foreign asset markets. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Thereafter, by means of a multiregional-multisectoral input-output model, the increase on the total employment levels by sector and by region has been estimated. Based on a tourism demand elasticity of -1.06 and a supply elasticity of 2.0, tourist nights would increase by a maximum of 3.15% and total tourism consumption by 4.4%, while gross fixed investments by the sector would increase by 2.17%. As for the budget constraint, we have calculated the final 'cost' of the fiscal measure for the Treasury. Concerning the macroeconomic effects in terms of employment, the fiscal measure would produce a total increase of almost 100,000 jobs (expressed in fulltime equivalents).","[Manente, Mara] Univ Venice, CISET Int Ctr Studies Tourism Econ, I-30123 Venice, Italy; [Zanette, Michele] PROGREST SRL, Treviso, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Manente, M (通讯作者)，Univ Venice, CISET Int Ctr Studies Tourism Econ, I-30123 Venice, Italy.",ciset@unive.it,"Manente, Mara/JDD-1233-2023",,,,,,20,14,14,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0953-5314,,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

For many senior managers and members of board of directors, 'real options' is nothing more than a theoretical-academic construct that is hard to apply in practice. Decision analysis, the multiperiod binomial model and the Black-Scholes and Margrabe formulae are well known but sometimes poorly applied and distrusted. Taking strategic investment opportunities as real options is widely accepted as the right approach, but the mathematical models to evaluate those options are often not understood. For that reason we believe that there still is a need to better communicate the true meaning of real options and of options thinking to senior management and board of directors. The setup of a gradually developing line of communication with the board is illustrated by means of simplified but real applications of the concepts.","[Mercken, Roger; Houben, Ghislain; Motmans, Lisette] Hasselt Univ, Fac Business Econ, Hasselt, Belgium; [Leoni, Peter] Electrabel NV, Quantitat Anal Trading & Portfolio Management, Brussels, Belgium",Hasselt University; GDF Suez,"Mercken, R (通讯作者)，Hasselt Univ, Fac Business Econ, Hasselt, Belgium.",,,,,,,,37,1,1,1,18,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

The results derived from a sample of 996 train travellers indicate that context variables, which were varied in the experiment (travel purpose, time of day, weather, travel party, amount of luggage, distance and route knowledge), all have significant effects on egress mode choice. Moreover, the estimated coefficients were all in anticipated directions, lending face validity to the results.

Results indicate that nonexporters have smaller margins than persistent exporters and firms that entered foreign markets during the nineties. However, larger export ratio is negatively associated with margins for persistent exporters. It suggests that efficiency advantages for exporters are partially compensated by higher competitive pressure in international markets.

The length of the series makes the application of a heterogeneous estimator suitable from an econometric point of view. The results, based on the hierarchical Bayes estimator, show that different EKC dynamics are associated with the different sub-samples of countries considered. On average, more industrialized countries show evidence of EKC in quadratic specifications, which nevertheless are probably evolving into an N-shape based on their cubic specification. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the EU, and not the Umbrella Group led by US, has been driving currently observed EKC-like shapes. The latter is associated to monotonic income-CO2 dynamics. The EU shows a clear EKC shape. Evidence for less-developed countries consistently shows that CO2 emissions rise positively with income, though there are some signs of an EKC. Analyses of future performance, nevertheless, favour quadratic specifications, thus supporting EKC evidence for wealthier countries and non-EKC shapes for industrializing regions.","[Mazzanti, Massimiliano] Univ Ferrara, Dept Econ Inst & Terr, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy; [Musolesi, Antonio] INRA CESAER UMRI041 Dijon, Dijon, France; [Mazzanti, Massimiliano; Zoboli, Roberto] CERIS CNR Milan, Milan, Italy; [Zoboli, Roberto] DISEIS Catholic Univ Milan, I-20100 Milan, Italy",University of Ferrara; INRAE; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Mazzanti, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ferrara, Dept Econ Inst & Terr, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy.",ma.maz@iol.it,"Zoboli, Roberto/F-5974-2015","Zoboli, Roberto/0000-0003-4662-5949; mazzanti, massimiliano/0000-0002-6538-7942",,,,,49,72,75,2,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The product-level analyses reveal that, compared to machinery finished products, machinery parts & components are traded through longer-lived and more stable relationships among East Asian countries. Once transactions are started, trade relationships of machinery parts & components are more likely to be maintained between countries even at a long distance, regardless of the exchange-rate fluctuations. The probability of discontinuing trade relationships of machinery finished products, on the other hand, are more likely to be sensitive to the level of trading cost as well as the exchange-rate fluctuations.

So far, however, scientific discussion lacks a common understanding of the architecture of hybrid media concepts as well as empirical evidence on the application of hybrid media in practice. Hence, it is unclear to what extent the performance potential of hybrid media concepts is utilized in different application fields and what the drivers of the use and performance of hybrid media concepts are.

This. in turn, will reduce the need for end of pipe (EOP) pollution control technologies to meet future air quality targets. This dynamic could put more stringent air quality goals within reach, and increase the political feasibility of climate policy. This paper presents a CGE model that has been modified to include the emissions and EDP abatement of PM, SO(2), and NO(x) from stationary sources in the EU-17. Emissions of pollutants are modeled as fixed-factor complementary inputs to their associated source. Abatement in each sector is modeled as a substitution between the pollutants and discrete abatement technologies, each of which is sector-specific and characterized by a marginal abatement cost and technical capacity constraint. Scenarios are run to 2020, to assess the costs and co-benefits of simultaneous air quality and climate policies. We find that under the Kyoto Protocol in 2010, the welfare cost of pollution control is reduced by 16% compared to the baseline, effectively offsetting the Cost Of CO(2) abatement by 15%. The co-benefit results depend heavily on policy choices, and their magnitude relative to total costs is likely to decline as greenhouse targets become more ambitious. In our scenarios. pollution control cost savings range from 1.3 to 20% in 2020, yielding a climate cost offset range of 0.2 to 3.9%. The CO(2) credit imports allowed by the EU via the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) offer a total savings of $9.7bn in 2020, but only need to be compensated by an additional $0.3-0.4bn in domestic pollution control from stationary sources.

To answer this question, we compare the endogenous growth paths of two economies that differ only in their political regimes in the context of an overlapping generations model. The key features of the model are: (i) a positive bequest motive in the form of investments in education or productive public capital (infrastructure); (ii) a higher marginal (inter-temporal) utility of consumption today versus consumption tomorrow in low-income countries (for example, subsistence level of consumption); and (iii) a dictator that cares about her income or the income of her dynasty tomorrow. In this framework, we demonstrate that poor but large and stable dictatorships exhibit a higher equilibrium growth rate than comparable (equally poor) democracies. Moreover, there exists a particular threshold value in income such that the growth-reducing impact of dictatorial consumption (corruption) outweighs the higher (initial) public investments. Above this, the growth rate under democracy dominates the one in dictatorship.","[Schiffbauer, Marc] Univ Bonn, Dept Econ, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Shen, Ling] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",University of Bonn; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Schiffbauer, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Dept Econ, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",marc.schiffbauer@uni-bonn.de; ling.shen@mail.shufe.edu.cn,,,,,,,24,2,2,2,29,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0967-0750,,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

Also during the 1940s, the wage distribution compressed sharply and the returns to education fell. This paper uses wage changes between occupations to link wartime labor market shocks to the decline in the return to education and the decline in wage inequality. Wartime production favoring semi-skilled labor and the occupation-biased nature of the draft combined to compress both the lower and upper tails of the male wage distribution and the upper portion of the female wage distribution.","Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Richmond, VA 23284 USA",Virginia Commonwealth University,"Scotese, CA (通讯作者)，Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",cslehr@vcu.edu,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,7,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

This study covered the monthly dataset from 1971:M1 to 2008:M11. The Johansen cointegration test suggests that the variables under investigation are co-move in the long run. Furthermore, the MWALD causality test shows a bidirectional causal relationship between money supply (M2) and aggregate prices, meaning that both the monetarist's and also the structuralists' views are vindicated in the Malaysian economy. However, the time-varying cointegration and causality tests indicate that the cointegrating and also the causal relationships are not stable over the analysis period. These results suggest that inflation in Malaysia is not purely a monetary phenomenon. Therefore, implementing a tighter monetary policy may not be an effective macro-economic instrument in managing the inflationary behaviour in the Malaysian economy.","Univ Malaya, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Tang, CF (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",tcfoon@yahoo.com,"Tang, Chor Foon/F-9289-2011","Tang, Chor Foon/0000-0003-2242-9222",,,,,67,15,15,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

The empirical strategy employed exploits the nature of the dependent variable, which is interval coded, and uses interval regression which provides an asymptotically efficient estimator provided that the classical linear model assumptions hold. These assumptions are investigated using standard diagnostic tests that have been modified for the interval regression model. Evidence is presented that shows that the firms in all regions engage in under-reporting. Regression results indicate that government corruption has the single largest causal effect on under-reporting, resulting in the percentage of sales not reported to the tax authority being 51.3% higher. Taxes have the second single largest causal effect on under-reporting, resulting in the percentage of sales not reported to the tax authority being 18.0% higher, followed by access to financing at 8.9% higher and organized crime at 7.6% higher. Inflation, political instability, exchange rates and the fairness of the legal system were found to have no effect on under-reporting. It is also found that there is a significant correlation between under-reporting and the legal organization of the business, size, age, ownership, competition and audit controls.","Univ Victoria, Sch Publ Adm, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada",University of Victoria,"Tedds, LM (通讯作者)，Univ Victoria, Sch Publ Adm, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada.",ltedds@uvic.ca,,,,,,,52,26,29,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Since the late 1990s, a strong wave of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) and market consolidation process have been induced by changing external environment. The aim of this paper is to find out whether M&A transactions in the European banking sector can be justified by creating value for involved banks' shareholders. For this purpose we conduct an event study examining value implications of 59 M&A transactions of listed European banks carried out between 1998 and 2007. Our findings suggest large value creation for the targets' shareholders. On contrary, significant value destruction is found for shareholders of the bidding banks. The net wealth effect for combined entities of targets and bidders is still significantly positive; therefore, we conclude that banking M&As have been successful in the observed period. Moreover, we present results for several sub-samples analysing differences in terms of value creation between domestic and cross-border deals, cash and equity-financed deals and transactions of different sizes.","[Teply, Petr; Starova, Hana] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic; [Cernohorsky, Jan] Univ Pardubice, Inst Econ, Fac Economisc & Adm, Pardubice 53210 2, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; University of Pardubice,"Teply, P (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Opletalova 26, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic.",teply@fsv.cuni.ez; hana.starova@gmail.com; jan.cernohorsky@upce.cz,"Teply, Petr/E-9785-2018; Cernohorsky, Jan/HGU-5477-2022","Cernohorsky, Jan/0000-0003-2662-2353",,,,,13,11,12,0,25,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

The wages paid during this period are an important element of firing costs and hence employment protection. To find a causal effect, I exploit the exogenous change in the term of notice that resulted from the introduction of a new Dutch law in 1999. Strong evidence is found that a longer 'dormant' term of notice leads to higher wages. in my sample, an additional month of notice increases wages by three percent, ceteris paribus.

The expanding engagement at the intersection of feminist scholarship and science and technology studies (STS) has enriched both fields immeasurably, and I will largely focus my reflections on the literature associated with these sites. I begin by highlighting the continuities as well as the differences between contemporary and earlier feminist debates on technology. Current approaches focus on the mutual shaping of gender and technology, in which technology is conceptualised as both a source and consequence of gender relations. In avoiding both technological determinism and gender essentialism, such theories emphasise that the gender-technology relationship is fluid and situated. These deliberations highlight how processes of technical change can influence gender power relations. A feminist politics of technology is thus key to achieving gender equality.","Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Sociol, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Wajcman, J (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Sociol, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",j.wajcman@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,58,362,476,1,53,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Drawing on a large dataset that includes most of the world's leading microfinance institutions, we explore eight questions about the microfinance industry: Who are the lenders? How widespread is profitability? Are loans in fact repaid at the high rates advertised? Who are the customers? Why are interest rates so high? Are profits high enough to attract profit-maximizing investors? How important are subsidies? The evidence suggests that investors seeking pure profits would have little interest in most of the institutions we see that are now serving poorer customers. We will suggest that the future of microfinance is unlikely to follow a single path. The recent clash between supporters of profit-driven Banco Compartamos and of the Grameen Bank with its social business model offers us a false choice. Commercial investment is necessary to fund the continued expansion of microfinance, but institutions with strong social missions, many taking advantage of subsidies, remain best placed to reach and serve the poorest customers, and some are doing so at a massive scale. The market is a powerful force, but it cannot fill all gaps.","[Cull, Robert; Demirguec-Kunt, Asli] World Bank, Dev Econ Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Morduch, Jonathan] NYU, Robert F Wagner Grad Sch Publ Serv, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Morduch, Jonathan] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Morduch, Jonathan] Financial Access Initiat, New York, NY USA",The World Bank; New York University; New York University,"Cull, R (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Econ Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",rcull@worldbank.org; Ademirguckunt@worldbank.org; jonathan.morduch@nyu.edu,,,,,,,34,323,366,3,85,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Most second generation currency crisis models are static models with multiple equilibria, and exogenous shifts between equilibria are interpreted as shifts of sentiments on financial markets leading to crises. This article develops a dynamic, continuous time model with a payoff structure similar to second generation models. We derive endogenous conditions under which shifts in sentiment occur over time, characterise them in terms the strategic risk associated with speculation, and provide comparative statics. Moreover, we show that the findings correspond almost exactly to the implications of global game currency crisis models, which are often used for equilibrium selection in the static context.","Tech Univ Berlin, Fachgebiet Makrookon, Inst Volkswirtschaftslehre & Wirtschaftsrecht, D-10623 Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin,"Daniëls, TR (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Berlin, Fachgebiet Makrookon, Inst Volkswirtschaftslehre & Wirtschaftsrecht, Sekr H52,Str 17 Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany.",tijmen.daniels@tu-berlin.de,,,,,,,26,3,3,1,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,DEC,2009,157.0,4,,,,,417,439,,10.1007/s10645-009-9130-9,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,562XD,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275088200002,0

Terrorism raises the costs of crime through two channels: (i) by increasing the presence and activity of the police force, and (ii) causing more people to stay at home rather than going out for leisure activities. Our analysis exploits a panel of 120 fatal terror attacks and all reported crimes for 17 districts throughout Israel between 2000 and 2005. After controlling for the fixed-effect of each district and for district-specific time trends, we show that terror attacks reduce property crimes such as burglary, auto-theft, and thefts-from-cars. Terror also reduces assaults and aggravated assaults which occur in private homes, but increases incidents of trespassing and disrupting the police. Taken as a whole, the results are consistent with a stronger deterrence effect produced by an increased police presence after a terror attack. A higher level of policing is likely to catch more people trespassing, and at the same time, reduce the number of property crimes. The decline in crimes committed in private houses is likely an indication that the tendency for individuals to stay home after a terror attack further increases the costs of crime.

J,"De Macedo, JB; Pereira, LB; Reis, AM",,,,"de Macedo, Jorge Braga; Pereira, Luis Brites; Reis, Afonso M.",,,Comparing Exchange Market Pressure across Five African Countries,OPEN ECONOMIES REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Exchange rate regime; Exchange market pressure; EGARCH-M,VARIANCE; CRISES; MODEL,"This paper compares the credibility of exchange rate arrangements for the five African countries which are members of the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries and will be referred to as Afro-Luso. Our working hypothesis is that credibility necessarily implies low mean exchange market pressure (EMP), low EMP conditional volatility and low-severity EMP crises under financial-market integration. In addition, economic fundamentals must account for EMP dynamics. We also seek evidence of a risk-return relationship for mean EMP and of bad news (negative shocks) having a greater impact on EMP volatility than good news (positive shocks). Using our econometric models, we are able to rank Afro-Luso countries' conditional volatility in ordinal terms. Our main conclusion is that countries with currency pegs, such as Guinea-Bissau (GB) and Cape Verde (CV), clearly have lower volatility when compared to those with managed floats and are therefore more credible. Moreover, EMP crises episodes under pegs are much less severe. We find that economic fundamentals correctly account for mean EMP in all countries and that the risk-return relationship is much more favourable for investors under currency pegs, as the increase in volatility is lower for the same rate of return. The exception to this finding is Mozambique (MOZ), which apparently has a risk-return profile akin to that enjoyed by countries with pegs. A plausible reason is that MOZ has the only managed float in our sample implementing monetary and exchange rate policy within the confines of an IMF framework, which establishes floors for international reserves and ceilings for the central bank's net domestic assets. This intuition needs to be tested, however. EMP conditional volatility, meanwhile, is generally driven by changes in domestic credit (lowers it) and foreign reserve changes (raises it). The first effect is more pronounced under currency pegs, but also under MOZ's managed float. Bad news increases volatility more that good news only in the case of CV's currency peg, which we take to be another sign of its credibility. A few striking cross-country comparisons also emerge in our analysis. Among countries with managed floats, Angola (ANG) has the most severe EMP crises, MOZ the least severe and So Tom, & Principe (STP) lies between the two extremes but closer to MOZ.","[de Macedo, Jorge Braga; Pereira, Luis Brites; Reis, Afonso M.] Trop Res Inst IICT, P-1300344 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa,"Pereira, LB (通讯作者)，Trop Res Inst IICT, Rua da Junqueira 86-1, P-1300344 Lisbon, Portugal.",lpereira@fe.unl.pt,"Pereira, Luis Brites/AAG-3224-2020","Pereira, Luis Brites/0000-0003-2554-9094; Macedo, Jorge/0000-0001-5168-1510",,,,,44,6,6,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Innovation performance is proxied by R&D-intensity (R&D expenditure over assets), patent-intensity (patents per US$million of assets), i.e. the R&D productivity of a firm's assets, and the patent stock, i.e. the accumulated R&D output. We find substantial overlaps between target and non-acquired firm characteristics. Nevertheless targets have a relatively high R&D-intensity and a large patent stock, which is consistent with acquirers targeting firms with a superior innovation performance. However, these targets have significantly lower pre-acquisition patent-intensity and hence a lower R&D productivity. The targets are also experiencing weak financial performance. Our results are consistent with a selection process in which acquirers seek out firms that have a superior past innovation performance, but that are failing in terms of recent R&D productivity and financial performance. A comparison of the performance of the targets with their acquirers reinforces this conclusion.","[Desyllas, Panos] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England; [Hughes, Alan] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Business Res, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Hughes, Alan] Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Manchester; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge,"Desyllas, P (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Booth St W, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England.",pdesyllas@gmail.com,,"Desyllas, Panos/0000-0003-3236-8734",,,,,79,21,22,3,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Conditions for the stability of the fundamental price in terms of agents' behavior parameters and time delay are obtained. In particular, it is found that an increase in time delay can not only destabilize the market price but also stabilize an otherwise unstable market price, leading to stability switching as delay increases. These interesting phenomena shed new light in understanding of mechanism on the market stability. When the fundamental price becomes unstable through Hopf bifurcations, sufficient conditions on the stability and global existence of the periodic solution are obtained. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, as the literature on strategic delegation suggests, one cannot generally expect that the behavior of teams is equivalent to the behavior of individuals in Cournot competition. Nevertheless, there are models of team-organizations such that team-firms and individual firms are behaviorally equivalent. This provides a theoretical foundation for the unitary player assumption in Cournot competition.

In addition, we also investigate the impact of the interest rate volatility on the interest rates of the U.S. and nine Asian countries. We find that the complete pass-through only exists in the U.S. deposit rate. The threshold cointegration test results show that the asymmetric cointegration relation exists in the deposit interest rate in five countries and in the lending rate in three countries. The symmetric cointegration relation exists in two countries. Besides, an estimation of the conditional means using the EC-EGARCH (1, 1)-M model shows that the effect of interest rate volatility on the retail interest rate differs from country to country. Among the eight countries that exhibit asymmetric adjustments in the short run, five of them are found to have upwards rigid adjustments in the deposit interest rate and three downwards rigid adjustments in the lending rate. The empirical results of Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the Philippines support the hypothesis of collusive pricing arrangements.

This may be explained by the different treatment of culture in each field. In postcolonial theory, culture serves as a central analytical category. In economics, despite increased attention in recent history, general approaches to culture continue to underestimate its role in economic behaviour and decision making. Borrowing some insights from postcolonial theory, this paper calls for further attention to culture in economics. It is argued that such a turn improves current understanding of contemporary economic phenomena, and allows subaltern cultures (currently theorised as less developed) to equally participate in the global construction of social meaning and economic well being. It is further argued that incorporating the postcolonial idea of hybridity into the institutional economic approach holds the most promise for theorising contemporary postcolonial economies. This argument is illustrated by examining some hybrid economic patterns within Africa.","Franklin & Marshall Coll, Dept Econ, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA",Franklin & Marshall College,"Zein-Elabdin, EO (通讯作者)，Franklin & Marshall Coll, Dept Econ, POB 4004, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA.",eiman.zein-elabdin@fandm.edu,,,,,,,55,21,24,1,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Douglas; Scholz, John Karl",,,THE EFFECTS OF FINANCIAL EDUCATION IN THE WORKPLACE: EVIDENCE FROM A SURVEY OF EMPLOYERS,ECONOMIC INQUIRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PARTICIPATION,"We examine the effects of education on financial decision-making skills by identifying an interesting source of variation in pertinent training. During the 1990s, an increasing number of individuals were exposed to programs of financial education provided by their employers. If, as some have argued, low saving frequently results from a failure to appreciate economic vulnerabilities, then education of this form could prove to have a powerful effect on behavior. The current article undertakes an analysis of these programs using a previously unexploited survey of employers. We find that both participation in and contributions to voluntary savings plans are significantly higher when employers offer retirement seminars.

We find that the conventional measure of resource dependence is endogenous with respect to conflict, and that instrumenting for dependence implies that it is no longer significant in conflict regressions. Instead, it appears that conflict increases dependence on resource extraction (as a default sector). Moreover, resource abundance is associated with a reduced probability of the onset of war. These results are robust to a range of specifications and, considering the conflict channel, we conclude there is no reason to regard resources as a general curse to peace and development.","[Brunnschweiler, Christa N.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CER, Zurich, Switzerland; [Brunnschweiler, Christa N.] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Bulte, Erwin H.] Wageningen Univ, Dev Econ Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Bulte, Erwin H.] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, Tilburg, Netherlands",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Oxford; Wageningen University & Research; Tilburg University,"Brunnschweiler, CN (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CER, Zurich, Switzerland.",cbrunnschweiler@ethz.ch; Erwin.bulte@wur.nl,,"Bulte, Erwin/0000-0001-9491-5268; Brunnschweiler Valente, Christa/0000-0002-8610-6433",,,,,52,160,187,4,66,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Roughly 15% of countries are tax havens: as has been widely observed. these countries tend to be small and affluent. This paper documents another robust empirical regularity: better-governed countries are much more likely than others to become tax havens. Controlling for other relevant factors, governance quality has a statistically significant and quantitatively large association with the probability of being a tax haven. For a typical country with a population under one million, the likelihood of a becoming a tax haven rises from 26% to 61% as governance quality improves from the level of Brazil to that of Portugal. Evidence from US firms suggests that low tax rates offer Much more powerful inducements to foreign investment in well-governed countries than do low tax rates elsewhere. This may explain why poorly-governed countries do not generally attempt to become tax havens, and suggests that the range of sensible tax policy options is constrained by the quality of governance.

Contrary to some scholars belief that at national level, openness does not contribute to growth in Malaysia, our sector specific analysis suggest otherwise. In this aspect, we believe that in any attempt to establish relationship between openness and growth, the analysis should be sector specific since it is more relevant as well as assures a meaningful insight for policy makers. The results suggest that in the long-run, trade openness is positively related to manufacturing growth in Malaysia. Furthermore, the results also suggest that openness should be viewed as the long term policy initiative for the sector to benefit. Therefore, the policy direction for Malaysian manufacturing sectors should focus on long term trade openness policies. Nevertheless, to ensure sustainability, emphasis should be placed on how (which Manufacturing sub-sectors) or when openness is actually important. Importantly, policy makers and scholars Should understand that leveraging the benefits of openness also depend on whether the liberalized sector has the comparative advantage.

The paper then presents cross-country, panel-data evidence on how the growth effect of openness may depend on a variety of structural characteristics. For this purpose, the empirical section uses a non-linear growth regression specification that interacts a proxy of trade openness with proxies of educational investment, financial depth, inflation stabilization, public infrastructure, governance, labor market flexibility, ease of firm entry, and ease of firm exit.

Because envy can imply ill will, discontent or dislike of the envied individual who possesses something that the envious individual desires, or aspiration to emulate the envied position, it can lead the envious individual to undertake costly efforts to reduce the gap between the envied situation and his own situation. The envious individual can seek either to damage or match the situation enjoyed by the envied individual.

This contrasts with previous studies, which assume the government can borrow using bonds that mature after one quarter. We show that, when we assume that the government issues bonds with a duration similar to the average duration of sovereign bonds in emerging economies, the model generates an interest rate that is substantially higher and more volatile than the one obtained assuming one-quarter bonds. This narrows the gap between the predictions of the model and the data, which indicates that the introduction of long-duration bonds may be a useful tool for future research about emerging economies.

In the process, there has been substantial financial engineering and balance sheets have been geared up towards exhaustion, with major implications for financing future investment. Increased gearing has, on the one hand, introduced the discipline of debt upon management which had engaged in substantive diversification, and on the other provided an arbitrage between the weighted average cost of capital used to calculate the allowed return, and the lower marginal cost of debt. The paper shows how regulation has determined the allocation of risk, and facilitated the observed changes in ownership and financial structures. Three solutions to the exhausted balance sheets are considered to finance future investment: rate-of-return regulation; the split cost of capital; and a collapse back into not-for-dividend, mutual or state ownership. The default outcome already witnessed in the Welsh Water and Network Rail cases is the latter case, which is inferior to the second option.","[Helm, Dieter] New Coll, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Helm, D (通讯作者)，New Coll, Oxford, England.",dieter@dhelm.co.uk; tom.tindall@oxera.com,,,,,,,48,22,22,6,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

J,"Rowthorn, RE",,,,"Rowthorn, R. E.",,,Returns to Scale and the Economic Impact of Migration: Some New Considerations,SPATIAL ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper builds on an earlier paper by the author. It uses a simple model to analyse the economic impact of international migration on a large city. The paper assumes that immigration causes the population of the city to grow, thereby increasing the cost of living for existing residents. In one version of the model, the government responds by increasing public-sector wages so as to help offset the higher cost of living. The private sector follows suit.

He studied what he called ancient societies, to compare them with his own times, in an effort to understand that subject. This paper aims to show, following Polanyi's work on Classical Greece, that it is possible to make a clear analogy between the Athenian state and economy with the modern Welfare State. First, we present Polanyi's Study of the early Athenian economy, focusing on the coexistence of a kind of state economic planning and a market. Second, we show how this relates to Polanyi's emphasis in the comparison of different societies and times. Third, we characterize the contemporary Welfare State to make an analogy between these two forms of economic organization. We conclude by underlining the relevance of this analogy in understanding the societies of today.","[Wjuniski, Bernardo Stuhlberger] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Fernandez, Ramon Garcia] Getulio Vargas Fdn FGV EESP, Sao Paulo Sch Econ, Sao Paulo, Brazil",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Getulio Vargas Foundation,"Wjuniski, BS (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",,"Fernandez, Ramon/ABC-1954-2021",,,,,,20,0,0,1,6,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

This condition is likely to be violated in practice for two reasons. First, some of the costs of evasion and avoidance are transfers to other agents. Second, some individuals overestimate the costs of evasion and avoidance. In such situations, excess burden depends on a weighted average of the taxable income and total earned income elasticities, with the weight determined by the resource cost of sheltering income from taxation. This generalized formula implies the efficiency cost of taxing high income individuals is not necessarily large despite evidence that their reported incomes are highly sensitive to marginal tax rates.","Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Chetty, R (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",chetty@fas.harvard.edu,,,,,,,38,159,188,1,34,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7731,,,AM ECON J-ECON POLIC,Am.

Schools seeking autonomy had only to propose and win a majority vote among current parents. Almost one in three high schools voted on autonomy between 1988 and 1997, and using a version of the regression discontinuity design, I find large achievement gains at schools in which the vote barely won compared to schools in which it barely lost. Despite other reforms that ensured that the British education system was, by international standards, highly competitive, a comparison of schools in the geographic neighborhoods of narrow vote winners and narrow vote losers suggests that these gains did not spill over.","[Clark, Damon] Univ Florida, Natl Bur Econ Res, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Clark, D (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Natl Bur Econ Res, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",,,,,,,,39,81,101,0,29,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-3808,,,J POLIT ECON,J.

Using China as an example, the present paper illustrates models commonly used to derive equilibrium real exchange rate estimates.

The basic conclusion is that, at least for China, small changes in model specifications, explanatory variable definitions, and time periods used in estimation can lead to very substantial differences in equilibrium real exchange rate estimates.

The necessary condition shows that input prices are relevant for Make-or-Buy decisions except under restrictive and often unverifiable assumptions on the demand structure, and that the least informationally-demanding way to ensure efficient Make-or-Buy decisions is to price inputs at marginal cost provided changes in the entrant's cost have a normal effect on the entrant's profit. The conditions also show that pricing the incumbent's input at the entrant's marginal cost always ensures efficient Make- or-Buy decisions.

Interestingly, when the sample is divided according to different income levels and institutional quality, there is two-way causality between financial development and economic growth only for the middle income group and for countries with stronger rule of law and creditor rights.

In this paper, we provide an empirical evaluation of the patterns of risk sharing among different groups of countries and examine how international financial integration has affected the evolution of these patterns. Using a variety of empirical techniques, we conclude that there is at best a modest degree of international risk sharing, and certainly nowhere near the levels predicted by theory. In addition, only industrial countries have attained better risk sharing outcomes during the recent period of globalization. Developing countries have, by and large, been shut out of this benefit. Even emerging market economies, many of which have reduced capital controls and all of which have witnessed large increases in cross-border capital flows, have seen little change in their ability to share risk. We find that the composition of flows may help explain why emerging markets have not been able to realize this presumed benefit of financial globalization. in particular, our results suggest that portfolio debt, which had dominated the external liability stocks of most emerging markets until recently, is not conducive to risk sharing.

Will the liberal market model retain its normative primacy once some semblance of normality is restored, or will other varieties of capitalism, with a bigger role of the state, acquire more legitimacy? The answer depends partly on one's explanation for the current crisis. This essay argues, first, that global imbalances had too important a role to ignore, in contrast to a mainstream view that focuses on mistakes in monetary policy and financial regulation. It argues, second, that in light of global dynamics, the crisis is likely to become worse by early 2010-which, on the face of it, makes significant reorganisations of capitalism more likely. The third section lays out what should be done to reconfigure capitalism at national and international levels. The final section discusses the political economy of policy reforms in terms of the difficult translation from what should be done to what can be done. The broad conclusion is that in five years from now the liberal market model will have been restored to normative primacy and 'we must have more globalization' will again be the elite rallying cry; but the crisis will have left behind sufficient doubts about factual propositions and value priorities that political parties and economists advocating alternatives will have more scope than they have had for the past three decades.","London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Wade, R (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",r.wade@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,85,89,93,2,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Using evidence from bid-level data, and supported by a simple theorising of bidder incentives under unorthodox issuance practices, this paper traces the recent volatility in yields to the emergence of a sharp segmentation of the T-bill market between sophisticated financial market players (foreign-controlled banks) and a less-experienced group of investors (domestic pension funds and small banks). An important policy recommendation that emerges is that public debt managers should avoid micro-managing Treasury bill auctions by issuing amounts in excess of those offered or by dipping into oversubscribed segments of the yield curve, as such practices seriously disadvantage the less-sophisticated (but more competitive) investors vis-a-vis the more sophisticated players.","[Abbas, S.

The paper explores this unexplored question by carrying out a cross-sector cross-country analysis of European systems of innovation in the 1990s. The empirical study takes Pavitt's (Res Policy 13:343-373, 1984) taxonomy as a starting point, and it investigates the cross-country variability of Pavitt's sectoral patterns of innovation. The analysis leads to three main results. First, the various technological trajectories show large differences across countries, due to the influence of national innovation systems. Second, there is evidence that the interaction between national systems and sectoral patterns of innovation constitutes an independent source of variability in the sample. Third, the analysis leads to the identification of eight sector- and country-specific technological trajectories in European manufacturing industries, and, based on that, proposes a refinement of Pavitt's taxonomy. The refined taxonomy, in a nutshell, suggests that sectoral systems must be supported by and interact with their respective national systems in order to become industrial leaders.","NUPI, Dept Int Econ, Norwegian Inst Int Affairs, Oslo, Norway",,"Castellacci, F (通讯作者)，NUPI, Dept Int Econ, Norwegian Inst Int Affairs, POB 8159,Dep 0033, Oslo, Norway.",fc@nupi.no,,,,,,,47,24,26,1,40,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

I show that the use of a small subsidy raises welfare in the FDI host country, with the consumption gains from attracting more multinationals exceeding the direct cost of funding the subsidy program through a tax on labor income. This welfare gain stems from a selection effect, whereby the subsidy induces only the most productive exporters to switch to servicing the host's market via FDI. I further show that for the same total subsidy bill, a subsidy to variable costs delivers a larger welfare gain than a subsidy to the fixed cost of conducting FDI, since a variable cost subsidy also raises the inefficiently low output levels stemming from each firm's markup pricing power.

This paper shows that the stark contrast between the high growth rates and declining income inequalities of HPAEs on one side, and low,growth rates and stable (or rising) income inequalities of India and other Asian countries on the other side, may at least in part be explained by the different role that human capital has played in those economies between the mid-1960s and mid 1990s.","[Fontana, Giuseppe] Univ Leeds, Dept Econ, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Fontana, Giuseppe] Univ Sannio, Benevento, Italy",University of Leeds; University of Sannio,"Fontana, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Dept Econ, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",,,,,,,,14,7,8,0,16,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Many politicians see increased ethanol use as a way to promote environmental goals, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and energy security goals. This paper provides a benefit-cost analysis of increasing ethanol use based on an analysis by the Environmental Protection Agency. We find that the cost of increasing ethanol production to almost ten billion gallons a year is likely to exceed the benefits by about three billion dollars annually. We also suggest that earlier attempts aimed at promoting ethanol would have likely failed a benefit-cost test, and that Congress should consider repealing ethanol incentive programs, such as the ethanol tariff and tax credit.","[Hahn, Robert; Cecot, Caroline] AEI, Regmarkets Ctr, Washington, DC 20036 USA",,"Hahn, R (通讯作者)，AEI, Regmarkets Ctr, 1150 17th St,NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",rhahn@aei.org; caroline.cecot@gmail.com,,,,,,,57,21,25,1,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

The government provides every child with goods that can also be purchased by parents in private markets, and the level of provision is determined by majority rule. Households with many children benefit from the public provision more than those with fewer children; thus, a political conflict arises between them. The distribution of the number of children across households, which is a crucial factor for determining which group is politically dominant, is endogenously determined by households' fertility decision. The sequential interaction between fertility and political decisions might lead to multiple equilibria: equilibrium with high fertility and low-private/public-spending ratio and equilibrium with low fertility and high-private/public-spending ratio. Our model could explain the large differences in fertility and structure of child-related spending across countries. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

To control for the effects of the business cycle, and associated monetary policy actions, on debt, deficits, and interest rates, this paper studies the relationship between long-horizon forward rates and future federal government deficits and debt as projected by the Congressional Budget Office. For the entire 30-year sample for which these projections are available, the estimated effects of government deficits and debt on interest rates are statistically significant and economically relevant: about 25 basis points per percentage point increase in the projected deficit/GDP ratio, and 3 to 4 basis points for the debt/GDP ratio. Under plausible assumptions the parameter estimates are shown to be consistent with predictions from the neoclassical growth model.

In a duopoly setting, firms invest resources into a Reinganum-type patent race. The wage is bargained for with a union. Besides the holdup and the strategic effect, which have been analysed before, we are able to identify a third effect of unionisation: through the Arrow effect. This effect increases the incentive for doing research. Solving the model numerically reveals that in sum, unionisation decreases the level of research investment. This result is independent of the bargaining institution and of the degree of product heterogeneity.

Then, we check whether the JV is more likely as well as the welfare level improves when the decision on JV profit sharing among partners is delegated to an independent JV management (Management sharing) rather than jointly taken by partners (Coordinated sharing). We find that the firm whose effort has a higher impact on the JV's profits should have a larger profit share.

There is also some evidence that the gender differences in access to financing vanish with the level of financial development, which is consistent with Becker-type discrimination.

Increased economic efficiency is seen as a powerful force for reducing the extent of poverty in developing countries in the long run. While this may be so, it ignores the depth and incidence of poverty that can be generated during adjustments to policy reforms. This possibility constrains policy choices as shown theoretically on natural resource policies and agricultural adjustment policies with Asian examples. Social, behavioral, and institutional features are also considered as they may result in the poverty lock-in of some groups. It is essential to consider dynamic processes and not to rely solely on comparative statics when assessing economic policies to reduce poverty and increase economic efficiency. It is also important to take into account the institutional constraints on policy choices.","Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Tisdell, C (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",c.tisdell@economics.uq.edu.au,"Tisdell, Clem A/A-5715-2008","Tisdell, Clem A/0000-0003-4370-4692",,,,,28,5,5,2,8,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

In this paper, we consider the particular example of ethanol and seek to quantify the incremental value from flexibility in its production from sugarcane in Brazil. We accomplish this by first jointly modeling the stochastic processes for the prices of the two relevant commodities, sugar (a food commodity) and ethanol (an energy commodity) in discrete time as a bivariate lattice. This framework allows us to value the option to switch output products based on the respective price signals of the two commodities. However, unlike the usual assumption of geometric Brownian motion stochastic processes, we use the more realistic case of mean reverting commodity price processes. We estimate the parameters for these processes by applying a regression-based procedure to empirical sugar and ethanol data collected during a period from 1998 through 2008. Our results show that the option to switch outputs has significant value, even under the assumption of mean reverting prices, which has implications for both producers and policy-makers alike.

It is a game of chance in which the probabilities for different objective outcomes (e.g. heads or tails in a coin toss) depend on the amount wagered on those outcomes. By varying the 'reality map', which relates the amount wagered to the probability of the outcome, it is possible to move continuously from a purely objective game in which probabilities have no dependence on wagers to a purely subjective game in which probabilities equal the amount wagered. We study self-reinforcing games, in which betting more on an outcome increases its odds, and self-defeating games, in which the opposite is true. This is investigated in and out of equilibrium, with and without rational players, and both numerically and analytically. We introduce a method of measuring the inefficiency of the game, similar to measuring the magnitude of the arbitrage opportunities in a financial market. We prove that the inefficiency converges to equilibrium as a power law with an extremely slow rate of convergence: the more subjective the game, the slower the convergence. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Some economists and politicians believe that asymmetry in oil and gasoline price movements is the outcome of a non-competitive gasoline market requiring that governments take policy action to address unfair pricing. There is no consensus as to the existence. or nature. of the asymmetric relationship between prices of gasoline and crude oil. Much of this literature specifies asymmetry in the speed of adjustment and short-run adjustment coefficients. In contrast, Granger and Yoon's [Granger, C.W. and Yoon, G. Hidden Cointegration, University of California, San Diego, Department of Economics Working Paper, (2002).] Crouching Error Correction Model (CECM) identifies asymmetry of the cointegrating vectors between components (cumulative positive and negative changes) of the series. Applying the CECM to retail gasoline and crude oil prices for the U.S., we find that there is only evidence of cointegration between positive components of crude oil prices and negative components of gasoline prices. In contrast to the literature which attributes asymmetric price movements to market power of refiners, these findings suggest that gasoline prices -in the long run- are more influenced by the technological changes on the demand side than crude oil price movements on the supply side.

The proposed introduction of an under-fill mechanism in current Doha Round WTO negotiations, with a benchmark fill rate of 65 percent is likely to have important implications for Korea. According to our analysis, roughly 30 percent of current TRQ products would need to have increased imports. Static analysis using 47 tariff-quota equivalency test sheds light on whether it would be in Korea's interest to use the sensitive products' provisions in the draft agreement on agriculture to limit reductions in out-of-quota tariffs. Our analysis suggests that if Korea wishes to pursue the objective of minimizing import competition, it will need to give careful consideration to the choice of sensitive products. It may be preferable to implement the proposed reduction in tariffs in full for some products, rather than adopting smaller tariff reductions and increasing TRQs, particularly given the greater scrutiny that is proposed for fill rates under the proposed Doha Round agriculture agreement.","[Lim, Song Soo] Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea; [Blandford, David] Penn State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Korea University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Lim, SS (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",songsoo@korea.ac.kr; dblandford@psu.edu,"Lim, Song Soo/Q-1560-2015; Lim, Song Soo/AAQ-7712-2020",,,,,,22,4,4,0,5,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

But Europe remains different even when allowing for such threshold effects, and its experience is similar to that of interstate flows within the United States.

Heterogeneity in skills makes redistribution desirable and generates an equity-efficiency trade-off. If tax revenues are devoted to a public good, this trade-off is affected in such a way that income transfers are less desirable. High-skilled individuals thus have an incentive to exaggerate their preferences for public goods. Analogously, low-skilled individuals lobby against public good provision. A requirement of collective incentive compatibility eliminates these biases. It implies that income transfers are increased whenever a public good is provided and are decreased otherwise.","Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Bierbrauer, F (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Kurt Schumacher Str 10, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",bierbrauer@coll.mpg.de,"Bierbrauer, Felix J/L-4129-2015",,,,,,30,9,9,0,12,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Each month, a set of parameters ruling worker mobility between labor market states and along the wage ladder is estimated using wage distributions and individual transitions. In particular, job-to-job mobility is decomposed into a voluntary component (on-the-job search) and an involuntary one (jot) reallocation), The resulting time series of transition parameters are first used in a longitudinal analysis of labor turnover and search frictions. Job reallocations are shown to be key in the acyclical behavior of the job separation rate, and in the procyclical behavior of the probability of changing job. Moreover, an index of search frictions is computed and shown to follow no cyclical pattern. The paper then turns to an estimation of the matching function with both unemployed and employed job seekers. The transition parameters from the job search model are used as weights in an aggregate indicator of labor supply. The inclusion of employed workers increases the estimates of the elasticities of the matching function with respect to its two inputs (labor supply and job vacancies). (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Comparison of allocations across problems suggests that subjects neglect probabilistic information on the joint distribution of returns and base their allocations on the observed return levels for the two assets. When asked to predict future returns, subjects try to replicate the historical distribution, thereby falling into the probability-matching bias. Predictions drastically vary when correlations become negative, while allocations are-not significantly affected by changes in sign of correlation. The observed allocation patterns contradict the predictions of standard models of choice; the inconsistency is attributed to common behavioral bias in financial decision.

Wages are determined by a single round of strategic bargaining after the worker is interviewed. The implications of this hiring process for the efficiency of matching and the incidence and severity of statistical discrimination are considered. The better are firms at identifying productive workers the worse the average quality of the unemployment pool so interviewing tends to slow down matching for every one.

I first give an overview of the subject of mechanism design, and then examine a pervasive premise in this field that economic agents are rational in their information processing and decisions. Examples from applied mechanism design identify the roles of perceptions and inference in agent behavior, and the influence of systematic irrationalities and sociality on agent responses. These examples suggest that tolerance of behavioral faults be added to the criteria for good mechanism design. In principle-agent problems for example, designers should consider using experimental treatments in contracts, and statistical post-processing of agent responses, to identify and mitigate the effects of agent non-compliance with contract incentives.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"McFadden, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",mcfadden@econ.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,130,22,25,0,22,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

The industry is a collection of initially inactive independent submarkets; the timing of their activation is determined by an exogenous aggregate diffusion process. New submarket opening attracts new entry. However, the post-entry endogenous sunk investment requirement induced by innovations also forces much exit to follow entry. The aggregate market thus has overlapping exit and entry; and has a shakeout if the aggregate diffusion process follows a typical S-shape.","Univ Southampton, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England",University of Southampton,"Tong, J (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England.",,"Tong, Jian/HSE-4052-2023","Tong, Jian/0000-0001-9367-4853",,,,,26,8,8,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

Only three subjects know the actual Value of the asset while the market is open for trading. The manipulation treatment is identical to the benchmark treatment apart from the fact that we introduce a computer program as an additional uninformed trader. This robot buys a fixed number of shares in the beginning of a trading period and sells them again afterwards. Our main result shows that the last contract price is significantly higher ill the Manipulation treatment if the asset takes a low Value and that private information is very well disseminated by both markets if the Value of the asset is high.

Three measures of comparative advantage in manufactured goods have been applied in our study, including Balassa's revealed comparative advantage, the net manufactured export index, and the Michaely index. We also use four indicators of financial development to identify the different functions of regional financial development, and to determine both size and efficiency features of financial institutions. The estimation results suggest that besides factor endowments, foreign firms and infrastructure, financial development has a quantitatively large and robust effect on China's manufactured goods trade. Therefore, further reform of China's financial system should be encouraged to fully exploit the comparative advantage of China's foreign trade.","[Bao, Qun] Nankai Univ, Dept Int Econ, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jiayu] Nankai Univ, Dept Finance, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China",Nankai University; Nankai University,"Bao, Q (通讯作者)，Nankai Univ, Dept Int Econ, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China.",baoqun@yeah.net; yangjiayu@nankai.edu.cn,,,,,,,34,6,6,1,14,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAR-APR,2009,17.0,2,,,,,15,34,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2009.01139.x,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,425AV,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000264610300002,0

Granger-causality is absent between total and transportation primary energy consumption and real GDP, respectively. Bidirectional Granger-causality is present between commercial and residential primary energy consumption and real GDP, respectively.

Two univariate trend-cycle decomposition methodologies. the Beveridge-Nelson (BN) decomposition and Harvey and Trimbur [Harvey, A.C. & Trimbur, T.M. (2003) General Model-Based Filters for Extracting Cycles and Trends in Economic Time Series, The Review of Economics and Statistics, 85(2), 244-255.]'s unobserved component model, together with a multivariate extension of the BN decomposition incorporating trend and cycle restrictions, are used to identify the trend and cyclical components from real GDP for each of the seven countries. The cycles extracted from the two univariate approaches vary significantly in both cycle period and amplitude. The average correlation calculated from the BN cycles are also smaller than the corresponding correlation estimated using cycles extracted from the unobserved component model. This confirms the argument in Canova [Canova, F. (1998) Detrending and Business Cycle Facts, journal of Monetary Economics, 41(3), 475-512.] that the use of different trend-cycle decomposition methodologies may influence the results obtained. The results produced from the multivariate model indicate the presence of common features in the data. This may reflect the coordinated and common monetary and fiscal policies that these countries have shared over the sample period. However, the finding of codependent and heterogeneous growth cycles raises concerns about the operation of the European Monetary Union (EMU), as it implies that members may face significant stabilisation costs.

Fewer generics enter if the drug is more frequently prescribed at large hospitals and at medical institutions where prescribing and dispensing are separated. Economies of scope in entering multiple markets also affect entry decisions. Brand revenues, which are an important determinant in unregulated markets, also explain generic entry in the regulated market.","Aoyama Gakuin Univ, Tokyo 150, Japan",Aoyama Gakuin University,"Iizuka, T (通讯作者)，Aoyama Gakuin Univ, Tokyo 150, Japan.",,,"Iizuka, Toshiaki/0000-0002-2991-2922",,,,,14,13,13,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1352-4739,1468-5876,,JPN ECON REV,Jpn.

This adds difficulty to measuring and testing for the existence of complementarities among several strategies. This paper introduces a generalized multivariate count data model that allows estimating correlations of any sign among the pricing decisions of competing firms in a manner that is robust to the existence of unobserved heterogeneity leading to either over- and underdispersion of the distribution of counts. Thus, it is possible to overcome a major challenge in testing whether two decisions are strategic complements or substitutes, namely, dealing with the effect of unobserved heterogeneity. I study how firms actually compete in nonlinear tariffs by analyzing the interrelation between the incumbent and entrant's decisions to offer a given number of tariff options. Results document the existence of complementarity among tariff options regardless of whether they are dominated or not. This result supports the view that the implementation of nonlinear tariffs by means of a menu of self-selecting two-part tariffs has some strategic competitive value.

Because of the commingling of unindexed with indexed earnings, a retiree born in 1930 who continued in a high earning career until age 75 receives an annual benefit more than $1,800 larger than would have been generated with full indexing. While the inflation indexing problems identified in this paper do not attract much attention in normal times, they can contribute to serious short-run financial instability for the OASI trust fund in periods of substantial inflation or deflation. They make the percentage increase in your inflation adjusted (CPI-W) benefit if you elect to postpone retirement and the start of OASI benefits depend in part on the pace of inflation.

However, given the sovereign's willingness-to-pay incentive problems, reserve accumulation may reduce sustainable debt levels. In addition, assuming constant debt levels does not allow addressing one of the puzzles behind using reserves as a means to avoid the negative effects of crisis: why do not sovereign countries reduce their sovereign debt instead? To study the joint decision of holding sovereign debt and reserves, we construct a stochastic dynamic equilibrium model calibrated to a sample of emerging markets. We obtain that the reserve accumulation does not play a quantitatively important role in this model. In fact, we find the optimal policy is not to hold reserves at all.

The results show that the real price of oil helps forecast unemployment in recessions only, while the real interest rate does so exclusively in expansions.

We propose a mathematical model of satisficing which explicitly represents agents' aspirations and which explores both single-person and multi-player contexts. The model shows that satisficing has a signature performance-profile in both contexts: (1) it can induce optimal long-run behavior in one class of problems but not in the complementary class; and (2) in the latter, it generates behavior that is sensible but not optimal. The model also yields empirically testable predictions: in certain bandit-problems it pins down the limiting probabilities of each arm's use, and it provides an ordering of the arms' dynamical use-probabilities as well.","[Bendor, Jonathan Brodie; Kumar, Sunil] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Siegel, David A.] Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",Stanford University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Bendor, JB (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",bendor_jonathan@gsb.stanford.edu; kumar_sunil@gsb.stanford.edu; dsiegel@fsu.edu,,,,,,,29,24,25,0,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

After a brief description of the model, the paper presents the results of the scenarios, mainly the values of the major indicators of carbon price - both in the ETS and in non-ETS sectors - and the welfare cost of the EU policy under the various configurations considered. While it is independent of the scenario in the ETS sector, in the non-ETS sector the value of carbon is very sensitive to the provisions of the Directive and in particular the option of resorting to the flexibility mechanisms. The welfare cost also varies significantly according to scenarios, and its value for the entire EU is more than double in the scenario closest to the Directive as compared to the least-cost one. The paper also addresses the very sensitive issue of carbon leakage and argues in favor of a new concept of net leakage. The analysis shows that while carbon leakage may affect some specific sectors, at the aggregate level it does not represent a real concern, with a magnitude of at most a few percent of GHG abatement by Annex B countries.

Participants were asked to estimate the charges payable, to indicate their confidence in that estimate, to say how difficult they had found it to understand the scenario, and to indicate whether they would change their behaviour if the charges were introduced. The time they took to answer each question was recorded and background data was collected on their personal characteristics and attitudes as well as on their attitude to decision-making Analysis of the resulting data shows that the time taken to estimate the charge and decide on a response varied not only with the characteristics of the scenario and with the order of presentation (indicating a learning, or fatigue, effect), but also with personal characteristics (notably age, educational attainment and self-reported decision-making style). The time taken to estimate a charge was significantly (and positively) related to the degree of difficulty reported and, although additional time devoted to making an estimate generally resulted in more accurate estimates, for the simplest scenarios, increased time taken was associated with reduced accuracy. These findings, particularly on the existence of groups with very different levels of motivation to make careful assessment of costs and benefits, and on the factors influencing the time taken to respond to questions, have implications for our understanding of real-world decision-making and for the way that we should collect and categorise choice data and model the decision-making process. The use of simple questions designed to elicit participants' attitudes to decision- making is seen to show great promise in this context.","[Bonsall, Peter; Lythgoe, Bill] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Bonsall, P (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",p.w.bonsall@its.leeds.ac.uk; w.f.lythgoe@its.leeds.ac.uk,,,European Union,European Union(European Union (EU)),"We are happy to acknowledge the financial support of the European Union via the DIFFERENT project and are pleased to be able to thank our colleague Phil Wickham for his help in the design and implementation of the experiment.

We first solve for the optimal mechanism of a direct revelation game in which there is no venue-restriction constraint. We find that the direct optimal mechanism must necessarily incorporate a certain kind of pooling. We then show that even with the venue constraint, the seller can use a two stage indirect mechanism that implements the allocation rule from the optimal direct mechanism, and uses the venues in an optimal fashion. The first stage of the indirect mechanism is a posted price at the store. If the object is not sold, we move to stage two, which involves an auction at the auction site. A feature of this auction is a buy-now option which is essential for implementing the pooling feature of the optimal direct mechanism. We also show that the buy-now option in the optimal mechanism is of a temporary variety, and that a permanent buy-now option, in contrast, cannot implement the optimal mechanism. Auctions with a temporary buy-now option are in widespread use on eBay.","[Bose, Subir] Univ Leicester, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Daripa, Arup] Univ London, Birkbeck Coll, London WC1E 7HX, England",University of Leicester; University of London; Birkbeck University London,"Bose, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",sb345@leicester.ac.uk; a.daripa@bbk.ac.uk,,,,,,,13,7,9,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

In almost all occupations, we find support for both the structuralist and the hysteresis hypotheses, but stress the importance of estimating the degree of persistence of seasonal shocks along with the degree of long-run persistence on raw data without applying seasonal filters.

Our model is a dynamic version of the standard two-party electoral competition model adapted to nonlinear income taxation. The theory has a number of desirable features. First, equilibria always exist, even though the set of admissible tax policies is multidimensional. Second, the Nash set can be characterized generically, and its components give sharp predictions. Third, the features of equilibrium tax policies depend only on empirically meaningful fundamentals. Equilibrium tax schedules benefit the more numerous income groups and place the burden of taxation on income groups with fewer voters. For empirical income distributions, the features of an equilibrium tax schedule are reminiscent of Director's law of public income redistribution (Stigler [39]).","[Carbonell-Nicolau, Oriol] Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA; [Carbonell-Nicolau, Oriol] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, CODE, Barcelona, Spain",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Carbonell-Nicolau, O (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA.",car-bonell@econ.rutgers.edu,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,3,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

Our data set also provides a natural packet of nonUS data for addressing the issue of whether the results of recent asset pricing research are sample specific.

Such strategic behavior on the part of consumers has been shown in the literature to render such dynamic targeted pricing unprofitable, even for a monopoly firm. We show that dynamic targeted pricing can benefit competing firms, when they actively pursue customer recognition based on consumer purchase history. This is because in order to pursue customer recognition, competing firms need to price high to screen out price-sensitive consumers and hence price competition is moderated. As a result, all competing firms can become better off with targeted pricing than without even when consumers behave strategically. Interestingly, because of this competition moderation effect, the paradoxical outcome occurs where dynamic targeted pricing may not benefit a monopolist, but it may benefit competing firms. We also show that dynamic targeted pricing can expand the market such that social welfare unambiguously improves. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Zhang, Z.

This paper develops methodologies for inferring these consequences and applies them to the recent sizable emigration of high-skilled workers from India to the U.S. This wave of emigration from India to the U.S. is shown to be unusually concentrated amongst the prime-age work force, the highly educated and high carriers. In order to calculate the fiscal losses associated with these emigrants, estimates of their counterfactual earnings distributions are generated using two distinct methods and integrated with a model of the Indian fiscal system to calculate fiscal consequences. Conservative estimates indicate that the annual net fiscal impact to India of high-skilled emigration to the U.S. is one-half of 1% of gross national income (or 2.5% of total fiscal revenues). The sensitivity of these results to the method of predicting counterfactual incomes and the implications of these estimates for other developing countries is discussed in detail.

The paper shows that insights gained from economic theory on the issue of the adoption of euro as a common currency can in a meaningful and interesting manner complement the so far known results.","Szkola Glowna Handlowa, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Dudek, MK (通讯作者)，Szkola Glowna Handlowa, Warsaw, Poland.",mkdudek@sgh.waw.pl,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2009,,6,,,,,743,760,,,,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,556AN,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274559000003,0

Most notably, we find that within cold temperature ranges, a decrease in past-month temperature causes a significant decrease in past-month exercise, and this effect is generally larger for lower education and income groups. In large part this differential by socioeconomic group appears to be due to smaller increases in indoor activity during cold weather. These results suggest that interventions and policies aiming to increase exercise participation, particularly among lower socioeconomic populations, could do so in part by increasing the availability and attractiveness of indoor facilities and activities. Furthermore, to the extent that the higher elasticity of behavior for lower socioeconomic groups reflects a more general sensitivity to external factors, these results highlight the promise of interventions that address such factors more broadly.","[Eisenberg, Daniel; Okeke, Edward] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Eisenberg, D (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",daneis@umich.edu; blkwrt@umich.edu,,,,,,,30,6,6,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The problem is a more general version of the Fixed Job Scheduling problem, involving a Lime window for each job larger than its processing time. The objective is to find the optimal subset of the jobs that can be processed. An interesting application area ties in Optimal Berth Allocation, which involves the assignment of vessels arriving at the port to appropriate berths within their time windows, while maximizing the total profit from the served vessels. Eligibility constraints are also taken into consideration. We develop an integer programming model for the problem. We show that the problem is NP-hard, and develop a constraint-graph-based construction algorithm for generating near-optimal solutions. We use genetic algorithm and other improvement algorithms to enhance the solution. Computational experimentation reveals that our algorithm generates very high quality solutions in very small computation times.","[Eliiyi, Deniz Tuersel; Korkmaz, Aslihan Gizem] Izmir Univ Econ, TR-35330 Izmir, Turkey; [Cicek, Abdullah Ercuement] Sabanci Univ, TR-34956 Istanbul, Turkey",Izmir Ekonomi Universitesi; Sabanci University,"Eliiyi, DT (通讯作者)，Izmir Univ Econ, TR-35330 Izmir, Turkey.",deniz.eliiyi@ieu.edu.tr; aslihan.korkmaz@ieu.edu.tr; ercumentc@su.sabanciuniv.edu,"Eliiyi, Deniz Türsel/J-9518-2014","Eliiyi, Deniz Türsel/0000-0001-7693-3980; Cicek, A.

This paper empirically examines the importance of leakage of government resources in the health sector in Chad, and its effects on the prices of drugs. The analysis uses data collected in Chad as part of a Health Facilities Survey organised by the World Bank in 2004. The survey covered 281 primary health care centres and contained information on the provision of medical material, financial resources and medicines allocated by the Ministry of Health to the regional administration and primary health centres. Although the regional administration is officially allocated 60% of the ministry's non-wage recurrent expenditures, the share of the resources that actually reach the regions is estimated to be only 18%. The health centres, which are the frontline providers and the entry point for the population, receive less than 1% of the ministry's non-wage recurrent expenditures. Accounting for the endogeneity of the level of competition among health centres, the leakage of government resources has a significant and negative impact on the price mark-up that health centres charge patients for drugs. Furthermore, it is estimated that had public resources earmarked for frontline providers reached them in their entirety, the number of patients seeking primary health care in Chad would have more than doubled.","[Gauthier, Bernard] HEC Montreal, Inst Econ Appl, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada; [Wane, Waly] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC USA",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; The World Bank,"Gauthier, B (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, Inst Econ Appl, 3000 Cote Ste Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada.",bernard.gauthier@hec.ca,,,,,,,16,14,17,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

The empirical investigation is carried out over a panel dataset covering the US bilateral transactions with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries for the period 1983-1998. The empirical specification is guided by a gravity-based model that accounts for trade and the operation of foreign affiliates as alternative modes of accessing foreign markets. The results show that the CUSFTA induced an increase in inward and outward trade between the US and Canada, but also led to a significant reduction in sales of their foreign affiliates in the corresponding CUSFTA partner country.

Our result shows that the optimal exemption equals to the pre-tax income of the poorer individual, moreover, in the optimal situation, the post-tax income gap between two types of people reflects the society's preference to efficiency.","[Hong Liyang; Zhou Zhuzhu] Xiamen Univ, Publ Finance Dept, Xiamen, Peoples R China",Xiamen University,,1876009@sina.com,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,WORLD ACAD UNION-WORLD ACAD PRESS,LIVERPOOL,"113, ACADEMIC HOUSE, MILL LANE, WAVERTREE TECHNOLOGY PARK, LIVERPOOL, L13 4 AH, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84626-071-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,160,163,,,,,,4,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BQC52,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280689800037,0

Using the Current Population Survey and controlling for differences in demographics, labour market conditions and a time-invariant unobserved individual fixed effect, we determine that for most sub-samples there was no change in labour force participation or in hours of work after 9/11 relative to before. Exceptions were women, who increased their labour force participation, and workers living in the proximity of one of the 9/11 events, who increased their hours of work. These results are consistent with a precautionary increase in labour supply during an uncertain time, and with others' documentation of women responding more dramatically to external stressors.","[Hotchkiss, Julie L.] Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Res Dept, Atlanta, GA 30309 USA; [Hotchkiss, Julie L.; Pavlova, Olga] Georgia State Univ, Dept Econ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Atlanta; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Hotchkiss, JL (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Res Dept, 1000 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30309 USA.",Julie.L.Hotchkiss@atl.frb.org,,,,,,,16,2,2,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Results reveal that tourism, trade and real income growth are cointegrated; thus, a long-run equilibrium relationship can be inferred between these three variables. On the other hand, Granger causality test results suggest that real income growth stimulates growth in international trade (both exports and imports) and international tourist arrivals to the island. Furthermore, growth in international trade (both exports and imports) also stimulates an increase in international tourist arrivals to Cyprus.

A CASE STUDY: SPAIN AND POLAND,REVISTA DE ECONOMIA MUNDIAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Economic Development; Productivity; Economic Stucture; Employment,,"The Spanish and Polish economies are often compared due to their similar potential, as far as area, population and importance of the agricultural sector are concerned. However, the division created by an 18-year time distance between their EU accession fundamentally influences their experience of the market economy, as well as the extent and pace of structural changes. The problem, which was posed in this article, in the context of comparative analysis, was identifying the paths of economic development of Spain and Poland, facing the fact that the three-sector structure of both economies, measured by the share in gross value added of agriculture, industry and service sector have been generally and apparently similar in the last decade. It is easy to find similarities, as far as high levels of unemployment are concerned, in some periods. However, their ways of achieving economic development are fairly different and lead to different results of effective character. The Spanish economic transformation took place mainly as a result of deep, effectiveness changes in agriculture. The Polish economic transformation took place mainly in the industrial sector. In both countries there is a completely different picture of relations between labour and capital inputs, as well as tendencies in changes of labour and capital productivity. As a result, economic growth, if we look at it from the point of traditional growth factors, has a totally different picture in Spain and Poland. In order to define the factors differentiating the economic development we used a neoclassical approach, taking into account the supply side of the economy. The research covers the dynamics and size of such parametres as: real GDP, employment, gross fixed capital formation, total factor productivity - TFP, measured by the Solow residual, labour productivity and value of capital per one person employed. The researched period comprises the years between 1980-2005 in the case of Spain, and 1995-2005 in the case of Poland. Time series used in the analysis come from the databases of Eurostat and OECD.","[Kokocinska, Malgorzata; Puziak, Marcin] Poznan Univ Econ, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Kokocinska, M (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ, Poznan, Poland.",malgorzata.kokocinska@ae.poznan.pl; marcin.puziak@ae.poznan.pl,,,,,,,23,1,1,0,11,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

We study the optimal settlement system design, and find that a trade-off arises endogenously within the model. A higher frequency of settlement and more costly intra-day borrowing policies limit the banks' accumulation of liabilities and promote conservative reserve management, hence limiting the risk of default should a bank fail for any reason. However, such policies also imply higher banking costs, less interest paid on deposits, and less capital allocated by banks to productive investments. After characterizing equilibrium and welfare, we parameterize the economy and analyze how the optimal settlement system policies depend on several features of the economy, including the risk of bank failure, the fragility of the settlement system, the volume of trade by banks' customers, and the rate of return on investments available to banks.","Ibmec Rio Janeiro, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",,"Mello, M (通讯作者)，Ibmec Rio Janeiro, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",mmello@ibmecrj.br,,,,,,,14,5,5,0,1,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

The latest phase in that process was the establishment of Customs Union with the European Union in 1996. This study aims to analyze the effects of that Customs Union on technology-led growth in Turkey. A direct test of the technology-led growth induced by the Custom Union is performed by estimating total factor productivity and labor productivity equations for Turkish manufacturing industry sectors. An indirect test of technology led growth is also performed by estimating a sectoral production function which includes a trade variable. The data set used for the estimation is a panel of 12 manufacturing industry sub-sectors for the period 1994-2001. According to the estimation results of the labour productivity equation, import volume has a positive and significant effect on output per labour. In the total output equation estimation the import variable, volume of imports from EU countries, also implies a positive effect. It is concluded that productivity improving effects generated by manufacturing imports from EU countries can be regarded as one of the positive effects of the Customs Union on the Turkish economy.","[Mihci, Sevinc; Akkoyunlu-Wigley, Arzu] Hacettepe Univ, Ankara, Turkey",Hacettepe University,"Mihci, S (通讯作者)，Hacettepe Univ, Ankara, Turkey.",,,,,,,,49,1,1,1,11,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

Should net neutrality dominate, attention would likely turn to other parts of the economy that might be perceived as choke points for economic activities, such as Net search. Traditionally, the balance between efficiency and fairness that was struck by policy makers depended heavily on cost considerations. When a service was expensive to provide, fairness was deemphasized.

First, I show how to endogenize the supply of liquidity in a simple (one-country) model where commodity money can be created, say through mining and minting, and also consumed, say melted or shipped abroad for imported goods. Second, I develop an explicit multi-country version of the model that determines how liquidity is allocated across economies that share the same currency, such as the euro-zone. The implications of the analysis are similar on many dimensions to more traditional theories, such as Hume's price-specie flow theory, or Mundell's monetary theory of the current account. However, in the current framework the role for money has explicit microfoundations based on frictions in the trading process. At the same time, as compared to existing search-based models in monetary economics, especially those used to address international issues, the current framework is much more natural and also much more tractable.","Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Peterson, B (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Wylie Hall 105, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",bripeter@indiana.edu,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6116,1935-1690,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

This confirms results that have been derived in the same model using an open-loop equilibrium concept. In contrast to the competitive and the open-loop equilibrium, the steady state of the MPNE depends on the utility functions of the households.

American, Japanese and European multinational corporations relocated operations in Singapore, Malaysia and Philippines in the late 1960s and early 1970s to begin electronics assembly, packaging and testing, which was followed in the late 1980s and 1990s by the relocation of electronics manufacturing from Japanese, European, American, Korean, Singaporean and Taiwanese multinationals to the above Southeast Asian countries as well as Thailand and Indonesia. Whereas Singapore has managed significant upgrading to designing and development activities through the provision of grants, incentives, labs and strong infrastructure coordination, electronics production in the remaining countries has largely remained entrenched in assembly, packaging and testing activities. The failure of Malaysia and Thailand to support technological upgrading has undermined the capacity of these economies to sustain rapid growth of the industry as China, Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam have a big edge in low wages and the labour force. Hence, while Singapore has managed to upgrade, Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam continue to enjoy rapid growth in low-end manufacturing activities, Malaysia and Thailand have faced a fall in the significance of the industry since 2000.","Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Rasiah, R (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",rajah.rasiah@gmail.com,"Rasiah, Rajah/X-9122-2019; RASIAH, RAJAH/B-9552-2010","RASIAH, RAJAH/0000-0002-6654-3011",,,,,54,23,26,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

If these absences are costly for the family left behind, the net development benefits of seasonal migration will be less than what they appear from remittances and repatriated foreign earnings, and there might be a role for government policies in host and source countries to mitigate some of the effects of absence. This article provides the first evidence of how Pacific island households and communities are affected by and cope with seasonal absences. We find that Tongan households have succeeded in mitigating many of the potential adverse effects associated with seasonal separation of members, whereas households from Vanuatu with members participating in the RSE appear to have suffered some short-term costs in terms of diet and health.","[Gibson, John] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Gibson, John] Ctr Global Dev, Washington, DC USA",University of Waikato,,,"Gibson, John/AAM-6159-2020","Gibson, John/0000-0003-3886-6873",,,,,13,10,10,0,2,ASIA PACIFIC PRESS,CANBERRA,"AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIV, CRAWFORD SCH ECONOMICS & GOVERNMENT, CANBERRA, ACT 0200, AUSTRALIA",0817-8038,,,PAC ECON BULL,Pac.

The bankruptcy law also might come to include circuit breaker delays in finalizing settlements during turbulent market settings. Some of the fundamental premises underlying mortgage finance should also be reconsidered. Stakes in individual residences could be combined with stakes in regional property portfolios. Finally, the paper promotes a system of continuous workout mortgages regularly readjusting loan balances to reflect economic conditions.

The effectiveness of appreciation in controlling inflation depends on the impact of exchange rate movements on import and domestic prices. Our analysis finds fairly large and speedy exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) to import prices: 50 and 60 percent for the short run and long run, respectively. However, the degree of ERPT decreases along the price chain from upstream to downstream prices. ERPT for consumer prices, the most downstream prices, is much milder and has substantial lags. A 10-percent rise in the nominal effective exchange rate will dampen consumer prices by 1.1 percent within a year, with very little pass-through in the first half year, and by 2.0 percent over the long run. These findings, particularly the ERPT to consumer prices, suggest that RMB appreciation can help to reduce inflationary pressures over the longer term. However, it is unlikely to provide rapid relief to the current round of high inflation because of the long lags in ERPT. The RMB needs to strengthen in effective terms to exert the desired dampening impact on prices.","[Shu, Chang; Su, Xiaojing] Hong Kong Monetary Author, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),"Shu, C (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Monetary Author, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",Chang_Shu@hkma.gov.hk; xsu@hkma.gov.hk,,,,,,,29,12,14,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2009,17.0,1,,,,,33,46,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2009.01129.x,0.0,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,400PH,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000262880100002,0

Older students have been shown in the literature to outperform younger students along many elementary school outcomes, and some post-schooling outcomes. Little evidence exists about the size of these advantages in high school. Data from British Columbia, Canada are used to estimate the effect of age on test scores in grades 4, 7, and 10. I estimate that older students still have a sizable skill advantage in grade 10 across numeracy, reading, and writing tests. The advantage is strongest for girls and low-income students. The results suggest a certain degree of permanence to age related skill differences, which may spill over and affect adult outcomes.","Univ Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada",University of Manitoba,"Smith, J (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",smith44@cc.umanitoba.ca,,,,,,,34,34,46,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

This paper investigates the tension between the modern conceptions, treating Romania as an integral part of Europe and insisting for the road beaten by the industrialized and urbanized West and the traditionalist conceptions, based on the belief in the prevalent rural character of Romania's historical development. Rethinking this controversy from the present globalization perspective, the paper concludes that it was actually a false problem, since the Romanian Principalities had already entered, after 1829, the European trade circuit and the new capitalist relations had been changing the aspect of traditional Romania. Globalization can not be avoided, if only because an understanding of the modem world requires us to confront it.","[Tache, Ileana] Transilvania Univ Brasov, Fac Econ Sci, Brasov, Romania",Transylvania University of Brasov,,ileanatache@unitbv.ro,"Tache, Ileana/B-4104-2019","Tache, Ileana/0000-0003-4559-3367",,,,,25,0,0,0,4,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,338,344,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS68,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287983800050,0

The purpose of this study is to estimate the optimal wetland rental through estimations of both the demand and supply functions in relation to wetland. The wetland supply function is directly estimated based on the data provided by the owners of the wetland, while the estimation of the wetland input demand function involves using the bootstrapping and contingent visitation approaches. Such estimation approaches could also be applied to other nonmarket value products that give rise to environmental externalities. The estimation of rental fee could provide a long-term leasing contract that gives the landlord with a particular rent to lease their lands to support a wetland eco-tourism park to maintain wetland for substantial management. Several environmental management policy implications are also addressed.","[Tseng, Wei-Chun; Chen, Chi-Chung] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Taichung 40227, Taiwan",National Chung Hsing University,"Chen, CC (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Taichung 40227, Taiwan.",mayjune@nchu.edu.tw,"chen, chen/GRY-7085-2022; CHEN, CHEN/HDM-6657-2022",,,,,,39,1,1,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The work is motivated by the introduction of an emissions-trading scheme in Australia, and by the need for policy to be developed around the direct and indirect (life-cycle) greenhouse gas emissions of industries, especially with regards to the trade exposure of industries with large carbon footprints. Greenhouse gas multipliers, which show the carbon footprint intensity of consumption items, are calculated to gain insight into opportunities for 'greening' consumption. Key industries are identified in relation to both greenhouse gas emissions and economic importance. The effects of imports, exports and capital consumption are explored and a brief analysis of the change in greenhouse gas multipliers over time is given.","[Wood, Richard; Dey, Christopher J.] Univ Sydney, Sch Phys A28, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Wood, Richard] NTNU, Ind Ecol Program, Trondheim, Norway",University of Sydney; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Wood, R (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Phys A28, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",r.wood@physics.usyd.edu.au,"Wood, Richard/E-4111-2015","Wood, Richard/0000-0002-7906-3324",,,,,38,57,61,7,46,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

To enable more timely forecasts the recent missing data have to be imputed. The paper presents a state-space model that can deal with publication lags and data revisions. The framework is applied to the US leading index.

The first measure emphasizes the importance of home bias in consumption of traded goods. The second measure highlights the importance of distribution services required for consumption of traded goods. It is found that terms of trade shocks affect the relative price of traded goods using both measures. A possible interpretation of empirical findings is that home bias and distribution services are important for understanding the relative price of traded goods. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper we show that despite some evidence of rising nominal urban unskilled wages between 2000 and 2009, there is little in the data to suggest that this wage increase has been caused by unskilled labour shortages. China still has abundant under-employed workers with very low income in the rural sector. We argue that China's unique institutional and policy-induced barriers to migration have both prevented many rural workers from migrating to cities and also reduced the migrants' length of stay. We project that under alternative institutional settings, the migrant stock could easily be doubled from the current 150 million to 300 million by increasing either the average length of migrant stay, or the migrant inflow, or both.

Current concerns focus on debt and associated intergenerational issues, such as pensions, infrastructure, and the environment. The sustainable state is designed to put in place a framework for integrating these intergenerational issues, alongside the traditional focus on macroeconomic policy, static market failures, and transfers. The building blocks include the accounting framework and, in particular, a national balance sheet setting out assets and liabilities, and providing for capital maintenance over time. To support these assets and to provide for sufficient investment, the sustainable state requires an appropriate level of savings, and institutions to translate these savings into investments. Two components are: the deployment of regulatory asset bases to underpin long-term sunk and fixed costs, given the time inconsistency problem in government's commitments; and the development of financial intermediaries such as an infrastructure bank.","New Coll, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Helm, D (通讯作者)，New Coll, Oxford, England.",dieter@dhelm.co.uk,,,,,,,36,9,9,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

We compare the extent to which optimal policies based on different normative criteria obey the principles of compensation (for differential skills) and responsibility (for preferences for labor) when labor supply is along the extensive margin. With heterogeneity in skills and preferences, traditional Welfarist criteria including Utilitarianism present unappealing policy recommendations in some scenarios as they fail to take compensation and responsibility issues into account. Criteria from the social-choice literature perform better in this regard in first and second best. More importantly, these equality of opportunity criteria push the second best policy away from an Earned Income Tax Credit and in the direction of a Negative Income Tax. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

One of the general presumptions is that trade liberalization has a positive impact on productivity through the effect of competitive pressures to which domestic firms are exposed. For instance, as a result of lowering or removing regulatory barriers to trade, a decline in entry costs of foreign and domestic competitors leads to more competitive pressures which have a downward effect on prices and markups and higher TFP through a better reallocation of inputs. The overall evidence shown in this paper leads to the conclusion that the impact of EU harmonization on various TFP measures occurs through a markup mechanism: more EU harmonization results in more competition (lower markups) and greater TFP growth. We also investigate the impact of assumptions relating to market structure and the production function. We empirical test and refute the assumptions of perfect competition and constant returns to scale in our sample. The analysis is carried out at the level of Dutch food processing firms for the 1979-2005 period. We extend and built upon a new database on EU harmonization of regulations in the food industry. The product classification of this database follows the detailed Combined Nomenclature classification that codes the relevant harmonization initiatives of technical regulations at the product level.","[Vancauteren, Mark] Hasselt Univ, Diepenbeek, Belgium; [Vancauteren, Mark] Stat Netherlands, Heerlen, Netherlands; [de Frahan, Bruno Henry] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium",Hasselt University; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Vancauteren, M (通讯作者)，Hasselt Univ, Diepenbeek, Belgium.",mark.vancauteren@uhasselt.be,,"Vancauteren, Mark/0000-0003-3335-6268",,,,,49,5,5,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,DEC,2011,159.0,4,,,,,483,509,,10.1007/s10645-011-9171-8,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,890KN,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300143600005,0

Currently, ethanol is the most important gasoline additive and alternative fuel consumed in Brazil and is responsible there for profound changes in the dynamics of fuel consumption. The diffusion of flex-fuel vehicles in Brazil symbolizes a new stage of ethanol expansion and is a central component of the increasing demand for fuel. Accordingly, we evaluate ethanol demand in Brazil following the introduction of flex-fuel vehicles using a cointegration approach and autoregressive distributed lag bounds tests over the period 2003-2010. The evidences confirm that during the last decade, ethanol has strengthened its position as both an independent fuel and a substitute for gasoline. There is also evidence that growth in the Brazilian automobile fleet based on flex-fuel technology is a major driving factor of long-run ethanol demand. Further, the dynamics of gasohol (mandatory blend of gasoline and ethanol) and ethanol prices operate in a symmetric manner over ethanol demand, thereby evidencing the increasing substitutability between these alternative fuels.

I consider models of electoral accountability that allow rulers a choice of whether to hold elections and citizens whether to rebel. When individuals observe diverse signals of government performance, coordination to pose a credible threat of protest if the ruler shirks is problematic. The convention of an electoral calendar and known rules can provide a public signal for coordinating rebellion if elections are suspended or blatantly rigged, while the elections themselves aggregate private observations of performance. Two threats to this solution to political moral hazard are considered. First, a ruling faction that controls the army may prefer to fight after losing an election, and ex post transfers may not be credible. A party system in which today's losers may win in the future can restore self-enforcing democracy, though at the cost of weaker electoral control. Second, subtle electoral fraud can undermine the threat of coordinated opposition that maintains elections. I show that when there are organizations in society that can observe and announce a signal of the extent of popular discontent, the incumbent may prefer to commit to fair elections over an accountable autocratic equilibrium in which public goods are provided but costly rebellions periodically occur.","Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Fearon, JD (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,,,,,70,166,209,0,51,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",0033-5533,,,Q J ECON,Q.

First it will be shown that this kind of indeterminacy arises from an arbitrary use of the tendency to a uniform rate of return on the supply prices of capital goods. Second, it will be remarked that, when Sraffa's contribution is placed, as it should, within the classical theory of value and distribution, no price or Sraffian indeterminacy will result. Finally, we will argue that Mandler's emphasis on the non-arbitrariness of the capital goods endowments, which is at the root of his indeterminacy result, naturally leads to refer to those normal positions of the economy whose only possible consistent determination is Sraffa's price theory.","[Fratini, Saverio M.] Roma Tre Univ, Fac Econ, I-00145 Rome, Italy",Roma Tre University,"Fratini, SM (通讯作者)，Roma Tre Univ, Fac Econ, Via Silvio Amico 77, I-00145 Rome, Italy.",fratini@uniroma3.it; levrero@uniroma3.it,"FRATINI, Saverio Maria/B-6417-2013","FRATINI, Saverio Maria/0000-0003-0766-0741; LEVRERO, Enrico Sergio/0000-0003-4529-4981",,,,,76,6,6,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Thus, there is a need of providing methodology that is able to deal with the most important features of electricity price series, which are well known for presenting not only structure in conditional mean but also time-varying conditional variances. In this work we propose a new model, which allows to extract conditionally heteroskedastic common factors from the vector of electricity prices. These common factors are jointly estimated as well as their relationship with the original vector of series, and the dynamics affecting both their conditional mean and variance. The estimation of the model is carried out under the state-space formulation. The new model proposed is applied to extract seasonal common dynamic factors as well as common volatility factors for electricity prices and the estimation results are used to forecast electricity prices and their volatilities in the Spanish zone of the Iberian Market. Several simplified/alternative models are also considered as benchmarks to illustrate that the proposed approach is superior to all of them in terms of explanatory and predictive power.

This paper proposes a new approach to evaluate the divergence between any two income distributions, where the latter can be a reference distribution for the former. In the case where the reference distribution is perfectly egalitarian - and uniquely in this case - we assume that any progressive transfer reduces the divergence, and that the divergence can be additively separated into inequality and efficiency loss. We characterize the unique class of decomposable divergence measures consistent with these views.

We study the emergence of multiple agglomerations as resulting from the interplay between spatial interaction externalities and competition in the land market. We show that the geography of the spatial economy affects significantly the properties of spatial equilibria. In particular, when agents locate on an open land strip (line segment), a single city emerges in equilibrium. In contrast, when the spatial economy extends along a closed land strip (circumference), multiple equilibria with odd numbers of cities arise. Spatial equilibrium configurations involve a high degree of spatial symmetry in terms of city size and location, and can be Pareto-ranked. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Picard, P.

An increase in Chinese demand for steam coal will lead to a growing need for additional domestic infrastructure as production hubs and demand centers are spatially separated, and domestic transport costs could influence the future Chinese steam coal supply mix. If domestic transport capacity is available only at elevated costs, Chinese power generators could turn to the global trade markets and further increase steam coal imports. Increased Chinese imports could then yield significant changes in steam coal market economics on a global scale. This effect is analyzed in China, where coal is mainly transported by railway, and in another setting where coal energy is transported as electricity. For this purpose, a spatial equilibrium model for the global steam coal market has been developed. One major finding is that if coal is converted into electricity early in the supply chain, worldwide marginal costs of supply are lower than if coal is transported via railway. Furthermore. China's dependence on international imports is significantly reduced in this context. Allocation of welfare changes particularly in favor of Chinese consumers while rents of international producers decrease. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Uninsurable expected risk will lead to rural-urban migration as a form of ex-ante insurance if households are liquidity constrained and cannot overcome adverse shocks.

To identify the causal effect, we exploit the family reunification motives and network effects (i.e., the tendency of newly arriving female immigrants to settle in places where males of the same country already live) which is used as an instrument for the geographical distribution of female foreign workers. We find that when the number of immigrants who provide household services is higher, native Italian women spend more time at work (intensive margin) without affecting their labour force participation (extensive margin). This impact is concentrated on highly skilled women whose time has a higher opportunity cost. These results also hold after a battery of robustness checks. We present some further evidence that is also consistent with the idea that the impact works through substitution in household work rather than complementarities in the production sector. Finally, we show that immigration arises as a substitute to publicly provided welfare services, although this phenomenon raises concerns regarding the fairness and sustainability of this private and informal welfare model.

The job of the economist is to teach students the principles of economics, most notably an understanding of spontaneous order and the role of the price system in generating that order within the market. The didactic purpose is simply to teach students so they may in fact become informed participants within the democratic process of collective choice. It is in our job as teachers of the basic principles of economic science, and not as pure researchers, let alone as policy experts who act as saviors, that justifies the public expenditure on the discipline.

Moreover, one's happiness appears to relate more to emotional than intellectual development, as suggested in indicators on Love, Insight, Fortitude, and Engagement (LIFE).

Representing various classes of real and nominal distortions as 'wedges' in standard equilibrium conditions allows a quantitative assessment of those distortions. Decomposing the data into movements due to these wedges shows that distortions generating movements in TFP and wedges in equilibrium conditions for asset markets are essential. In contrast, wedges capturing the effects of sticky prices play less important role. These results are robust to alternative implementations of the accounting method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

To deal with such situations, Aaberge (Soc Choice Welf 33:235-259, 2009) introduced two alternative sequences of nested dominance criteria for Lorenz curves, which proved to characterize two separate systems of nested subfamilies of inequality measures. This paper uses the obtained characterization results to arrange the members of two different generalized Gini families of inequality measures into subfamilies according to their relationship to Lorenz dominance of various degrees. Since the various criteria of higher degree Lorenz dominance provide convenient computational methods, these results can be used to identify the largest subfamily of the generalized Gini families, and thus the least restrictive social preferences, required to reach unambiguous ranking of a set of Lorenz curves. We further show that the weight-functions of the members of the generalized Gini families offer intuitive interpretations of higher degree Lorenz dominance, which generally has been viewed as difficult to interpret because they involve assumptions about third and higher derivatives. To demonstrate the usefulness of these methods for empirical applications, we examine the time trend in income and earnings inequality of Norwegian males during the period 1967-2005.","[Aaberge, Rolf; Mogstad, Magne] Stat Norway, Res Dept, N-0033 Oslo, Norway",Statistics Norway,"Aaberge, R (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, Res Dept, POB 8131 Dep, N-0033 Oslo, Norway.",magne.mogstad@gmail.com; rolf.aaberge@ssb.no,,,,,,,30,8,9,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

We suggest a methodology based on the combination of the gravity model, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the goal programming model (GP). The gravity model is used to determine the attractiveness factors of a country with respect to FPI for 30 investing and 43 receiving countries. Results show the importance of information costs and bilateral trade in the determination of the bilateral asset holdings. The AHP method is applied to prioritize the set of FPI location alternatives according to variables' significance in the gravity model outcome; information costs, bilateral trade, GDP, investment freedom, institutional quality, and geographic distance. Results show that in general Saudi Arabia is the best destination for Japanese and US investors, Turkey is the favorite location for French, German, Italian and British investors and Algeria is the preferred country for Canadian investors. A combined AHP-GP model has been used to determine the degree of portfolio investment in each MENA country from the viewpoint of G7 investors. The relative attractiveness of MENA countries varies over time and across investors. In general, over the period 2001-2005, the most attractive country is Iran for Canadian, French and Italian investors, Turkey for German and British investors and Saudi Arabia for Japanese and US investors. For a MENA country to attract more FPI it should especially improve bilateral trade and institutional quality and reduce foreign investment restrictions and information costs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The reason is that deflation increases the value of being excluded from the credit market and eliminates the incentive to repay loans.

Except in rare cases, the representative agent's noise terms cannot be independently and identically distributed across the set of actions, even if that is assumed for the individual agents. This result demonstrates a fundamental difference between a representative agent and truly heterogeneous quantal responders and suggests that when fitting quantal response specifications to aggregate data from a population of subjects, the noise terms should be allowed to be jointly dependent across actions. Even though this introduces additional degrees of freedom, it makes the model well specified.

Wage is a more non-equalising income source in China than in Russia. While Russian public transfers reduce income inequality, Chinese public transfers increase income inequality. Cross-country differences in the process of transition are also found to be significant.

In economies, such as those of Australia and Canada, that experience substantial changes in the terms of trade, a real gross domestic product excluding those effects becomes a misleading guide for macroeconomic analysis and policy.","[Hall, Alan] Australian Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Res Sch Social Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,,,,,,,,,22,5,6,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0004-9018,,,AUST ECON REV,Aust.

Applying a new testing strategy for Baumol's model, Nordhaus (2008) finds strong evidence in favor of the cost and growth diseases in U. S. GDP-by-industry data (published by the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis). The aim of the present paper is twofold. The first is to check whether Nordhaus's results can be reproduced using U. S. industry data from the EU KLEMS database. Second, Nordhaus's testing methodology is applied to European Union data from the same database. The results suggest that-although there are differences vis-a-vis the U.S.-the EU also shows symptoms of Baumol's diseases.","[Hartwig, Jochen] ETH, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Hartwig, J (通讯作者)，KOF ETH, Weinbergstr 35, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",hartwig@kof.ethz.ch,,"Hartwig, Jochen/0000-0002-8138-5920",,,,,10,22,23,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

We conclude that discrepancies in past studies can be explained by violations of identifying assumptions. Our reading of past evidence, together with an application to Swedish register data, suggests that intergenerational schooling associations are largely driven by selection. Parental schooling constitutes a large part of the parental nurture effect, but as a whole does not play a large role.","[Holmlund, Helena] Stockholm Univ, Swedish Inst Social Res, Stockholm, Sweden; [Holmlund, Helena] London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London, England; [Lindahl, Mikael] Uppsala Univ, IFAU, Uppsala, Sweden; [Plug, Erik] Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands",Stockholm University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Uppsala University; University of Amsterdam,"Holmlund, H (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Swedish Inst Social Res, Stockholm, Sweden.",,"Lindahl, Mikael/GQA-3588-2022",,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,57,222,251,5,51,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,,,J ECON LIT,J.

This stands in sharp contrast to the presumption that these auctions are strategically equivalent, which is indeed valid in the expected utility case.

It is shown that the results obtained in a similar model with homogeneous goods rivalry no longer hold when the goods are differentiated. Indeed, the degree of product substitutability plays an important role in the determination of export policies, and also determines whether a country can be better off under a trade policy war compared to free trade. The use of a differentiated product setting also allows one to compare export policies and countries' welfare levels under both Cournot and Bertrand competition.

We exploit that the second round of the European Social Survey was conducted around the time when Mohammed Bouyeri murdered Theo van Gogh on 2 November 2004. The murder was covered extensively across Europe and led to a debate about the impact of mass immigration. We consider the murder as a natural experiment which allows us to explore how a shock to issue saliency affects immigration policy preferences. We compare preferences of those interviewed right before the murder (control group) with those interviewed right after the murder (treatment group). We find robust evidence of a significant treatment effect in a pooled analysis with country fixed effects. However, when we allow the treatment effect to vary across countries, we find evidence of more support for restrictive policy in only three countries (Norway, Spain, and Slovakia).","[Finseraas, Henning; Jakobsson, Niklas; Kotsadam, Andreas] Norwegian Social Res NOVA, N-0208 Oslo, Norway",,"Finseraas, H (通讯作者)，Norwegian Social Res NOVA, Box 3223 Elisenberg, N-0208 Oslo, Norway.",henning.finseraas@nova.no; niklas.jakobsson@nova.no; andreas.kotsadam@nova.no,"Jakobsson, Niklas/AAD-3660-2022; Jakobsson, Niklas/F-8194-2013","Jakobsson, Niklas/0000-0002-7143-8793;",,,,,21,53,56,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0023-5962,,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,AUG,2011,64.0,3,,,,,396,409,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2011.00512.x,0.0,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,794BD,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000292868300005,0

This enables us to investigate the importance of individuals' attributes in explaining the segregation. Using data from the Labor Force Survey between 1985 and 2005, our results indicate that the L index controlling only for sex is substantial and persistent. However, the full model L index generally implies that occupational segregation has widened after controlling for individuals' attributes. It is found that segregation in the Malaysian labor market is mainly explained by gender, which, on average, accounts for 82% of the segregation. When a measure of macroeconomic conditions and a time variable economic are factored into the model that controls for gender only, the L index remains unchanged.","[Goy, Siew Ching; Johnes, Geraint] Lancaster Univ Management Sch, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England",Lancaster University,"Goy, SC (通讯作者)，Lancaster Univ Management Sch, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England.",s.goy@lancaster.ac.uk; g.johnes@lancaster.ac.uk,"Johnes, Geraint/G-3671-2013","Johnes, Geraint/0000-0002-8148-0629",,,,,50,2,2,0,8,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

We model monitoring as a way to transform team production from a collective action dilemma with strong free riding incentives to a productivity-enhancing opportunity with strong private marginal incentives to contribute effort. In an experiment, we have subjects experience team production without monitoring, team production with a central monitor, and team production with peer monitoring. Then subjects vote on whether to employ the central monitor, who gets to keep a fixed share of the team output, or to rely on peer monitoring, which entails a coordination or free riding problem. Our subjects usually prefer peer monitoring but they switch to the specialist when unable to successfully self-monitor. We provide evidence for situations in which team members resist the appointing of a central monitor and succeed in overcoming coordination and free riding problems as well as for a situation in which an Alchian-Demsetz-like firm grows in the laboratory.","[Grosse, Stefan] Univ Erfurt, Erfurt, Germany; [Putterman, Louis] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Rockenbach, Bettina] Univ Cologne, D-5000 Cologne 41, Germany",University of Erfurt; Brown University; University of Cologne,"Grosse, S (通讯作者)，Univ Erfurt, Erfurt, Germany.",stefan.grosse@googlemail.com; Louis_Putterman@brown.edu; rockenbach@wiso.uni-koeln.de,"Rockenbach, Bettina/B-5447-2016; Rockenbach, Bettina/HRC-3842-2023; Rockenbach, Bettina/AAI-8072-2021","Rockenbach, Bettina/0000-0003-2624-1964; Rockenbach, Bettina/0000-0003-2624-1964",,,,,46,23,24,2,31,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1542-4766,,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

The argument is developed through an analytical example for a stationary economy with no investment. As motivation for the example's main assumptions, the paper presents empirical evidence gathered from the country's Annual Industrial Survey and the estimation of cointegration equations for maquila and non-maquila intermediate imports. The empirical evidence shows that (a) exports are highly dependent on imports and thus benefit from trade liberalization, and (b) while real exchange rate changes can induce substitution between local and imported intermediate goods generally, this is not the case in the maquila sector.","Univ Americas Puebla, Dept Econ, Cholula, Mexico",Universidad Americas Puebla (UDLAP),"Ibarra, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Americas Puebla, Dept Econ, Cholula, Mexico.",carlos.ibarra@udlap.mx,,,,,,,36,1,2,0,7,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,AUG,2011,,104,,,,,191,205,,,,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,865EW,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298294700010,0

Specifically, this paper first aims to analyze determinants of intra-APEC FDI flows so as to ascertain if and whether APEC members tend to invest more intensively intraregionally than extraregionally and, conversely, whether APEC economies receive more investments from other APEC members compared to extra-regional investments. This paper then aims to assess the impact on FDI flows of three different types of country risks - political, economic and financial risks - for the destination economy. This paper finds that the APEC member economies engage more intensively with each other in terms of FDI flows than what one might expect based on the general determinants of FDI flows. However, this conclusion does not hold once we incorporate bilateral exports, suggesting that the reason for the more intensive FDI engagement within APEC was largely due to the significant trade links between the member economies. More exports tend to promote bilateral FDI flows. This points to the complementary nature of FDI and trade in the APEC region. This paper also finds that economies with lower political risk appear to attract more FDI inflows. Thus, individual and regional efforts to improve the institutional quality of member economies are expected to contribute to increasing intra-regional FDI flows in the region. Other aspects, such as more stable political systems, improvements in socioeconomic conditions, reduction in corruption and enhancement of law and order, are all important objectives in and of themselves and will obviously contribute to greater FDI flows","[Lee, Hyun-Hoon] Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Int Trade & Business, Chunchon 200701, South Korea; [Rajan, Ramkishen S.] George Mason Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Arlington, VA 22201 USA",Kangwon National University; George Mason University,"Lee, HH (通讯作者)，Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Int Trade & Business, Chunchon 200701, South Korea.",hhlee@kangwon.ac.kr; rrajan1@gmu.edu,"Rajan, Ramkishen/J-2344-2017","Rajan, Ramkishen/0000-0002-7718-3867",,,,,31,8,8,0,15,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

A large number of empirical studies have been done to examine the welfare effects of microcredit on the borrowers and such effects are well documented in many other countries such as Bangladesh. However, the impacts of microcredit on China rural households' livelihood are not well documented. This paper attempts to empirically evaluate the impact of microcredit on household welfare outcomes such as income and consumption in rural China. The estimation is based on the difference-in-difference approach which is an increasingly popular method of tackling the selection bias issue in assessing the impacts of microcredit. The study uses a two-year panel dataset, including both primary and secondary data collected through a household survey in rural China. Our empirical results favour the wide belief in the literature that joining microcredit programme helps improve households' welfare such as income and consumption. Despite the optimistic findings on how microcredit has changed the rural households' living conditions, our results show that the vast majority of the programme participants are non-poor, which casts some doubts on the social potential (such as poverty reduction) of China's microcredit programmes.

This allocated additional resources to some police force areas to specifically target street crime, whereas other forces did not receive any additional funding. Estimates derived from several empirical strategies show that robberies fell significantly in SCI police forces relative to non-SCI forces after the initiative was introduced. Moreover, the policy seems to have been a cost effective one, even after extensively testing for possible displacement or diffusion effects onto other crimes and into adjacent areas.

Nevertheless, this interpretation leaves aside certain other significant disciplines where the idea and methods of the search of value were applied and came to fruition. One of the disciplines alluded to was art history. Alois Riegl, a prominent member of the Vienna School of Art History, created an original and fully applicable theory of monuments resulting from his thoughts on the question of cultural heritage preservation in Austria-Hungary. His theory of value is largely consonant with not only the value theory proposed by the Austrian economists, but also with the current theories of culture economics; in this respect, it is important to note that Riegl's theory could be interpreted similarly or identically within different disciplines of the Arts.

The NKPC provides theoretical micro-foundations that attempt to explain, inter alia, nominal rigidities and, explicitly price stickiness. This paper investigates the validity of the NKPC for Australia. In contrast to the findings for the USA and Euro area, we find that neither the output gap nor marginal cost appears to be a key driving force variable across different set of instruments and estimators (GMM and 2SLS) over the sample period from 1959 to 2009. The flattening of the NKPC along with significant presence of price stickiness is also found in the data. In particular, the reduced form coefficients and implied estimates from the structural parameters of the model support the view that inflation dynamics are forward looking while the role of lagged inflation is also statistically important only after 1980s. However, we claim that the forward looking baseline NKPC contrary to the hybrid NKPC is stable and better explains inflation dynamics for the Australian economy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, instability in parameter estimates contributes to more uncertainty in assessments of macroeconomic disequilibria than data revisions.

How are trade policies and the viability of trade agreements affected? What are the welfare implications of such foreign influence? In this paper we develop a model of foreign influence and apply it to the study of optimal tariffs. In a two-country voting model of electoral competition, we allow the incumbent party in each country to take costly actions that probabilistically affect the electoral outcome in the other country. We show that policies end up maximizing a weighted sum of domestic and foreign welfare. Using this formulation we show that foreign influence increases aggregate world welfare when there are no other means of alleviating the externalities that arise from cross-border effects of policies. In contrast, when countries can engage in international agreements, foreign influence can prove harmful as powerful countries may refuse to offer concessions. We also show that power imbalances are particularly detrimental to cooperation when they are positively correlated with economic size. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We characterize the set of subgame perfect Nash equilibria under various assumptions regarding the nature and timing of demand uncertainty. In order to prove equilibrium existence, we identify a sufficient condition for the capacity choice game to be submodular. This condition resembles the standard downward-sloping marginal revenue condition used in Cournot games. A robust conclusion of the analysis is that equilibrium capacity choices are asymmetric, even when firms are ex-ante identical. Concerning the equivalence between the capacity-price game and the Cournot game, we find that with inelastic demands, the equilibria of the former belong to the equilibrium set of the latter. However, as compared to the Cournot game, the capacity-price game leads to lower prices and generates price dispersion. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In practice it happens that they can cross-subsidize their activity in other markets since regulation is not perfect. Based on a simple model, I show that such cross-subsidization reduces at least consumer welfare. In competition law, the SSNIP test is used to identify market power. If the state-owned enterprises have some scope for price discrimination, the paper argues that the paradox of the SSNIP test that companies operating below marginal costs are a monopolist on a 'relevant market' makes sense. The paper recommends imposing a duty to deal as a special responsibility for these companies. Finally, it is argued that some criteria are necessary to refine the applicability of competition law in such situations.

Observers of electricity markets have noted how generation capacity constraints may contribute to market power of generation firms. If a generation firm's rivals are capacity constrained then the firm may be pivotal; that is, the firm could substantially raise the market price by unilaterally withholding output. However the SFE literature has not fully considered the impact of capacity constraints and pivotal firms on equilibrium predictions. We characterize the set of symmetric supply function equilibria for uniform-price auctions when firms are capacity constrained and show that this set is increasing as capacity per firm rises. We provide conditions under which asymmetric equilibria exist and characterize these equilibria. In addition, we compare results for uniform-price auctions to those for discriminatory auctions, and we compare our SFE predictions to equilibrium predictions of models in which bidders are constrained to bid on discrete units of output.

If the shocks that give rise to firm growth are perfectly correlated within a firm, then the growth rates of small and large firms are equally volatile, contrary to what is found in the data. If firm growth is the result of many independent shocks within a firm, it can take hundreds of years for a few large firms to emerge. This paper describes an economy with both types of shocks that can account for the thick-tailed firm size distribution, high entry and exit rates, and the relatively young age of large firms. The economy is one in which aggregate growth is driven by the creation of new products by both new and incumbent firms. Some new firms have better ideas than others and choose to implement those ideas at a more rapid pace. Eventually, such firms slow down when the quality of their ideas reverts to the mean. As in the data, average growth rates in a cross section of firms will appear to be independent of firm size, for all but the smallest firms.","[Luttmer, Erzo G.

Chile looks more unequal in international relative terms due to this adjustment.,"[Bravo, David] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Ctr Microdatos, Santiago, Chile; [Valderrama Torres, Jose A.] Minist Econ & Finanzas, Lima, Peru",Universidad de Chile,"Bravo, D (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Ctr Microdatos, Santiago, Chile.",dbravo@econ.uchile.cl; jval-der@ulima.edu.pe,,"Valderrama, Jose/0000-0002-2736-6526",,,,,20,8,9,1,33,UNIV CHILE DEPT ECONOMICS,SANTIAGO,"DIAGONAL PARAGUAY 257, REGISTRO PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL 112.761, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0304-2758,,,ESTUD ECONOMIA,Estud.

The results indicate fast speed of mean-reversion in the returns of these markets but with quite distinct patterns of return dynamics. The evidence seems strong to suggest asymmetric mean reversion and overreaction during market downturns in the Indonesian market. The Vietnamese market exhibits most persistent return autocorrelation with some evidence pointing to higher persistence during market downturns. However, there is no evidence indicating significant serial correlation in the markets of Singapore and Thailand. Finally, the leverage effect is documented in all markets except Vietnam. We tentatively attribute these differences to stages of market development and, accordingly their levels of efficiency, and to the degree of market volatility.","Univ Putra Malaysia, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Management, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Ibrahim, MH (通讯作者)，Univ Putra Malaysia, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Management, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.",mansorhi@econ.upm.edu.my,"Ibrahim, Mansor/AAU-6887-2020",,,,,,19,0,1,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The other interpretation is that the optimal long-run forecast defines an observable permanent component.

Most subjects simultaneously gave to multiple charities with similar missions even when the social benefit of gifts to different charities were not equal, as proxied by the matching rates applied to subjects' gifts. Taking each subject's preferences over the set of charities as given, these choices resulted in substantial inefficiencies: subjects forfeited social surplus (matching funds) equal to 25% of the value of their gifts. Suggestive evidence indicates that warm glow utility derived from the act of making a gift, which can lead to a love of variety even among similar charities, and risk aversion over the social value of charitable gifts are both important factors motivating donors who make socially inefficient gifts. Additionally, few subjects were willing to pay for information that could have enabled them to increase the social benefit of their gifts, although many of these subjects also forfeited potential personal gains in an investment decision, casting some doubt on this interpretation. The possibility that the personal value of information might not be equal to the social value might help explain why there are so few rigorous evaluations of aid programs: such evaluations are costly to charities and might not be valued by donors.

We show that efficient networks are stable and that severing a link in an efficient network results in a higher price for the buyer but a lower price for the seller. We also examine network intermediation when sellers (buyers) form links sequentially. When sellers form links sequentially, the first seller becomes an intermediary and shares links with other sellers; this makes all sellers better off. However, when buyers form links sequentially, buyers may or may not share links.

The regulator's reaction to regulatory risk depends on the curvature of demand. For convex (concave) demand, it yields a positive (negative) information rent effect that benefits (hurts) the firm. Consumers dislike a positive information rent effect but their risk preferences also depend on their tendency to dislike fluctuations in consumption.

Most importantly, the set of sustainable first-best allocations is larger when there is less persistence in the identity of the party in power (because this encourages political compromise).

A major aim has been to see under what conditions we do or do not get an inverted U-shaped curve of income distribution. The paper finds that the tendency always is for the Gini coefficient to rise and then decline. However, once it starts declining, it need not continuously decline; it may rise, then decline, then rise again and indeed rise above the previous peak before starting to decline again and may well end at the end of the simulation at a higher value than at the start. Any case for the redistribution of income is seen to be much stronger at the later stages of development that at earlier stages, even though at later stages, Gini coefficient may be lower than at earlier stages.

To achieve this, an industrial electricity demand function for Turkey is estimated by applying the structural time series technique to annual data over the period 1960 to 2008. In addition to identifying the size and significance of the price and industrial value added (output) elasticities, this technique also uncovers the electricity Underlying Energy Demand Trend (UEDT) for the Turkish industrial sector and is, as far as is known, the first attempt to do this. The results suggest that output and real electricity prices and a UEDT all have an important role to play in driving Turkish industrial electricity demand. Consequently, they should all be incorporated when modelling Turkish industrial electricity demand and the estimated UEDT should arguably be considered in future energy policy decisions concerning the Turkish electricity industry. The output and price elasticities are estimated to be 0.15 and -0.16 respectively, with an increasing (but at a decreasing rate) UEDT and based on the estimated equation, and different forecast assumptions, it is predicted that Turkish industrial electricity demand will be somewhere between 97 and 148 TWh by 2020.

We study competition between hydro and thermal electricity generators under demand uncertainty. Producers compete in quantities and each is constrained: the thermal generator by capacity and the hydro generator by water availability. We analyze a two-period game emphasizing the incentives for capacity investments by the thermal generator. We characterize both Markov perfect and open-loop equilibria. In the Markov perfect equilibrium, investment is discontinuous in initial capacity and higher than it is in the open-loop equilibrium. However, since there are two distortions in the model, equilibrium investment can be either higher or lower than the efficient investment. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

I employ the analogy-based expectation equilibrium (Jehiel 2005) to model such situations. First-price auctions in which past bids are disclosed in an anonymous way generate more revenues than second-price auctions while achieving an efficient outcome in the asymmetric private values two-bidder case with independent distributions. Besides, by using several auction formats with coarse feedback, a designer can always extract more revenues than in Myerson's optimal auction, and yet less revenues than in the full information case whenever bidders enjoy ex post quitting rights and the assignment and payment rules are monotonic in bids. These results suggest an important role of feedback disclosure as a novel instrument in mechanism design.","[Jehiel, Philippe] Paris Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Paris, France; [Jehiel, Philippe] UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1E 6BT, England",Paris School of Economics; University of London; University College London,"Jehiel, P (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Paris, France.",jehiel@enpc.fr,"Jehiel, Philippe/AAG-2354-2020",,Economic and Social Research Council [RES-538-28-1001] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,28,19,19,1,14,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

The interaction between private information problems and the possibility of retrade creates an externality, unless preferences have special, restrictive properties. The externality is internalized by allowing agents to contract ex ante on market fundamentals determining the spot price or interest rate, over and above contracting on actions and outputs. Then competitive equilibria are equivalent with the appropriate notion of constrained Pareto optimality.

The informal sector as defined in the resolution of the 15th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS), January 1993, consists of unincorporated household enterprises which differ from formal enterprises in terms of technology, economies of scale, use of labor intensive processes, and virtual absence of well maintained accounts. Although the informal sector has been characterized as above, no clear-cut operational definition of informal sector is available for the purpose of data collection. In India and in other developing countries in Asia and the Pacific, however, the unorganized segment of the economy closely approximates the ICLS concept of the informal sector. The unorganized segment is labor intensive and provides employment to a sizable section of the population. This paper examines the problems of measuring the unorganized sector and explains the approach taken by the Indian Central Statistical Office. The size of the informal sector is examined in terms of the employment it generates and its contribution to value added.","[Kulshreshtha, A.

Our work is different from most of the previous studies in three ways. First, we use a cross-sectional input-output table data series for the sample period of 1995-2008. Second, unlike most of the previous studies that used an ex post arithmetic average of either Paasche's or Laspeyres's index formula, we use an ex ante mid-point weighting method of those indices in order to minimize measurement errors. Third, we try to figure out how changes in the coefficients of the growth factors in SDA affect the growth of the decomposed factors. The results of our study suggest that the order of the contribution obtained by the SDA method is final demand (52.2%), export demand (48.7%), import substitution for intermediate goods (0.6%), import substitution for final goods (0.2%), and technical changes (-1.7%) respectively.

They illustrate incentive-based reasons for ownership arrangements of private enterprises, and highlight how institutional foundations of trust, particularly government and family-based cultural values, play an important role in influencing the development of private enterprises. These models attempt to explain why government and family-based culture are crucial for the ownership structure and management of private enterprises. The main argument in the models is that the structure of family businesses can be viewed, in essence, as a form of trust-sharing (Guanxi-sharing) arrangement within the firm. Furthermore, the increase in the prevalence of family businesses can be seen as a result of family trust replacing government trust in the firm's economic activities. (C) 2010 Elsevier By.

Empirical evidence from Portugal,ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Conditional convergence; Human capital; External trade; Employment share; GMM regressions; Panel data,PANEL-DATA; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; CONVERGENCE; BALANCE,"The aim of this study is to investigate whether openness, export shares or trade balances affect regional growth in Portugal. Human capital is also considered as a conditional factor to growth, expressed by the rate of success in high school education. Thus, we analyse whether the combination of international trade and human capital is relevant to explain regional growth in Portugal and how it affects the convergence process between regions. In the empirical analysis, interaction terms are introduced to explore the existence of different performances between regions of the Littoral and the Interior. As an alternative to the traditional approach that considers the population growth rate, we include the share of sectoral employment aiming to capture labour specialisation in the main sectors of economic activity and measure its impact on regional growth. The empirical analysis estimates the conditional convergence model of the Barro's type, applied to the Portuguese NUTS3 regions for the period 1996-2005. The GMM estimation approach applied to regional panel data reveals that factors associated with external trade, human capital and sectoral labour share (especially of the industrial sector) are relevant to explain regional growth and convergence in Portugal.

The monetary policy loading on the output gap has averaged around 0 center dot 4 and has not changed very much over time. The overall response of the yield curve to output gap components is relatively small. In contrast, the inflation loading has changed substantially over the last 50 years and ranges from close to zero in 2003 to a high of 2 center dot 4 in 1983.

The framework is provided by the capabilities approach (CA). Hence we extend not only the conceptualisation of entrepreneurship in development, but the reach of the CA into entrepreneurship. From a CA view, entrepreneurship is not only a production factor, or a means to an end, as is often taken to be the case by economists, but also an end in itself. Entrepreneurship can be a human functioning and can contribute towards expanding the set of human capabilities through being both a resource and a process. Our model shows, however, that entrepreneurship is not automatically a functioning. Where it is a necessity it stops being a valued functioning. The model also shows that even when entrepreneurship is valued, entrepreneurs may often not match their ideas with suitable opportunities. Policy implications are discussed. P. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Finally, the existence of individuals with different abilities will also move the optimal income tax system toward progressivity.","[Malchow-Moller, Nikolaj] Univ So Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; [Nielsen, Soren Bo] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Econ, CEPR, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Skaksen, Jan Rose] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Econ, IZA, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark; Copenhagen Business School; Copenhagen Business School,"Malchow-Moller, N (通讯作者)，Univ So Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark.",nmm@sam.sdu.dk; sbn.eco@cbs.dk; jrs.eco@cbs.dk,,"Malchow-Moller, Nikolaj/0000-0001-5350-3152",,,,,16,3,4,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

One is caused by the need to learn the new technologies. As older workers have shorter career horizons, they gain less from such learning and retire earlier. This is the erosion effect. The second effect is opposite. Since technologies are positively correlated across sectors and since aggregate technical change raises aggregate wages, sector technical change is negatively related to early retirement. This is the wage effect.

Additionally, philanthropic preferences may increase the effectiveness of policies to redistribute income, instead of weakening them. Our results thus suggest that philanthropy and direct redistribution may often be better viewed as complements, rather than substitutes, in the context of inequality reduction.

The paper builds upon existing literature by examining whether any significant effects of PTAs occur through a change in the variety of exports (the extensive margin) or through a change in the volume of existing products (the intensive margin). To address this issue we employ the commonly used gravity equation as well as a matching approach to deal with potential self-selection problems. Our results indicate that exports respond positively to the formation of a PTA between countries, and that much of this increase in exports occurs along the extensive margin. We also show that the extensive margin responds more strongly to the formation of a PTA in larger exporters and for larger country pairs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The customers are homogenous with respect to their linear waiting cost and the reward associated with service completion. The cost of joining depends on the behavior of the other customers present, which naturally forms a strategic game. We present a recursive algorithm for computing the (possibly mixed) Nash equilibrium strategy. The algorithm's output is queue-dependent joining probabilities. We demonstrate that depending on the service distribution, this equilibrium is not necessarily unique.

There is a growing body of empirical literature on this topic and many studies provide mixed results. In this study, Sri Lanka is used as a detailed case study and a computable general equilibrium (CGE) approach is used as an analytical framework to examine the trade poverty nexus. The results suggest that, liberalisation of the manufacturing industries is more pro-poor than that of the agricultural industries. Overall, this study suggests that trade reforms may widen the income gap between the rich and the poor creating uneven gains across different household groups in Sri Lanka. While short-term complementary policies are needed to compensate vulnerable income groups, long-term policies are needed to make gains from trade liberalisation more inclusive and equitable to maintain economic and political stability in Sri Lanka.

It makes three main arguments. First, that oil prices have never been as important as is popularly thought. Second, that the most important route through which oil prices affect output is monetary policy: when oil prices pass through to core inflation, monetary authorities raise interest rates, slowing growth. Based on the second argument, the third argument is that high oil prices have not reduced growth in recent years because they no longer pass through to core inflation, so the monetary tightening previously seen in response to high oil prices is absent. It also argues that oil prices had little impact on the global recession of 2008-9.","[Segal, Paul] Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England; [Segal, Paul] Oxford Inst Energy Studies, Oxford, England",University of Sussex; University of Oxford,"Segal, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England.",paul.segal@oxfordenergy.org,,"Segal, Paul/0000-0001-8595-6076",,,,,46,35,40,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

It investigates the ways in which various types of situation dictate selections and valuations and contrasts this process with the marginal model of economic theory. Rational and behavioural approaches to theory are compared. It is suggested that situation-related selection provides a more realistic account of consumer selection than neoclassical theory. The 'situations' that govern choice are seen as established through a process of 'support-bargaining', whereby individuals adjust their behaviour and opinions to gain the support of those around them. This process forms also the abstract 'situations' embodied in theories about the nature of the world and society. The individualism of neoclassical theory is displaced in the process of support-bargaining. The idea of support-bargaining focuses attention on the dependence of neoclassical theory on support to offset its fundamental faults. It is suggested that it be replaced with the theory of support-bargaining and associated situation-related selection.",,,"Spread, P (通讯作者)，7 Kings Peace,Crossways Rd, Grayshott GU26 6HS, Hindhead, England.",pspread@btopenworld.com,,,,,,,22,4,4,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

It is a reasonable conjecture that the government fiscal behavior and in particular vis-a-vis economic growth had undergone a significant shift as Singapore switched from British colonial rule to self-government. The paper first traces out the characteristics of the colonial government fiscal behavior and compares them with those during the period of self-government in terms of sources and uses of revenue and fiscal balance. This is then followed by econometric exercises to ascertain whether the government fiscal expenditure responds to income movements broadly in the spirit of Wagner's law in 1900-1939 and 1966-2000. Generally, attention is focused upon inter-temporal similarities and differences.","[Sugimoto, Ichiro] Soka Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Tan, Eu Chye] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Soka University; Universiti Malaya,"Sugimoto, I (通讯作者)，Soka Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan.",ichiro@soka.ac.jp; tanec@um.edu.my,"杉本, 一郎/AAQ-3641-2021","杉本, 一郎/0000-0001-6535-6073",,,,,57,2,2,2,13,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

This paper estimates the vertical motive of offshore production by multinational enterprises (MNEs) by exploiting past schooling characteristics as instruments for skilled-labor abundance in a host country. Using panel data on Japanese and U.S. MNEs in the 1990s, I find that skilled-labor abundance has a significantly negative impact on sales of manufacturing foreign affiliate only for Japanese MNEs. The results suggest that vertical FDI activity was more prevalent in Japanese MNEs than U.S. MNEs. A plausible explanation is that Japanese MNEs might be more vertically integrated with their offshore production than U.S. MNEs. A difference in foreign outsourcing activities could generate the observed deviation between Japanese and U.S. MNEs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesize that the risk of violence is affected by the gain-loss utility of game outcomes around a rationally expected reference point. Our empirical analysis uses police reports of violent incidents on Sundays during the professional football season. Controlling for the pregame point spread and the size of the local viewing audience, we find that upset losses (defeats when the home team was predicted to win by four or more points) lead to a 10% increase in the rate of at-home violence by men against their wives and girlfriends. In contrast, losses when the game was expected to be close have small and insignificant effects. Upset wins (victories when the home team was predicted to lose) also have little impact on violence, consistent with asymmetry in the gain-loss utility function. The rise in violence after an upset loss is concentrated in a narrow time window near the end of the game and is larger for more important games. We find no evidence for reference point updating based on the halftime score.

A simple North-South general equilibrium model in which industries differ in their imitation rates is developed. Stronger IPRs encourage Northern firms in a wider range of industries to start exporting. Exports in industries with the highest risk of imitation rise, while exports in other industries may fall. More technology diffuses to the South because new high-tech products are introduced in the Southern market. This works against the reduction in technology diffusion caused by limited imitation.

Borrowers monitor each other when liability is joint, while the lender monitors individual loans. Joint liability offers poorer borrowers larger loans with less monitoring effort than would have to be exerted by the lender. Individual liability offers the wealthier among credit-constrained borrowers larger loans even without monitoring. The theory explains why individual loans serve the wealthier among poor borrowers and are larger, and why businesses funded with individual loans grow more. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It is found that market completeness and the specific form of nominal rigidities, namely, nominal price vs. nominal wage rigidities, matter for justifying the observed structure of equity holdings. When markets are complete, sticky prices generate a negative correlation between the non-diversifiable labour income and the profit of domestic firms with respect to the productivity shocks, which explains why households invest little abroad. In contrast, when markets are incomplete, rigidities in goods prices result in a counterfactual 'super home bias', because domestic equities provide a good hedge against not only the labour income risk but also the relative price risk. Wage rigidities, however, have the opposite effect. Therefore, nominal rigidities in both goods prices and wage rates are needed to address the empirical composition of gross equity positions under incomplete markets.

It is the case that the New Consensus Macroeconomics theoretical framework has dominated macroeconomic analysis in recent years and has in effect underpinned many macroeconomic policies. However, given the current experience with the 'great recession' crisis, the question arises whether there is not a better paradigm and set of economic policies that can lead the economy to an improved economic performance. This is precisely the focus of this contribution. Our response is very much that there is. In this contribution we propose another theoretical framework before moving to economic policy questions. The general background to the theoretical framework is that the analysis is of a monetary production economy in which finance and credit play a significant role. It relates to an economy, which has degrees of instability, and there is often inadequacy of aggregate demand. The level and distribution of productive capacity can often be inadequate for underpinning the full employment of labour.","[Arestis, Philip] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Arestis, Philip] Univ Basque Country, Leioa, Spain; [Sawyer, Malcolm] Univ Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Cambridge; University of Basque Country; University of Leeds,"Arestis, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",mcs@lubs.leeds.ac.uk,,,,,,,54,4,5,0,5,PALGRAVE,BASINGSTOKE,"HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, ENGLAND",,,978-0-23030-768-1,INT PAP POLIT ECON,,,2011,,,,,,,1,38,,,,,,38,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BWV66,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000295079400001,0

In separating cost efficiency from technological differences, the model provides more accurate efficiency measures for airports' policy makers. The input/output data used in testing the model reflect on recent figures from the UK airport industry, and as a result link the efficiency measures with the current industry trends such as the increase in oil price, airport capital investments and market expansion. Results from the model estimation showed that the model fits the data well with all coefficients correctly signed and in line with the theoretical requirements. The average cost efficiency for 2007 was around 73.73%, indicating that UK airports are not operating close to a full efficiency level. This article attributed the sources of inefficiencies to the current industry trends and discussed the importance of heterogeneity in future policy formulations at UK airports.","Victoria Univ, Ctr Tourism & Serv Res, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia",Victoria University,"Assaf, A (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ, Ctr Tourism & Serv Res, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia.",albert.assaf@vu.edu.au,"Assaf, Albert/GVU-5821-2022",,,,,,39,14,14,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It is well known from business praxis that in each crisis have been some companies gone but some of them became even stronger. Those have been the companies, which based on right intelligence, prepared new business plans in time, mainly based on valuable or disruptive innovations and using the right competitive strategy they realized their intentions successfully. This means that Competitive Intelligence must be able to first of all gain the important information for strategic decision making and second through analyzing them and its evaluation bring added value for the TOP management to achieve the original competitive advantage. Concerning the Cl as a system application discipline, which none of foreign or inland authors mention, we would like to describe the CI using the term Competitive Engineering.

In addition, conclusions are drawn about the market efficiency of the Chinese equity markets that are based on well-known analytical methods. On the basis of the analysis, we observe that the equity markets of both exchanges were not efficient before the financial crisis and became efficient to some extent in terms of the weak-form efficiency markets hypothesis during the financial crisis.

Methodologically, Dietzenbacher's framework for evaluating the innovative spillover effect is modified and extended to a cross-national and cross-sectoral context for accommodating this purpose, accompanied by the utilization of the Asian International I/O (AIO) table for the year 2000. Several results are thus achieved: (1) For the spillover structure, it is understood that the inter-sectoral dependence and vertical specialization in production serves as the nexus for the skeleton of rent spillover. (2) The extent of process innovative spillover is at a level of approximately 90%, while the extent of product innovative spillover is roughly in the 40-50% range. (3) On average, a 1% process innovation would create the total Asian output by a 0.0025-0.1387% margin, and a 1% product innovation would contribute 0.0010-0.0575% of the total output. (4) The United States, Japan, and China rank as the top three countries equipped with the capability of creating the most plentiful innovative spillover effect on the Asian region overall. (5) The United States and Japan still occupy the position of leading flying geese to date, while China might emerge as an industrial innovative leading flying goose in the near future. (6) Under the prerequisite of regional development, this study has tabulated the sector rankings according to the strength of overall spillover effect by country as a reference for tactically reallocating industrial and innovative policy from a regional development perspective.","[Chen, Ku-Hsieh] Fo Guang Univ, Dept Management, Yilan, Taiwan; [Yang, Hao-Yen] Natl Taipei Coll Business, Dept Finance, Taipei, Taiwan",Fo Guang University,"Chen, KH (通讯作者)，Fo Guang Univ, Dept Management, 160 Linwei Rd, Jiaosi Shiang 26247, Yilan, Taiwan.",khchen@mail.fgu.edu.tw,"Chen, Ku Hsieh/IJF-6060-2023",,,,,,30,0,0,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

Using data from 1972 to 2006, we find that the SMA (1, 50) consistently outperforms the market before the integration of stock exchanges in 1986. Under the (1, 50) rule, a variable length moving average performs better than the fixed length moving average rule by 2.5 to 5% (annual) before transaction costs because it includes the information of the first 9 days into investors' decision. The results are robust to the out of sample tests for the validity of the profitability of the trading rules. The returns of the trading range break rules are insignificant over the 35-year span. Our results support the conjecture that stock market integration may lead to better information efficiency. The findings of significant pre-1986 profits and insignificant post-1986 profits, contradict previous findings that returns are predictable in Hong Kong, suggesting that the Hong Kong stock market may be weak-form efficient after 1986. Overall, our results suggest that technical analysis matters for asset pricing.","[Cheung, William; Lam, Keith S.

We distinguish between passive traders who hold fixed portfolios of stocks and bonds, and active traders who adjust their portfolios to changes in expected returns. To solve the model, we derive an optimal consumption sharing rule that does not depend on the trading technology, and we derive an aggregation result for state prices. This allows us to solve for equilibrium prices and allocations without having to search for market clearing prices in each asset market separately. We show that the fraction of total wealth held by active traders, not the fraction held by all participants, is critical for asset prices because only these traders respond to variation in state prices and hence absorb the residual aggregate risk created by non-participants. We calibrate the heterogeneity in trading technologies to match the equity premium and the risk-free rate. The calibrated model reproduces the skewness and kurtosis of the wealth distribution in the data. In contrast to existing asset pricing models with heterogeneous agents, our model matches the high volatility of returns and the low volatility of the risk-free rate.","[Chien, Yili] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Cole, Harold] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Lustig, Hanno] UCLA Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Lustig, Hanno] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; University of Pennsylvania; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Chien, YL (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",,"Chien, Yili/I-5741-2016","Chien, Yili/0000-0002-6820-1197; Cole, Harold/0009-0003-0590-0139",,,,,35,34,44,1,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

In other words, countries were to contribute to the global targets but not be held to account against them, as they were originally conceived. In practice though, countries are assessed against the global MDG targets. It is appropriate that continuing interest be paid to the achievement of the MDGs, however it is also necessary that the global community now start to turn its attention to what framework for addressing the world's development needs beyond the MDG timeframe following 2015. The 'poverty landscape' has changed significantly in the last decade - partly as a result of the international community's focus on the MDGs - and so it is necessary that a new approach to poverty alleviation reflect this changed reality.

A literature has been developed which examines this causal structure. The results have been anything but consistent. De Long and Summers (1991) find strong evidence of the traditional causal relationship from investment to output growth. But Blomstrom et al. (1996) find just the opposite. One problem with these studies is that each fails to recognize the implied long-run relationship between fixed investment and output such that a Vector Autoregressive Representation (VAR) in these variables should be modelled as an error correction mechanism. We employ panel cointegration techniques on data from the Penn World Tables 6.1 covering 98 countries over 40 years. Our results suggest that investment and output are cointegrated and that the direction of causality generally runs in both directions. However, we find that in African- and low-income nations the direction of causality runs from output to investment, supportive of the findings by Blomstrom et al. (1996).

It quantifies recent emigration flows and provides preliminary evidence on the economic consequences of migration for the region. Results show that the most common destination for South Caucasian migrants is Russia and that the most common purpose of migration is to work abroad. An analysis of the demographic and socio-economic determinants of migration reveals that the migration flows do not involve mass emigration of skilled labour. However, this result is probably due to the relatively high cost of emigration to high-income countries. While individuals with higher education are not more likely to become migrants in general, having higher education is associated with up to four times higher probability of migration to a high-income OECD country among Armenians and Georgians. The results are in line with theoretical arguments that skill distribution and returns to education in the host country relative to the home country affect the selection of migrants, and that the cost of migration plays an important role in the migration decision. Further analysis suggests that migration indirectly boosts economic development in the South Caucasus by raising local incomes and demand. I also find a significant correlation between having a migrant and running a family business in Armenia, which suggests that migrants' earnings can provide scarce capital for business investment and support the development of the private sector in the region.","[Dermendzhieva, Zvezda] CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic; [Dermendzhieva, Zvezda] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Tokyo, Japan",Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Dermendzhieva, Z (通讯作者)，CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic.",zdermend@cerge-ei.cz,,,,,,,32,12,12,2,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2011,23.0,3,,,,,377,398,,10.1080/14631377.2011.595135,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,883HJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299624500006,0

We use an original survey conducted in 2003 that provides instruments to deal with the endogeneity of parent's education. In Senegal, school supply has been increasing a lot over the last decades, individuals who are now adults had different exposure to the schooling system, depending on where they lived when they were young and on their birth cohort. Hence, a first set of instruments describes the infrastructures available in the environment in which parents lived when they were 10 years old. Moreover, variation in education demand for a child is also driven by his/her position among his/her siblings, since older children tend to be less educated in West Africa. Being the first born is random but implies different educational outcomes than other birth ranks. Hence, the second set of instruments describes whether the parents were the first born among their same sex siblings. The estimated effect of father's education is more than double when its endogeneity is accounted for. Unexpectedly, mother's education comes out as a lesser determinant. We then focus on the understanding of the channels through which parental education affects children's schooling. We present the results pointing at the importance of the direct impact of parental education relative to the effect passing through wealth or household activity choices.","[Lambert, Sylvie] Paris Sch Econ Inra 48, F-75014 Paris, France; [Dumas, Christelle] Thema Univ Cergy Pontoise, F-95011 Cergy Pontoise, France",Paris School of Economics; INRAE; CY Cergy Paris Universite,"Lambert, S (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ Inra 48, Bd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",sylvie.lambert@ens.fr,,"Dumas, Christelle/0000-0002-6034-7239",,,,,24,8,8,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The presence of companies on the community webs poses considerable risks - as the reality has shown. The present contribution aims at a brief description of the current situation in the Czech Republic and at problems of using communication via Facebook for the needs of marketing. The contribution brings the outputs based on inquiries focusing on students of secondary schools and universities, i.e. the target group forming a substantial part from the total number of the user accounts on Facebook in the Czech Republic. In the conclusion the results are then compared with similar research studies in the USA. The results of the research show what attitude these users have towards the community webs, namely Facebook, what their online behaviour is and how they perceive the presence of companies and brands on the community webs. The stated information is very important for the communication of companies on social networks as this type of communication requires different and innovative approach and the Czech companies have so far only taken the first steps on their way to the mastery in this specific area.","[Eger, Ludvik; Petrtyl, Jan] Univ W Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt Trade & Serv, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,,leger@kmo.zcu.cz; petrtyl@kmo.zcu.cz,"Eger, Ludvik/C-1330-2016","Eger, Ludvik/0000-0002-5437-3297",,,,,24,4,4,0,24,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-755-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,118,126,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT98,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300261200013,0

In the analysis, we focus on their long run relations as well as their dynamic causal interactions by means of time series techniques of cointegration and vector autoregression (VAR). Our basic framework consists of real aggregate investment, real output, lending rate, real stock prices and stock market volatility. We obtain evidence for their long run relation and that, in the long run, real aggregate investment is positively related to real stock prices and negatively related to the stock market volatility. The generalized impulse-response functions (IRF) generated from the VAR also paint similar picture in that the real aggregate investment reacts positively to shocks in real stock prices and negatively to innovations in stock market volatility. These results tend to be robust when we extend the framework to include alternatively real credits, real effective exchange rate and real government spending.","[Ibrahim, Mansor H.] Int Ctr Educ Islamic Finance INCEIF, Kuala Lumpur 50350, Malaysia; [Ibrahim, Mansor H.] Univ Putra Malaysia, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Management, Serdang 43400, Malaysia",INCEIF; Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Ibrahim, MH (通讯作者)，Int Ctr Educ Islamic Finance INCEIF, Kuala Lumpur 50350, Malaysia.",mansorhi@inceif.org,"Ibrahim, Mansor/AAU-6887-2020","Ibrahim, Mansor/0000-0003-0413-0075",,,,,43,4,4,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

Theory of leadership evaluating leadership from the point of view of relationship is the theory of leader-member exchange (LMX) (Dansereau, F., Graen, G. B. and Haga, W., 1975). This theory considers the influence of subordinates on the leader to be of the same importance as the influence of leaders on subordinates. LMX theory presents the model of the creation of leadership which proposes leaders to search for the methods of creation of mutual trust and respect with all subordinates, thus changing the whole wok unit into an inside group. LMX theory prompts leaders to create relationship of mature partnership with every subordinate and to avoid any inequity. We raise the hypothesis: the quality of interaction between a leader and a follower and the process of the creation of leadership at the same time are influenced by the age and sex of subordinates, therefore while creating leadership these aspects should be taken into account. The research of the interaction between the leader and followers performed among the higher medical staff of stationary departments of Kaunas county hospital and its branch Kaunas psychiatry hospital showed some differences among sexes in the process of the creation of leadership and some influence of the age of a follower to the quality of interchange with the leader. The analysis of the interaction between a leader and followers allowed us to make the final generalization as follows: 1) the more aged, the more often high quality interchange is formed with a leader and mostly this tendency is exposed among respondents aged 41-60 who already have some work and life experience; 2) despite the fact that the major part of the investigated group consisted of women, even twice more men in comparison to women group create high quality interchange with the leader; 3) men trust their leader more than women and are ready to protect and to explain his/her decision. 4) women feel less understood by their leaders, considerably less than men trust them and more seldom are ready to protect themselves and to explain their decisions; 5) however, despite the quality of interchange with the leader, women who form the major part of the members of the dyad are not less pleased in their relationship with the leader than men. Therefore it could be stated that despite a prompt attempt of leaders (by LMX theory) to create relationship of mature partnership with every subordinate avoiding any inequity, it is necessary that such aspects as age and sex of followers should be taken into account.","[Kaminskas, Giedrius; Pilinkus, Donatas] Vilnius Univ Kaunas Fac Humanities, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Bartkus, Edverdas Vaclovas] Kaunas Technol Univ, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vilnius University; Kaunas University of Technology,"Kaminskas, G (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ Kaunas Fac Humanities, Muitines St 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",pilinkus@pilinkus.com; edvardas.bartkus@ktu.lt,,,,,,,28,4,9,0,29,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The main result of this study supports the hypothesis for the textile and clothing firms in the developed country of Spain, while intangibles proved to be insignificant in explaining the efficiency of companies in the transitional economy of Poland.","Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ Empresa, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Kapelko, M (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ Empresa, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",,"Kapelko, Magdalena/F-3788-2016","Kapelko, Magdalena/0000-0003-2020-2374",,,,,29,2,2,0,11,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

Specifically, we study the conditions under which share prices are increased for the Financial Times (FT) Global 500 companies due to participation in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), a consortium of institutional investors with $57 trillion in assets. We find no systematic evidence that participation, in and of itself, increased shareholder value. However, by making use of Russia's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, which caused the Protocol to go into effect, we find that companies' CDP participation increased shareholder value when the likelihood of climate change regulation rose. We estimate the total increase in shareholder value from CDP participation at $8.6 billion, about 86% of the size of the carbon market in 2005. Our findings suggest that institutional investor activism towards climate change can increase shareholder value when the external business environment becomes more climate conscious.","[Kim, Eun-Hee] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Lyon, Thomas] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",George Washington University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Kim, EH (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",eunheek@gwu.edu; tplyon@umich.edu,"Shingade, Sudam Shrikrushna/D-5452-2019",,,,,,47,80,86,4,65,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

While the challenges related to leadership development have been studied in many organizations worldwide, in many developing countries like Iran it seems to be more important. As Iran is extremely dependent on oil exports as the most important source of income, the main purpose of this study is to find the important leadership development characteristics within oil industry and petroleum in Iran. To meet the aim of the study, literature study and comparative evaluation of that literature and then a qualitative methodology were employed. As a result, eight leadership characteristics are introduced as the most important characteristics in leadership development in the oil companies including: inspiring shared vision, building trust, team working, building communication skills, giving contingent rewards, encouraging creativity and solving problems, monitoring, and empowering. In addition, as a secondary result, four factors were found as important outcomes of organizational leadership development. These factors are leadership effectiveness, more leaders' satisfaction, better organizational performance and more competitive advantages.","[Mehrabani, Shadi Ebrahimi] Islamic Azad Univ, Dehaghan Branch, Dept Comp, Dehaghan, Iran; [Mohamad, Noor Azmi] UTM, Fac Management & Human Resource Dev, Skudai, Malaysia",Islamic Azad University; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Mehrabani, SE (通讯作者)，Islamic Azad Univ, Dehaghan Branch, Dept Comp, Dehaghan, Iran.",ebrahimish@yahoo.com; noorazmi@utm.my,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,3,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8867-1,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,7.0,,,,,,38,+,,,,,,3,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX61,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303217600009,0

While most research has examined the factors which encourage people to move to new locations, we focus our research on the effects of satisfaction with individuals' current location on the decision to stay. To do so, we examine the relative effects of three kinds of factors: (1) satisfaction with community or place-based factors such as aesthetic appeal, outdoor space and recreational amenities, artistic and cultural amenities, the ability to meet people and make friends; (2) community economic conditions; and (3) individual-level demographic factors such as income, human capital, and age. Our findings indicate that place-based factors, in particular the beauty and physical appeal of the current location and the ability to meet people and make friends, explain more of the desire to stay than do community economic conditions or individual demographic characteristics.

Pour ceci, nous examinons les effets relatifs de trois types de facteurs: (1) la satisfaction avec la communaute ou avec des facteurs propres a l'endroit, par exemple l'esthetique du lieu, les espaces au grand air et les amenagements de loisirs, artistiques et culturels, la capacite de rencontrer des gens, de nouer des liens d'amitie; (2) des conditions economiques propres a la communaute; et (3) des facteurs demographiques au niveau personnel: revenus, capital humain, age, entre autres. Nos conclusions indiquent que des facteurs bases sur les lieux, notamment la beaute et l'attrait physique du lieu, et la capacite de rencontrer des gens et de nouer des liens d'amitie, expliquent le desir de rester sur place plutot que des conditions economiques propres a la communaute ou des facteurs demographiques.

In the paper, the author focuses on the determinants and the consequences of this sudden adjustment in the exchange rate, and also of its formation in the around-crisis period, simultaneously pointing to the role of the economic authorities in stabilising the situation in the foreign exchange market. As a research method, the analysis of statistical data and of literature was used. Main conclusions include the statement that the exchange rate played a role of an absorber of negative exogenous tendencies, and moderated to some extent the recessionary phenomena spreading into the country. As a result of a significant depreciation of the zloty, the exports competitiveness has been maintained, although at the cost of a major increase in the inflation rate and in the scale of exchange rate volatility. Revealed after a short time, later appreciation trend has been successfully inhibited by a foreign exchange intervention - a first one since more than a decade - in April 2010.","[Michalczyk, Wawrzyniec] Wroclaw Univ Econ, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,,wawrzyniec.michalczyk@ue.wroc.pl,"Michalczyk, Wawrzyniec/P-2716-2018","Michalczyk, Wawrzyniec/0000-0002-8521-4088",,,,,22,0,0,0,0,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

Both operate within the logic provided by a balance-of-payments constraint framework. The more developed and larger economy, the leader, is technologically more advanced with higher levels of productivity and issues the international reserve currency. The developing economy, the follower, is closely linked to the leader economy and is balance-of-payments-constrained (BPC). The paper argues that the growth of the leader has at the same time divergent and convergent effects on the productivity gap between both economies. The divergent effect (the Kaldor effect) works through a process of induced productivity and cumulative causation. The convergent effect (Thirlwall's Law) works through the BPC constraint. The model states that growth with convergence in productivity requires that the ratio of export to import income elasticities of the follower economy exceeds the ratio of the induced productivity of the leader economy to that of the follower economy The paper then highlights the difficulty of achieving convergence under a BPC constraint and provides policy implications.","[Perez Caldentey, Esteban] Comis Econ Amer Latina & Carib, Santiago, Chile",,"Caldentey, EP (通讯作者)，Comis Econ Amer Latina & Carib, Santiago, Chile.",esteban.perez@cepal.org; anesa.ali.mfa@gmail.com,,,,,,,34,4,5,0,5,UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO,COYOACAN C P,"CIUDAD UNIV, FAC ECONOMIA, CIRCUITO INTEROR S-N, 1ER PISO, EDIFICIO B, COYOACAN C P, 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

The data employed herein include the industry input-output table and labor data. The labor productivity table by age and industry was generated using the results of a survey. The survey was conducted among the manufacturing and service sectors. The average wage by industry and age (Ministry of Labor, Monthly Labor Statistics Survey) and the number of wage workers by industry and age (National Statistical Office) were also determined to be used in this study. The principal empirical findings of this work are that the extension of mandatory retirement exerts a value-added effect ranging from a minimum of 1.02 trillion Kwon (about 1 billion US dollars) to a maximum of 3.01 trillion Kwon (about 3 billion US dollars). If the mandatory retirement age is extended from the current 55 to 60, the industries that benefits from the largest value-added effects are the public administration and education service sectors. This means that more workers will continue to work after the age of 55 relative to other industries, or that the wage levels of workers over the age of 55 will be higher, or that the decline in the productivity of these workers will be lower. The economic ripple effect of the extension of mandatory retirement age is estimated to be quite immense. The extension of retirement age should begin in the service sector, in which the loss of productivity is anticipated to be relatively small. This study addresses a variety of policy remedies to soft-land the extended mandatory retirement age, and to enhance its social benefits.","[Rhee, Hae-Chun; Cho, Joonmo] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Woo, Kwangho] Korea Labor Inst, Seoul, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Korea Labor Institute,"Rhee, HC (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Myeongnyun 3-Ga, Seoul, South Korea.",rheehc@skku.edu; trustcho@skku.edu; wookh1@gmail.com,"Cho, Joonmo/B-7368-2012",,,,,,17,0,0,0,15,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The initial regression analysis makes use of German administrative data and is based on the variation of foreign workers' shares within education-experience cells over time. It confirms previous findings suggesting that immigration in Germany had no adverse impact on native wages. However, the paper highlights that in Germany immigrants and natives with similar education and experience are likely to work in different occupations. The subsequent analysis based on occupational clustering uses the same data and finds significant adverse wage effects for natives, particularly for those in basic service occupations. The paper argues, therefore, that an identification strategy based on formal education characteristics might lead to biased estimates if a country's labor market is characterized by occupational segmentation of immigrants.","Hamburg Inst Int Econ HWWI, Hamburg, Germany",,"Steinhardt, MF (通讯作者)，Hamburg Inst Int Econ HWWI, Hamburg, Germany.",steinhardt@hwwi.org,"Steinhardt, Max Friedrich/ACK-1489-2022","Steinhardt, Max Friedrich/0000-0001-7994-4060",,,,,46,29,34,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6108,1935-1682,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Depending on the ratio of switching costs to network effects, our model generates four different market patterns: monopolization and market sharing, which can be either preserved or reversed. A critical mass effect where one firm becomes the monopolist for sure only occurs for intermediate values of the ratio, whereas for large switching costs market sharing is the unique equilibrium. For large network effects, both monopoly and market sharing equilibria exist. Our welfare analysis reveals a conflict between maximization of consumer surplus and social welfare when network effects are large. We also analyze firms' incentives for compatibility and incentives to increase switching costs and examine how market outcomes are affected by market expansion and cost asymmetries. Finally, in a dynamic extension of our model, we show how competition depends on agents' discount factors.","[Suleymanova, Irina; Wey, Christian] Univ Dusseldorf, DICE, D-4000 Dusseldorf, Germany",Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf,"Suleymanova, I (通讯作者)，Univ Dusseldorf, DICE, D-4000 Dusseldorf, Germany.",suleymanova@dice.uni-duesseldorf.de; wey@dice.uni-duesseldorf.de,"Wey, Christian/GNP-5568-2022",,,,,,33,7,7,0,17,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Although the literature has explored wage inequality issues, we studied the impacts of FDI on skill upgrading comprehensively, together with trade and other factors (such as FDI externalities). Specifically, our analysis introduces the origin of FDI, controls for plant heterogeneity and relates the results to the FDI theory on Multinational Enterprises (MNEs). The results show that, on average, FDI caused wage inequality because of FDI-led skill-biased technological change. However, Japanese and Taiwanese investments helped to alleviate the inequality. Japanese and Taiwanese FDI is motivated by cost advantages achieved through vertical FDI and thus increases relative demand for unskilled labour.","[Tomohara, Akinori] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Tomohara, Akinori] Aoyama Gakuin Univ, Dept Int Polit Econ & Commun, Shibuya Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Yokota, Kazuhiko] Waseda Univ, Sch Commerce, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1898050, Japan",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Waseda University,"Tomohara, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",jujodai@yahoo.com,,,,,,,11,9,14,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

In the model, moderately poor bidders outbid rich bidders in such auctions, because poor bidders have less to lose by defaulting on taxpayer loans. Thus, says Zheng: After defeating their rich rivals and acquiring the toxic assets, such bidders will default on government-provided loans whenever the toxic assets turn out to be unsalvageable. The chief trouble with the paper is that the assumptions do not fit reality. In reality, the government-provided loans used to buy toxic assets are nonrecourse, allowing the borrower to walk away from the loan with no penalties besides ceding the asset that the loan purchased. Thus, there is nothing to make rich bidders less ready to win the auction. Zheng's conclusions that less well endowed borrowers will win toxic asset auctions are erroneous. Further Zheng's use of auctions to model these plans is largely inappropriate since only one of the three government toxic asset plans has government backed investors bid for the same toxic asset in an auction format.","Univ Louisiana Lafayette, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA",University of Louisiana Lafayette,"Wilson, L (通讯作者)，Univ Louisiana Lafayette, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA.",linuswilson@louisiana.edu,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,5,INST SPONTANEOUS ORDER ECONOMICS,FAIRFAX,"9745 KINGS CROWN COURT #102, FAIRFAX, VA 22031 USA",1933-527X,,,ECON J WATCH,Econ.

Does the effect of social security on fertility differ by income? Does social security further affect the dynamics of the earnings distribution through its differential effects on fertility? We answer these questions in a three-period OLG model with heterogeneous agents and endogenous fertility. We find that given its redistributional property, social security reduces fertility of the poor proportionally more than it reduces fertility of the rich. Assuming that earning ability is transmitted from parents to children, the differential effects of social security on fertility can have a significant impact on the dynamics of the earnings distribution: a relatively lower fertility rate among the poor can lead to a new earnings distribution with a smaller portion of poor people and a higher average earnings level. With reasonable parameter values, our numerical exercise shows that the effects of social security on differential fertility and the dynamics of the earnings distribution are quantitatively important.","Univ Western Ontario, Social Sci Ctr 7432, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Zhao, K (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, Social Sci Ctr 7432, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada.",kzhao5@uwo.ca,,,,,,,55,3,4,0,22,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

I critically review the foundations for Kaplow's procedure and its reliance on strict welfarism. I argue that basing efficiency gains on hypothetical lump- sum tax adjustments can lead to social welfare reducing policies if such tax adjustments are not carried out.

In this celebratory article, we show how this model not only answered important practical questions, but also opened the door to a quite startling range of important and challenging follow-up questions, many of great practical importance and analytic depth. The (S, s) model has become one of the touchstone models of economics, opening new vistas of applied economic theory to all who internalize its structure. Today it is universally applied to solve questions faced in inventory control. The core model elements, uncertainty and fixed costs of adjustment, are ubiquitous, which has resulted in its becoming the general purpose economic model of discrete adjustment. The (S, s) model has also become a profound source of inspiration for macroeconomists seeking to understand the role that discrete microeconomic adjustments play in macroeconomic fluctuations. Looking forward, we foresee rapid growth in the use of (S, s) modeling to aid households making complex and costly financial decisions, such as when and how to terminate a mortgage. In the projected era of household operations research, new modeling challenges will arise due to enriched feedback from the world of practice.","[Caplin, Andrew; Leahy, John] NYU, New York, NY 10012 USA",New York University,"Caplin, A (通讯作者)，NYU, New York, NY 10012 USA.",andrew.caplin@nyu.edu; john.leahy@nyu.edu,,,,,,,75,20,24,0,18,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

J,"Chai, A; Moneta, A",,,,"Chai, Andreas; Moneta, Alessio",,,Retrospectives Engel Curves,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,DEMAND; LAW,"Engel curves describe how household expenditure on particular goods or services depends on household income. German statistician Ernst Engel (1821-1896) was the first to investigate this relationship systematically in an article published about 150 years ago. The best-known single result from the article is Engel's law, which states that the poorer a family is, the larger the budget share it spends on nourishment. We revisit Engel's article, including its context and the mechanics of the argument. Because the article was completed a few decades before linear regression techniques were established and income effects were incorporated into standard consumer theory, Engel was forced to develop his own approach to analyzing household expenditure patterns. We find his work contains some interesting features in juxtaposition to both the modern and classical literature. For example, Engel's way of estimating the expenditure-income relationship resembles a data-fitting technique called the regressogram that is nonparametric - in that no functional form is specified before the estimation. Moreover, Engel introduced a way of categorizing household expenditures in which expenditures on commodities that served the same purpose by satisfying the same underlying want were grouped together. This procedure enabled Engel to discuss the welfare implications of his results in terms of the Smithian notion that individual welfare is related to the satisfaction of wants. At the same time, he avoided making a priori assumptions about which specific goods were necessities, assumptions which were made by many classical economists like Adam Smith. Finally, we offer a few thoughts about some modern literature that builds on Engel's research.",,,,chai@econ.mpg.de; moneta@econ.mpg.de,,"MONETA, Alessio/0000-0003-4786-9507; Chai, Andreas/0000-0003-0838-9324",,,,,41,85,91,0,17,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

The idea is that a strict interpretation of an inflation target may preserve inflationary distortions after price stability is attained. We show that such a policy not only creates a slump in output but may increase macroeconomic volatility substantially in a model in which wages are subject to a Taylor staggering structure. The policy implication is that the problems associated with an excessively rigid inflation targeting policy are even more severe during a disinflationary episode. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Although this risk is microeconomic in nature, the evidence advanced thus far has taken the form of macro correlations. We evaluate this mechanism empirically at the micro level by using a database of over 3000 publicly listed firms from fifteen emerging markets. We measure the risk of maturity mismatch by estimating, at the firm level, the effect on investment of the interaction of short-term exposure and aggregate capital flight. This effect is (statistically) zero, contrary to the prediction of the maturity-mismatch hypothesis. This conclusion is robust to using a variety of different estimators, alternative measures of capital flows, and controls for devaluation effects and access to international capital. We do find evidence that short-term-exposed firms pay higher financing costs, and have lower equity valuations, but not that this reduction in net worth translates into a drop in investment or sales.

Volatility decreases with openness to international trade and per capita GDP, and increases with inflation, particularly under a horizontal peg or band, and with terms-of-trade volatility. The choice of exchange rate regime matters. After controlling for these effects, an independent float adds at least 45% to the standard deviation of the real effective exchange rate, relative to a conventional peg, but most other regimes make little difference. The results are robust to alternative volatility measures and to sample selection bias.","[Bleaney, Michael] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Francisco, Manuela] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Francisco, Manuela] Univ Minho, Barga, Portugal",University of Nottingham; The World Bank; Universidade do Minho,"Bleaney, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",michael.bleaney@nottingham.ac.uk,,,,,,,33,11,11,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

However, in many cases, only the incumbent utility bids for the contract and the competitive effects are limited. This paper presents a statistical analysis of bidders' participation in competitive procurement. We employ several count data regression models to explain the number of bidders other than the local electric utility. Our results suggest that the number of bidders would decrease in response to an increase in the load factor, perhaps because the new entrants are less competitive in serving customers with high load factors as they do not operate low-cost base-load power plants such as nuclear power plants: It would increase along with the voltage level and contract demand. The results also indicate that new entrants are more likely to participate in the bidding process in large city areas. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Higher growth in China and India is likely to raise Malaysia's national income and to expand Malaysia's natural resource and agricultural exports, while putting downward pressure on exports from some manufacturing and service sectors. Increases in the quality and variety of exports from China and India are likely to increase substantially the overall gains to Malaysia. The expansion of the natural resource sectors and the contraction of manufacturing and services reflect a Dutch-disease effect that will raise the importance of policies to facilitate adaptation to the changing world economy and improve competitiveness. Most-favoured-nation (MFN) liberalisation would increase welfare, and, by increasing competitiveness, raise output and exports of key industries. Preferential liberalisation with India and completely free trade with China would provide greater market access gains than MFN reform, but neither would be as effective in increasing income as MFN liberalisation, and free trade agreements would lead to greater competitive pressure on many of Malaysia's industries than MFN liberalisation.

Using the bound test approach to cointegration, we found a short-run as well as a long-run relationship among the variables with a positive and a statistically significant relationship between pollutant emissions and economic growth. Further, applying a modified version of the Granger causality test we also found a unidirectional causality running from pollutant emissions to economic growth; from energy consumption to economic growth and from energy consumption to CO2 emissions all without a feedback. The econometric evidence suggests that South Africa has to sacrifice economic growth or reduce its energy consumption per unit of output or both in order to reduce pollutant emissions. In the long-run however, it is possible to meet the energy needs of the country and at the same time reduce CO2 emissions by developing energy alternatives to coal, the main source of CO2 emissions. However, the econometric results upon which the policy suggestions are made should be interpreted with care, as they may not be sufficiently robust enough to categorically warrant the choice of an unpalatable policy option by South Africa.

But such an approach fails to represent the heterogeneous influence of movie features on demographic groups and is unable to assist market-segmentation decisions. We propose and illustrate a new approach for modeling the appeal of movie features to market segments via the use of appropriate individual-specific data and canonical correlation analysis. Specifically, through demographically detailed movie-attendance data available in Spain, we build a model of how movie features influence the demographic composition of audiences. Via a canonical correlation analysis, we identify four dimensions underlying the relationships between several movie features (country of origin, genre, objectionable content, stars, promotional effort, and critical evaluations) and audience demographics (gender, age range, presence of children, education, social class, and size of municipality). These dimensions represent the strong pairings between four moviegoer demographic profiles and four movie-feature profiles. Our approach can potentially aid in segmentation and green-lighting decisions by matching movie features with the most relevant segment-specific preferences.","[Redondo, Ignacio] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Financiac & Invest Comercial, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Holbrook, Morris B.] Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Business, New York, NY 10024 USA",Autonomous University of Madrid; Columbia University,"Redondo, I (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Financiac & Invest Comercial, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",ignacio.redondo@uam.es; mbh3@columbia.edu,"REDONDO BELLON, IGNACIO/W-1486-2017","REDONDO BELLON, IGNACIO/0000-0002-0550-5556",,,,,41,18,19,3,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

This paper bridges the gap between empirical findings and financial theory. By slightly modifying the Lucas (Lucas, R.E., 1978. Asset prices in an exchange economy. Econometrica 46, 1429-1445.) model, this study shows how investor mood variations affect equilibrium asset prices and expected returns. Analysis results indicate that both equity and bill prices correlate positively with investor mood, with higher asset prices associated with better mood. Conversely, expected asset returns correlate negatively with investor mood. Further, the mood effect on asset prices increases when investors are in a good mood, and mood variations exhibit a greater influence on equity markets than on bill markets. Results of this study suggest that investor mood is a vital factor in equilibrium asset prices and returns, and integrating investor mood into asset-pricing models helps to interpret the growing body of seemingly anomalous evidence regarding investor behavior.

Of particular interest are the changes in inequality and poverty over time, which are typically assessed through the estimation of income distributions. From this, income inequality and poverty measures, along with their differences and standard errors, can be derived and compared. With panel data becoming more frequently used to make such comparisons, traditional methods which treat income distributions from different years independently and estimate them on a univariate basis, fail to capture the dependence inherent in a sample taken from a panel study. Consequently, parameter estimates are likely to be less efficient, and the standard errors for between-year differences in various inequality and poverty measures will be incorrect. This paper addresses the issue of sample dependence by suggesting a number of bivariate distributions, with Singh-Maddala or Dagum marginals, for a partially dependent sample of household income for two years. Specifically, the distributions considered are the bivariate Singh-Maddala distribution, proposed by Takahasi (1965), and bivariate distributions belonging to the copula class of multivariate distributions, which are an increasingly popular approach to modelling joint distributions. Each bivariate income distribution is estimated via full information maximum likelihood using data from the Household. Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey for 2001 and 2005. Parameter estimates for each bivariate income distribution are used to obtain values for mean income and modal income, the Gini inequality coefficient and the headcount ratio poverty measure, along with their differences, enabling the assessment of changes in such measures over time. In addition, the standard errors of each summary measure and their differences, which are of particular interest in this analysis, are calculated using the delta method. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we investigate the hypothesis that the sharp rise in energy costs during this period resulted in the obsolescence of firms' existing capital and reduced their market value. To quantify this obsolescence channel of the energy crisis, we simulate a calibrated dynamic general equilibrium model, where firms adopt, energy-saving technologies along with the rise in energy prices, and the value of their installed capital falls due to investment irreversibility. We find that this channel can account for a third of the decline in Tobin's q observed in the data. Separately, we consider the role of investment subsidies extended by the government during this period to expedite the adoption of energy-saving technologies. This extension of the model can account for more than half of the decline in q. We also find empirical support for the capital obsolescence channel in cross-sectional regressions, where we show that the sectoral variation in the decline of energy use following the crisis is significant in explaining the sectoral variation in the drop of market values.

Without knowledge of the location of such boundaries, there is no way to know whether the confidence region about the parameters' point estimates might be crossed by one or more such boundaries. If there are intersections between bifurcation boundaries and a confidence region, the resulting stratification of the confidence region damages inference robustness about dynamics, when such dynamical inferences are produced by the usual simulations at the point estimates only. Recently, interest in policy in some circles has moved to New Keynesian models, which have become common in monetary policy formulations. As a result, we explore bifurcations within the class of New Keynesian models. We study different specifications of monetary policy rules within the New Keynesian functional structure. In initial research in this area, Barnett and Duzhak (Physica A 387(15):3817-3825, 2008) found a New Keynesian Hopf bifurcation boundary, with the setting of the policy parameters influencing the existence and location of the bifurcation boundary. Hopf bifurcation is the most commonly encountered type of bifurcation boundary found among economic models, since the existence of a Hopf bifurcation boundary is accompanied by regular oscillations within a neighborhood of the bifurcation boundary. Now, following a more extensive and systematic search of the parameter space, we also find the existence of Period Doubling (flip) bifurcation boundaries in the class of models. Central results in this research are our theorems on the existence and location of Hopf bifurcation boundaries in each of the considered cases. We also solve numerically for the location and properties of the Period Doubling bifurcation boundaries and their dependence upon policy-rule parameter settings.","[Barnett, William A.] Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Duzhak, Evgeniya A.] CUNY, Baruch Coll, Zicklin Sch Business, New York, NY 10010 USA",University of Kansas; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY),"Barnett, WA (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",barnett@ku.edu; evgeniya_duzhak@baruch.cuny.edu,"Barnett, William/GWU-7996-2022",,,,,,42,15,19,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

One of the key structural differences between the North and the South is that the South experiences a pronounced rural-urban migration in the presence of urban unemployment. We introduce this feature in the structure of a simple general equilibrium model to analyze the effects of trade liberalization and fragmentation on employment and the skilled-unskilled wage differential in the South. In particular, we show that while fragmentation necessarily improves the unskilled wage and the skilled wage, more lucrative global opportunities for the skilled final product, in the absence of fragmentation, can reduce the rural wage and increase urban unemployment. The effect of fragmentation, ceteris paribus, on the skilled-unskilled wage gap is sensitive to the degree of substitutability between land and unskilled labor. As such, fragmentation can magnify the increase in the skilled-unskilled wage gap resulting from an improvement in the terms of trade. It is also shown that a technological progress in the intermediate goods sector increases the skilled-unskilled wage gap and raises urban unemployment.

One of the best ways to let that happen is to pass through wholesale energy costs to retail customers. This can be accomplished by letting retail prices vary dynamically, either entirely or partly. For the overwhelming majority of customers, that requires a change out of the metering infrastructure, which may cost as much as $40 billion for the US as a whole. While a good portion of this investment can be covered by savings in distribution system costs, about 40% may remain uncovered. This investment gap could be covered by reductions in power generation costs that could be brought about through demand response. Thus, state regulators in many states are investigating whether customers will respond to the higher prices by lowering demand and if so, by how much. To help inform this assessment, this paper surveys the evidence from the 15 most recent pilots, experiments and full-scale implementations of dynamic pricing of electricity. It finds conclusive evidence that households respond to higher prices by lowering usage. The magnitude of price response depends on several factors, such as the magnitude of the price increase, the presence of central air conditioning and the availability of enabling technologies such as two-way programmable communicating thermostats and always-on gateway systems that allow multiple end-uses to be controlled remotely. In addition, the design of the studies, the tools used to analyze the data and the geography of the assessment influence demand response. Across the range of experiments studied, time-of-use rates induce a drop in peak demand that ranges between 3 and 6% and critical-peak pricing (CPP) tariffs induce a drop in peak demand that ranges between 13 and 20%. When accompanied with enabling technologies, the latter set of tariffs lead to a reduction in peak demand in the 27-44% range.","[Faruqui, Ahmad] Brattle Grp, San Francisco, CA USA; [Sergici, Sanem] Brattle Grp, Cambridge, MA USA",The Brattle Group; The Brattle Group,"Faruqui, A (通讯作者)，Brattle Grp, San Francisco, CA USA.",ahmad.faruqui@brattle.com,,,,,,,32,417,457,5,112,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

In particular, these two reforms reduced the marginal tax rates for married households. In this paper I investigate what part of the rise in labor force participation of married women between 1980 to 1990 (a rise of 13 percentage points) can be accounted by the changes in taxes. I build an heterogeneous agent model populated by married households. Households differ by age and educational attainment levels of their members and decide whether the second earner, the wife, should participate in the labor market. I select parameter values so that the model economy is consistent with the 1980 U.S. economy in terms of income tax structure, wages (skill premium and gender gap), marital sorting (who is married with whom), and female labor force participation. Using counterfactual experiments I find that 20-24 percent of the rise in married female labor force participation is accounted for by the changes in the income tax structure. Changes in wages account for 62-64 percent, and changes in marital sorting account for 14-16 percent of the rise in the participation rate of married women. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

A reduction in income taxation provides immediate incentives to work and save more, raising aggregate output and consumption. A temporary rebate is mostly saved and increases consumption marginally. Both policies improve the overall welfare of households and the rebate policy benefits especially low-income households. In the long-run, however, the debt accumulated to finance the stimulus and a higher tax to service the debt can crowd out capital and lower output and consumption, causing welfare to deteriorate.

We first explicitly derive optimal consumption and portfolio rules under RI and then show that introducing RI reduces the optimal share of savings invested in the risky asset because inattentive investors face greater long-run consumption risk. We also show that the investment horizon matters for portfolio allocation in the presence of RI, even if investment opportunities are constant and the utility function of investors is constant relative risk aversion. Second, after aggregating across investors, we show that introducing RI can better explain the observed joint dynamics of aggregate consumption and the equity return. Finally, we show that RI increases the implied equity premium because investors under RI face greater long-run consumption risk and thus require higher compensation in equilibrium.

The market structure that provides the context for firms' investment choices itself evolves due to the feedback effect of firms' investments. In such cases, analyses of investment-performance relationship, purporting to explain sustainable competitive advantages, should ideally account for the endogeneity of the determinants of market structure-technology, demand, and policy-and firms' investment choices. This paper focuses on the endogeneity of the demand-side determinants of market structure and firms' demand-side investments under the assumed conditions of constant technology and policy environment. In doing so it contradicts the extant depiction of the evolution of industrial market structure in the above context as primarily caused by the evolution of underlying technological system in response to firms' endogenous technological investments that generate sustainable competitive advantage for the dominant firms. A dynamic evolutionary model of demand competition captures the competition in the downstream market for basic industry product and its complements in an industry based on systemic technology during its post-interoperability stage. A natural experiment drawn from the US Long-distance telecommunications services industry during 1984-1996 allows testing the hypotheses drawn from the above model in a panel data setting.","Univ Cent Oklahoma, Coll Business Adm, Edmond, OK 73034 USA",University of Central Oklahoma,"Manral, L (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Oklahoma, Coll Business Adm, 100 N Univ Dr, Edmond, OK 73034 USA.",LManral@uco.edu,"MANRAL, LALIT/AGG-3729-2022; MANRAL, LALIT/B-2641-2012","MANRAL, LALIT/0000-0003-3623-7299;",,,,,46,11,12,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,,,J EVOL ECON,J.

The main concern is that the new risk-sensitive bank capital regulation (Basel II) may amplify business cycle fluctuations. This paper compares the leading alternative procedures that have been proposed to mitigate this problem. We estimate a model of the probabilities of default (PDs) of Spanish firms during the period 1987-2008, and use the estimated PDs to compute the corresponding series of Basel II capital requirements per unit of loans. These requirements move significantly along the business cycle, ranging from 7.6% (in 2006) to 11.9% (in 1993). The comparison of the different procedures is based on the criterion of minimizing the root mean square deviations of each adjusted series with respect to the Hodrick-Prescott trend of the original series. The results show that the best procedures are either to smooth the input of the Basel II formula by using through-the-cycle PDs or to smooth the output with a multiplier based on GDP growth. Our discussion concludes that the latter is better in terms of simplicity, transparency, and consistency with banks' risk pricing and risk management systems. For the portfolio of Spanish commercial and industrial loans and a 45% loss given default (LGD), the multiplier would amount to a 6.5% surcharge for each standard deviation in GDP growth. The surcharge would be significantly higher with cyclically varying LGDs. --- Rafael Repullo, Jesus Saurina and Carlos Trucharte.","[Repullo, Rafael; Saurina, Jesus; Trucharte, Carlos] CEMFI, Madrid, Spain; [Repullo, Rafael; Saurina, Jesus; Trucharte, Carlos] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Repullo, Rafael; Saurina, Jesus; Trucharte, Carlos] Banco Espana, Madrid, Spain",Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Banco de Espana,"Repullo, R (通讯作者)，CEMFI, Madrid, Spain.",,,,,,,,52,35,40,0,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

In our equilibrium, house prices compensate for cross-sectional productivity differences. We increase productivity dispersion in the calibrated model in order to match the 30-year increase in cross-sectional wage dispersion that we document based on metropolitan-level data. We show that the model quantitatively matches the observed 30-year increase in dispersion of house prices across US metropolitan areas. It is consistent with several other features of the cross-sectional distribution of house prices and wages.","[Van Nieuwerburgh, Stijn] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Van Nieuwerburgh, Stijn; Weill, Pierre-Olivier] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Weill, Pierre-Olivier] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA",New York University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Van Nieuwerburgh, S (通讯作者)，NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,,,,,,,56,91,122,2,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Although real wages increased seven-fold during the period, growth was uneven across ownership types, industries and regions. Over the past decade, the wages of state-owned enterprises have increased rapidly and wage disparities between skill-intensive and labour-intensive industries have widened. Comparisons of international data show that China's manufacturing wage has already converged to that of Asian emerging markets, but China still enjoys enormous labour cost advantages over its neighbouring developed economies. Our analysis suggests that China's wage growth will stabilize to a moderate pace in the near future.","[Yang, Dennis Tao] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Monarch, Ryan] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Chinese University of Hong Kong; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Yang, DT (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",deyang@cuhk.edu.hk,,,,,,,44,59,71,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

It is shown that in a 'neoklassikal' model - in which utility maximising consumption choices are combined with a fixed-coefficient technology - an increase in government purchases will reduce the demand for labour at the given wage rate. The reasoning turns on the link between optimising consumption behaviour and employment in the investment sector. An increase in G will (as a matter of arithmetic) make current consumption scarcer relative to future consumption; and thereby reduce the valuation of future consumption in terms of current consumption. As labour is valued according to its contribution to future consumption (through its contribution to capital formation), it follows that an increase in G will reduce the wage at any given volume of employment.","Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Coleman, W (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",william.coleman@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,12,4,4,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,,,ECON REC,Econ.

We propose principles for its regulation and describe a specific proposal to implement those principles. We document how the rise of shadow banking was helped by regulatory and legal changes that gave advantages to three main institutions: money-market mutual funds (MMMFs) to capture retail deposits from traditional banks, securitization to move assets of traditional banks off their balance sheets, and repurchase agreements (repos) that facilitated the use of securitized bonds as money. The evolution of a bankruptcy safe harbor for repos was crucial to the growth and efficiency of shadow banking; regulators can use access to this safe harbor as the lever to enforce new rules. History has demonstrated two successful methods for regulating privately created money: strict guidelines on collateral, and government-guaranteed insurance. We propose the use of insurance for MMMFs, combined with strict guidelines on collateral for both securitization and repos, with regulatory control established by chartering new forms of narrow banks for MMMFs and securitization, and using the bankruptcy safe harbor to incentivize compliance on repos.","[Gorton, Gary; Metrick, Andrew] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Gorton, G (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",,"Metrick, Andrew/B-9296-2008","Metrick, Andrew/0000-0002-7930-9830",,,,,84,183,210,1,116,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

This paper uses a dynamic computable general equilibrium model to assess the likely impacts on sectoral competitiveness that would accompany efforts to meet greenhouse gas mitigation targets that have been set by the Canadian government. Additionally, it evaluates several design mechanisms that could be used to reduce the negative competiveness impacts associated with adoption of domestic climate policies. The analysis suggests that several sectors would likely face significant competiveness challenges under a reference scenario in which permits are given to emitters in lump sum. However, it finds that competiveness impacts can be minimized by using output-based recycling of permits, or by using border tax adjustments. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In the simplest version of the game, there is a single location a pool and one agent is exogenously dropped into the pool every period. Payoffs to entrants are positive as long as the number of agents in the pool is below a critical level. If an agent chooses to exit, he cannot re-enter, resulting in a future payoff of zero. Agents in the pool decide simultaneously each period whether to stay in or not. We characterize the symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium of the resulting dynamic game. We then introduce local interactions between agents that occupy neighboring pools and demonstrate that, under our payoff structure, local interaction effects are necessary and sufficient for SOC and for an associated power law to emerge. Thus, we provide an explicit game-theoretic model of the mechanism through which SOC can arise in a social context with forward looking agents. (C) 2010 Elsevier By.

In this paper I test the so called frustration-aggression hypothesis, which holds that thwarted expectations from a reference point tend to lead to violent behavior. I use unique data on hooligan violence in Sweden. I find that frustration, generated by a team's bad performance, indeed leads to unruly supporter behavior. A one-position drop in the soccer league leads to approximately 5 percent more unruly behavior by the team's supporters.

Neoclassical explanations of this phenomenon focus on rational gamblers who overbet long shots because of risk-love. The competing behavioral explanations emphasize the role of misperceptions of probabilities. We provide novel empirical tests that can discriminate between these competing theories by assessing whether the models that explain gamblers' choices in one part of their choice set (betting to win) can also rationalize decisions over a wider choice set, including compound bets in the exacta, quinella, or trifecta pools. Using a new, large-scale data set ideally suited to implement these tests, we find evidence in favor of the view that misperceptions of probability drive the favorite-long shot bias, as suggested by prospect theory.","[Snowberg, Erik] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Wolfers, Justin] Univ Penn, Ctr Econ Policy Res, Inst Study Labor, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Wolfers, Justin] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",California Institute of Technology; University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Snowberg, E (通讯作者)，CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",,,,,,,,37,137,151,1,32,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-3808,,,J POLIT ECON,J.

The average benefit increase was 15% for the first 150 days of the unemployment spell. At the same time severance pay system was abolished. In this paper we evaluate the effect of the change in the benefit structure on the duration of unemployment by comparing the changes in the re-employment hazard profiles among the unemployed who were affected by the reform to the changes in a comparison group whose benefit structure remained unchanged. We find that the change in the benefit structure reduced the re-employment hazards by on average 17%. The effect is largest at the beginning of the unemployment spell and disappears after the eligibility period for the increased benefits expires. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The occurrence of a worldwide financial market meltdown as a consequence originally stemming from of the crisis in the US subprime housing sector was only prevented by extraordinary monetary and fiscal policy measures implemented at the international level. Although the world economy seems now to be slowing recovering, it is worthwhile exploring the fragility and potentially destabilizing feedbacks of advanced macroeconomies in the context of Keynesian macro models. Fragilities and destabilizing feedback mechanisms are known to be potential features of all markets-the product markets, the labor market, and the financial markets. In this paper we focus in particular on the financial market. We use a Tobin-like macroeconomic portfolio approach, and the interaction of heterogeneous agents on the financial market to characterize the potential instability of the financial markets. Though the study of the latter has been undertaken in many partial models, we focus here on the interconnectedness of all three markets. Furthermore, we also study how labor market, fiscal and monetary policies can stabilize unstable macroeconomies. Besides other stabilizing policies we in particular propose a countercyclical monetary policy that sells assets in the boom and purchases assets in recessions. Modern stability analysis is brought to bear to demonstrate the stabilizing effects of those suggested policies.","[Proano, Christian R.] Macroecon Policy Inst IMK, D-40476 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Asada, Toichiro] Chuo Univ, Tokyo 112, Japan; [Chiarella, Carl] Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Flaschel, Peter] Univ Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany; [Mouakil, Tarik] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Semmler, Willi] New Sch Univ, New York, NY USA",Chuo University; University of Technology Sydney; University of Bielefeld; University of Cambridge; The New School,"Proaño, CR (通讯作者)，Macroecon Policy Inst IMK, Hans Bockler Str 39, D-40476 Dusseldorf, Germany.",christian.proano@gmail.com,,,,,,,23,2,2,0,13,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUL 16,2010,4.0,,,,,,,,201021,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2010-21,0.0,,,43,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,865AU,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298283700001,0

The results are robust to the potential endogeneity of program placement and individual participation. The findings suggest that for as low a cost as 3 cents per child per school day the scheme reduced the daily protein deficiency of a primary school student by 100%. the calorie deficiency by almost 30% and the daily iron deficiency by nearly 10%. At least in the short-run, therefore, the program had a substantial effect on reducing hunger at school and protein-energy malnutrition. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Sonmez (1997) showed that no stable mechanism is non-manipulable via capacities. We show that non-manipulability via capacities can be equivalently described by two types of non-manipulation via capacities: non-Type-I-manipulability meaning that no college with vacant positions can manipulate by dropping some of its empty positions; and non-Type-II-manipulability meaning that no college with no vacant positions can manipulate by dropping some of its filled positions. Our main result shows that the student-optimal stable mechanism is the unique stable mechanism which is non-Type-I-manipulable via capacities and independent of truncations.

Initially we use a unified statistical framework (cointegration and VECM) to study the data in levels. We then employ a multivariate VAR model to examine the relationship among the cyclical components of our series. The period of the study is from 1996:1 to 2008:6. Findings suggest that oil prices and the stock market exercise a positive effect on the Greek CPI, in the long run. Cyclical components analysis suggests that oil prices exercise significant negative influence to the stock market. In addition, oil prices are negatively influencing CPI, at a significant level. However, we find no effect of oil prices on industrial production and CPI. Finally, no relationship can be documented between the industrial production and stock market for the Greek market. The findings of this study are of particular interest and importance to policy makers, financial managers, financial analysts and investors dealing with the Greek economy and the Greek stock market.

Revisiting a contribution by Dehez and Fitoussi on macroeconomic fluctuations, I analyse a monetary overlapping generations small open economy in which full indexation is interpreted as the occurrence of a dynamic 'quasi-equilibrium'. In the suggested framework, the nominal wage is linked to the inflation rate by a specific indexation formula whose shape relies on unions' bargaining positions. Assuming a constant peg for the real interest rate and the superneutrality of money, I show that the economy has a unique long-run quasi-equilibrium allocation whose stability depends only on the behaviour of the monetary authority. Moreover, I show how the operating of a 'wage-aspiration effect' might lead to the persistence of involuntary unemployment.","Univ Pisa, Dept Econ, I-56126 Pisa, Italy",University of Pisa,"Guerrazzi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dept Econ, Via Serafini 3, I-56126 Pisa, Italy.",guerrazzi@ec.unipi.it,"Guerrazzi, Marco/I-1310-2019","Guerrazzi, Marco/0000-0001-7138-3983",,,,,30,2,2,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0307-3378,,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

A robust multidimensional answer,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC INEQUALITY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Poverty; Welfare; Dominance; Multidimensional; Development; Local public goods,DISTRIBUTIONS,"This paper provides a robust multidimensional normative evaluation of the growth episode that India has experienced in the last 15 years. Specifically, the paper compares the evolution, between 1987, 1995 and 2002, of the distribution of several individual attributes on the basis of ethically robust dominance criteria. The individual attributes considered are real consumption (measured at the individual level), literacy rate, under 5 mortality and violent crime rates (all measured at the district levels). District level variables are interpreted as (local) public goods which, along with consumption, contribute to individual well-being. The robust criteria used are generalizations, to more than two attributes, of the first and second order dominance criteria of Atkinson and Bourguignon (Rev Econ Stud 49:183-201, 1982) and coincide with the unanimity of utilitarian value judgements taken over a specific class of individual utility functions. The main result of the empirical analysis is that all utilitarian rankings of distributions of the four attributes that assume that individual utility functions satisfy the assumptions of second order dominance agree that India is better off in 2002 than in 1987 or 1995 but that these rankings disagree as to how to rank 1987 and 1995. Furthermore, if one removes crime from the list of attributes, the dominance is shown to apply steadily over the whole period.","[Gravel, Nicolas] Univ Mediterranee, IDEP GREQAM, Ctr Vieille Charite, F-13002 Marseille, France; [Mukhopadhyay, Abhiroop] Indian Stat Inst, Delhi Ctr, New Delhi 110016, India",Aix-Marseille Universite; Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Delhi,"Gravel, N (通讯作者)，Univ Mediterranee, IDEP GREQAM, Ctr Vieille Charite, 2 Rue Charite, F-13002 Marseille, France.",nicolas.gravel@univmed.fr; abhiroop@isid.ac.in,,,,,,,27,15,15,0,14,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

To achieve the objective, cost efficiency was estimated using the stochastic cost frontier approach assuming normal-gamma efficiency distribution model proposed by Greene (1990). The cost efficiency scores were then used in the second stage Tobit simultaneous equation regression to determine the effect of non-performing loans on bank efficiency. The results indicate that there is no significant difference in cost efficiency between banks in Singapore and Malaysia although banks in Singapore exhibit a higher average cost efficiency score. The Tobit simultaneous equation regression results clearly indicate that higher non-performing loan reduces cost efficiency. Likewise, lower cost efficiency increases non-performing loans. The result also support the hypothesis of bad management proposed by Berger and De Young (1992) that poor management in the banking institutions results in bad quality loans, and therefore, escalates the level of non-performing loans.","[Karim, Mohd Zaini Abd; Hassan, Sallahudin] Univ Utara Malaysia, Coll Art & Sci, Sintok, Malaysia; [Chan, Sok-Gee] Univ Malaya, Inst China Studies, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Utara Malaysia; Universiti Malaya,"Karim, MZA (通讯作者)，Univ Utara Malaysia, Coll Art & Sci, Sintok, Malaysia.",zaini500@uum.edu.my; sokgee@yahoo.com; din636@uum.edu.my,"Chan, Sok-Gee/B-8349-2010; Hassan, Suhaidi/F-4000-2010",,,,,,30,42,45,0,32,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

The violation of the homogeneity assumption would have two consequences. First, results based on country studies might not be applicable to other countries. Second, one should be careful when pooling cross-country data in this type of research. Data at household level from the European and World Values Survey are pooled for 25 western countries. We estimate simultaneously an income and a religion equation to correct for the endogeneity of religiousness. We find that estimation outcomes are different for low-and high-income countries: whereas church membership is found to have a positive effect on income for high-income countries, this effect is negative for low-income countries.

The study is performed using UK electricity and natural gas daily spot prices and suggests that with the aim of valuing a gas-fired power plant with and without operational flexibility, non-linear models with stochastic volatility, specifically for logarithms of electricity prices, provide better out-of-sample forecasts than both linear models and regime-switching models.

When to this one adds the saturation of some of the original markets, the consolidation of traditional coastal destinations, and changes in client preferences and habits, it is not surprising that cultural tourism is being seen as having considerable growth potential over the next few years. In this context, policy-makers have been striving to better understand the cultural tourism market by attempting to segment their clients so as to adapt their offer to the client's needs and leave the client satisfied with the experience. Unfortunately, most studies on cultural tourism segmentation have been purely psychographic. While this can help to explain attitudes, it fails to identify, access, and quantify segments, and is of little use for implementing specific strategies. The aim of the present work was to study the influence of socioeconomic and demographic variables (age, academic level, expenditure on tourism, inter alia) on the predisposition to choose cultural tourism (the culturophile tourist). To this end, we have developed a novel methodological approach and applied it to the results of a survey conducted by Andalusia's Middle Towns Initiative. The approach uses the latent variables resulting from a latent class analysis to estimate log-linear models.","[Ignacio Pulido-Fernandez, Juan] Univ Jaen, Dept Econ, Jaen 23071, Spain; [Sanchez-Rivero, Marcelino] Univ Extremadura, Dept Econ, E-06071 Badajoz, Spain",Universidad de Jaen; Universidad de Extremadura,"Pulido-Fernández, JI (通讯作者)，Univ Jaen, Dept Econ, Campus Lagunillas S-N, Jaen 23071, Spain.",jipulido@ujaen.es,"Sánchez Rivero, Marcelino/F-3862-2016","Pulido-Fernandez, Juan Ignacio/0000-0002-9019-726X; SANCHEZ-RIVERO, MARCELINO/0000-0003-3988-6278",,,,,104,69,70,3,37,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

Sardoni takes issue with the identification by Trigg, in a 2006 publication, of a role for the Keynesian investment multiplier in Marx's schemes of reproduction. Indirectly, Sardoni also expresses his disagreement with Hartwig (by attributing one of his statements to Trigg). We appreciate the opportunity to defend our view against Sardoni's critique. This reply shows that a bridging point between Marx and Keynes can be established without recourse to microfoundations. As suggested by both Trigg, in 2006, and Hartwig, in 2004, the well known Harrod-Domar model of economic growth provides an interpretation of Marx's reproduction schemes that has the Keynesian multiplier as a constituent element. This note will further explore the assumptions underlying the interface between Marx and Keynes, in response to the challenging questions raised in Sardoni's contribution.","[Trigg, Andrew B.] Open Univ, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England; ETH, Swiss Econ Inst, Zurich, Switzerland",Open University - UK; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Trigg, AB (通讯作者)，Open Univ, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England.",,,"Hartwig, Jochen/0000-0002-8138-5920",,,,,14,0,0,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We develop a model of multi-armed contests and axiomatize its contest success function. We then analyze the outcomes of the multi-armed contest and the effects of allowing or restricting arms. Restricting an arm increases total effort directed to other arms if and only if restricting the arm balances the contest. Restricting an arm tends to reduce rent dissipation because it reduces the discriminatory power of the contest. But it also tends to increase rent dissipation if it balances the contest. Less rent is dissipated if an arm is restricted as long as no player is excessively stronger than the other with that arm. If players are sufficiently symmetric in an arm, both players are better off if that arm is restricted. Nevertheless, players cannot agree to restrict the arm if their costs of using the arm are sufficiently low.","[Arbatskaya, Maria; Mialon, Hugo M.] Emory Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",Emory University,"Mialon, HM (通讯作者)，Emory Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",marbats@emory.edu; hmialon@emory.edu,,,,,,,33,39,42,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

We conduct a counterfactual experiment in order to isolate the effect of worker mobility on state-level redistributive policies. We find that migration has induced substantial convergence in tax rates across U.S. states, but no race to the bottom. interestingly, the degree of convergence has been much lower for transfers due to an offsetting tax-base effect.

Specifically, why is it that car rental companies do not offer customers the option of renting older cars at a discount, instead of offering only relatively new cars at full price? We also tackle a related puzzle: why do car rental companies trade-in their vehicles so early? Most US companies purchase brand new rental cars and replace them after 2 years or when their odometer exceeds 34,000 km. That is a very costly strategy due to the well-known by rapid depreciation in used car prices. We show that in a competitive rental market, prices are a declining function of odometer and cars are rented over their full economic lifespan. Our solution to these puzzles is that actual rental markets are not fully competitive and firms may be behaving suboptimally. We provide a case study of a large car rental company that provided us access to its operating data. We develop a model of the company's operations that predicts that the company can significantly increase its profits by keeping its rental cars twice as long as it currently does, discounting the rental prices of older vehicles to induce its customers to rent them. The company undertook an experiment to test our model's predictions. We report initial findings from this experiment which involved over 4500 rentals of over 500 cars in 4 locations over a 5-month period. The results are consistent with the predictions of our model, and suggest that a properly chosen declining rental price function can increase overall revenues. Profits also increase significantly, since doubling the holding period of rental cars cuts discounted replacement costs by nearly 40%.","[Cho, Sungjin] Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Rust, John] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Seoul National University (SNU); University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Cho, S (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",,,,,,,,15,22,28,0,23,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

We employ a model in which the ratios of currency to deposits and currency to reserves are endogenously determined. The model distinguishes quantitatively between three sources of welfare cost of inflation, and provides further estimates for potential welfare gains from improvements in transaction technologies. Estimates of the marginal cost of public funds associated with the inflation tax are compared both with that of labor taxation within the model and with those reported in the public finance and macro literature. We conclude that not only is inflation an inefficient source of government revenue, but also that, in the absence of lump-sum taxation, deflationary policies may be highly inefficient.

This situation was well known to policy-makers but it was hoped that financial crises would wait until policy integration occurred. The reality turned out differently, however. We assess the management of the 2007--2009 banking crisis within the EU against this backdrop. In a nutshell, we find that Europe has done better than could have been expected on the basis of existing arrangements. The two federal institutions acted swiftly, the European Central Bank by providing ample liquidity and the European Commission by enforcing competition discipline flexibly. However, there was no institutional innovation in the form of an EU-financed bail-out of transnational financial institutions or a genuine EU financial stress test. Supervisory responsibilities remained entirely with individual countries and coordination problems were managed through a combination of ad-hoc, discretionary cooperation and reliance on EU rules and procedures. It is not possible, however, to determine whether this relatively satisfactory situation is due to the fact that ad-hoc coordination was fundamentally sufficient or because no complex case of cross-border bank failure occurred. --- Jean Pisani-Ferry and Andre Sapir.","[Pisani-Ferry, Jean] Univ Paris 09, F-75775 Paris 16, France; Univ Libre Bruxelles, Bruegel, Belgium",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Pisani-Ferry, J (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",,"Sapir, Andre/IAS-0343-2023","Sapir, Andre/0000-0001-6493-0352",,,,,33,37,37,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

Levin and Williams confirm the existence of robust rules across competing closed economy models. In this paper, we evaluate three small open economy models exhibiting different degrees of inflation and output gap persistence. We find that the above result does not carry over to the open economy, primarily due to the mutually exclusive degree of interest rate smoothing that yields stability in the three models. We also confirm the existence of robust rules across the closed economy versions of these models. Finally, a first difference rule, though yields dynamic stability across the open economy models, continues to perform poorly in at least one of the models. Thus, the cost of choosing the wrong model is extremely high in open economies compared to closed economies, and policymakers must invest more resources to know the true structure of these economies.","Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Ctr Int Trade & Dev, New Delhi 110067, India","Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi","Sen Gupta, A (通讯作者)，Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Ctr Int Trade & Dev, New Delhi 110067, India.",abhijit@mail.jnu.ac.in,,"Sen Gupta, Abhijit/0000-0003-3689-2189",,,,,31,0,0,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

While Leamer's suggested remedy, sensitivity analysis, has played a role in this, we argue that the primary engine driving improvement has been a focus on the quality of empirical research designs. The advantages of a good research design are perhaps most easily apparent in research using random assignment. We begin with an overview of Leamer's 1983 critique and his proposed remedies. We then turn to the key factors we see contributing to improved empirical work, including the availability of more and better data, along with advances in theoretical econometric understanding, but especially the fact that research design has moved front and center in much of empirical micro. We offer a brief digression into macroeconomics and industrial organization, where progress - by our lights - is less dramatic, although there is work in both fields that we find encouraging. Finally, we discuss the view that the design pendulum has swung too far. Critics of design-driven studies argue that in pursuit of clean and credible research designs, researchers seek good answers instead of good questions. We briefly respond to this concern, which worries us little.","[Angrist, Joshua D.] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Pischke, Joern-Steffen] London Sch Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Angrist, JD (通讯作者)，MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",angrist@mit.edu; s.pischke@lse.ac.uk,"Angrist, Josh/ADL-8782-2022","Pischke, Jorn-Steffen/0000-0002-6466-1874",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,129,729,825,4,180,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We show that when unlicensed spectrum is assigned to all competing users during periods of excess demand an inefficient outcome related to the Tragedy of the Commons is likely to result. This inefficiency can be substantially reduced when the assignment of users to unlicensed spectrum is based on the bandwidth and latency tolerance needs of the competing users. Further efficiency gains can also occur when users are required to bid to have their unlicensed spectrum needs met in the presence of congestion. The paper also examines the merits of creating an auction based market in which firms providing spectrum based services to users bid to have their spectrum regime needs satisfied. The objective of this approach is to reduce the incentive that service operators have to misstate their expressed value for a given license regime. The efficiency of this approach is based in large part on the auction mechanism's ability to solve a collective action problem in which firms desiring unlicensed spectrum have an incentive to free-ride on the bidding behavior of other unlicensed firms. Together our results open up the possibility that a wide variety of spectrum policy issues may be efficiently solved using a market-based approach. They further suggest that there may be a hybrid regime that combines the best features of the license and unlicensed regimes and, thus, lead to a more efficient use of spectrum at any moment in time.

In the theoretical part, we develop an endogenous growth model with formal and informal sectors to analyse the effect of the public external debt on the production efficiency. We show that an increase of the public external debt share increases the production efficiency through a positive externality effect. However, it generates an opposite effect via the reduction of the formal sector's size in favour of a less efficient informal sector. The resultant effect becomes negative beyond an optimal level. Besides, we show that a large stock of public external debt reduces the production efficiency when it leads to a tight fiscal policy which reduces the formal sector size. Empirically, using a stochastic frontier technique with unobserved heterogeneity, for a panel of 27 developing countries for the period of 1970-2005, we confirm that the turning point associated to the effect of the share external public debt is apparent at 84%.

This implies that switching from a relatively unstable form of income to a stable one motivates consumption. This article explores this implication by quantifying and comparing the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of private income and income from a public pension scheme. It exploits the introduction of a public pension that provides a monthly fixed amount of payment - a relatively secure source of income. The results suggest that the provision of pension leads to a higher MPC for the beneficiaries' households, and the estimated MPC out of the pension income is significantly larger than the corresponding estimate for private income. Further examination suggests that households facing more non-tradable risks appear to be more prudent on consumption, highlighting the role of income uncertainty in households' consumption decisions.","Australian Natl Univ, Social Policy Evaluat Anal & Res Ctr, Res Sch Social Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Fan, E (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Social Policy Evaluat Anal & Res Ctr, Res Sch Social Sci, Coombs Bldg 9,Fellows Rd, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",elliott.fan@anu.edu.au,"Fan, Elliott/AAO-6499-2020","Fan, Elliott/0000-0002-2511-2581",,,,,16,2,2,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

We use differences in student mark across subjects to identify within-pupil variation in achievement and find that union membership of the teacher is associated with reduced pupil achievement. We find no evidence this could be due to the unobservables not controlled for by this procedure. A school fixed effects equation of teacher pay shows that union membership raises pay and in this case too we find that remaining unobservables are unlikely to explain this outcome. We discuss the policy implications of the findings and show that the effectiveness of teacher credentials in improving teacher performance is linked to unionization. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this introduction is to show how ideas from the familiar theory of preference aggregation can be extended to this more general case.

East Asia has long been said to be the champion of loose regional economic integration, with deepening intra-regional trade and investment linkages in the absence of any formal cooperative scheme. However, an oft-heard claim is that East Asia has been shifting recently towards an institution-based form of regional economic cooperation, primarily as a result of the 1997-98 financial crisis. Next to post-crisis financial cooperative schemes under the ASEAN+3, the surge of Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) involving East Asian countries is thought by some to further substantiate this claim. The objective of the paper is twofold; first, to assess the validity of the aforementioned claim; and second, to examine the links between de facto and de jure economic integration in East Asia compared to other regions of the world. In the process, the sequencing between trade and monetary cooperation is also addressed. The paper starts by providing a candid assessment of the current state of play of economic cooperation in East Asia (de jure integration), both from the trade and the financial/monetary perspective, and highlights the limitations of the formal regional integration movement in East Asia to date. As a next step, it explores the changing nature of intra-regional trade and investment linkages, contrasts it to the situation in other parts of the world such as Europe and examines to what extent this new form of interdependence may be instrumental in making formal regional economic schemes more attractive. A major conclusion is that de facto trade integration may not automatically lead to deeper regional trade cooperation de jure and that its impact is likely to be stronger on monetary cooperation projects.","French Inst Int Relat, F-75740 Paris 15, France",,"Nicolas, F (通讯作者)，French Inst Int Relat, 27 Rue Procession, F-75740 Paris 15, France.",nicolas@ifri.org,,"NICOLAS, Francoise/0000-0002-2419-8440",,,,,36,5,5,0,21,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

However, there are a number of reasons why regulators may choose to inspect many sites in a particular geographic area at one time. If the probability a site is inspected also depends on its compliance behavior, the expected payoff from choosing to violate will depend upon the compliance decisions of neighboring sites, creating a game of strategic interdependence between firms. In this paper, we use a dataset of inspections at petroleum storage sites in Manitoba between 1981 and 1998 to consider to what extent inspections are spatially correlated and whether inspection probabilities are a function of the inspection and violation history of the site and its neighbors. Further, we examine to what extent firms take into account whether their neighbors have been previously found in violation in determining compliance.","[Eckert, Heather; Eckert, Andrew] Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H4, Canada",University of Alberta,"Eckert, H (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H4, Canada.",heckert@ualberta.ca; aeckert@ualberta.ca,,,,,,,27,5,8,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

In particular, this paper focuses on institutions associated with high levels of corruption and examines the conditions under which such institutions could serve the interests of a dictatorship. Developing such a model requires that we pose alternative institutions that dictators can choose to extract rents. Using this framework, this paper builds a model providing a theoretical basis for some stylized facts about the observed cross-country variation in corruption levels. Specifically, the model motivates a rationale for the finding that higher levels of corruption are observed in countries characterized as having more heterogeneous populations, longer expected dictator tenure, and more severe punishment norms.
