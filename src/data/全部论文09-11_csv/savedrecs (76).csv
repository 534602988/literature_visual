This study addressed this through construction of a short HRQoL measure, the Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL)-8 from the original AQoL. Methods: Data from the AQoL validation database (N = 996) were reanalyzed using item response theory (IRT) to identify the least fitting items, which were removed. The standard AQoL scoring algorithm and weights were applied. Validity, reliability, and sensitivity tests were carried out using the 2004 South Australian Health Omnibus Survey (N = 3015), including direct comparisons with other short utility measures, the EQ5D and SF6D. Results: The IRT analysis showed that the AQoL was a weak scale (Loevinger H = 0.36) but reliable (Mokken rho = 0.84). Removal of the four weakest items led to an 8-item instrument with two items per subscale, the AQoL-8. The AQoL-8 Loevinger H = 0.38 and Mokken rho = 0.80 suggested similar psychometric properties to the AQoL. It correlated (intraclass correlation coefficient) 0.95 (or 90% of shared variance) with the AQoL. The AQoL-8 was as sensitive to six common health conditions as the AQoL, EQ5D, and SF6D. Conclusions: The utility scores fall on the same life-death scale as those of the AQoL. Where parsimony is imperative, researchers may consider use of the AQoL-8 to collect participant self-report HRQoL data that is suitable for use either as reported outcomes or for the calculation of quality-adjusted life-years for cost-utility analysis.","[Hawthorne, Graeme] Univ Melbourne, Dept Psychiat, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Hawthorne, G (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Melbourne, Dept Psychiat, Royal Melbourne Hosp, Level 1 N,Grattan St, Parkville, Vic 3050, Australia.",graemeeh@unimelb.edu.au,,,"Northern Health, Victoria, Australia","Northern Health, Victoria, Australia","This study was supported by a grant from Northern Health, Victoria, Australia.",,61,35,38,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2009,12.0,6,,,,,948,957,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00526.x,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,474SP,19490558.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000268304600013,0

Methods: Questionnaire development included item representation from the reviewed literature, focus groups, and pretesting. Dimensions related to treatment satisfaction were identified with exploratory factor analysis, verified with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and tested with structural equation modeling. Results: A total of 31,988 email invitations were disseminated to obtain 311 qualified respondents with diagnoses for chronic constipation and IBS-c using ROME II criteria, which required that two of the following symptoms: fewer than 3 bowel movements per week, hard or lumpy stools, straining with defecation, and a sensation of incomplete evacuation, a sensation of anorectal obstruction, and the use of manual maneuvers to assist defecation be present 25% of the time during the last year. Approximately 84% of the sample was female. Item-to-total correlations were 0.66 for activities, ranged from 0.60 to 0.67 for expectations, from 0.59 to 0.69 for value, from 0.56 to 0.60 for effectiveness, and 0.68 to 0.79 for treatment satisfaction. All standardized parameter estimates from CFA were significant (P < 0.01). The chi-square was 46.98, df = 41, P = 0.241, comparative fit index = 0.996, Tucker-Lewis Index = 0.994, root mean square error of approximation = 0.022, indicating an excellent fit between the sample data and proposed model. Treatment satisfaction was a strong and significant predictor of effectiveness, activities, and value (P < 0.001). Conclusions: The CTSAT-Q was demonstrated to be reliable and valid, and appears to assess treatment satisfaction for patients with chronic constipation and patients with IBS-c.","[Szeinbach, Sheryl L.] Ohio State Univ, Coll Pharm, Div Pharm Practice & Adm, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Baran, Robert W.] Takeda Pharmaceut N Amer Inc, Deerfield, IL USA; [Bratten, Jason; Jones, Michael P.] Northwestern Univ, Div Gastroenterol, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine,"Szeinbach, SL (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåOhio State Univ, Coll Pharm, Div Pharm Practice & Adm, 500 W 12th Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",szeinbach.1@osu.edu,"Jones, Michael/A-9013-2013",,"Takeda Pharmaceuticals North America, Inc., Deerfield, Illinois 60015 USA","Takeda Pharmaceuticals North America, Inc., Deerfield, Illinois 60015 USA(Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd)","Support for this research was provided by an unrestricted grant from Takeda Pharmaceuticals North America, Inc., Deerfield, Illinois 60015 USA.",,34,12,12,1,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2009,12.0,6,,,,,1004,1010,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00533.x,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,474SP,19490553.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000268304600019,0

The worth of a coalition of players is the total Cournot profit of the active firms within this coalition. The number of firms that a coalition activates is determined by the Nash equilibrium of the game played by the coalition and its complement, where the strategy of each is the number of firms to be activated. Only firms in a coalition containing the patent holder are allowed to use the new technology. We prove that when the industry size increases indefinitely, the Shapley value of the patent holder approximates the payoff he obtains in a standard non-cooperative setup where he has the entire bargaining power. We also examine a partition game which considers for every coalition all structures of its complement, namely all partitions of the complement into sub-coalitions. The coalition and every sub-coalition of the complement simultaneously decide how many of their firms to be activated. We prove a similar equivalence result for an extension of the Shapley value from coalitional games to partition games. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: We analyzed the Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2005, a nationally representative probability sample that includes nearly 8 million inpatient records from US community hospitals. Results: During the past decade, the obesity among inpatients has steeply increased. In 2005, nearly 1.87 million hospitalizations were made by obese or morbidly obese patients. Both patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes were considerably more likely to be obese or morbidly obese compared with inpatients without diabetes (P < 0.01). The proportions of hospitalizations with obese or morbidly obese conditions were 4.5% among patients without diabetes, 6.5% among patients with type 1, and 12.2% among patients with type 2 diabetes. The hospital charges for obese and morbidly obese patients were 6.1% (P < 0.01) and 18.7% (P < 0.01) higher than that of the nonobese patients when diabetes status, sex, age, race, hospital admission type, and length of hospital stays were the same. Conclusions: Following a parallel rise in obesity among the general population, hospital admissions of obese and morbidly obese inpatients are continuously increasing. Morbidly obese patients consumed substantially more hospital resources regardless of the presence or type of diabetes. Under the current price-per-case reimbursement system, additional hospital resource use by this growing number of morbidly obese inpatients could be a burden to hospital financial systems.","[Kim, Sunny] Florida Int Univ, Stempel Sch Publ Hlth, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Boye, Kristina S.] Eli Lilly & Co, Global Hlth Outcomes, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University; Eli Lilly,"Kim, S (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåFlorida Int Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, HLS 575,11200 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",skim@fiu.edu,,,Eli Lilly and Company,Eli Lilly and Company(Eli Lilly),"Source of financial support: Sunny Kim is a paid consultant to Eli Lilly and Company, and Kristina S.

We use a rich data set on household grain consumption in 2003 from the market research institute GfK Sweden, combined with information oil the nutritional content of the consumption. We estimate behavioral parameters, which are used to simulate the impact on the average household of tax reforms entailing either a Subsidy oil commodities particularly rich in Fiber or a subsidy of the fiber density in grain products. Our results suggest that to direct the fiber intake towards nutritional recommendations, reforms with a substantial impact on consumer prices are required. Regardless of the type of subsidy implemented, the increase in the intake of Fiber is accompanied by unwanted increases in nutrients that are often overconsumed: far, salt and sugar Funding the subsidies by taxing these nutrients, or less healthy commodities, helps to counteract such developments.

We use a stochastic agent-based model to simulate pandemic influenza in the community. We compare 17 strategies: targeted antiviral prophylaxis (TAP) alone and in combination with school closure as well as prevaccination. In the absence of intervention, we predict a 50% attack rate with an economic impact of $187 per capita as loss to society. Full TAP (FTAP) is the most effective single strategy, reducing number of cases by 54% at the lowest cost to society ($127 per capita). Prevaccination reduces number of cases by 48% and is the second least costly alternative ($140 per capita). Adding school closure to FTAP or prevaccination further improves health outcomes but increases total cost to society by approximately $2700 per capita. FTAP is an effective and cost-saving measure for mitigating pandemic influenza.","[Sander, Beate] Univ Hlth Network, Div Clin Decis Making & Hlth Care Res, Toronto, ON M5G 2C4, Canada; [Sander, Beate] Univ Toronto, Dept Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Sander, Beate] Univ Toronto, THETA Toronto Hlth Econ & Technol Assessment Coll, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Nizam, Azhar] Emory Univ, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Garrison, Louis P., Jr.; Halloran, M.

A total of 893 patients were enrolled in a prospective cross-sectional multicenter study. In addition to demographic and clinical data, health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) data were collected using the disease-specific Moorehead-Ardelt II questionnaire (MA-II) and two generic questionnaires, the EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D) and the Short Form-6D (SF-6D). Multiple regression models were constructed to predict EQ-5D- and SF-6D-based utility values from MA-II scores and additional demographic variables. The mean body mass index was 39.4, and 591 patients (66%) had already undergone surgery. The average EQ-5D and SF-6D scores were 0.830 and 0.699. The MA-IIwas correlated to both utility measures (Spearman's r = 0.677 and 0.741). Goodness-of-fit was highest (R-2 = 0.55 in the validation sample) for the following item-based transformation algorithm: utility (MA-II-based) = 0.4293 + (0.0336 x MA1) + (0.0071 x MA2) + (0.0053 x MA3) + (0.0107 x MA4) + (0.0001 x MA5). This EQ-5D-based mapping algorithm outperformed a similar SF-6D-based algorithm in terms of mean absolute percentage error (P = 0.045). Because the mapping algorithm estimated utilities with only minor errors, it appears to be a valid method for calculating health state values in cost-utility analyses. The algorithm will help to define the role of bariatric surgery in morbid obesity.","[Sauerland, Stefan] Univ Witten Herdecke, Inst Res Operat Med, D-51109 Cologne, Germany; [Weiner, Sylvia] Krankenhaus Sachsenhausen, Chirurg Abt, Frankfurt, Germany; [Dolezalova, Karin] Ctr Miniinvazivni Chirurg, Kli Ctr Iscare, Prague, Czech Republic; [Angrisani, Luigi] Osped S Giovanni Bosco, Chirurg Gen Endoscop, Naples, Italy; [Masdevall Noguera, Carlos] Hosp Univ Bellvitge, Dept Cirugia, Barcelona, Spain; [Garcia-Caballero, Manuel] Hosp Univ Malaga, Dept Cirugia, Malaga, Spain; [Rupprecht, Frederic; Immenroth, Marc] Ethicon Endosurg Europe GmbH, Norderstedt, Germany",Witten Herdecke University; Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL); Bellvitge University Hospital; University of Barcelona; Johnson & Johnson,"Sauerland, S (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Witten Herdecke, Inst Res Operat Med, Ostmerheimer Str 200, D-51109 Cologne, Germany.",stefan.sauerland@ifom-uni-wh.de,,"Dolezalova, Karin/0000-0002-9775-4866; Sauerland, Stefan/0000-0003-1048-796X","Ethicon Endo-Surgery (Europe), GmbH","Ethicon Endo-Surgery (Europe), GmbH","Source of financial support: This study was funded by Ethicon Endo-Surgery (Europe), GmbH.

Parcels of such land are actively transferred to new owners, get subdivided, partitioned or otherwise reshaped. Due to the land management activities that involve changing of prime land use, agriculture loses similar to 2 thous. ha of land used for farming each year. Article gives suggestions on how the legal acts must facilitate rational forming of land tenures for farms, straiten decomposition and diminishing of arable land plots, and protect productive agricultural areas from their self-afforestation or from turning them into residential areas. Land management issues also involve regulation of rational land use. In 2005, about 650 thous. ha of agricultural land in Lithuania was not used for agricultural production, and part of land for meadows, pastures and perennial grass was used extensively.

The aim of the study is to design and evaluate a medication adherence scale suitable for use across levels of patient literacy. The Adherence to Refills and Medications scale (ARMS) was developed, pilot tested, and administered to 435 patients with coronary heart disease in an inner-city primary care clinic. Psychometric evaluation performed overall and by literacy level, included an assessment of internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and factor analysis. Criterion-related validity was evaluated by comparing scores with Morisky's self-reported measure of adherence, medication refill adherence, and blood pressure measurements. Lexile analysis was performed to assess the reading difficulty of the instrument. The final 12-item scale had high internal consistency overall (Cronbach's alpha = 0.814) and among patients with inadequate (alpha = 0.792) or marginal/adequate literacy skills (alpha = 0.828). Factor analysis yielded two subscales, which pertained to taking medications as prescribed and refilling medications on schedule. The ARMS correlated significantly with the Morisky adherence scale (Spearman's rho = -0.651, P < 0.01), and it correlated more strongly with measures of refill adherence than did the Morisky scale. Patients with low ARMS scores (which indicated better adherence) were significantly more likely to have controlled diastolic blood pressure (P < 0.05), and tended to have better systolic blood pressure control. Lexile analysis demonstrated that the instrument had a favorable reading difficulty level below the eight grade. The ARMS is a valid and reliable medication adherence scale when used in a chronic disease population, with good performance characteristics even among low-literacy patients.","[Kripalani, Sunil] Vanderbilt Univ, Sect Hosp Med, Div Gen Internal Med & Publ Hlth, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Risser, Jessica] Brown Univ, Warren Alpert Med Sch, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Gatti, Margaret E.] Georgetown Univ, Sch Med, Washington, DC USA; [Jacobson, Terry A.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Atlanta, GA USA",Vanderbilt University; Brown University; Georgetown University; Emory University,"Kripalani, S (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåVanderbilt Univ, Sect Hosp Med, Div Gen Internal Med & Publ Hlth, 1215 21st Ave S,Suite 6000 MCE, Nashville, TN 37232 USA.",sunil.kripalani@vanderbilt.edu,"Jacobson, Terry/AAK-4757-2020","Jacobson, Terry/0000-0002-9926-2179",American Heart Association.,American Heart Association.(American Heart Association),Source of financial support: Supported by a grant from the American Heart Association.,,34,259,292,3,27,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2009,12.0,1,,,,,118,123,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00400.x,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,397XX,19911444.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000262696800018,0

This paper exploits option games approach to examine the impact of operating costs and technological innovations on firms' strategic irreversible investment decisions. In the model, the irreversible investment in adoption of the existing new technology is in strategic competitive circumstances and facing the arrival of a further new technology after the competition setting is established, which the further new technology can reduce operating costs. The study shows that the rapid technological innovation encourages the follower's investment and discourages the leader's investment, when the operating cost reduction is greater enough and the investment cost is lower enough of the further new technology. However, the case is the opposite when the operating cost reduction isn't greater enough and the investment cost isn't lower enough of the further new technology. The higher operating cost and the larger investment cost of the existing new technology, the lower cost reduction and the larger investment cost of the further new technology, the greater volatility of the market demand, and the greater first-mover advantage delay the follower's investment, instead, hasten the leader's investment. Comparing with the optimal timing without the adoption of the further new technology, the firm delays its investment when no firm has invested; however, once one firm has invested first, the firm will hasten to invest, when the operating cost reduction is greater enough and the investment cost is lower enough of the further new technology.","[Liu, Xianghua] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Xinhua Sch Finance & Insurance, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China",Zhongnan University of Economics & Law,,xhliu99@tom.tom,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,ALFRED UNIV,ALFRED,"ONE SAXON DR, ALFRED, NY 14802 USA",,,978-0-9800510-2-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,830,837,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science,BJZ06,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000267479300129,0

From an evaluation of 45 social networking sites using 260 criteria we find that many popular assumptions regarding privacy and social networking need to be revisited when considering the entire ecosystem instead of only a handful of well-known sites. Contrary to the common perception of an oligopolistic market, we find evidence of vigorous competition for new users. Despite observing many poor security practices, there is evidence that social network providers are making efforts to implement privacy enhancing technologies with substantial diversity in the amount of privacy control offered. However, privacy is rarely used as a selling point, even then only as auxiliary, non-decisive feature. Sites also failed to promote their existing privacy controls within the site. We similarly found great diversity in the length and content of formal privacy policies, but found an opposite promotional trend: though almost all policies are not accessible to ordinary users due to obfuscating legal jargon, they conspicuously vaunt the sites' privacy practices. We conclude that the market for privacy in social networks is dysfunctional in that there is significant variation in sites' privacy controls, data collection requirements, and legal privacy policies, but this is not effectively conveyed to users. Our empirical findings motivate us to introduce the novel model of a privacy communication game, where the economically rational choice for a site operator is to make privacy control available to evade criticism from privacy fundamentalists, while hiding the privacy control interface and privacy policy to maximize sign-up numbers and encourage data sharing from the pragmatic majority of users.","[Bonneau, Joseph; Preibusch, Soeren] Univ Cambridge, Comp Lab, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge,,jcb82@cl.cam.ac.uk; sdp36@cl.cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,89,43,50,1,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4419-6966-8,,,,2010,,,,,,,121,167,,10.1007/978-1-4419-6967-5_8,0.0,,,47,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BQI69,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281125700008,0

We propose, contrast and compare three metrics for measuring the price of uncertainty due to the departure from the payoff-optimal security outcomes under complete information. Per the analogy with other efficiency metrics, such as the price of anarchy, we define the price of uncertainty as the maximum discrepancy in expected payoff in a complete information environment versus the payoff in an incomplete information environment. We consider difference, payoff-ratio, and cost-ratio metrics as canonical nontrivial measurements of the price of uncertainty. We conduct an algebraic, numerical, and graphical analysis of these metrics applied to different well-studied security scenarios proposed in prior work (i.e., best shot, weakest-link, and total effort). In these scenarios, we study how a fully rational expert agent could utilize the metrics to decide whether to gather information about the economic incentives of multiple nearsighted and naive agents.

Even though many security managers are skeptical about outsourcing of IT security, others have cited reasons that are used for outsourcing of traditional IT functions for why security outsourcing is likely to increase. Our research offers a novel explanation, based on competitive externalities associated with IT security, for firms' decisions to outsource IT security. We show that if competitive externalities are ignored, then a firm will outsource security if and only if the MSSP offers a quality (or a cost) advantage over in-house operations, which is consistent with the traditional explanation for security outsourcing. However, a higher quality is neither a prerequisite nor a guarantee for a firm to outsource security. The competitive risk environment and the nature of the security function outsourced, in addition to quality, determine firms' outsourcing decisions. If the reward from the competitor's breach is higher than the loss from own breach, then even if the likelihood of a breach is higher under the MSSP the expected benefit from the competitive demand externality may offset the loss from the higher likelihood of breaches, resulting in one or both firms outsourcing security. The incentive to outsource security monitoring is higher than that of infrastructure management because the MSSP can reduce the likelihood of breach on both firms and thus enhance the demand externality effect. The incentive to outsource security monitoring (infrastructure management) is higher (lower) if either the likelihood of breach on both firms is lower (higher) when security is outsourced or the benefit (relative to loss) from the externality is higher (lower).

In particular the IRC markets for stolen identities, phishing kits, botnets, and cybercrime related services have been extensively studied. It is suggested that sophisticated underground markets show great specialization and maturity. There are complex divisions of labor and service offerings for every need. Stolen credentials are traded in bulk for pennies on the dollar. It is suggested that large sums move on these markets. We argue that this makes very little sense. Using basic arguments from economics we show that the IRC markets studied represent classic examples of lemon markets. The ever-present rippers who cheat other participants ensure that the market cannot operate effectively. Their presence represents a tax on every transaction conducted in the market. Those who form gangs and alliances avoid this tax, enjoy a lower cost basis and higher profit. This suggests a two tier underground economy where organization is the route to profit. The IRC markets appear to be the lower tier, and are occupied by those without skills or alliances, newcomers, and those who seek to cheat them. The goods offered for sale there are those that are easy to acquire, but hard to monetize. We find that estimates of the size of the IRC markets are greatly exaggerated. Finally, we find that defenders recruit their own opponents by publicizing exaggerated estimates of the rewards of cybercrime. Those so recruited inhabit the lower tier; they produce very little profit, but contribute greatly to the externalities of cybercrime.","[Herley, Cormac; Florencio, Dinei] Microsoft Res, Redmond, WA USA",Microsoft,,cormac@microsoft.com; dinei@microsoft.com,,,,,,,32,56,68,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4419-6966-8,,,,2010,,,,,,,33,53,,10.1007/978-1-4419-6967-5_3,0.0,,,21,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BQI69,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281125700003,0

Since this is essentially 'free', yet impacts the cost and stability of every router in the world, this is a classic 'tragedy of the commons'. There is little prospect of change in the IPv4 world, but there is a chance to fix the problem as IPv6 is rolled out. Unfortunately, SHIM6, the engineering solution chosen to solve this issue in IPv6, will only be effective if universally adopted, and there are no short-term incentives to prefer SHIM6 over a duplication of the IPv4 arrangements. Incentives could be artificially introduced by requiring payment for adding multi-homed address space to the global routing table-a naive estimate of the actual cost being $77 000 per routing prefix.

For this purpose, the development of a data subject's personal attributes over time and the development of the attribute distribution in the population are modeled as two stochastic processes, which fit into the Binomial Option Pricing Model (BOPM).

First of all, according to previous studies, we come to the definition and features of breakthrough technological innovation, compared to incremental innovation. Moreover, combined with internal and external environment and the characteristics of breakthrough technological innovation, the risk components of breakthrough technological innovation are divided into six categories. Third, in response to these risk factors, we analyze five areas, such as attitude of decision makers towards risk, enterprise's structure, information management systems, market strategy, and motivation mechanisms of staff.

In our model, a user's probability to incur damage (from being attacked) depends on both his security and the network security, with the latter taken by individual users as given. First, we consider cyber-insurers who cannot observe (and thus, affect) individual user security. This asymmetric information causes moral hazard. Then, for most parameters, no equilibrium exists: the insurance market is missing. Even if an equilibrium exists, the insurance contract covers only a minor fraction of the damage; network security worsens relative to the no-insurance equilibrium. Second, we consider insurers with perfect information about their users' security. Here, user security is perfectly enforceable (zero cost); each insurance contract stipulates the required user security. The unique equilibrium contract covers the entire user damage. Still, for most parameters, network security worsens relative to the no-insurance equilibrium.

Appropriate regulation of identity in a ubiquitous information environment is seen as one of the major drivers of the future Internet economy. Regulation of personal identity data has come to the fore including mapping conducted on digital personhood by the OECD; work on human rights and profiling by the Council of Europe and major studies by the European Commission with regard to self-regulation in the privacy market, electronic identity technical interoperability and enhanced safety for young people. These domains overlap onto an increasingly complex model of regulation of individuals' identity management, online and offline. This chapter argues that policy makers struggle to deal with issues concerning electronic identity, due to the apparently irrational and unpredictable behavior of users when engaging in online interactions involving identity management. Building on empirical survey evidence from four EU countries, we examine the first aspect in detail citizens' management of identity in a digital environment. We build on data from a large scale (n = 5,265) online survey of attitudes to electronic identity among young Europeans (France, Germany, Spain, UK) conducted in August 2008. The survey asked questions about perceptions and acceptance of risks, general motivations, attitudes and behaviors concerning electronic identity. Four behavioral paradoxes are identified in the analysis: a privacy paradox (to date well known), but also a control paradox, a responsibility paradox and an awareness paradox. The chapter then examines the paradoxes in relation of three main policy dilemmas framing the debate on digital identity. The paper concludes by arguing for an expanded identity debate spanning policy circles and the engineering community.",,,,Ramon.compano@ec.europa.eu; Wainer.lusoli@ec.europa.eu,"Jia, Chuanchang/AAA-5513-2020",,,,,,21,17,18,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4419-6966-8,,,,2010,,,,,,,169,185,,10.1007/978-1-4419-6967-5_9,0.0,,,17,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BQI69,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281125700009,0

We suggest that an understanding of the true cost of additional policies to control insider threats, and the dynamic nature of potential insider threats together help explain why this observed behavior is economically rational. This conclusion also suggests that further work needs to be done to understand how better to change underlying motivations of insiders, rather than simply focus on controlling and monitoring their behavior.","[Probst, Christian W.] Tech Univ Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark,,probst@imm.dtu.dk; hunker@jeffreyhunker.com,,,,,,,21,2,3,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4419-6966-8,,,,2010,,,,,,,279,+,,10.1007/978-1-4419-6967-5_14,0.0,,,3,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BQI69,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281125700014,0

This is commonly interpreted to mean preventing online sabotage against utilities such as electricity, oil and gas, water, and sewage including pipelines, refineries, generators, storage depots and transport facilities such as tankers and terminals. A consensus is emerging that the protection of such assets is more a matter of business models and regulation in short, of security economics than of technology. We describe the problems, and the state of play, in this paper. Industrial control systems operate in a different world from systems previously studied by security economists; we find the same issues (lock-in, externalities, asymmetric information and so on) but in different forms. Lock-in is physical, rather than based on network effects, while the most serious externalities result from correlated failure, whether from cascade failures, common-mode failures or simultaneous attacks. There is also an interesting natural experiment happening, in that the USA is regulating cyber security in the electric power industry, but not in oil and gas, while the UK is not regulating at all but rather encouraging industry's own efforts. Some European governments are intervening, while others are leaving cybersecurity entirely to plant owners to worry about. We already note some perverse effects of the U.S. regulation regime as companies game the system, to the detriment of overall dependability.","[Anderson, Ross; Fuloria, Shailendra] Univ Cambridge, Comp Lab, Cambridge CB2 3QG, England",University of Cambridge,,Ross.Anderson@cl.cam.ac.uk; Shailendra.Fuloria@cl.cam.ac,,,,,,,22,15,18,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4419-6966-8,,,,2010,,,,,,,55,66,,10.1007/978-1-4419-6967-5_4,0.0,,,12,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BQI69,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281125700004,0

Buyers compete by offering menus of nonexclusive contracts, so that the seller can privately trade with several buyers. In this setting, we show that an equilibrium exists under mild conditions and that aggregate equilibrium allocations are generically unique. Although the good for sale is divisible, in equilibrium the seller ends up trading her whole endowment or not trading at all. Trades take place at a price equal to the expected quality of the good, conditional on the seller being ready to trade at that price. Our model thus provides a novel strategic foundation for Akerlof's (1970) results. It also contrasts with competitive screening models in which contracts are assumed to be exclusive, as in Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976).

Asymptotic study assuming that each marginal risk goes to infinity is more mathematically tractable and has also uncovered some interesting performance of risk measures and relationships between risk measures by their first order approximations. However, the First order approximation is only a crude way to understand tail behavior of multiple risks, and especially for sub-extremal risks. In this paper, we conduct asymptotic analysis on conditional tail expectation (CTE) under the condition of second order regular variation (2RV). First, the closed-form second order approximation of CTE is obtained for the univariate case. Then CTE of the form E vertical bar X-1 vertical bar g(X-1, ..., X-d) > t], as t -> infinity. is studied, where g is a loss aggregating function and (X-1, ..., X-d) := (RT1, ..., RTd) with R independent of (T-1, ..., T-d) and the survivor function of R satisfying the condition of 2RV. Closed-form second order approximations of CTE for this multivariate form have been derived in terms of corresponding value at risk. For both the univariate and multivariate cases, we find that the first order approximation is affected by only the regular variation index -alpha of marginal survivor functions, while the second order approximation is influenced by both the parameters for first and second order regular variation, and the rate of convergence to the first order approximation is dominated by the second order parameter only. We have also shown that the 2RV condition and the assumptions for the multivariate form are satisfied by many parametric distribution families, and thus the closed-form approximations would be useful for applications. Those closed-form results extend the study of Zhu and Li (submitted for publication). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The new estimators are shown to be higher-order accurate when higher-order accuracy is possible. A discussion on kernel choice is presented as well as a supporting finite-sample simulation. The problem of spectral estimation under a potential lack of finite fourth moments is also addressed. The higher-order accuracy of flat-top kernel estimators typically comes at the sacrifice of the positive semidefinite property. Nevertheless, we show how a flattop estimator can be modified to become positive semidefinite (even strictly positive definite) while maintaining its higher-order accuracy. In addition, an easy (and consistent) procedure for optimal bandwidth choice is given; this procedure estimates the optimal bandwidth associated with each individual element of the target matrix, automatically sensing (and adapting to) the underlying correlation structure.","Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Math & Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Politis, DN (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Calif San Diego, Dept Math & Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",dpolitis@ucsd.edu,,,"NSF [SES-04-18136, DMS-07-06732]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This research was partially supported by NSF grants SES-04-18136 and DMS-07-06732.

First, this paper employs a contingent claim approach to evaluate the risk return tradeoff for annuitants. For that, we take into account the differences in contract specifications and in regulatory regimes. Second, a welfare analysis is conducted to examine whether a consumer with power utility experiences utility gains if she chooses a defined benefit plan or a life annuity contract over a defined contribution plan.

This property, usually called the loading monotonicity, is satisfied by premiums that appear in the literature. The increased interest in constructing new insurance premiums has raised a question as to what weight functions would produce loading-monotonic premiums. In this paper, we demonstrate a decisive role of log-supermodularity or, equivalently, of total positivity of order 2 (TP2) in answering this question. As a consequence, we establish - at a stroke - the loading monotonicity of a number of well-known insurance premiums, and offer a host of further weight functions, and consequently of premiums, thus illustrating the power of the herein suggested methodology for constructing loading-monotonic insurance premiums.

The main axioms used in all of our results are Nash's IIA and disagreement point monotonicity-an axiom which requires a player's payoff to strictly increase in his disagreement payoff. For n = 2 these axioms, together with other standard requirements, uniquely characterize the egalitarian solution. For n > 2 we provide two extensions of our 2-person result, each of which is obtained by imposing an additional axiom on the solution. Dropping the axiom of anonymity, strengthening disagreement point monotonicity by requiring player i's payoff to be a strictly decreasing function of the disagreement payoff of every other player j not equal i, and adding a weak convexity axiom regarding changes of the disagreement point, we obtain a characterization of the class of weighted egalitarian solutions. This weak convexity axiom requires that a movement of the disagreement point in the direction of the solution point should not change the solution point.

Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the willingness to pay (WTP), of both the Dutch general public and dialysis patients, for regulatory requirements related to reducing the risk of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with epoetin alpha use. Methods: A survey was carried out in April 2009. The Dutch general public (n = 422) was approached through a survey sampling agency. Patients (n = 112) were included through several Dutch dialysis clinics because they are often treated with epoetin alpha and therefore were expected to have a higher WTP than the general public. The survey aimed to determine the WTP for reducing the risk of PRCA in epoetin alpha users from 4.5 to 0 per 10 000 patients per year, based on regulatory actions that have been taken by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). WTP was determined via a payment scale and an open-ended follow-up question. Patients were asked how much extra per year they would be willing to pay for their basic healthcare insurance. We used two censored regression models to test the association between WTP and a set of independent variables: a Tobit model with the stated WTP as the dependent variable and an interval regression model with the interval between the lower and upper bounds of the payment scale as the dependent variable. Results: The patients' mean WTP was significantly higher ((sic)46.52) than that of the general public ((sic)24.40). The Tobit model showed significant associations (alpha = 0.05) with WTP for dialysis patients, risk perception and respondents' opinions on costs of healthcare. The interval regression model showed significant associations with WTP for the same variables as the Tobit model and for one additional variable (risk aversion). Income did not significantly affect WTP. A scenario with a 10-fold larger risk reduction did not increase WTP significantly. Conclusion: This study is, as far as we know, one of the first attempts to analyse the WTP for drug regulation and should in future be used in studies of the societal costs of drug regulation for epoetin alpha use. Our results indicate that the Dutch general public, especially Dutch dialysis patients, are willing to pay limited amounts to reduce the risk of serious adverse events associated with drug use.","[Bouvy, Jacoline; Weemers, Just; Koopmanschap, Marc] Erasmus Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management iBMG, Inst Med Technol Assessment, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Bouvy, Jacoline; Schellekens, Huub] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Inst Pharmaceut Sci, Utrecht, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Utrecht University,"Bouvy, J (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåErasmus Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Inst Med Technol Assessment, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",bouvy@bmg.eur.nl,,"Bouvy, Jacoline/0000-0003-0093-5773",,,,,51,6,6,0,13,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2011,29.0,11,,,,,963,975,,,,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,843RW,21910513.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000296691200005,0

Given high incidence rates among young adults and the large number of deaths, skin cancer has the potential to result in significant years of potential life lost (YPLL) and lost productivity. The purpose of this study was to systematically review the published literature on the YPLL and the value of productivity loss from morbidity and premature mortality resulting from melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Employing pre-defined search terms and inclusion/exclusion criteria, systematic searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Econlit. We selected studies that measured the societal burden of melanoma and NMSC through estimating either the YPLL and/or the indirect costs. We identified 16 relevant studies meeting our criteria, six were from the US and ten were from other industrialized countries; ten of the studies reported results on YPLL, eight on mortality costs and five on morbidity costs. Some studies reported results in more than one category. From each eligible article and report, we extracted detailed information on the study population/country, study design, data analysis methods and study results. Data abstracted for each eligible study included estimated number of YPLL, YPLL per death and morbidity and mortality costs. The average number of YPLL per death was approximately 15 for melanoma and 10 for NMSC. We found the costs attributable to melanoma and NMSC ranged from SUS39.2 million to $US28.9 million for morbidity and $US3.3 billion to $US1.0 billion for mortality, respectively. It is clear from the published literature that skin cancer leads to significant YPLL and indirect costs associated with premature mortality and morbidity. Prevention and early detection efforts are important in helping reduce the incidence of melanoma and NMSC, and the related deaths and productivity losses.","[Guy, Gery P., Jr.; Ekwueme, Donatus U.] CDC, Div Canc Prevent & Control, Natl Ctr Chron Dis Prevent & Hlth Promot, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA",Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA,"Ekwueme, DU (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåCtr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Canc Prevent & Control, 4770 Buford Highway NE,MS K-55, Atlanta, GA 30341 USA.",dce3@cdc.gov,,,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USA),"Gery P.

However, the overall effectiveness and the balance between cost and benefit for such a prophylactic strategy have rarely been addressed. Objective: Using a review of recent literature, we aimed to assess the cost effectiveness, from the Taiwanese societal perspective, of administering prophylactic lamivudine to mothers to reduce vertical transmission of hepatitis B virus and its long-term sequelae in neonates. Methods: A meta-analysis of three randomized controlled trials was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of lamivudine versus placebo. A Markov decision model was constructed in which in both treatment arms infants received active and passive immunoprophylaxis. An economic evaluation was performed to calculate costs, acute infections averted, and QALYs gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted and a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve drawn. All these analyses were from the societal perspective. Costs (SUS) were valued in year 2008 prices. Result: Supplemental lamivudine use gained an additional 0.0024 QALYs and averted 0.23 acute infections per birth compared with the routine active-passive immunization without lamivudine. The cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that the use of additional prophylactic lamivudine dominated the routine strategy. The acceptability curve suggested that the probability of being cost effective under the willingness-to-pay threshold of $US20 000 was 94%. Conclusion: This analysis suggests that supplemental use of lamivudine in mothers with high hepatitis B viraemia is effective in reducing vertical transmission and may be cost effective, from a Taiwanese societal perspective, compared with the routine active-passive immunization without lamivudine.","[Chen, Hsiu-Hsi] Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Inst Epidemiol, Taipei 100, Taiwan; [Hung, Hui-Fang] Hsin Chu Gen Hosp, Dept Hlth, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Chen, HH (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåNatl Taiwan Univ, Coll Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Inst Epidemiol, Room 533,17 Hsu Chow Rd, Taipei 100, Taiwan.",chenlin@ntu.edu.tw,,"Chen, Tony Hsiu-Hsi/0000-0002-5799-6705",,,,,62,10,10,0,16,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2011,29.0,12,,,,,1063,1073,,10.2165/11586470-000000000-00000,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,856CG,22077578.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297613700005,0

Many applied decision models (implicitly) assume that the process of identifying relevant values for a model's input parameters is sufficient to prove the model's accuracy. The selection of infeasible combinations of input parameter values is most likely in the context of probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA), where parameter values are drawn from independently specified probability distributions for each model parameter. Model calibration involves the identification of input parameter values that produce model output parameters that best predict observed data. Methods: An empirical comparison of three key calibration issues is presented: the applied measure of goodness of fit (GOF), the search strategy for selecting sets of input parameter values; and the convergence criteria for determining acceptable GOF. The comparisons are presented in the context of probabilistic calibration, a widely applicable approach to calibration that can be easily integrated with PSA. The appendix provides a user's guide to probabilistic calibration, with the reader invited to download the Microsoft (R) Excel-based model reported in this article. Results: The calibrated models consistently provided higher mean estimates of the models' output parameter, illustrating the potential gain in accuracy derived from calibrating decision models. Model uncertainty was also reduced. The chi-squared GOF measure differentiated between the accuracy of different parameter sets to a far greater degree than the likelihood GOF measure. The guided search strategy produced higher mean estimates of the models' output parameter, as well as a narrower range of predicted output values, which may reflect greater precision in the identification of candidate parameter sets or more limited coverage of the parameter space. The broader convergence threshold resulted in lower mean estimates of the models' output, and slightly wider ranges, which were closer to the outputs associated with the non-calibrated approach. Conclusions: Probabilistic calibration provides a broadly applicable method that will improve the relevance of health economic decision models, and simultaneously reduce model uncertainty. The analyses reported in this paper inform the more efficient and accurate application of calibration methods for health economic decision models.","[Karnon, Jonathan] Univ Adelaide, Dept Publ Hlth, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Vanni, Tazio] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1, England",University of Adelaide; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Karnon, J (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Adelaide, Dept Publ Hlth, Level 8,10 Pulteney St,Mail Drop 207, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",jonathan.karnon@adelaide.edu.au,"Vanni, Tazio P./B-7925-2018","Karnon, Jonathan/0000-0003-3220-2099",,,,,18,44,50,0,8,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2011,29.0,1,,,,,51,62,,10.2165/11584610-000000000-00000,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,708FN,21142278.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000286347800004,0

We assume workers care about their relative position, and we study the impact of this assumption on their efforts and on their optimal incentive contracts. We explicitly solve for the optimal incentive contract of moral hazard a la Holmstrom and Milgrom (Econometrica 55:303-328, 1987). We model team production by agents in which each agent's effort generates an observable signal and depends on efforts of other agents. One of the important findings is that an agent's optimal effort is negatively impacted by the behavioral biases in other agents' judgments. We also show envious behavior is destructive for organizations. Consistent with Tirole (Econometrica 69(1):1-35, 2001), our findings suggest that in the presence of agency problems induced by envy or jealousy, the optimal compensation exhibits high pay-for-performance sensitivity.","[Goukasian, Levon] Pepperdine Univ, Seaver Coll, Business Div, Malibu, CA 90263 USA; [Wan, Xuhu] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Informat Syst Business Stat & Operat Managem, Sch Business & Management, Kowloon, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Pepperdine University; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Wan, XH (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåHong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Informat Syst Business Stat & Operat Managem, Sch Business & Management, Kowloon, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",Levon.Goukasian@Pepperdine.edu; imwan@ust.hk,,"Wan, Xuhu/0000-0003-3558-1151",,,,,36,14,16,0,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

To establish asymptotic normality for making inferences, bias control mechanisms are often used in implementing semiparametric estimators. The first contribution of this paper is to propose a mechanism that enables us to establish asymptotic normality with regular kernels. In so doing, we argue that the resulting estimator performs very well in finite samples. Semiparametric models are commonly estimated under a single index assumption. Because the consistency of the estimator critically depends on this assumption being correct, our second objective is to develop a test for it. To ensure that the test statistic has good size and power properties in finite samples, we employ a bias control mechanism similar to that underlying the estimator. Furthermore, we structure the test so that its form adapts to the model under the alternative hypothesis. Monte Carlo results confirm that the bias control and the adaptive feature significantly improve the performance of the test statistic in finite samples.","[Klein, Roger; Shen, Chan] Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Shen, C (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåGeorgetown Univ, Dept Econ, ICC 580,37th & O Sts NW, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",cs589@georgetown.edu,,,,,,,31,9,13,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

A major consideration in the development of this approach is that it should be easily applicable to large portfolios. Our method uses as a first tool the model developed by Afonso et al. (2009), which is quite flexible and allows premiums to change annually. We extend that model by introducing a credibility approach to experience rating. We consider a portfolio of risks which satisfy the assumptions of the Buhlmann (1967, 1969) or Buhlmann and Straub (1970) credibility models. We compute finite time ruin probabilities for different scenarios and compare with those when a fixed premium is considered.","[Afonso, Lourdes B.] Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, Dept Matemat, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal; [Afonso, Lourdes B.] Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, CMA, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal; [Egidio dos Reis, Alfredo D.] Univ Tecn Lisbon, Dept Math, ISEG, P-1200781 Lisbon, Portugal; [Egidio dos Reis, Alfredo D.] Univ Tecn Lisbon, CEMAPRE, P-1200781 Lisbon, Portugal; [Waters, Howard R.] Heriot Watt Univ, Maxwell Inst Math Sci, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Waters, Howard R.] Heriot Watt Univ, Dept Actuarial Math & Stat, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa; Heriot Watt University; University of Edinburgh; Heriot Watt University,"Afonso, LB (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Nova Lisboa, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, Dept Matemat, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal.",lbafonso@fct.unl.pt; alfredo@iseg.utl.pt; H.R.Waters@ma.hw.ac.uk,"dos Reis, Alfredo Duarte Egidio/A-4080-2010; Afonso, Lourdes/X-6006-2018","dos Reis, Alfredo Duarte Egidio/0000-0003-2533-1343; Afonso, Lourdes/0000-0002-3831-7164",Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [FEDER/POCI 2010],Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (programme FEDER/POCI 2010).,,12,8,8,0,5,PEETERS,LEUVEN,"BONDGENOTENLAAN 153, B-3000 LEUVEN, BELGIUM",0515-0361,,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,MAY,2010,40.0,1,,,,,399,414,,10.2143/AST.40.1.2049236,0.0,,,16,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,609AR,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000278627600019,0

Inference with point estimates is possible with the Wald, likelihood ratio (LR), and Lagrange multiplier (LM) tests in GMM estimator with only nearly-weak instruments present in the system. The limit is the standard chi(2) limit. This is important from an applied perspective, since tests on the weak case do depend on the true value and can only test simple null.

Secondly, under the conditions of incomplete information, the proportion of distribution in the total surplus of each side will depend on the relationship of trust and knowledge distance between the two sides. Finally, through the analysis of the game mechanism, the mechanism to allow the both sides tell their true valuation of the knowledge is founded that the price of the knowledge goods should be equal to the multiply of the each side's valuation of knowledge divided by the sum of their valuation.","[Chen Bo] Dongguan Polytech, Dong Guan 523808, Peoples R China",Dongguan Polytechnic,,,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,5,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,1056,1062,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100149,0

Calibration results indicate that the regime-switching model is a better fit to market data compared to a one-factor mean-reverting model similar to those used by other authors to value gas storage. We extend a semi-Lagrangian timestepping scheme from Chen and Forsyth (2007) to solve the gas storage pricing problem, essentially a stochastic control problem, and conduct a convergence analysis of the scheme.

Objectives: To forecast the impact of the use of darunavir with low-dose ritonavir 600/100 mg twice a day (bid) in highly treatment-experienced, HIV-infected adults who have failed one or more protease inhibitor (PI)-containing regimen on the budget of the French Sickness Fund (French healthcare system) over a 3-year time horizon. Methods: A transition state model based on disease severity was developed that compared the evolution of antiretroviral and non-antiretroviral-related direct costs of care in the target population over 3 years (2007-2009) under two scenarios: (1) darunavir enters the French market in year 1; (2) darunavir is not available to the target population during 2007-2009. Model inputs were derived from a targeted analysis of the French hospital database in HIV, the darunavir POWER 1 and 2 trials and other relevant clinical studies. Results: In the scenario where darunavir was available from year 1, the proportion of patients in the lower, more costly CD4 cell count strata (<= 100 cells per mm(3)) was consistently lower than in the scenario without darunavir in each year of the model (17.0% vs 19.2%, 13.9% vs 18.3% and 10.8% vs 16.8% for years 1, 2 and 3, respectively). As a result, over the entire 3-year period, the net increase of antiretroviral drug costs (+5.6 million Euros; (sic)), resulting from the substitution of older, cheaper PIs by darunavir, is expected to be fully compensated by savings in hospitalization costs ((sic)-9.7 million) and expenditures for other HIV-related (non-antiretroviral) medications ((sic)-7.3 million), leading to a net saving of (sic)11.4 million or 2.9% of the total budget in the scenario without darunavir. Various sensitivity analyses confirmed these projected savings. Conclusion: The use of darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) 600/100 mg bid, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, in highly pre-treated, HIV-infected adults who have failed one or more PI-containing highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen is not expected to increase the budget of the French healthcare system, in comparison with a scenario without darunavir. Further research is needed to estimate the budget impact of the use of DRV/r in less treatment-experienced, HIV-infected individuals in France.","[Colin, Xavier; Lafuma, Antoine] Cemka Eval, F-92340 Bourg La Reine, France; [Costagliola, Dominique] Univ Paris 06, UMR S 720, Paris, France; [Costagliola, Dominique] INSERM, Unite Mixte Rech UMR S 720, Paris, France; [Smets, Erik] Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceut Serv LLC, Mechelen, Belgium; [Mauskopf, Josephine] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Guillon, Pascal] Janssen Cilag SAS, Issy Les Moulineaux, France",Sorbonne Universite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Johnson & Johnson; Research Triangle Institute,"Colin, X (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåCemka Eval, 43 Blvd Marechal Joffre, F-92340 Bourg La Reine, France.",xavier.colin@cemka.fr,"Costagliola, Dominique/H-5849-2011","Costagliola, Dominique/0000-0003-0765-0869; Mauskopf, Josephine/0000-0002-6098-5548","Janssen-Cilag SAS, France; Johnson & Johnson (Janssen Cilag); Janssen Cilag","Janssen-Cilag SAS, France; Johnson & Johnson (Janssen Cilag)(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc); Janssen Cilag(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc)","The authors wish to acknowledge Anita Brogan (RTI Health Solutions, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA) for her involvement in the development and programming of the model used in this analysis.

Objective: A decision-analytic model was created to explore economic benefits from a third-party payer perspective of the use of 5ARIs in preventing PCa in men with different risk factors for developing the disease. Methods: A Markov model was developed to simulate a cohort of men annually through health states (e.g. healthy male, benign prostatic hyperplasia [BPH], PCa, PCa recurrence) over a man's lifetime. Men with risk factors were treated with a SARI and compared with patients given no chemoprevention. Men from the general population were examined along with higher-risk men who had been referred to a PCa centre. Baseline risk was estimated via published risk data, risk factor analyses and risk equations. Clinical efficacy, morality, costs and utilities were obtained from published literature. Outcomes of the model included number of prostate cancers, incremental costs, incremental QALYs, incremental cost per QALY and number needed to treat. Along with sensitivity and scenario analyses, a validation of outcomes was performed. All costs were valued in SUS, year 2009 values. Costs were discounted at 3% per annum. Results: Men receiving 5ARls benefited through a reduction in the number of PCas. Assuming a cost-effectiveness threshold of $US50 000 per QALY, chemoprevention with 5ARIs was cost effective ($US37 900 per QALY) in men from the general population who were aged 50 years with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and who were aged 50 years with PCa family history and elevated PSA ($US31 065 per QALY). Chemoprevention with 5ARIs was not cost effective in men aged 50 years with no additional risk factors, men aged 50 years with abnormal digital rectal examinations (DREs), and men aged 50 years with a family history ($US86 511. $US85 577and $US84 950 per QALY, respectively). In higher-risk men, chemoprevention could be expected to be cost effective ($US18 490 to $US11 816 per QALY, depending on risk scenario). Results were sensitive to changes in utilities, assumed PCa risk reduction with 5ARIs, and patient age. Conclusion: When considering common risk factors associated with PCa, prevention with 5ARIs is expected to be cost effective in 50-year-old men with elevated PSA. As a man's risk increases, the cost effectiveness of SARI chemoprevention improves.","[Earnshaw, Stephanie R.; McDade, Cheryl L.] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Black, Libby K.; Bell, Christopher F.] GlaxoSmithKline, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Kattan, Michael W.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Lerner Coll Med, Cleveland Clin, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",Research Triangle Institute; GlaxoSmithKline; Cleveland Clinic Foundation; University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University,"Earnshaw, SR (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåRTI Hlth Solut, 200 Pk Off, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",searnshaw@rti.org,"Kattan, Michael W/HZM-2315-2023","Kattan, Michael W/0000-0002-3840-4161; Earnshaw, Stephanie/0000-0003-2975-6509",GlaxoSmithKline; pharmaceutical companies,GlaxoSmithKline(GlaxoSmithKline); pharmaceutical companies,"The funding for this study was provided by GlaxoSmithKline.

Four related questions arise that VOI methods could address. (i) Is further research for a health technology assessment (HTA) potentially worthwhile? (ii) Is the cost of a given research design less than its expected value? (iii) What is the optimal research design for an HTA? (iv) How can research funding be best prioritized across alternative HTAs? Following Occam's razor, we consider the usefulness of VOI methods in informing questions 1-4 relative to their simplicity of use. Expected value of perfect information (EVPI) with current information, while simple to calculate, is shown to provide neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition to address question 1, given that what EVPI needs to exceed varies with the cost of research design, which can vary from very large down to negligible. Hence, for any given HTA, EVPI does not discriminate, as it can be large and further research not worthwhile or small and further research worthwhile. In contrast, each of questions 1-4 are shown to be fully addressed (necessary and sufficient) where VOI methods are applied to maximize expected value of sample information (EVSI) minus expected costs across designs. In comparing complexity in use of VOI methods, applying the central limit theorem (CLT) simplifies analysis to enable easy estimation of EVSI and optimal overall research design, and has been shown to outperform bootstrapping, particularly with small samples. Consequently, VOI methods applying the CLT to inform optimal overall research design satisfy Occam's razor in both improving decision making and reducing complexity. Furthermore, they enable consideration of relevant decision contexts, including option value and opportunity cost of delay, time, imperfect implementation and optimal design across jurisdictions. More complex VOI methods such as bootstrapping of the expected value of partial EVPI may have potential value in refining overall research design. However, Occam's razor must be seriously considered in application of these VOI methods, given their increased complexity and current limitations in informing decision making, with restriction to EVPI rather than EVSI and not allowing for important decision-making contexts. Initial use of CLT methods to focus these more complex partial VOI methods towards where they may be useful in refining optimal overall trial design is suggested. Integrating CLT methods with such partial VOI methods to allow estimation of partial EVSI is suggested in future research to add value to the current VOI toolkit.","[Eckermann, Simon] Univ Wollongong, Ctr Hlth Serv Dev, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Karnon, Jon] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Willan, Andrew R.] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Willan, Andrew R.] SickKids Res Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Wollongong; University of Adelaide; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids),"Eckermann, S (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Wollongong, Ctr Hlth Serv Dev, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",seckerma@uow.edu.au,,"Karnon, Jonathan/0000-0003-3220-2099",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [44868-03],Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),The data models and methodology used in the research are not subject to any proprietary interests.

Methods: A Bayesian cost-effectiveness model was developed to estimate the costs and benefits associated with initiating AS treatment with etoricoxib, celecoxib, diclofenac or naproxen. Efficacy, safety and medical resource and cost data were obtained from the literature. The obtained efficacy estimates were synthesized with a mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis. Treatment benefit and degree of disease activity, as reflected with Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) scores, were related to QALYs and AS-specific costs (related to BASDAI). Other cost outcomes related to drug acquisition, and gastrointestinal and cardiovascular safety. Uncertainty in the source data was translated into uncertainty in cost-effectiveness estimates and therefore decision uncertainty. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5% per annum. Results: There was a >98% probability that treatment with etoricoxib results in greater QALYs than the other interventions. Over a 30-year time horizon, starting AS treatment with etoricoxib was associated with about 0.4 more QALYs than the other interventions. At 2 years there was a 77% probability that etoricoxib had the lowest cost. This increased to >99% at 30 years. Etoricoxib is expected to save pound 13 620 (year 2007 values) relative to celecoxib (200/400 mg), 9957 pound relative to diclofenac and 9863 relative to naproxen. For a willingness-to-pay ceiling ratio of 20 000 per QALY, there was a >97% probability that etoricoxib was the most cost-effective treatment. Additional analysis with different assumptions, including celecoxib 200 mg, and ignoring cost-offsets associated with improvements in disease activity, supported these findings. Conclusions: This economic evaluation suggests that, from the UK NHS perspective, etoricoxib is the most cost-effective initial NSAID treatment for AS patients.","[Jansen, Jeroen P.] Mapi Values, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Gaugris, Sabine] Merck & Co Inc, Outcome Res, Whitehouse Stn, NJ USA; [Choy, Ernest H.] Kings Coll Hosp London, Sir Alfred Baring Garrod Clin Trials Unit, Acad Dept Rheumatol, GKT Sch Med, London, England; [Ostor, Andrew] Addenbrookes Hosp, Dept Rheumatol, Cambridge, England; [Nash, Julian T.] Stanmore Hosp, Dept Rheumatol, Royal Natl Orthopaed Hosp, Stanmore, Middx, England; [Stam, Wiro] Mapi Values, Houten, Netherlands",Merck & Company; King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust; King's College Hospital; University of London; King's College London; Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Addenbrooke's Hospital; University of Cambridge; University of London; University College London; Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Trust,"Jansen, JP (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåMapi Values, 133 Portland St, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",jeroen.jansen@mapivalues.com,,"Jansen, Jeroen Paul/0000-0003-2686-9217","Merck Co., Inc.","Merck Co., Inc.(Merck & Company)","This study was funded by Merck & Co., Inc.

We apply four flexible probability density functions (pdfs) to model possible skewness and kurtosis in estimating the parameters of the CAPM and compare the corresponding estimates with ordinary least squares (OLS) and other symmetric distribution estimates. Estimation using the flexible pdfs provides more efficient results than OLS when the errors are non-normal and similar results when the errors are normal. Large estimation differences correspond to clear departures from normality. Our results show that OLS is not the best estimator of betas using this type of data.

The primary literature search was performed for 1980-2009 using PubMed, PubMed In Process and Non-Indexed, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process, PsycINFO (EBSCO), CINAHL (EBSCO), Ovid HealthStar, EMBASE (Elsevier) and Cochrane Databases and using the following search terms: 'patient compliance', 'medication adherence', 'treatment compliance', 'drug monitoring', 'drug therapy', 'electronic', 'digital', 'computer', 'monitor', 'monitoring', 'drug', 'drugs', 'pharmaceutical preparations', 'compliance' and 'medications'. We identified studies that included SRQs and electronic monitoring devices to measure adherence and focused on the SRQs that were found to be moderately to highly correlated with the monitoring devices. Of the 1679 citations found via the primary search, 41 full-text articles were reviewed for correlation between monitoring devices and SRQs. A majority (68%) of articles reported high (27%), moderate (29%) or significant (12%) correlation between monitoring devices (37 using Medication Event Monitoring System [MEMS (R)] and four using other devices) and SRQs (11 identified and numerous other unnamed SRQs). The most commonly used SRQs were the Adult/Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trial Group (AACTG/PACTG; 24.4%, 10/41) followed by the 4-item Morisky (9.8%, 4/41), Brief Medication Questionnaire (9.8%, 4/41) and visual analogue scale (VAS; 7.3%, 3/41). Although study designs differed across the articles, SRQs appeared to report a higher rate of medication adherence (+14.9%) than monitoring devices. In conclusion, several medication adherence SRQs were validated using electronic monitoring devices. A majority of them showed high or moderate correlation with medication adherence measured using monitoring devices, and could be considered for measuring patient-reported adherence prospectively.","[Shi, Lizheng; Liu, Jinan; Koleva, Yordanka; Fonseca, Vivian] Tulane Univ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Kalsekar, Anupama; Pawaskar, Manjiri] Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA",Tulane University; Eli Lilly,"Shi, LZ (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)Ôºå1440 Canal St,Suite 1900, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA.",lshi1@tulane.edu,,,Eli Lilly and Company,Eli Lilly and Company(Eli Lilly),"Eli Lilly and Company provided funding under a research agreement to the principal investigator, Lizheng Shi.",,78,146,172,1,20,ADIS INT LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 1311, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2010,28.0,12,,,,,1097,1107,,10.2165/11537400-000000000-00000,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,708JY,21080735.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000286359300004,0

A potential barrier to the widespread implementation of pharmacogenetic testing is the lack of evidence on whether testing provides good value for money. The objective of this review was to provide a systematic and critical review of economic evaluations of pharmacogenetic testing. A literature search using publically available databases was performed for articles published up to October 2009. To be included, studies had to meet the definition of being a pharmacogenomic study (defined as use of information on human genetic variation to target drug therapy) and an economic evaluation (defined as an evaluation of both costs and clinical outcomes). Articles that met these criteria were subsequently reviewed and graded using the Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) instrument. Lastly, the evidence for biomarker validity and utility were qualitatively assessed using expert opinion. A total of 34 articles were identified using our defined criteria. The most common disease category was thromboembolic-related diseases (26%), while the most common biomarkers were thiopurine methyltransferase and cytochrome P450 2C9 (18% each). Almost all studies were published after 2004 (91%). Two types of studies were identified: cost-effectiveness studies and cost-utility studies, with roughly half of the overall studies being cost-utility studies (53%) and a majority of these published within the last 3 years. The average quality score was 77 (range 29-99). Of the biomarkers reviewed, it was estimated that most had demonstrated clinical validity, but only two had demonstrated clinical utility.

The result shows: the performance of conditional hedging strategy based on the principle of forward premium is better than no hedging and full hedging strategies in all respects. When comparing the average return per unit of risk of hedging stock investment in G5 countries, selective hedging strategy is of the best performance, followed by large premium strategy, and full-hedging strategy is the worst. Also, the efficiency frontier distribution graph of G5 stock portfolios shows that, conditional hedging strategy is in the best position, but the efficiency of full hedging will increase with the rising of risk level. These results indicate that, with gradual enhancement of the effectiveness of Chinese spot foreign exchange market, conditional hedging strategy is a simple and effective method to manage currency risk in international portfolios in the appreciation trend of RMB.","[Ye Xin; Zhang Lu; Liu Ming-ming] Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China",Tongji University,,,,,,,,,20,0,0,1,4,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,1233,1238,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100171,0

To entertain the nonlinearity and structural change in the VaR, we extend the CAViaR idea using two approaches: the threshold GARCH (TGARCH) and the mixture-GARCH models. The estimation method of these models are proposed. Our models should possess all the advantages of the CAViaR model and enhance the nonlinear structure. The methods are applied to the SP500, Hang Seng, Nikkei and Nasdaq indices to illustrate our models.","[Yu, Philip L.

The idea behind this approach is that in a situation of weak solvency, an insurer's asset allocation can be adjusted much more easily in the short term than can, for example, claims cost distributions, operating expenses, or equity capital. Hence, instead of using separate models for capital regulation and solvency regulation - as is typically done in most insurance markets - our single model will reduce the complexity and costs for insurers as well as for regulators. In this paper, we first develop the model framework and second test its applicability using data from a German non-life insurer. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

When the data are moderately integrated in the stationary direction (with c(i) < 0), it is shown that least squares regression is consistent and asymptotically normal but suffers from significant bias, related to simultaneous equations bias. In the moderately explosive case (where c(i) > 0) the limit theory is mixed normal with Cauchy-type tail behavior, and the rate of convergence is explosive, as in the case of a moderately explosive scalar autoregression (Phillips and Magdalinos, 2007, Journal of Econometrics 136, 115-130). Moreover, the limit theory applies without any distributional assumptions and for weakly dependent errors under conventional moment conditions, so an invariance principle holds, unlike the well-known case of an explosive autoregression. This theory validates inference in cointegrating regression with mildly explosive regressors. The special case in which the regressors themselves have a common explosive component is also considered.","[Phillips, Peter C.

Such policies can be seen as European path-dependent contingent claims whose underlying security is the investment portfolio of the insurance company that sold the policy. The fair valuation of these policies is studied under the assumption that the insurance company has the right to modify the investment strategy of the underlying portfolio at any time. Furthermore, it is assumed that the issuer of the policy does not setup a separate portfolio to hedge the risk associated with the policy. Instead, the issuer will use its discretion about the investment strategy of the underlying portfolio to hedge shortfall risks. In that sense, the insurer's investment portfolio serves simultaneously as the underlying security and as the hedge portfolio. This means that the hedging problem can not be separated from the valuation problem. We investigate the relationship between risk-neutral valuation and hedging of these policies in complete and incomplete financial markets. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Currently the performance of the Local Authority staff is inefficient. They lack motivation to seek better results. It is claimed that they are diligent and accurate in performing their duties. However their efforts are neither efficient nor innovative. The occurrence of such situation is affected by the legislation which regulates the public sector imposing insufficiently efficient procedural regulations on the public servants. The Local Authority employees fail to be motivated to seek better results as the management of this field is still characterised by irrational task sharing and a horizontal hierarchical system, which frequently results in de-motivation of personal achievements and personal responsibility for performance results.

Recent studies have focused on MVC and their effect on the healthcare system, but limited published data exist on long-term costs associated with MVC in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Objective: The objective of this study was to compare resource utilization and medical costs over a 12-month period among patients diagnosed with T2DM with versus without MVC in a managed-care population. Methods: Patients aged >= 18 years, diagnosed with T2DM between I January 2003 and 31 December 2004 were identified in an administrative claims database of approximately 55 million beneficiaries in private and public health plans. The date of the first T2DM diagnosis during this period was the 'index date' for each patient. All patients had to have a minimum of 12 months of continuous enrolment both prior to and following the index date. MVC was identified during the 12 months prior to the first T2DM diagnosis and these patients were matched (1 : 2) by age, sex and ten co-morbid conditions to those with no evidence of MVC during the entire study period. Results: Among the 15 326 MVC patients included in the study, 61% had a history of peripheral neuropathy, 28% diabetic retinopathy and 19% nephropathy. Compared with 30 652 patients without MVC, the MVC patients were more likely to use oral antidiabetics and insulin and had a higher comorbidity score. Over 12 months, patients with MVC had more (mean 0.3 vs 0.2; p<0.001) and longer (mean length of stay 1.79 days vs 0.85 days; p<0.001) hospital stays; physician office visits (19.7 vs 13.7; p<0.001); and prescriptions for oral antidiabetic (6.3 vs 5.6 scripts; p<0.001) and insulin (0.7 vs 0.2 scripts; p<0.001)use. Average total costs per patient over 12-months were $US14414 with MVC versus $US8669 without MVC (p<0.001). Conclusion: This study indicates that in patients with T2DM, MVC is associated with significant consumption of healthcare resources. Mean total costs with MVC were almost double those of patients without MVC over a 12-month period.","[Pelletier, Elise M.; Shim, Boyung] IMS Hlth Inc, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Watertown, MA 02472 USA; [Ben-Joseph, Rami] Sanofi Aventis, Hlth Outcomes, Bridgewater, NJ USA; [Caro, J.

J,"Polsky, D; Glick, H",,,,"Polsky, Daniel; Glick, Henry",,,Costing and Cost Analysis in Randomized Controlled Trials Caveat Emptor,PHARMACOECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ECONOMIC EVALUATIONS; CLINICAL-TRIALS; RETRANSFORMATION,"This article provides an overview of the central issues regarding cost valuation and analysis for a decision maker's evaluation of costing performed within randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Costing involves specific choices for Valuation and analysis that involve trade-offs. Understanding these choices and their implications is necessary for proper evaluation of how costs are valued and analyzed within an RCT and cannot be assessed through a checklist of adherence to general principles. Resource costing, the most common method of costing, involves measuring medical service use in study case report forms and translating this use into a cost by multiplying the number of units of each medical set-vice by price weights for those services. A choice must be made as to how detailed the measurement of resources will be. Micro-costing improves the specificity of the cost estimate, but it is often impractical to precisely measure resources at this level and the price weights for these micro-units may not be available. Gross-costing may be more practical, and price weights are often easier to find and are more reliable, but important resource differences between treatment groups may be lost in the bundling of resources. Price weights can either tie nationally determined or centre specific, but the appropriate price weight will depend oil perspective, convenience, completeness and accuracy. Identifying the resource types and the appropriate price weights for these resources are the essential elements to an accurate valuation of costs. Once medical services are valued, the resulting individual patient cost estimates must be analysed. The difference in the mean cost between treatment groups is the important summary statistic for cost-effectiveness analysis from both the budgetary and the social perspectives. The statistical challenges with cost data typically stein from its skewed distribution and the resulting possibility that the sample mean may be inefficient and possibly inappropriate for statistical inference. Multivariable analysis of cost is useful, even if the data come from an RCT, but the same distributional problems that affect univariate tests of cost also affect use of cost as a dependent variable in a multivariable regression analysis. The generalized linear model (GLM) overcomes many of the problems of more common cost models, but caution must be used when applying this model because it is prone to mis-specification and precision losses in data with a heavy-tailed log error term. Attention to the appropriate cost valuation and analysis techniques reviewed here will help bring the same level of rigor and attention to the methodological issues in cost valuation as is currently applied to clinical evidence within RCTs.","[Polsky, Daniel] Univ Penn, Div Gen Internal Med, Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Polsky, D (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Penn, Div Gen Internal Med, Sch Med, Blockley Hall,Rm 1212,423 Guardian Dr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",polsky@mail.med.upenn.edu,,,NIH/NIDA [R01 DAO 1722 1],NIH/NIDA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)),Support for this paper was received from NIH/NIDA grant R01 DAO 1722 1.

In many cases, this event is associated with unpleasant somatic-vegetative, urogenital or psychological symptoms. Objective: To test the health and social demographic factors (especially household income level) that influence willingness to pay (WTP) for a new hormone-free treatment in women of menopausal age. Methods: 1365 women between the ages of 45 and 73 years were surveyed about their health and WTP for the new treatment. WTP was evaluated with a closed-ended binary questionnaire (four groups with different levels of co-payment between is an element of 15 and is an element of 60), using the contingent valuation method. The average WTP was calculated according to the area under the demand function. Factors contributing to payment readiness were examined by means of binary logistic regression. Results: WTP was significantly affected by women's opinion of the new medication, the level of co-payment required, net household income, whether currently in treatment for menopausal symptoms, and Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) values. Compared with other factors, the level of co-payment was predicted to have a negative impact on WTP. Income level is an important factor in WTP and correlates highly with several other health-related variables (WHO-5 index, MRS value, receipt of other menopause medicines and existing co-morbidity). The average co-payment that our group of women was willing to pay was between is an element of 17 and is an element of 35 per month, or is an element of 24 to is an element of 42 for women who were currently receiving treatment for symptorns of menopause. While interpreting the results, it should be considered that the hypothetical therapy was assumed to be a new non-reimbursable alternative to conventional therapy offered under the existing statutory framework for health insurance in Germany. Conclusions: Despite some methodological limitations, these results are useful for examining the factors affecting WTP and incremental utilities for future medicine dealing with menopause.","[Rasch, Andrej; Hodek, Jan-Marc; Greiner, Wolfgang] Univ Bielefeld, Sch Publ Hlth Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany; [Runge, Claus] Wyeth Pharma GmbH, Munster, Germany",University of Bielefeld; Pfizer,"Rasch, A (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Bielefeld, Sch Publ Hlth, Postfach 100131, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany.",andrej.rasch@uni-bielefeld.de,,"Rasch, Andrej/0000-0003-4098-4502",Wyeth Pharma GmbH,Wyeth Pharma GmbH,"The study was supported by Wyeth Pharma GmbH.

We propose a methodology for robust forecasting based on the existence of a larger reference population sharing the same long-term trend as the population of interest. The reference population is used to estimate the parameters in a frailty model for the underlying intensity surface. A multivariate time series model describing the deviations of the small population mortality from the underlying mortality is then fitted and forecasted. Coherent long-term forecasts are ensured by the underlying frailty model while the size and variability of short- to medium-term deviations are quantified by the time series model. The frailty model is particularly well suited to describe the changing improvement patterns in old age mortality.

Focus is on the study of local stability of the wealth dynamics through the application of recent results on the linearization and stability of random dynamical systems (Evstigneev et al. Proc Am Math Soc 139: 1061-1072, 2011). Conditions are derived for the linearization of the model at an equilibrium state which ensure local convergence of sample paths to this equilibrium. The paper also shows that the concept of local stability is closely related to the notion of evolutionary stability. A locally evolutionarily stable investment strategy in the evolutionary model with a risk-free asset is derived, extending previous research. The method illustrated here is applicable for the analysis of manifold economic and financial dynamic models involving randomness.","[Evstigneev, Igor V.] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Econ Dept, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Hens, Thorsten] Univ Zurich, Dept Banking & Finance, Zurich, Switzerland; [Hens, Thorsten; Schenk-Hoppe, Klaus Reiner] NHH Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Finance & Management, Bergen, Norway; [Schenk-Hoppe, Klaus Reiner] Univ Leeds, Leeds Univ Business Sch, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Schenk-Hoppe, Klaus Reiner] Univ Leeds, Sch Math, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Manchester; University of Zurich; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Schenk-Hopp√©, KR (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Leeds, Leeds Univ Business Sch, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",igor.evstigneev@manchester.ac.uk; thorsten.hens@bf.uzh.ch; k.r.schenk-hoppe@leeds.ac.uk,,"Hens, Thorsten/0000-0002-0266-1561",Norwegian Finance Market Fund (project Stochastic Dynamics of Financial Markets); Norwegian Finance Market Fund (project Stability of Financial Markets: An Evolutionary Approach); Swiss National Center of Competence in Research Financial Valuation and Risk Management (project Behavioural and Evolutionary Finance); European Commission under the Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship Programme [PIEF-GA-2010-274454],Norwegian Finance Market Fund (project Stochastic Dynamics of Financial Markets); Norwegian Finance Market Fund (project Stability of Financial Markets: An Evolutionary Approach); Swiss National Center of Competence in Research Financial Valuation and Risk Management (project Behavioural and Evolutionary Finance); European Commission under the Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship Programme(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"Financial support from the Norwegian Finance Market Fund (projects Stochastic Dynamics of Financial Markets and Stability of Financial Markets: An Evolutionary Approach), the Swiss National Center of Competence in Research Financial Valuation and Risk Management (project Behavioural and Evolutionary Finance) and the European Commission under the Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship Programme (grant agreement PIEF-GA-2010-274454) is gratefully acknowledged.",,25,6,7,0,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

After estimation of parameters using preprogram data, we evaluate the model's ability to predict and interpret the impact of the village fund intervention. Simulations from the model mirror the data in yielding a greater increase in consumption than credit, which is interpreted as evidence of credit constraints. A cost-benefit analysis using the model indicates that some households value the program much more than its per household cost, but overall the program costs 30 percent more than the sum of these benefits.","[Kaboski, Joseph P.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Econ, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Townsend, Robert M.] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kaboski, Joseph P.; Townsend, Robert M.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Notre Dame; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kaboski, JP (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Notre Dame, Dept Econ, 717 Flanner Hall, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",jkaboski@ND.EDU; rtownsen@MIT.EDU,"de Groot, M/A-2025-2012",,NICHD [R03 HD04776801]; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; John Templeton Foundation; NSF,NICHD(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); John Templeton Foundation; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Research funded by NICHD Grant R03 HD04776801, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation grant to the University of Chicago Consortium on Financial Systems and Poverty, John Templeton Foundation, and NSF.

This formulation covers a wide body of existing and new models with law-invariant preference measures, including expected utility maximization, mean-variance, goal reaching, Yaari's dual model, Lopes' SP/A model, behavioral model under prospect theory, as well as those explicitly involving VaR and CVaR in objectives and/or constraints. A solution scheme to this quantile model is proposed, and then demonstrated by solving analytically the goal-reaching model and Yaari's dual model. A general property derived for the quantile model is that the optimal terminal payment is anticomonotonic with the pricing kernel (or with the minimal pricing kernel in the case of an incomplete market if the investment opportunity set is deterministic). As a consequence, the mutual fund theorem still holds in a market where rational and irrational agents co-exist.","[Zhou, Xun Yu] Univ Oxford, Inst Math, Oxford OX1 3LB, England; [He, Xue Dong] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Zhou, Xun Yu] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Syst Engn & Engn Management, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Oxford; Columbia University; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Zhou, XY (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Oxford, Inst Math, 24-29 St Giles, Oxford OX1 3LB, England.",zhouxy@maths.ox.ac.uk,,,Nomura Centre for Mathematical Finance; University of Oxford; Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance,Nomura Centre for Mathematical Finance; University of Oxford; Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance,"This work was presented at the 2008 Special Semester on Stochastics with Emphasis on Finance in Linz, Austria, the 2009 Midlands Probability Theory Seminars in Warwick, the 2009 Workshop on Optimal Stopping and Singular Stochastic Control Problems in Finance in Singapore, the 2010 Workshop on Foundations of Mathematical Finance at the Fields Institute, Toronto, and at seminars at Columbia, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Oxford, Oslo, Swedish Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Vienna Institute of Finance, and Yale.

These strategies are called semiconstant rebalanced portfolios in Blum and Kalai and Helmbold et al. Unlike a constant rebalanced portfolio, which must rebalance at every investment interval, a semiconstant rebalanced portfolio rebalances its portfolio only on selected instants. Hence, a semiconstant rebalanced portfolio may avoid rebalancing if the transaction costs outweigh the benefits of rebalancing. In a competitive algorithm framework, we compete against all such semiconstant portfolios with an arbitrary number of rebalancings and corresponding rebalancing instants. We investigate this framework with and without transaction costs and demonstrate sequential portfolios that asymptotically achieve the wealth of the best semiconstant rebalanced portfolios whose number of rebalancings and instants of rebalancings are tuned to the individual sequence of price relatives.","[Kozat, Suleyman S.] Koc Univ, Dept ECE, Istanbul, Turkey; [Singer, Andrew C.] Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60680 USA",Koc University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Kozat, SS (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåKoc Univ, Dept ECE, Istanbul, Turkey.",skozat@ku.edu.tr,"Singer, Andrew Carl/JFS-0605-2023","Singer, Andrew Carl/0000-0001-9926-7036",,,,,25,17,22,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

We develop a dynamic shadow distance system that integrates dynamic adjustment costs into a long-run shadow cost-minimization problem, which allows us to distinguish static allocative distortions from short-run inefficiencies that arise due to period-to-period adjustment costs. The set of estimating equations is comprised of the first-order conditions from the short-run shadow cost-minimization problem for the variable shadow input quantities, a set of Euler equations derived from subsequent shadow cost minimization with respect to the quasi-fixed inputs, and the input distance function, expressed in terms of shadow quantities. This system nests within it the static model with zero adjustment costs. Using panel data on U.S. electric utilities, we contrast the results of static and dynamic shadow distance systems. First, the zero-adjustment-cost restriction is strongly rejected. Second, we find that adjustment costs represent about 0.42% of total cost, and about 1.26% of capital costs. Third, while both models reveal that labor is not utilized efficiently, the dynamic model indicates a longer period of over-use and less variance over time in the degree of inefficiency. With the dynamic model, productivity growth is larger but more stable.","[Atkinson, Scott E.; Cornwell, Christopher] Univ Georgia, Dept Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Atkinson, SE (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Georgia, Dept Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",atknsn@uga.edu,,,,,,,18,3,3,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

These statistics provide a tool to examine the preferences of investors with S-shaped utility functions proposed by Kahneman and Tversky (1979) in their prospect theory and investors with RS-shaped investors proposed by Markowitz (1952a). We also derive the limiting distributions of the test statistics to be stochastic processes. In addition, we propose a bootstrap method to decide the critical points of the tests and prove the consistency of the bootstrap tests. To illustrate the applicability of our proposed statistics, we apply them to study the preferences of investors with the corresponding S-shaped and RS-shaped utility functions vis-a-vis returns on iShares and vis-a-vis returns of traditional stocks and Internet stocks before and after the Internet bubble.","[Bai, Zhidong; Li, Hua] NE Normal Univ, Sch Math & Stat, KLASMOE, 5268 Ren Min St, Chang Chun City 130024, Ji Lin Province, Peoples R China; [Liu, Huixia] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Stat & Appl Probabil, Singapore 119077, Singapore; [Wong, Wing-Keung] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, WLB, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Northeast Normal University - China; National University of Singapore; Hong Kong Baptist University,"Bai, ZD (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåNE Normal Univ, Sch Math & Stat, KLASMOE, 5268 Ren Min St, Chang Chun City 130024, Ji Lin Province, Peoples R China.",baizd@nenu.edu.cn; g0800806@nus.edu.sg; huixialiu@dbs.com; awong@hkbu.edu.hk,"Wong, Wing-Keung/AAI-9296-2020; Wong, Wing-Keung/B-8864-2013; Wong, Wing-Keung/JCN-7787-2023; Bai, Zhidong/C-1747-2012","Wong, Wing-Keung/0000-0001-6755-572X; Bai, Zhidong/0000-0002-5300-5513",Northeast Normal University; National University of Singapore; Hong Kong Baptist University; CNSF [1087-1036]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [10ssxt149]; Research Grants Council of Hong Kong [202809],Northeast Normal University; National University of Singapore(National University of Singapore); Hong Kong Baptist University; CNSF(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(Hong Kong Research Grants Council),"The authors are grateful to Professor Oliver B.

It is becoming increasingly important to evaluate not only the therapeutic value of a new drug but also the cost effectiveness compared with the most relevant treatment alternatives. Objective: The objective of this study was to estimate the cost effectiveness of denosumab compared with oral bisphosphonates (branded and generic drugs) in the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporotic women in Belgium. Methods: Cost effectiveness of 3 years of treatment with denosumab was compared with branded risedronate and branded and generic alendronate using an updated version of a previously validated Markov microsiraulation model. The model was populated with relevant cost, adherence and epidemiological data for Belgium from a payer perspective and the results were presented as costs per QALY gained ((sic), year 2009 values). Analyses were performed in populations (aged >= 60 years) in which osteoporosis medications are currently reimbursed in many European countries, i.e. those with BMD T-score of -2.5 or less or prevalent vertebral fracture. Patients receiving denosumab were assumed to have a 46% lower risk of discontinuation than those receiving oral bisphosphonates, and the effect of denosumab after treatment cessation was assumed to decline linearly to zero over a maximum of 1 year. Results: Denosumab was cost effective compared with all other therapies, assuming a willingness to pay of (sic)40 000 per QALY gained. In particular, denosumab was found to be cost effective compared with branded alendronate and risedronate at a threshold value of (sic)30 000 per QALY and denosumab was dominant (i.e. lower cost and greater effectiveness) compared with risedronate from the age of 70 years in women with a T-score of -2.5 or less and no prior fractures. The cost effectiveness of denosumab compared with generic alendronate was estimated at (sic)38 514, (sic)22 220 and (sic)27 862 per QALY for women aged 60, 70 and 80 years, respectively, with T-scores of -2.5 or less. The equivalent values were (sic)37 167, (sic)19 718 and (sic)19 638 per QALY for women with prevalent vertebral fractures. Conclusion: This study suggests, on the basis of currently available data, that denosumab is a cost-effective strategy compared with oral bisphosphonates (including generic alendronate) for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporotic women, aged >= 60 years in Belgium. Denosumab therefore appears to have the potential to become a first-line treatment for post-menopausal women with osteoporosis. However, further studies would be required to evaluate the long-term safety and adherence of denosumab in real-world clinical practice as well as head-to-head effectiveness compared with oral bisphosphonates.","[Hiligsmann, Mickael] Univ Liege, Pharmacoecon Res Unit, HEC ULg Management Sch, B-4000 Liege, Belgium",University of Liege,"Hiligsmann, M (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Liege, Pharmacoecon Res Unit, HEC ULg Management Sch, Blvd Rectorat 7,Bat B31, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.",m.hiligsmann@ulg.ac.be,"Reginster, Jean-Yves/AGC-6097-2022",,Amgen; ESCEO-Amgen,Amgen(Amgen); ESCEO-Amgen(Amgen),"Mickael Hiligsmann and Jean-Yves Reginster contributed to the conception and design of the economic model, the analysis and interpretation of the data and the writing of the manuscript.

Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, a tertiary-care adult academic hospital, has cared for an average of 100 cases of suspected HIT per year. Although the management of suspected HIT is resource intensive, few studies have assessed the cost burden associated with HIT, and none have assessed the costs of suspected HIT. Objective: The objective of this study was to identify and quantify the direct medical costs associated with suspected (confirmed and negative) HIT at a hospital in Canada. Methods: A cost-of-illness analysis was conducted in patients with suspected HIT during 2005. Resource utilization variables included (i) laboratory tests to investigate HIT; (ii) HIT-safe anticoagulant use; (iii) diagnostic imaging related to HIT or its treatment; and (iv) additional hospital days attributed to HIT. The average costs per case of confirmed HIT, confirmed HIT with thrombosis (HITT) and negative HIT were calculated in $Can, year 2007 values. Results: Confirmed HITT cases incurred substantially greater costs ($Can34 155, range 358-202 069; n = 12) than confirmed HIT cases without thrombosis ($Can4575, range 39-16 373; n = 8). The average cost of care for a negative HIT case was $Can119 (range 39-4181; n = 88). Conclusions: This is the first study to quantify the costs associated with suspected HIT cases. These cases increase the costs of hospital care and provide further justification for HIT prevention strategies.","[Nanwa, Natasha; Walker, Scott E.] Univ Toronto, Grad Dept Pharmaceut Sci, 144 Coll St,Room 658, Toronto, ON M5S 3M2, Canada; [Mittmann, Nicole] Sunnybrook Hlth Sci Ctr, Div Clin Pharmacol, HOPE Res Ctr, Toronto, ON M4N 3M5, Canada; [Knowles, Sandra; Bucci, Claudia; Walker, Scott E.] Sunnybrook Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Pharm, Toronto, ON M4N 3M5, Canada; [Bucci, Claudia; Shear, Neil] Sunnybrook Hlth Sci Ctr, Div Clin Pharmacol, Toronto, ON M4N 3M5, Canada; [Selby, Rita; Shear, Neil; Geerts, William] Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Toronto, ON M5S 3M2, Canada; [Selby, Rita] Sunnybrook Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Clin Pathol, Toronto, ON M4N 3M5, Canada",University of Toronto; University of Toronto; Sunnybrook Research Institute; Sunnybrook Health Science Center; University of Toronto; Sunnybrook Research Institute; Sunnybrook Health Science Center; University of Toronto; Sunnybrook Health Science Center; Sunnybrook Research Institute; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; Sunnybrook Health Science Center; Sunnybrook Research Institute,"Nanwa, N (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Toronto, Grad Dept Pharmaceut Sci, 144 Coll St,Room 658, Toronto, ON M5S 3M2, Canada.",natasha.nanwa@utoronto.ca,,,Bayer-Talecris-Canadian Blood Services-Hema Queb Partnership Fund; Bayer-Talecris-Canadian Blood Services,Bayer-Talecris-Canadian Blood Services-Hema Queb Partnership Fund; Bayer-Talecris-Canadian Blood Services,"Unrestricted educational grant support was received from the Bayer-Talecris-Canadian Blood Services-Hema Queb Partnership Fund.

We show that MD estimators can be obtained as solutions to a tractable lower dimensional optimization problem. This problem is similar to the one solved by the generalized empirical likelihood estimators of Newey and Smith (2004), but it is equivalent to it only for a subclass of divergences. The MD framework provides a coherent testing theory: tests for overidentification and parametric restrictions in this framework can be interpreted as semiparametric versions of Pearson-type goodness of fit tests. The higher order properties of MD estimators are also studied and it is shown that MD estimators that have the same higher order bias as the empirical likelihood (EL) estimator also share the same higher order mean square error and are all higher order efficient. We identify members of the MD class that are not only higher order efficient, but also, unlike the EL estimator, well behaved when the moment restrictions are misspecified.","LUISS Guido Carli, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Aziendali, I-00197 Rome, Italy",Luiss Guido Carli University,"Ragusa, G (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåLUISS Guido Carli, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Aziendali, Viale Romania 32, I-00197 Rome, Italy.",gragusa@luiss.it,,"Ragusa, Giuseppe/0000-0002-6964-6278",,,,,55,8,8,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 CHESTNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

In addition, a full Bayesian approach using decision theory to determine optimal sample size is given for INB. The full Bayesian approach, based on the value of information, is proposed in reaction to concerns that traditional methods rely on arbitrarily chosen error probabilities and an ill-defined notion of the smallest clinically important difference. Furthermore, the results of cost-effectiveness studies are used for decision making (e.g. should a new intervention be adopted or the old one retained), and employing decision theory, which permits optimal use of current information and the optimal design of new studies, provides a more consistent approach.","[Willan, Andrew R.] SickKids Res Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Willan, Andrew R.] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto; Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids); University of Toronto,"Willan, AR (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåCHES, 555 Univ Ave, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada.",andy@andywillan.com,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [44868-08],Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),A.R.

In this paper, we prove without any restrictions that there is a formulation of the characteristic function in which the principal branch is the correct one. Because this formulation is easier to implement and numerically more stable than the so-called rotation count algorithm of Kahl and Jackel, we solely focus on its stability in this paper.

An omnibus test fully utilizes the information in the joint conditional distribution of the underlying processes and hence has power against a vast class of continuous-time alternatives in the multifactor framework. A class of easy-to-interpret diagnostic procedures is also proposed to gauge possible sources of model misspecification. All the proposed test statistics have a convenient asymptotic N (0, 1) distribution under correct model specification, and all asymptotic results allow for some data-dependent bandwidth. Simulations show that in finite samples, our tests have reasonable size, thanks to the dimension reduction in nonparametric regression, and good power against a variety of alternatives, including misspecifications in the joint dynamics, but the dynamics of each individual component is correctly specified. This feature is not attainable by some existing tests.

An optimal decision is the one which minimizes the expected time to reach a goal before the reserve reaches a ruin level. We introduce a rescuing procedure to deal with the case that the company is too big to fail.

In the literature we find two main schools: coherent risk measures (Artzner, Coherent Measures of Risk. Risk Management: Value at Risk and Beyond, 1998) and insurance risk measures (Wang, Insur Math Econ 21: 173-183, 1997). In this note, we set to study yet another extension motivated by a third axiomatically based risk measure that has been recently introduced. In Heyde et al. (Working Paper, Columbia University, 2007), the concept of natural risk statistic is discussed as a data-based risk measure, i.e. as an axiomatic risk measure defined in the space R-n. One drawback of these kind of risk measures is their dependence on the space dimension n. In order to circumvent this issue, we propose a way to define a family {rho(n)} n=1,2,... of natural risk statistics whose members are defined on Rn and related in an appropriateway. This construction requires the generalization of natural risk statistics to the space of infinite sequences l(infinity).","[Assa, Hirbod; Morales, Manuel] Univ Montreal, Dept Math & Stat, 6128 Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada",Universite de Montreal,"Morales, M (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Montreal, Dept Math & Stat, 6128 Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.",assa@dms.umontreal.ca; morales@dms.umontreal.ca,"Balb√°s, Alejandro/AAC-3636-2022","Balb√°s, Alejandro/0000-0003-1678-0550",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) operating grant [RGPIN-311660]; Le Fonds quebecois de la recherche sur la nature et les technologies (FQRNT) operating grant [NC-113809],Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) operating grant; Le Fonds quebecois de la recherche sur la nature et les technologies (FQRNT) operating grant,This research was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) operating grant RGPIN-311660 and by Le Fonds quebecois de la recherche sur la nature et les technologies (FQRNT) operating grant NC-113809.

The EQ-5D has produced quite different utility values from that of the SF-6D. This article seeks to understand these differences using a cohort of patients with inflammatory arthritis. Objective: To examine the relationship between the disease-specific measure, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) disability index (DI) and the preference-based measures, SF-6D, EQ-5D and European League Against Arthritis (EULAR) Disease Activity Score (DAS) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Methods: Patients with RA and PsA (n = 504) attending a tertiary rheumatology referral centre completed the HAQ, SF-6D and the EQ-5D before starting biological therapy and again 12 months later. The SF-36 was converted into a utility using the preference-based SF-6D. Clinical outcomes such as the DAS, joint counts and laboratory measures were also recorded. We calculated single index utility scores from the preference-based instruments using UK population norms. We used regression analysis to derive a mapping function and calculated utility scores from the HAQDI and the DAS 28. Results: The mean utility observed at baseline for RA was 0.43 for the EQ-5D and 0.54 for the SF-6D and for PsA was 0.49 for the EQ-5D and 0.57 for the SF-6D. The utility gain demonstrated by the EQ-5D was over twice that of the SF-6D. The EQ-5D scored 17% of the RA group as less than 0 (state defined as worse than death); 7% of this group remained less than 0 at follow-up. The distribution of the utility estimates was similar for both RA and PsA. Conclusions: Our findings draw attention to the impact of states worse than death on the overall distribution for the EQ-5D derived utilities and how these impact on its use in practice. EQ-5D-derived QALY changes are over twice that of the SF-6D. The implication of this for decision makers is that cost-effectiveness evaluations for treatments in this disease class are likely to be very sensitive to the choice of utility measure.","[Adams, Roisin; Walsh, Cathal; Barry, Michael] St James Hosp, Natl Ctr Pharmacoecon, Dublin 8, Ireland; [Walsh, Cathal] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Stat, Dublin, Ireland; [Veale, Douglas; Bresnihan, Barry; FitzGerald, Oliver] Dublin Acad Healthcare, St Vincents Univ Hosp, Dublin, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin; Trinity College Dublin; University College Dublin; Saint Vincent's University Hospital,"Adams, R (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåSt James Hosp, Natl Ctr Pharmacoecon, St James St, Dublin 8, Ireland.",radams@stjames.ie,"Walsh, Chloe/AAM-1093-2020; Veale, David M/F-5670-2010","Barry, Michael/0000-0002-6232-3003; Veale, Douglas/0000-0003-2802-4971; FitzGerald, Oliver/0000-0002-6607-6070; Walsh, Cathal/0000-0001-6599-9562",Wyeth Pharmaceuticals; Schering Plough; GlaxoSmithKline; Abbott Immunology Pharmaceuticals,Wyeth Pharmaceuticals(Wyeth); Schering Plough(Merck & CompanySchering Plough Corporation); GlaxoSmithKline(GlaxoSmithKline); Abbott Immunology Pharmaceuticals,"Professor Veale has received research grants from Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Schering Plough and GlaxoSmithKline, and consulting fees from Wyeth Pharmaceuticals and Schering Plough.

The syndrome is characterized by mental impairment, frequent seizures of multiple types that are particularly resistant to treatment, and high rates of seizure-related injury. With the introduction of newer, but more costly, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), it is important that decision makers are able to assess their value in the management of this rare and difficult-to-treat condition. Objective: To evaluate the cost effectiveness, from the UK NHS perspective, of rufinamide in patients with LGS. Methods: An individual patient-simulation model was developed to estimate the total treatment-related costs and clinical benefits of rufinamide compared with topiramate and lamotrigine over a 3-year time horizon. The model examines the treatment scenarios of adding rufinamide, lamotrigine or topiramate to older AEDs (standard therapy), or standard therapy alone within a primary-care or community setting. Three placebo-controlled clinical trials of adjunctive AED treatment for children with LGS were analysed. There are no head-to-head comparator studies. Between 98 and 139 patients were randomized in each study and the mean age in each study was 10, 11 and 14 years. A mixed-treatment comparison using a random-effects model was carried out on the number of patients in each response category, using the placebo arms of the respective trials. The primary outcome measure was the percentage of successfully treated patients, defined as >50% reduction in the frequency of total seizures and drop attacks. The hypothesis being tested was formulated after data collection. Costs ( pound, year 2006/07 values) of patient monitoring, switching treatments, hospitalization due to seizure, treatment of adverse effects, and personal and social services were included in the analysis. Results of 10000 Monte Carlo simulations were bootstrapped to conduct probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Results: Over 3 years, adjunctive rufinamide resulted in higher total costs than topiramate and lamotrigine; however, with more patients being treated successfully, this leads to acceptable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. If society is prepared to pay at least E250 for a 1% increase in the number of successfully treated LGS patients, in terms of a 50% reduction in the frequency of drop attacks, the probability of the treatment with rufinamide being cost effective is >80%. Conclusion: This cost-effectiveness analysis suggests that rufinamide results in more LGS patients being treated successfully at a reasonable cost from a UK NHS perspective.","[Benedict, Agnes] United BioSource Corp, Hlth Care Analyt, London WC1A 2NS, England; [Verdian, Lara; Maclaine, Grant] Eisai Global Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Hatfield, Herts, England",United Biosource Corporation; Eisai Co Ltd,"Benedict, A (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUnited BioSource Corp, Hlth Care Analyt, 20 Bloomsbury Sq, London WC1A 2NS, England.",agnes.benedict@unitedbiosource.com,"Haenen, Alexandra/HIR-5839-2022",,,,,,40,22,24,0,10,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2010,28.0,3,,,,,185,199,,10.2165/11313640-000000000-00000,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,571NH,20151724.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000275758300003,0

We find that the credit spreads between junk-grade corporate bonds and Treasury bonds were significantly more volatile in the second half of this period when credit-related securities became popular. In contrast, investment-grade bonds exhibited no significant change in volatility. The junk bonds variance ratios changed from being less than one to greater than one. Using the GJR-Garch model, the conditional volatilities of junk bonds increased in the second half of the period and the mean reversion speeds slowed, suggesting a longer time for mean reversion to occur. Our analysis rules out treasury volatility, credit spread level, equity market return, T-bill rate, curvature of the Treasury curve, financial crisis, quantity of defaults and standard deviation of defaults as explanations for the increase in junk bond volatility. In contrast, volatility of equity returns provides a partial explanation of junk bond spread volatility in the later period.","[Hessel, Christopher; Wang, Jun] CUNY Bernard M Baruch Coll, Dept Econ & Finance, Zicklin Sch Business, New York, NY 10010 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY),"Wang, J (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåCUNY Bernard M Baruch Coll, Dept Econ & Finance, Zicklin Sch Business, 1 Bernard Baruch Way,Box B10-225, New York, NY 10010 USA.",jun_wang@baruch.cuny.edu,,,,,,,31,1,1,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Four of the committees evaluating medications for formulary inclusion are funded by, but remain at arm's length from, the government (Canada, Australia, Sweden and Scotland), while the process is fully embedded within the government in the Netherlands Each of these jurisdictions has a stated preference for comparative outcomes evidence from randomized controlled trials, but will, under certain circumstances, accept randomized evidence using surrogate markers, other comparators that are not directly relevant or non-randomized evidence. Health technology evaluation committees largely comprise health professionals, with public representatives included in the Canadian, Australian and Scottish committees Scotland is the only one of the five jurisdictions reviewed to have industry representation on the evaluation committee We identified seven characteristics that are shared across the jurisdictions reviewed and that potentially serve as insights for development of CER in the US. (i) the process must be responsive to stakeholders' interests, in that the turn-around time for assessments must be minimized, transparency must be maximized, the process must be considered fair using universally agreed standards and the process must be modifiable based on stakeholders' requirements, (ii) the assessment of medical technologies other than drugs may present different challenges and is managed separately in other HTA organizations, (m) because of the link between HTA and reimbursement decisions, completion of the HTA process following regulatory approval can delay market access to new technologies, thus closer integration between regulatory approval and HTA processes is being explored internationally, (iv) there is a direct or indirect link to reimbursement in the jurisdictions explored - without this link the role of CER in the US will remain advisory; (v) each jurisdiction reviewed benefits from a single payer that is informed by the process - given the diverse multipayer environment in the US, CER in the US may usefully focus on generating comparative effectiveness evidence; (vi) a common metric for assessing intended and unintended effects of treatment allows comparison across different technologies, and (vii) one stated focus of CER is on therapeutic benefit among 'high-priority populations', including specific demographic groups (the elderly and children, racial and ethnic minorities) and individuals with disabilities, multiple chronic conditions and specific genomic factors. This will be difficult to achieve because epidemiological evidence of differences in therapeutic benefit among subgroups is detected through effect modification, or more specifically, statistical evidence of effect measure modification, typically on relative measures of effect. Few randomized trials have enough power to detect effect modification and these have been uncommon in the scientific literature As consideration is given to the development of a publicly funded CER body in the US, much can be learned from the international experience. Nevertheless, there are some distinctive features of the US healthcare system that must be taken into account when assessing the transferability of these insights","[Levy, Adrian R.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Community Hlth & Epidemiol, Halifax, NS B3H 1V7, Canada; [Levy, Adrian R.; Johnston, Karissa M.; Harrigan, Brian; Briggs, Andrew H.] Oxford Outcomes, Oxford, England; [Levy, Adrian R.; Johnston, Karissa M.; Harrigan, Brian; Briggs, Andrew H.] Oxford Outcomes, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Mitton, Craig] Univ British Columbia, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",Dalhousie University; University of British Columbia,"Levy, AR (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåDalhousie Univ, Dept Community Hlth & Epidemiol, Room 425,5790 Univ Ave, Halifax, NS B3H 1V7, Canada.",,"Briggs, Andrew/ABA-9009-2020","Briggs, Andrew/0000-0002-0777-1997",National Pharmaceutical Council,National Pharmaceutical Council,This review was funded by the National Pharmaceutical Council The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare that are directly relevant to the contents of this review,,73,28,30,0,22,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2010,28.0,10,,,SI,,813,830,,10.2165/11536150-000000000-00000,0.0,,,18,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,660UX,20831289.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000282673000004,0

Empirical studies generally find evidence of a significant reaction of stock price or bid-ask spread before the initial announcement date, but they do not consider separately the different components of the spreads, nor do they take into account the implications of the market microstructure on the reaction of traders to merger announcements. Using intraday data, we investigate empirically the behavior of the components of 89 target firms' bid-ask spreads around the merger announcements between January 2003 and December 2006. We use the Lin, Sanger and Booth (1995) model to estimate the adverse selection component. Our results show that the information indeed leaks from 30 days prior to the announcement date. We also look at the difference between the ST and non ST, low and high market value firms and we find for ST and low market value firms, information of the announcements have already learned by the liquidity suppliers before the announcement date while the non ST and high market value firms decrease significantly after the announcement date.","[Sun Jian; Liu Jun-yong; Lu Chuang] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Accountancy, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,,,"Li, Xiaoli/JVZ-4089-2024",,,,,,24,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,1205,1210,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100168,0

This empirical study shows that from the consumer's perspective, high-priced ICT products fall into at least two categories-luxury products and high-end products. Consumers who adopt perfection-seeking, novelty-seeking, and prestige-seeking shopping styles tend to prefer a luxury product; in addition, the consumer who desires uniqueness is likely to adopt the prestige-seeking shopping style. Consumers who adopt innovation-seeking and perfection-seeking shopping styles tend to prefer a high-end product; innovation-seeking customers are more likely to pay attention to utilitarian values and accept new brands.

It's affected by many factors, such as demand, supply, environment, operation and many other factors. Knowledge management is a useful tool for business management. Its concept and analysis method are used in many areas. This paper analyzed the risk posed by the logistic company and put forward the logistics risk warning system based on the analytical framework of knowledge management. The system specifies the path of enterprise logistics risk warning. During the logistics risk warning management, information collection, assessment, prediction and warning must be taken seriously. Then the paper gave the three-dimensional graph of knowledge needs. The graph shows the sources of knowledge in logistics warning system. Finally, the article on the business logistics risk warning measures was discussed. So far, few research studies the logistics risk from the perspective of knowledge management. The building of the early warning system of logistics risk discussed in the paper was with a larger reference value and practical significance to the practice of early warning of the logistics risk management.","[Zhao Qing] NW Polytech Univ, Sch Management, Xian 710072, Peoples R China",Northwestern Polytechnical University,,,,,,,,,27,1,1,1,4,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,342,347,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100048,0

One-way monotonicity is the strictly weaker requirement forbidding this effect when v makes the opposite switch, by moving s from below t to above t. Two-way monotonicity is very strong-equivalent over any domain to strategy proofness. One-way monotonicity holds for all sensible voting rules, a broad class including the scoring rules, but no Condorcet extension for four or more alternatives is one-way monotonic. These monotonicities have interpretations in terms of strategy-proofness. For a one-way monotonic rule F, each manipulation is paired with a positive response, in which F offers the pivotal voter a strictly better result when she votes sincerely.","[Sanver, M.

Conventional methods, such as ladder or separation methods based on aggregated or grouped claims of the so-called run-off triangle, have been illustrated to have some drawbacks. Recently, individual claim loss models have attracted a great deal of interest in actuarial literature, which can overcome the shortcomings of aggregated claim loss models. In this paper, we propose an alternative individual claim loss model, which has a semiparametric structure and can be used to fit flexibly the claim loss reserving. Local likelihood is employed to estimate the parametric and nonparametric components of the model, and their asymptotic properties are discussed. Then the prediction of the IBNR claim loss reserving is investigated. A simulation study is carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper illustrates AXA and their securitization of French motor insurance in 2005 as an example. Though this application is new, this transaction is based on a concept similar to CDOs. Tranches of bonds are constructed on the basis of the expected loss ratio from motor insurance policy holders' groups. As a consequence we develop motor loss rate bonds using the structure of synthetic CDOs. The coupon payments of each tranche depend on the level of the loss rates of the underlying motor insurance pool. We show the integral formulas for the loss tranche contract where the loss distribution is modelled with discounted compound Poisson process.

This Lasso-type estimator is formed by the GMM objective function with the addition of a penalty term. The exponent of the penalty term in the regular Lasso estimator is equal to one. However, the exponent of the penalty term in the Lasso-type estimator is less than one in the analysis here. The magnitude of the exponent is reduced to avoid the asymptotic bias. This estimator selects the correct model and estimates it simultaneously. In other words, this method estimates the redundant parameters as zero in the large samples and provides the standard GMM limit distribution for the estimates of the nonzero parameters in the model. The asymptotic theory for our estimator is nonstandard. We conduct a simulation study that shows that the Lasso-type GMM correctly selects the true model much more often than the Bayesian information Criterion (BIC) and another model selection procedure based on the GMM objective function.","N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",North Carolina State University,"Caner, M (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåN Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, 4168 Nelson Hall, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",mcaner@ncsu.edu,,,,,,,23,62,82,4,26,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

The optimization problem of container shipping route operations is formulated as a mixed integer problem (MIP) by taking into account all opportunity costs involving empty container repositioning, extra short-term container leasing and unused owned container storing. The optimal process of opportunity costs in the formulation is analysed mathematically. Finally a circular shipping route operation is taken as an example to conduct the numerical experiment. Results indicate that the proposed formulation can show the quantities of containers loaded and unloaded at each calling port must be the same meanwhile the route operation profit is maximized.

Methods: Data were retrieved from a prospective, observational, non-randomized, follow-up survey. Clinical investigators assigned 265 patients with schizophrenia to either olanzapine (n = 136) or risperidone (n = 129). Patients were followed up for 2 years. Total healthcare costs were determined from the public payer perspective and calculated by multiplying resource use with official tariffs; effectiveness of the drugs was measured with the EQ-5D. This study uses a net-benefit regression approach to accommodate for baseline differences between treatment groups and uncertainty. Results: Total 2-year costs were very similar for patients receiving risperidone and olanzapine ((sic)20 915.33 and (sic)20 569.69, respectively; p = 0.925) [year 2002 values]. The health condition of the patients receiving risperidone was better than that of patients receiving olanzapine but not significantly so (1.46 and 1.41, respectively; p=0.191). Simple ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions indicated that, for lambda = (sic)40 000, we could not reject the null hypothesis that the drugs provide similar net monetary benefits to the patient (risperidone vs olanzapine (sic)2046.95; p = 0.656). When we controlled for several patient characteristics, risperidone moved further away from olanzapine but the difference did not reach statistical significance (risperidone vs olanzapine (sic)3198.07; p = 0.595). Numerous sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. Conclusion: Results of this study suggest that it is important to control for baseline patient characteristics when performing a cost-effectiveness analysis. No significant difference in net monetary benefit was found between risperidone and olanzapine.","[De Ridder, Annemieke; De Graeve, Diana] Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Dept Math Stat & Actuarial Sci, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"De Ridder, A (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Dept Math Stat & Actuarial Sci, Room B512,Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",annemieke.deridder@ua.ac.be,,"De Graeve, Diana/0000-0002-3098-5352",,,,,36,9,12,0,6,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2009,27.0,1,,,,,69,80,,10.2165/00019053-200927010-00007,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,420EZ,19178125.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000264273000007,0

The null hypothesis is stated in terms of the lack of serial correlation of the errors of the model. The tests are based on a linear transformation of a Bartlett's T(p)-process of the residuals. This transformation approximates the martingale component of the process so that it converges weakly to the standard Brownian motion under the null hypothesis. One feature of our setup is that we do not require to specify the dynamic structure of the regressors. Due to this, the transformation employs a semi-parametric correction that does not restrict the class of local alternatives that our tests can detect, in contrast with other works using smoothing techniques. A Monte Carlo study illustrates the finite sample performance of the tests.","[Delgado, Miguel A.; Velasco, Carlos] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Madrid 28903, Spain; [Hidalgo, Javier] London Sch Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Delgado, MA (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Carlos III Madrid, Madrid 28903, Spain.",delgado@est-econ.uc3m.es; f.j.hidalgo@lse.ac.uk; carlos.velasco@uc3m.es,"Delgado, Miguel A/K-6755-2014; Velasco, Carlos/K-7112-2014","Velasco, Carlos/0000-0001-5913-0107; DELGADO, MIGUEL ANGEL/0000-0002-9117-2419",Spanish 'Plan Nacional de I + D + I' [SEJ2007-62908],Spanish 'Plan Nacional de I + D + I',"The research of the first and third author is funded by the Spanish 'Plan Nacional de I + D + I', reference number SEJ2007-62908.",,11,1,1,0,1,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1368-4221,,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

However, its cost effectiveness is not well known. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness and economic attractiveness of fondaparinux relative to enoxaparin in patients with NSTE-ACS treated with triple antiplatelet therapy and early (non-urgent) invasive strategy. Methods: The decision model compares two alternative strategies: subcutaneous (SC) enoxaparin (1 mg/kg 12 hourly) versus SC fondaparinux (2.5 mg/day) in NSTE-ACS patients pre-treated with triple antiplatelet therapy and early revascularization. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses were performed from a healthcare perspective, based on a Markov model with a time horizon of the patient lifespan. Univariate sensitivity analysis and probabilistic (Monte Carlo) microsimulation analysis were performed. Results: In the base-case analysis (65 years, Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] score 4), the use of fondaparinux was associated with a significant reduction in major bleeding, a slight reduction in adverse cardiac events, and minor improvements in survival and QALYs, together with a small reduction in costs. The dominance of fondaparinux over enoxaparin remained unchanged in the univariate sensitivity analyses. According to Monte Carlo simulation, fondaparinux was cost saving in 99.9% of cases. Conclusion: Compared with enoxaparin, the use of fondaparinux in patients with NSTE-ACS managed with an early invasive strategy appears to be cost effective, even in patients with a low risk of bleeding.","[Latour-Perez, Jaime] Hosp Gen Univ Elche, Serv Med Intens, Intens Care & Coronary Unit, Elche 03203, Spain",,"Latour-Perez, J (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåHosp Gen Univ Elche, Serv Med Intens, Intens Care & Coronary Unit, Cami Vell Almassera 11, Elche 03203, Spain.",jlatour@coma.es,"de-Miguel-Balsa, Eva/B-6422-2018; Latour-Perez, Jaime/A-1038-2012","de-Miguel-Balsa, Eva/0000-0002-2117-7257; Latour-Perez, Jaime/0000-0003-1169-1292",GlaxoSmithKline,GlaxoSmithKline(GlaxoSmithKline),"The authors declare that they received no direct or indirect funding (or support of any kind) from GlaxoSmithKline or any other pharmaceutical manufacturer.

Results: Of 1393 CUAs published through 2006, 640 (45.9%) pertained to pharmaceuticals. The proportion of CUAs that focussed on pharmaceuticals increased from 34% for the period 1990-5 to 47% for the period 2001-5. Investigations with a US perspective accounted for 51% of all CUAs, although this proportion has decreased over time. The UK perspective investigations accounted for nearly 16% of all studies, and this portion has increased over time. About 24% of all CUAs were sponsored by industry, 48% were sponsored by non-industry sources, and 28% did not disclose their funding. Adherence to good methodological practices is roughly similar for studies with industry and non-industry sponsorship. Adherence to these practices has increased over time. Among the 1969 ratios meeting our inclusion criteria, the median value was $US22 000 per QALY. Logistic regression revealed that, while controlling for the intervention category (e.g. pharmaceutical, medical device, screening), ratios were more likely to be favourable if they were from studies sponsored by a pharmaceutical or device manufacturer (OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.07, 2.19). Ratios for pharmaceutical CUAs were less favourable than other ratios while controlling for sponsorship (OR 0.66; 95% CI 0.44, 0.98). Conclusion: The number of published pharmaceutical CUAs has grown steadily and accounts for almost half of all published CUAs. Adherence to good methodological practices does not appear to differ by study sponsor. Ratios from industry-sponsored studies are more favourable than other ratios. The results highlight that there are many opportunities for efficient healthcare investment, among pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions, just as there are many investments that are inefficient.","[Neumann, Peter J.; Fang, Chi-Hui; Cohen, Joshua T.] Tufts Med Ctr, Inst Clin Res & Hlth Policy Studies, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, Boston, MA 02111 USA",Tufts Medical Center,"Neumann, PJ (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåTufts Med Ctr, Inst Clin Res & Hlth Policy Studies, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, 800 Washington St, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",pneumann@tuftsmedicalcenter.org,,"Cohen, Joshua/0000-0003-1737-0991",National Library of Medicine [1G08LM008413],National Library of Medicine(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Library of Medicine (NLM)),"The CEA Registry upon which this research is based has been funded by a number of sources, including most recently the National Library of Medicine (1G08LM008413).

Published BIAs were identified by conducting a computerized search on PubMed using the search term 'budget impact analysis'. The years covered by the search included January 2000 through November 2008. Only studies (i) named by authors as BIAs and (ii) predicting financial consequences of adoption and diffusion of a new health intervention(s) within a specific healthcare setting were included. Relevant studies were evaluated according to the checklist that focuses on issues unique to BIA, highlighting areas of agreement or dissent between published studies and methodological guidelines. A total of 34 studies met the inclusion criteria, the majority published in 2007-8. Of these, 41% were from the US, 54% were prepared for pharmaceuticals and 65% had BIA as their main aim. The published BIAs were heterogeneous in respect of methods for deriving budget-impact estimates, time horizon and population. There is fairly good agreement between published studies and methodological guidelines within the scope of perspective, comparator, cost included and data sources. Specific issues that need to be addressed and/or improved are reporting format, sensitivity analysis and discounting. The results indicate that, recently, BIAs have appeared more frequently in peer-reviewed journals, providing stimulus to development, validation and dissemination of methods. Many published studies fail to reach the desired quality, but this situation should change with good research practice principles that will help codify and clarify important issues and promote standardization and transparency. Future research needs to be directed to quality assurance of published BIAs and investment in data collection for parameters specific to BIAs.","[Orlewska, Ewa] Ctr Pharmacoecon, PL-02969 Warsaw, Poland; [Gulacsi, Laszlo] Budapesti Corvinus Egyetem Corvinus Univ Budapest, Hlth Econ & Technol Assessment Res Ctr, Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest,"Orlewska, E (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåCtr Pharmacoecon, Kremowa Str 13, PL-02969 Warsaw, Poland.",ewaorlewska@go2.pl,"Gulacsi, Laszlo/HMD-6274-2023; Orlewska, Ewa/HMW-0385-2023","Gulacsi, Laszlo/0000-0002-9285-8746",,,,,50,32,35,0,15,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2009,27.0,10,,,,,807,827,,10.2165/11313770-000000000-00000,0.0,,,21,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,518XI,19803537.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271728700003,0

Advances in computer technology and capacity combined with lower start-up costs will allow developing countries to achieve greater impact when they initiate electronic health information systems. We focused on the integrated health information system that was established in Taiwan in conjunction with the launch of the National Health Insurance (NHI) programme. We used data from that health information system to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of chemotherapy use among breast cancer patients. We then used this analysis to discuss what policy makers can learn from this type of analysis. Methods: We identified a cohort of patients in the NHI Research Database who had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2001 and had received chemotherapy following surgical removal of the tumour. We followed these patients for 3 years and conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis from the payer's perspective. Using the net benefit regression approach, we compared the cost effectiveness of the two most commonly prescribed first-line chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of breast cancer in 2001 in Taiwan. The dependent variable of the regression model was the individual-level net benefit, and the independent variables included a binary variable indicating the choice of chemotherapy regimen, the patients' age, co-morbidity, type of surgery, geographic region and type of treatment facility. We employed both frequentist and Bayesian approaches in our net benefit regression analyses. In the Bayesian analysis, we applied non-informative priors to all parameters in the base-case analyses. We then explored the use of informative priors in the sensitivity analysis, using cost-effectiveness data published in the literature to form the prior distributions for the relevant parameters. Results: Over 60% of surgically treated breast cancer patients received either CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil) or CEF (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, fluorouracil). A comparison of patient characteristics indicated that patients in the CEF group tended to be younger (47.8 vs 49.1 years; p=0.016), and were significantly more likely to have undergone a mastectomy (84% vs 76%; p<0.001) and to have been treated in a teaching hospital (26% vs 13%, p<0.001). We also observed significant variations in geographic region of the location of facilities between treatment groups. On average, CEF was not cost effective in the treatment of patients with breast cancer in Taiwan, although analyses stratified by geographic region suggested a wide variation across regions. At a societal willingness to pay (WTP) of new Taiwanese dollar ($NT) 1 500 000 ($US80 000), the probability that CEF was more cost effective than CMF was 0.0%, 0.0%, 0.0% and 3.9% for the Taipei metropolitan area, and the north, middle and the combined south and east region, respectively; the probability became 0.6%, 0.0%, 1.3% and 54.5%, respectively, at a WTP of $NT5000000 ($US270000). After co-variate adjustments, the probabilities were 0.0%, 0.0%, 0.0% and 0.8%, respectively at a WTP of $NT 1500 000, and were 0.0%, 0.0%, 1.4% and 34.7% at $NT5000000. Sensitivity analyses showed that CEF potentially could have been more cost effective than CMF within a reasonable range of societal WTP (i.e. $NT 1000 000-3 000 000 or $US55 000-160 000) had the optimal dosage level for CEF been established for breast cancer patients in Taiwan. Conclusions: A population-based, fully integrated electronic health information system provides useful data to assess the cost effectiveness of competing treatments and interventions in current practice. This research may potentially inform policy makers of modifications that can be instituted to improve the cost effectiveness of a new therapy. However, findings from this study need to be interpreted with caution because the study provided information only on the short-term cost effectiveness (i.e. 3 years) of CEF compared with CMF. It is possible that a future analysis will reach a different conclusion when more years of follow-up data become available.","[Shih, Ya-Chen Tina; Pan, I-Wen] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Div Quantitat Sci, Dept Biostat, Sect Hlth Serv Res, Houston, TX 77230 USA; [Tsai, Yi-Wen] Natl Yang Ming Univ, Inst Hlth & Welf Policy, Taipei 112, Taiwan; [Tsai, Yi-Wen] Natl Yang Ming Univ, Ctr Hlth Policy Res & Dev, Natl Hlth Res Inst, Taipei 112, Taiwan",University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; National Health Research Institutes - Taiwan,"Shih, YCT (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Div Quantitat Sci, Dept Biostat, Sect Hlth Serv Res, POB 301402, Houston, TX 77230 USA.",yashih@mdanderson.org,"Pan, Iwen/M-2335-2016","Pan, Iwen/0000-0002-2781-2629; Shih, Ya-Chen Tina/0000-0001-7290-3864",Chiang Ching-Kao Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange,Chiang Ching-Kao Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange,This research was supported by a research grant from the Chiang Ching-Kao Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange.

In Thailand, there have been concerted efforts to promote evidence-based policy making, including the introduction of economic, appraisals within health technology assessment (HTA). This paper reviews the experience of this lower middle-income country, with an emphasis on the creation of the Health Intervention and Technology Assessment Program (HITAP), including its mission, management structures and activities. Over the past 3 decades, several HTA programmes were implemented in Thailand but not sustained or developed further into a national institute. As a response to increasing demands for HTA evidence including CEA information, the HITAP was created in 2007 as an affiliate unit of a semi-autonomous research arm of the Ministry Of Public Health. An advantage of this HTA programme over previous initiatives was that it was hosted by a research institute with long-term experience in conducting health systems and policy research and capacity building of its research staff, and excellent research and policy networks. To deal with existing impediments to conducting health economics research, the main strategies of the HITAP were carefully devised to include not only capacity strengthening of its researchers and administrative staff, but also the development of essential elements for the country's health economic evaluation methodology. These included, for example, methodological guidelines, standard protocols and benchmarks for resource allocation, many of which have been adopted by national policy-making bodies including the three major public health insurance plans. Networks and collaborations with domestic and foreign institutes have been sought as a means of resource mobilization and exchange. Although the HITAP is well financed by a number of government agencies and international organizations, the programme is vulnerable to shortages of qualified research staff, as most staff work on a part-time or temporary basis. To enhance the utilization of its research findings by policy makers, practitioners and consumers, the HITAP has adopted the principles of technical excellence, policy relevance, transparency, effective communication and participation of key stakeholders. These principles have been translated into good practice at every step of HTA management. In 2007 and 2008, the HITAP carried out assessments of a wide range of health products, medical procedures and public health initiatives. Although CEA and other economic evaluation approaches were employed in these studies, the tools and underlying efficiency goal were considered inadequate to provide complete information for prioritization. As suggested by official stakeholders, some of the projects investigated broader issues of management, feasibility, performance and socio-political implications of interventions. As yet, it is unclear what role HITAP research and associated recommendations have played in policy decisions. It is hoped that the lessons drawn on the creation of the HITAP and its experience during the first 2 years, as well as information on its main strategies and management structures, may be helpful for other resource-constrained countries when considering how best to strengthen their capacity to conduct economic appraisals of health technologies and interventions.","[Tantivess, Sripen] Minist Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth, Hlth Intervent & Technol Assessment Program, Nonthaburi 11000, Thailand; [Mills, Anne] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1, England",Ministry of Public Health - Thailand; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Tantivess, S (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåMinist Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth, Hlth Intervent & Technol Assessment Program, 6th Floor,Bldg 6, Nonthaburi 11000, Thailand.",sripen@ihpp.thaigov.net,,"Teerawattananon, Yot/0000-0003-2217-2930; Mills, Anne/0000-0001-9863-9950",ThaiHealth; HSRI; Bureau of Policy and Strategy; Ministry of Public Health; Thai Health-Global Link Initiative Project,ThaiHealth; HSRI; Bureau of Policy and Strategy; Ministry of Public Health; Thai Health-Global Link Initiative Project,"This paper was developed as part of work under the Social Mobilization and Public Communication Plan of the HITAP.

Use of parametric models allows one to exploit information in all lags of instruments, unconstrained by degrees of freedom limitations. Analytical calculations and simulations indicate that sometimes there are large asymptotic and finite sample efficiency gains relative to conventional estimators (Hansen, 1982), and modest gains or losses depending on data generating process and sample size relative to quasi-maximum likelihood.

We consider three model variants, which have different portfolio strategies when the risk reserve reaches the barrier or exceeds the threshold. In these models we construct a time-extended risk process defined on cycles of a specific renewal process. The time until ruin is equal to one cycle of the specific renewal process. We also consider a fourth model, which is a variant of a model proposed by Dickson and Waters (2004). The analysis of each model employs a level crossing method (LC) to derive the steady-state probability distribution of the time-extended risk process. From the derived distribution we compute the expected time until ruin, the probability distribution of the deficit at ruin, and related quantities of interest. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We compare the outcomes in homogenous populations learning in accordance with imitate the best dynamics and with replicator dynamics to outcomes in populations that mix these two learning rules. New outcomes can emerge. In certain games, a linear combination of the two rules almost always attains an equilibrium that homogenous learners almost never locate. Moreover, even when almost all weight is placed on one learning rule, the outcome can differ from homogenous use of that rule. Thus, allowing even an arbitrarily small chance of using an alternative learning style can shift a population to select a different equilibrium.","Univ Michigan, Dept Appl & Interdisciplinary Math, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Golman, R (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Michigan, Dept Appl & Interdisciplinary Math, 2082 East Hall,530 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",rgolman@umich.edu,,,,,,,36,5,6,0,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

They construct a non-partitional continuation equilibrium for a given first-period menu of contracts and conjecture that this continuation equilibrium need not be suboptimal for the whole game under small uncertainty. We show that, irrespective of the amount of uncertainty, this non-partitional continuation equilibrium generates a strictly smaller payoff for the principal than a different menu of contracts with a partitional continuation equilibrium.

Such securities are common in practice where, due to illiquidity, wealth cannot be transferred quite freely in time. We generalize some classical characterizations of superhedging to markets where trading costs may depend nonlinearly on traded amounts and portfolios may be subject to constraints. In addition to classical frictionless markets and markets with transaction costs or bid-ask spreads, our model covers markets with nonlinear illiquidity effects for large instantaneous trades. The characterizations are given in terms of stochastic term structures which generalize term structures of interest rates beyond fixed income markets as well as martingale densities beyond stochastic markets with a cash account. The characterizations are valid under a topological condition and a minimal consistency condition, both of which are implied by the no arbitrage condition in the case of classical perfectly liquid market models.

The primary aim is achieved by combining a number of recent and novel developments in stochastic mortality modelling, but these, additionally, provide us with a number of side benefits and insights for stochastic mortality modelling. By way of example, we propose an Age-Period-Cohort model which incorporates a mean-reverting stochastic spread that allows for different trends in mortality improvement rates in the short-run, but parallel improvements in the long run. Second, we fit the model using a Bayesian framework that allows us to combine estimation of the unobservable state variables and the parameters of the stochastic processes driving them into a single procedure. Key benefits of this include dampening down of the impact of Poisson variation in death counts, full allowance for paramater uncertainty, and the flexibility to deal with missing data. The framework is designed for large populations coupled with a small sub-population and is applied to the England & Wales national and Continuous Mortality Investigation assured lives males populations. We compare and contrast results based on the two-population approach with single-population results.","[Cairns, Andrew J.

By controlling the descriptive time scale of the dynamics involved, I show how market impact, linear by definition, and trading strategies lead to precise pictures for clarifying order book dynamics, consistent with what is observed empirically. I then discuss more specifically the role of market impact in the created dynamics and structure of the book and the economic implications of my studies. The article is organized as follows. In Sect. 1, I describe financial market dynamics in an agent-based market model that clarifies the role of volatility in characteristics observed on a wide range of descriptive time scales. I define in Sect. 2 the limit order book model, agents' strategies, and link liquidity provision to volatility estimates. I focus the analysis on the dynamics and structures of the book in Sect. 3.

Specifically, we consider a financial market model with several strategically interacting players who hold European contingent claims and whose trading decisions have an impact on the price evolution of the underlying. We establish the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium results for risk-neutral and CARA investors and show that the equilibrium dynamics can be characterized in terms of a coupled system of possibly nonlinear PDEs. For the linear cost function used by Almgren, we obtain a (semi) closed-form solution.

We first use asymptotic analysis techniques to calculate explicit approximations of the equilibrium bids and of the seller's revenue in any k-price auction (k = 1, 2,...). These explicit approximations show that in all large k-price auctions the effect of risk-aversion is O(1/n(2)) small. Hence, all large k-price auctions with risk-averse bidders are O(1/n(2)) revenue equivalent. The generalization, that all large auctions are O(1/n(2)) revenue equivalent, is false. Indeed, we show that there exist auction mechanisms for which the limiting revenue as n -> infinity with risk-averse bidders is strictly below the risk-neutral limit. Therefore, these auction mechanisms are not revenue equivalent to large k-price auctions even to leading-order as n -> infinity.","[Gavious, Arieh] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Fac Engn Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Fibich, Gadi] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Math Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",Ben Gurion University; Tel Aviv University,"Gavious, A (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåBen Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Fac Engn Sci, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",fibich@tau.ac.il; arieh@bgu.ac.il,"Gavious, Arieh/B-4616-2008; Fibich, Gadi/A-4116-2008","Fibich, Gadi/0000-0002-0173-7560",,,,,24,16,16,0,11,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

For the rare events, we use a compound Poisson process with log-normal jump amplitude to describe the jumps. As for the time-inhomogeneity in the market dynamics, we particularly stress the strong dependence of the domestic/foreign interest rates, the appreciation rate and the volatility of the foreign currency on the time-varying sovereign ratings in the currency market. The time-varying ratings are formulated by a continuous-time finite-state Markov chain. Based on such a spot foreign exchange rate dynamics, we then study the pricing of some currency options. Here we will adopt a so-called regime-switching Esscher transform to identify a risk-neutral martingale measure. By determining the regime-switching Esscher parameters we then get an integral expression on the prices of European-style currency options. Finally, numerical illustrations are given.

In this chapter, we review the published results and explanations. We also examine the results and show that some are at best fragile. Similarly, we discuss the suggested explanations and propose a new model based on Gaussian mixtures.

We show the measure is asymptotically normally distributed, making it amenable to inference in consequence. This Overlap measure can be used in the univariate and multivariate framework, and three examples are used to illustrate its use. The nonparametric Overlap Index has two sources of bias, the first being a positive bias induced by the unknown intersection point of the underlying distribution and the second being a negative bias induced by the expectation of cell probabilities being less than the conditional expected values. We show that the inconsistency problem generated by the first bias, prevalent within this class of Goodness of Fit measure, is limited by the number of intersection points of the underlying distributions. A Monte Carlo study was used to examine the biases, and it was found that the latter bias dominates the former. These biases can be diluted by increasing the number of partitions, but prevails asymptotically nonetheless.","[Ge, Ying] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Leo, Teng Wah] St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Econ, Antigonish, NS B2G 2W5, Canada; [Anderson, Gordon] Univ Toronto, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",University of International Business & Economics; Saint Francis Xavier University - Canada; University of Toronto,"Leo, TW (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåSt Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Econ, 1 West St, Antigonish, NS B2G 2W5, Canada.",tleo@stfx.ca,,"Leo, Teng Wah/0000-0001-9945-6128",SSHRC [410040254],SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"Part of this work was carried out in part whilst the first author was visiting the Institute for Fiscal Studies and has benefited from the help and advice of Alissa Goodman, Ian Crawford, and participants at the Macro Seminar at Wisconsin Madison and the Economics Seminar at Southern Methodist University.

Firm size can be decreased at no cost or increased subject to adjustment costs. In the optimal contract, investment takes place only if a long enough period of time elapses with no losses occurring. Then, if good performance continues, the agent is paid. As soon as a loss occurs, payments to the agent are suspended, and so is investment if further losses occur. Accumulated bad performance leads to downsizing.

The higher proportion of shares the controlling shareholder has, the smaller the motivation of tunneling is, resulting in the lower financing scale of listed companies. If the counterbalance ability of other large shareholders is strong, it is less possible for the controlling shareholder to tunnel the listed companies, thus the financing scale of listed companies is lower.

In The theory of Team Coaching, Hachman & Wageman [1] posited the team coaching functions are positively related to team performance processes and then foster team effectiveness. Also, team coaching is a leadership behavior. The exchange quality between team leader and members (LMX) may influence the effects of team coaching functions on team effectiveness.

It has been found that the correlations obtained from historical data are covered by a considerable amount of noise, which leads to a substantial error in the estimation of the portfolio risk. A method to suppress this noise is power mapping. It raises the absolute value of each matrix element to a power q while preserving the sign. In this paper we use the Markowitz portfolio optimization as a criterion for the optimal value of q and find a K/T dependence, where K is the portfolio size and T the length of the time series. Both in numerical simulations and for real market data we find that power mapping leads to portfolios with considerably reduced risk. It compares well with another noise reduction method based on spectral filtering.

The research found that environmental satisfaction, job satisfaction, conscientiousness and extraversion have a positive effect on subjective well-being. In addition, individuals married, managers and working in state sector were found to be happier in their lives than individuals who are single, in non-managerial position and in private sector. However, the research found no relationship between neuroticism, agreeableness and subjective well-being.

High fair-premium demand elasticity leads to a collapse in loss coverage, with an equilibrium premium close to the risk of the higher-risk population. Low fair-premium demand elasticity leads to an equilibrium premium close to the risk of the lower-risk population, and high loss coverage - possibly higher than under more complete risk classification. The demand elasticity parameters which are required to generate a collapse in coverage in the model in this paper appear higher than the values for demand elasticity which have been estimated in several empirical studies of various insurance markets. This offers a possible explanation of why some insurance markets appear to operate reasonably well under community rating, without the collapse in coverage which insurance folklore suggests.","Univ Kent, Sch Math Stat & Actuarial Sci, Canterbury CT2 7NF, Kent, England",University of Kent,"Thomas, RG (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Kent, Sch Math Stat & Actuarial Sci, Canterbury CT2 7NF, Kent, England.",r.g.thomas@kent.ac.uk,,,,,,,20,5,5,1,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,NOV,2009,39.0,2,,,,,403,428,,10.2143/AST.39.2.2044641,0.0,,,26,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,531DA,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000272641700002,0

First, we show that the benchmark model is nonindentified from observed bids. We also derive the restrictions imposed by the model on observables and show that these restrictions are weak. Second, we establish the nonparametric identification of the bidders' utility function under exclusion restrictions. Our primary exclusion restriction takes the form of an exogenous bidders' participation, leading to a latent distribution of private values that is independent of the number of bidders. The key idea is to exploit the property that the bid distribution varies with the number of bidders while the private value distribution does not. We then extend these results to endogenous bidders' participation when the exclusion restriction takes the form of instruments that do not affect the bidders' private value distribution. Though derived for a benchmark model, our results extend to more general cases such as a binding reserve price, affiliated private values, and asymmetric bidders.

Our approach, thus, can be readily generalized to other distributional statistics.","[Firpo, Sergio] Fundacao Getulio Vargas, Escola Econ Sao Paulo, BR-01332000 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Fortin, Nicole M.] Canadian Inst Adv Res, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Fortin, Nicole M.; Lemieux, Thomas] Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada",Getulio Vargas Foundation; Escola de Pos-Graduacao em Economia (EPGE); Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR); University of British Columbia,"Firpo, S (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåFundacao Getulio Vargas, Escola Econ Sao Paulo, Rua Itapeva 474, BR-01332000 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",sergio.firpo@fgv.br; nifortin@interchange.ubc.ca; tlemieux@interchange.ubc.ca,,"Firpo, Sergio/0000-0003-2545-7536",CNPq,CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"We thank the co-editor and three referees for helpful suggestions.

This parameterized approach utilizes Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), based on heteroscedastic Poisson (non-additive) error structures, and using an orthonormal polynomial design matrix. Principal Component (PC) analysis is then applied to the cross-sectional fitted parameters. The produced model can be viewed either as a one-factor parameterized model where the time series are the fitted parameters, or as a principal component model, namely a log-bilinear hierarchical statistical association model of Goodman [Goodman, L.A., 1991. Measures, models, and graphical displays in the analysis of cross-classified data. J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 86(416), 1085-1111] or equivalently as a generalized Lee-Carter model with p interaction terms. Mortality forecasts are obtained by applying dynamic linear regression models to the PCs.

In the case of a continuum of strikes, we complement the optimal lower bound for spread options obtained in [Rapuch, G., Roncalli, T., 2002. Pricing multiasset options and credit derivatives with copula, Credit Lyonnais, Working Papers] by describing its corresponding subreplicating strategy. This result is explored numerically in a Black-Scholes and in a CEV setting. In the case of discrete strikes, we solve in closed form the optimization problem in which, for each asset S-1 and S-2, forward prices and the price of one option are used as constraints on the marginal distributions of each asset. We provide a partial solution in the case where the marginal distributions are constrained by two strikes per asset. Numerical results on real NYMEX (New York Mercantile Exchange) crack spread option data show that the one discrete lower bound can be far and also very close to the traded price. In addition, the one strike closed form solution is very close to the two strike. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

As the occurrence of dam destruction is beyond the control of the owner of the dam, the research of the countermeasures against the destruction risk of Chinese dams should be focused on the ways of minimizing the dam bombing calamity and reducing the failure probability of the safety and protection system.

We identified and reviewed all cost-effectiveness studies of influenza vaccination in those aged 50-64 years published before July 2008. While the studies suggest that vaccination in this age-group is likely to be cost effective, these results were dependent on several key assumptions. The estimates of serious outcomes due to influenza and the estimates of vaccine effectiveness (VE) against these outcomes were found to have the most influence on cost effectiveness. However, due to factors including mismatches between the measure of VE and the outcome under consideration, as well as various other data limitations, there is significant uncertainty around these key assumptions that was not well explored. There was a failure in some studies to report fundamental inputs such as discount rates. Overall, there was a general lack of transparency in the studies and, consequently, the conclusions around the cost effectiveness of influenza vaccine in those aged 50-64 years must be interpreted with caution.","[Scuffham, Paul A.] Griffith Univ, Sch Med, Meadowbrook, Qld 4131, Australia; [Harsley, Stuart] CSL Biotherapies, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Kelly, Heath] Victorian Infect Dis Reference Lab, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Kelly, Heath] Univ Melbourne, Sch Populat Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Newall, Anthony T.] Childrens Hosp Westmead, Natl Ctr Immunisat Res & Surveillance Vaccine Pre, Westmead, NSW, Australia; [Newall, Anthony T.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Publ Hlth & Community Med, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University - Logan Campus; CSL; Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory; University of Melbourne; NSW Health; The Children's Hospital at Westmead; University of Sydney; Sydney Childrens Hospitals Network; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Scuffham, PA (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåGriffith Univ, Sch Med, L03 2-43,Logan Campus, Meadowbrook, Qld 4131, Australia.",p.scuffham@griffith.edu.au,"Scuffham, Paul/AAS-8084-2021","Scuffham, Paul/0000-0001-5931-642X; Newall, Anthony/0000-0003-0836-1065",GlaxoSmithKline Australia,GlaxoSmithKline Australia(GlaxoSmithKline),Anthony Newell has received research grants for investigator-driven research from GlaxoSmithKline Australia.

The Garhwal Himalaya is located in the centre of the Himalayan Mountain System. Characterized by harsh climatic conditions, rough, rugged and precipitous terrain, fragile landscape and economically backwardness, about 95% of the total population is inhabited in rural areas. Traditional cereal farming is the main occupation of the populace as about 80% population is engaged in the production of cereal crops and livestock farming. The farming system in Garhwal Himalaya is peculiar, which is based upon the centuries old practices and carried out mainly on the narrow patches of the terraced fields. The main crops grown are paddy, wheat barley, millets, pulses, and oilseeds. The economic viability of these crops is insufficient even to meet the food requirement of the populace but these crops are environmentally sound and suitable for this ecologically fragile terrain. The scope for further expansion and modernization of agriculture practices is not viable due to the fragility of terrain and precipitous slope. Therefore, an exodus of population emigrated to the foothills of Himalaya and major urban centres of country for the search of job or recruited in national Army. Enhancing and diversifying livelihood options, other than biomass-based production, will definitely raise the income and food-security of the rural mountain people, as the agro-climatic conditions in this region are very much feasible for the cultivation of cash generating crops. Therefore, the scope of cultivation of off-season vegetables, fruits, medicinal plants and collection of non-timber based forest products are tremendous. Cultivation of fruits will also manifest a way for ecological restoration of the fragi le terrain and will enhance the economic level and sustainable livelihood of the inhabitants. Thus, it is suggested that the optimum harnessing of these products will surely provide a base for sustainable livelihood in the region. Data on farming systems were gathered from the primary and secondary sources. Primary data were gathered through structured questionnaire and household survey was done to study of agricultural pattern and production trend. Case studies of the villages were also done for collection of data on horticultural practices.",,,,sati.vp@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,1,1,0,4,LITHUANIAN UNIV AGRICULTURE,KAUNO RAJ,"STUDENTU 11, AKADEMIJA, KAUNO RAJ, LT-53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2009,,,,,,,399,407,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BNL14,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000274845200070,0

Working capital management, as the core content of short-term corporate finance, is vital to enterprises' survival and development and plays an important role in maximizing shareholders' wealth. In this paper, we test the differences in profitability and risk levels from 2002 to 2006 between Chinese listed companies which pursue positive and negative working capital policies with the method of One-Way ANOVA. Furthermore, the first sample is eventually subdivided according to net commercial credits into two sub-ones, namely positive and negative commercial credits. Same analyses are done on above two sub-samples again. To find out how and what factors influence enterprises' profitability through different working capital polices, we do linear regression analyses. The results show: the proportion of Chinese listed companies which adopt the policy of negative working capital is steadily rising year by year; they have gained greater improvement in performance; however, relatively higher risk can not be ignored; companies can improve their performance by increasing the ratio of current assets to total assets (CAAR), the ratio of net cash inflows from operating activities to current liabilities (COACL), growth rate of total assets(GRA) and the size of total assets(LNAT) or shortening days of working capital (DWC) and reducing the ratio of current liabilities to total assets(CLAR). In this paper, net commercial credits are firstly introduced into working capital research and as much attention is paid to risk indicators as to profitability ones. Such a practice is absolutely a meaningful try in this type of study. The conclusion of this paper not only supports the concept of negative working capital and its technical application, but also gives useful suggestions to listed companies both in China and other countries.","[Wang, Dongmei; Liu, Na] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Sch Business Adm, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS",,dmwang@gucas.ac.cn; happysophialiu@163.com,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,12,UNIVERSE ACADEMIC PRESS TORONTO,TORONTO,"1 SPADINA CRESCENT, ROOM 205, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 3G3, CANADA",,,978-1-926642-01-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,549,556,,,,,,8,"Business; Economics; Management; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BLY20,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271409600094,0

This paper focus on typhoon disaster, which has become one of disasters most seriously happened in China so far since 1990. Then, the article has a simulation study based on bond pricing model. The result manifests that China's typhoon losses distribution is adaptive to Gamma process. The losses frequency is adaptive to Poisson process. By assuming Binomial interest rate changes in no-arbitrage opportunities, it will be possible to design an elementary price system for typhoon Cat bond in different periods and interest rate in China.

We begin with a discussion of the typical contract design, the current state of the market, as well as major areas of application. Subsequently, a two-stage contingent claims pricing approach is proposed, which distinguishes between the main risk drivers ex-ante as well as during the loss reestimation phase and additionally incorporates counterparty default risk. Catastrophe occurrence is modeled as a doubly stochastic Poisson process (Cox process) with mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck intensity. In addition, we fit various parametric distributions to normalized historical loss data for hurricanes and earthquakes in the US and find the heavy-tailed Burr distribution to be the most adequate representation for loss severities. Applying our pricing model to market quotes for hurricane and earthquake contracts, we derive implied Poisson intensities which are subsequently condensed into a common factor for each peril by means of exploratory factor analysis. Further examining the resulting factor scores, we show that a first order autoregressive process provides a good fit. Hence, its continuous-time limit, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process should be well suited to represent the dynamics of the Poisson intensity in a cat swap pricing model. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This estimator accommodates a more general set of moment restrictions than the standard generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator. More specifically, the XMM differs from the GMM in that it can handle not only uniform conditional moment restrictions (i. e., valid for any value of the conditioning variable), but also local conditional moment restrictions valid for a given fixed value of the conditioning variable. The local conditional moment restrictions are of special relevance in derivative pricing to reconstruct the pricing operator on a given day by using the information in a few cross sections of observed traded derivative prices and a time series of underlying asset returns. The estimated derivative prices are consistent for a large time series dimension, but a fixed number of cross sectionally observed derivative prices. The asymptotic properties of the XMM estimator are nonstandard, since the combination of uniform and local conditional moment restrictions induces different rates of convergence (parametric and nonparametric) for the parameters.","[Gagliardini, P.] USI, Fac Econ, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland; [Gourieroux, C.] Lab Finance Assurance, F-92245 Malakoff, France; [Gourieroux, C.] Univ Toronto, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada; [Renault, E.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Renault, E.] CIRANO CIREQ Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Gagliardini, P.] Swiss Finance Inst, Zurich, Switzerland",Universita della Svizzera Italiana; University of Toronto; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Universite de Montreal; Swiss Finance Institute (SFI),"Gagliardini, P (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUSI, Fac Econ, Via Buffi 13, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland.",patrick.gagliardini@usi.ch; Christian.Gourieroux@ensae.fr; renault@email.unc.edu,,,Swiss National Science Foundation through NCCR FINRISK network; NSERC Canada; AXA/Risk Foundation,Swiss National Science Foundation through NCCR FINRISK network(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); NSERC Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); AXA/Risk Foundation,"We thank D.

For most of the proposed test statistics, such as the well-known Box-Pierce test statistic with fixed lag truncation number, the asymptotic null distributions are obtained under independent and identically distributed assumptions and may not be valid for dependent white noise. Because of recent popularity of conditional heteroskedastic models (e.g., generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic [GARCH] models), which imply nonlinear dependence with zero autocorrelation, there is a need to understand the asymptotic properties of the existing test statistics under unknown dependence. In this paper, we show that the asymptotic null distribution of the Box-Pierce test statistic with general weights still holds under unknown weak dependence as long as the lag truncation number grows at an appropriate rate with increasing sample size. Further applications to diagnostic checking of the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) and fractional autoregressive integrated moving average (FARIMA) models with dependent white noise errors are also addressed. Our results go beyond earlier ones by allowing non-Gaussian and conditional heteroskedastic errors in the ARMA and FARIMA models and provide theoretical support for some empirical findings reported in the literature.","Univ Illinois, Dept Stat, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Shao, XF (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Illinois, Dept Stat, 725 S Wright St, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",xshao@uiuc.edu,,,NSF [DMS-0804937]; Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien [0804937] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),"I thank Professor Pentti Saikkonen and two referees for constructive comments that led to improvement of the paper.

This paper, instead, takes the weak convergence of some function of the data to a limiting random element as the starting point and studies efficiency in the class of tests that remain asymptotically valid for all models that induce the same weak limit. It is found that efficient tests in this class are simply given by efficient tests in the limiting problem-that is, with the limiting random element assumed observed-evaluated at sample analogues. Efficient tests in the limiting problem are usually straightforward to derive, even in nonstandard testing problems. What is more, their evaluation at sample analogues typically yields tests that coincide with suitably robustified versions of optimal tests in canonical parametric versions of the model. This paper thus establishes an alternative and broader sense of asymptotic efficiency for many previously derived tests in econometrics, such as tests for unit roots, parameter stability tests, and tests about regression coefficients under weak instruments.","Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"M√ºller, UK (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåPrinceton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",umueller@princeton.edu,,,NSF [SES-0751056],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"A previous version of this paper was circulated under the title An Alternative Sense of Asymptotic Efficiency.

While there is no theoretical reason to restrict the measurement of QALYs to patients, decisions have to be made about which carers to consider, what instruments to use and how to aggregate and present QALYs for carers and patients. Current, albeit limited, practice in measuring QALY gains to carers in economic evaluation varies, suggesting that there may be inconsistency in judgements about whether interventions are deemed cost effective. While conventional health-related quality-of-life tools can, in theory, be used to estimate QALYs, there are both theoretical and empirical concerns over the suitability of their use with carers. Measures that take a broader view of health or well-being may be more appropriate. Incorporating QALYs of carers in economic evaluations may have important distributional consequences and, therefore, greater normative discussion over the appropriateness of incorporating these impacts is required. In the longer term, more flexible forms of cost-per-QALY analysis may be required to take account of the broader impacts on carers and the weight these impacts should receive in decision making.","[Al-Janabi, Hareth; Coast, Joanna] Univ Birmingham, Hlth Econ Unit, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Flynn, Terry N.] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Study Choice CenSoC, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Birmingham; University of Technology Sydney,"Al-Janabi, H (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Birmingham, Hlth Econ Unit, Publ Hlth Bldg, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",h.aljanabi@bham.ac.uk,,"Al-Janabi, Hareth/0000-0002-3691-8310; Coast, Joanna/0000-0002-3537-5166","Medical Research Council [G0800808, G1002334] Funding Source: Medline; MRC [G0800808, G1002334] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [G1002334, G0800808] Funding Source: researchfish",Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),,,58,59,64,0,16,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2011,29.0,12,,,,,1015,1023,,10.2165/11593940-000000000-00000,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,856CG,22077576.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297613700002,0

We show that the stationary wealth distribution is a Pareto distribution in the right tail and that it is capital income risk, rather than labor income, that drives the properties of the right tail of the wealth distribution. We also study analytically the dependence of the distribution of wealth-of wealth inequality in particular-on various fiscal policy instruments like capital income taxes and estate taxes, and on different degrees of social mobility. We show that capital income and estate taxes can significantly reduce wealth inequality, as do institutions favoring social mobility.

We assume that trading is instantaneous and the dynamics of the stock to be liquidated follows a geometric Brownian motion. The solution to the impulse control problem is computed at each time step by solving a linear partial differential equation and a maximization problem. In contrast to results obtained from the static formulation of Almgren and Chriss [J. Risk, 2000, 3, 5-39], when risk is not considered, the optimal liquidation strategy from our stochastic control formulation depends on temporary market impact cost and permanent market impact cost parameters. In addition, our computational results indicate the following properties of the optimal execution strategy from the stochastic control formulation. Due to the existence of a no-transaction region, it may not be optimal for some individuals to sell their assets on some trading dates. As the value of the permanent market impact parameter increases, the expected optimal amount liquidated at the terminal time increases. As the value of the quadratic temporary impact cost parameter increases, the expected optimal amount liquidated at trading times tends to be uniform, and the no-transaction region shrinks. In the presence of quadratic temporary market impact costs, in contrast to optimal strategies that result from fixed and/or proportional transaction costs alone, portfolios in the selling region are neither re-balanced into the no-transaction region nor into the sell and no-transaction interface.","[Draviam, Thangaraj; Coleman, Thomas F.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Combinator & Optimizat, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Li, Yuying] Univ Waterloo, David R Cheriton Sch Comp Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo; University of Waterloo,"Coleman, TF (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Waterloo, Dept Combinator & Optimizat, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",tfcoleman@uwaterloo.ca,,,National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; TD Securities Inc.,National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); TD Securities Inc.,This work was supported by the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and by TD Securities Inc.

Despite the many stock return models taking this fact into account, there are only a few credit default models that take it into consideration. In this paper we present a default model based on nested Archimedean copulas that is able to capture hierarchical dependence structures among the obligors in a credit portfolio. Nested Archimedean copulas have a surprisingly simple and intuitive interpretation. The dependence among all companies in the same sector is described by an inner copula and the sectors are then coupled via an outer copula. Consequently, our model implies a larger default correlation for companies in the same industry sector than for companies in different sectors. A calibration to CDO tranche spreads of the European iTraxx portfolio is performed to demonstrate the fitting capability of the model. This portfolio consists of CDS on 125 companies from six different industry sectors and is therefore an excellent portfolio for a comparison of our generalized model with a traditional copula model of the same family that does not take different sectors into account.","[Hofert, Marius] Univ Ulm, Inst Number Theory & Probabil Theory, D-89081 Ulm, Germany; [Scherer, Matthias] Tech Univ Munich, HVB Stiftungsinst Finanzmath, D-85748 Garching, Germany",Ulm University; Technical University of Munich,"Hofert, M (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Ulm, Inst Number Theory & Probabil Theory, Helmholtzstr 18, D-89081 Ulm, Germany.",marius.hofert@uni-ulm.de,,,,,,,24,54,57,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

However, when such trade-offs relate to the introduction of new, promising health technologies, perceived 'winners' and 'losers' are more apparent. In recent years, public scrutiny over such decisions has intensified, raising the need to better understand how they are currently made and how they might be improved. The objective of this paper is to critically review and compare current processes for making health technology funding decisions at the regional, state/provincial and national level in 20 countries. A comprehensive search for published, peer-reviewed and grey literature describing actual national, state/provincial and regional/institutional technology decision-making processes was conducted. Information was extracted by two independent reviewers and tabulated to facilitate qualitative comparative analyses. To identify strengths and weaknesses of processes identified, websites of corresponding organizations were searched for commissioned reviews/evaluations, which were subsequently analysed using standard qualitative methods. A total of 21 national, four provincial/state and six regional/institutional-level processes were found. Although information on each one varied, they could be grouped into four sequential categories: (i) identification of the decision problem; (ii) information inputs; (iii) elements of the decision-making process; and (iv) public accountability and decision implementation. While information requirements of all processes appeared substantial and decision-making factors comprehensive, the way in which they were utilized was often unclear, as were approaches used to incorporate social values or equity arguments into decisions. A comprehensive inventory of approaches to implementing the four main components of all technology funding decision-making processes was compiled, from which areas for future work or research aimed at improving the acceptability of decisions were identified. They include the explication of decision criteria and social values underpinning processes.","[Stafinski, Tania] Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, Hlth Technol & Policy Unit, Res Transit Facil, Edmonton, AB T6G 2V2, Canada; [McCabe, Christopher] Univ Leeds, Acad Unit Hlth Econ, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Alberta; University of Leeds,"Stafinski, T (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, Hlth Technol & Policy Unit, Res Transit Facil, Room 3021,8308-114 St, Edmonton, AB T6G 2V2, Canada.",tanias@ualberta.ca,"McCabe, Christopher J/E-2051-2016",,Canadian Institutes of Health Research,Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),This study was funded through a New Emerging Team Grant on Cancer Technology Decision Making awarded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.,,226,52,55,0,18,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2011,29.0,6,,,,,475,495,,10.2165/11586420-000000000-00000,0.0,,,21,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,776BI,21568357.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000291509100003,0

Various theories of decision making have been tested and methods piloted, but, despite their availability, evidence of sustained uptake is limited. Since the challenge of determining which of many technologies to fund is one that healthcare systems have faced since their inception, an analysis of actual processes, criticisms confronted and approaches used to manage them may serve to guide the development of an 'evidence-informed' decision-making framework for improving the acceptability of decisions. Objective: The purpose of this study was to develop a technology funding decision-making framework informed by the experiences of multiple healthcare systems and the views of senior-level decision makers in Canada. Methods: A 1-day, facilitated workshop was held with 16 senior-level healthcare decision makers in Canada. International examples of actual technology funding decision-making processes were presented. Participants discussed key elements of these processes, debated strengths and weaknesses and highlighted unresolved challenges. The findings were used to construct a technology decision-making framework on which participant feedback was then sought. Its relevance, content, structure and feasibility were further assessed through key informant interviews with ten additional senior-level decision makers. Results: Six main issues surrounding current processes were raised: (i) timeliness; (ii) methodological considerations; (iii) interpretations of 'value for money'; (iv) explication of social values; (v) stakeholder engagement; and (vi) 'accountability for reasonableness'. While no attempt was made to force consensus on what should constitute each of these, there was widespread agreement on questions that must be addressed through a 'robust' process. These questions, grouped and ordered into three phases, became the final framework. Conclusions: A decision-making framework informed by processes in other jurisdictions and the views of local decision makers was developed. Pilot testing underway in one Canadian jurisdiction will identify any further refinements needed to optimize its usefulness.","[Stafinski, Tania] Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, Hlth Technol & Policy Unit, Res Transit Facil, Edmonton, AB T6G 2V2, Canada; [McCabe, Christopher] Univ Leeds, Acad Unit Hlth Econ, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Alberta; University of Leeds,"Stafinski, T (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, Hlth Technol & Policy Unit, Res Transit Facil, Room 3021,8308-114 St, Edmonton, AB T6G 2V2, Canada.",tanias@ualberta.ca,"McCabe, Christopher J/E-2051-2016",,Canadian Institutes of Health Research,Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),The authors thank Leigh-Ann Topfer for her invaluable help with the literature search.

I offer a simple explanation for this: benefits and costs of technologies are heterogeneous, so that farmers with low net returns do not adopt the technology. I examine this hypothesis by estimating a correlated random coefficient model of yields and the corresponding distribution of returns to hybrid maize. This distribution indicates that the group of farmers with the highest estimated gross returns does not use hybrid, but their returns are correlated with high costs of acquiring the technology (due to poor infrastructure). Another group of farmers has lower returns and adopts, while the marginal farmers have zero returns and switch in and out of use over the sample period. Overall, adoption decisions appear to be rational and well explained by (observed and unobserved) variation in heterogeneous net benefits to the technology.","MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Suri, T (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåMIT, Sloan Sch Management, 100 Main St,E62-517, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",tavneet@mit.edu,,,Yale Center; Lindsay Fellowship; Agrarian Studies Program at Yale; USAID,Yale Center; Lindsay Fellowship; Agrarian Studies Program at Yale; USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"I would like to thank three anonymous referees for extensive comments that have substantially improved the paper.

While one in five individuals smoke, and 70% of these indicate a desire to quit, <5% of unaided quit attempts succeed. Cessation aids can double or triple the odds of successfully quitting. Models of smoking-cessation behaviour can elucidate the implications of individual abstinence patterns to allow better tailoring of quit attempts to an individual's characteristics. Objective: The objectives of this study were to develop and validate a discrete-event simulation (DES) to evaluate the benefits of smoking abstinence using data from the pooled pivotal clinical trials of varenicline versus bupropion or placebo for smoking cessation and to provide a foundation for the development of a lifetime smoking-cessation model. Methods: The DES model simulated the outcome of a single smoking-cessation attempt over 1 year, in accordance with the clinical trial timeframes. Pharmaceutical costs were assessed from the perspective of a healthcare payer. The model randomly sampled patient profiles from the pooled varenicline clinical trials. All patients were physically and mentally healthy adult smokers who were motivated to quit abruptly. The model allowed for comparisons of up to five distinct treatment approaches for smoking cessation. In the current analyses, three interventions corresponding to the clinical trials were evaluated, which included brief counselling plus varenicline 1.0 mg twice daily (bid) or bupropion SR 150 mg bid versus placebo (i.e. brief counselling only). The treatment periods in the clinical trials were 12 weeks (target quit date: day 8), with a 40-week non-treatment follow-up, and counselling continuing over the entire 52-week period in all treatment groups. The main outcome modelled was the continuous abstinence rate (CAR; defined as complete abstinence from smoking and confirmed by exhaled carbon monoxide <= 10 ppm) at end of treatment (weeks 9-12) and long-term follow-up (weeks 9-52), and total time abstinent from smoking over the course of 52 weeks. The model also evaluated costs and cost-effectiveness outcomes. Results: For the varenicline, bupropion and placebo cohorts, respectively, the model predicted CARs for weeks 9-12 of 44.3%, 30.4% and 18.6% compared with observed rates of 44.0%, 29.7% and 17.7%; over weeks 9-52, predicted CARs in the model compared with observed rates in the pooled clinical studies were 22.9%, 16.4% and 9.4% versus 22.4%, 15.4% and 9.3%, respectively. Total mean abstinence times accrued in the model varenicline, bupropion and placebo groups, respectively, were 3.6, 2.6 and 1.5 months and total pharmaceutical treatment costs were $US261, $US442 and $US0 (year 2008 values) over the 1-year model period. Using cost per abstinent-month achieved as a measure of cost effectiveness, varenicline dominated bupropion and yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of SUS 124 compared with placebo. Conclusion: The model accurately replicated abstinence patterns observed in the clinical trial data using individualized predictions and indicated that varenicline was more effective and may be less costly than bupropion. This simulation incorporated individual predictions of abstinence and relapse, and provides a framework for lifetime modelling that considers multiple quit attempts over time in diverse patient populations using a variety of quit attempt strategies.","[Marton, Jeno P.; Willke, Richard J.; Davies, Simon] Pfizer Inc, Primary Care Business Unit, New York, NY 10017 USA; [Xenakis, James G.; Kinter, Elizabeth T.; Ward, Alexandra J.; Caro, J.

This shows that the structures of the forecast equations are identical, but with different dependencies on the forecast horizon. The process equations for the forward variance are induced by the process equations for an ARCH model, but postulated in a market model. In the ARCH case, they are different from the usual diffusive type. The conceptual differences between both approaches and their implication for volatility forecasts are analysed. The volatility forecast is compared with the realized volatility (the volatility that will occur between date t and t + T), and the implied volatility (corresponding to an at-the-money option with expiry at t + T). For the ARCH forecasts, the parameters are set a priori. An empirical analysis across multiple time horizons T shows that a forecast provided by an I-GARCH(1) process (one time scale) does not capture correctly the dynamics of the realized volatility. An I-GARCH(2) process (two time scales, similar to GARCH(1,1)) is better, while a long-memory LM-ARCH process (multiple time scales) replicates correctly the dynamics of the implied and realized volatilities and delivers consistently good forecasts for the realized volatility.","Swissquote Bank, CH-1196 Gland, Switzerland",,"Zumbach, G (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåSwissquote Bank, Chemin Cretaux 33, CH-1196 Gland, Switzerland.",gilles.zumbach@swissquote.com,,,,,,,16,3,3,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We show that the estimated common factors can be used as instrumental variables and they are more efficient than the observed variables in our framework. Whereas standard optimal generalized method of moments estimator using a large number of instruments is biased and can be inconsistent, the factor instrumental variable estimator (FIV) is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal, even if the number of instruments exceeds the sample size. Furthermore, FIV remains consistent even if the observed variables are invalid instruments as long as the unobserved common components are valid instruments. We also consider estimating panel data models in which all regressors are endogenous but share exogenous common factors. We show that valid instruments can be constructed from the endogenous regressors.

The wavelet approach is appealing, since it is based directly on the different behavior of the spectra of a unit root process and that of a short memory stationary process. By decomposing the variance (energy) of the underlying process into the variance of its low frequency components and that of its high frequency components via the discrete wavelet transformation (DWT), we design unit root tests against near unit root alternatives. Since DWT is an energy preserving transformation and able to disbalance energy across high and low frequency components of a series, it is possible to isolate the most persistent component of a series in a small number of scaling coefficients. We demonstrate the size and power properties of our tests through Monte Carlo simulations.","[Gencay, Ramazan] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Fan, Yanqin] Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",Simon Fraser University; Vanderbilt University,"Gencay, R (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåSimon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",rgencay@sfu.ca,"Gencay, Ramazan/A-1905-2008",,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"This is a substantially shortened version of the paper Unit root and cointegration tests with wavelets.

We contribute to the literature by making a qualitative observation that the incidental parameters problem in this model may not be not as severe as in the conventional case. Because fixed effects have finite support, the probability of correctly identifying the fixed effect converges to one even when the cross sectional dimension grows as fast as some exponential function of the time dimension.

Once detected, however, there has been little attempt to quantify its welfare cost or to assess whether and what potential government interventions may reduce these costs. To do so, we develop a model of annuity contract choice and estimate it using data from the U.K. annuity market. The model allows for private information about mortality risk as well as heterogeneity in preferences over different contract options. We focus on the choice of length of guarantee among individuals who are required to buy annuities. The results suggest that asymmetric information along the guarantee margin reduces welfare relative to a first-best symmetric information benchmark by about 127 pound million per year or about 2 percent of annuitized wealth. We also find that by requiring that individuals choose the longest guarantee period allowed, mandates could achieve the first-best allocation. However, we estimate that other mandated guarantee lengths would have detrimental effects on welfare. Since determining the optimal mandate is empirically difficult, our findings suggest that achieving welfare gains through mandatory social insurance may be harder in practice than simple theory may suggest.","[Einav, Liran] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Finkelstein, Amy; Schrimpf, Paul] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Einav, Liran] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Einav, L (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåStanford Univ, Dept Econ, 579 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",leinav@stanford.edu; afink@mit.edu; paul_s@mit.edu,,"Schrimpf, Paul/0000-0003-1188-1563",National Institute of Aging [R01 AG032449]; National Science Foundation [SES-0643037]; Social Security Administration [10-P-98363-3]; Alfred P.

The present work reformulates this in the language of random walks and extends it to price a variety of other discretely monitored path-dependent options. Analytic arguments familiar in the applied mathematics literature are used to obtain fluctuation identities. This includes casting the famous identities of Baxter and Spitzer in a form convenient to price barrier, first-touch, and hindsight options. Analyzing random walks killed by two absorbing barriers with a modified Wiener-Hopf technique yields a novel formula for double-barrier option prices. Continuum limits and continuity correction approximations are considered. Numerically, efficient results are obtained by implementing Pade approximation. A Gaussian Black-Scholes framework is used as a simple model to exemplify the techniques, but the analysis applies to Levy processes generally.","[Green, Ross; Abrahams, I.

In our model, myopic investors dynamically allocate capital between a riskless asset and an actively managed fund which charges fraction-of-fund fees. The presence of dynamic flows induces flow hedging portfolio distortions on the part of the fund, even though investors are myopic. Our model predicts a positive relationship between a fund's proportional fee rate and its volatility. This is a consequence of higher-fee funds holding more extreme equity positions. Although both the fund portfolio and investors' trading strategies depend on the proportional fee rate, the equilibrium value functions do not. Finally, we show that our results hold even if investors are allowed to directly trade some of the risky securities.","[Hugonnier, Julien] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Swiss Finance Inst, Quartier UNIL Dorigny, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Kaniel, Ron] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, CEPR, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Swiss Finance Institute (SFI); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Duke University,"Hugonnier, J (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåEcole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Swiss Finance Inst, Quartier UNIL Dorigny, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",Julien-Hugonnier@epfl.ch,,"Hugonnier, Julien/0000-0003-1356-5070",,,,,45,22,24,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

Fudenberg and Levine also defined a concept of consistency, and claimed in their Theorem 4 that with consistency and other conditions on beliefs, a self-confirming equilibrium has a Nash equilibrium outcome. We provide a counterexample that disproves Theorem 4 and prove an alternative by replacing consistency with a more restrictive concept, which we call strong consistency. In games with observed deviators, self-confirming equilibria are strongly consistent self-confirming equilibria. Hence, our alternative theorem ensures that despite the counterexample, the corollary of Theorem 4 is still valid.","Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Kamada, Y (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåHarvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",ykamada@fas.harvard.edu,,,,,,,8,4,4,1,11,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0012-9682,,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAR,2010,78.0,2,,,,,823,832,,10.3982/ECTA7496,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,581GB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000276508500015,0

A simple consistent GMM estimation method is proposed that avoids the weak moment condition problem that is known to affect conventional GMM estimation when the autoregressiye coefficient (rho) is near unity. In both panel and time series cases, the estimator has standard Gaussian asymptotics for all values of rho is an element of (-1, 1] irrespective of how the composite cross-section and time series sample sizes pass to infinity. Simulations reveal that the estimator has little bias even in very small samples. The approach is applied to panel unit root testing.","[Phillips, Peter C.

Adopting the theory of Automatic Pipeline, Inventory and Order Based Production Control System (APIOBPCS) and system dynamics, this paper proposes a VMI&TPL-APIOBPCS model to simulate the process of dual-pipeline replenishment and dispatching when the TPL implements Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) to coordinate the two supply chains.

The model documents that the imposition and elevation of property tax will cause the housing price decline in whatever cases of market structure. The greater the degree of monopoly is, the higher the housing price will be, and the greater impact of property tax on housing price will become. Using the housing market data of 33 large and medium cities in China from 1996 through 2007, I find that 1% increase of property tax will give rise to 0.02% decline of housing price. The influence of market structure upon housing price, however, is greater than that of property tax. 1% increase of Lerner index will generate 0.13% augment of housing price. The interplay of property tax and market structure will lead to the housing price increase. 1% increase of the product of property tax and market structure will generate 0.01% increase of housing price. Accordingly, the property tax can not curb the inflated housing price effectively in China, albeit the imposition of property tax will depress the housing price. More importantly, the policy makers are supposed to pay great attention on market structure to mitigate the monopoly in the housing markets.","[Kuang Wei-da] Renmin Univ China, Sch Business, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,,,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,19,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,1619,1625,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100217,0

A random vector is upper-comonotonic if its components are moving in the same direction simultaneously when their values are greater than some thresholds. We provide a characterization of this new notion in terms of both the joint distribution function and the underlying copula. The copula characterization allows us to study the coefficient of upper tail dependence as well as the distributional representation of an upper-comonotonic random vector. As an application to financial economics, we show that the several commonly used risk measures, like the Value-at-Risk, the Tail Value-at-Risk, and the expected shortfall, are additive, not only for sum of comonotonic risks, but also for sum of upper-comonotonic risks, provided that the level of probability is greater than a certain threshold.

Nevertheless, while developing countries lag behind in the development of HEE methods, they could benefit from the progress made in other countries and concentrate on ways in which existing methods can be used or would need to be modified to fulfill their specific needs. HEEs, as context-specific tools, are not easily generalizable from setting to setting. Existing studies regarding generalizability and transferability of HEEs have primarily been conducted in developed countries. Therefore, a legitimate question for policy makers in Latin America and the Caribbean region (LAC) is to what extent HEEs conducted in industrialized economies and in LAC are generalizable to LAC (trans-regional) and to other LAC countries (intra-regional), respectively. We conducted a systematic review, searching the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), Office of Health Economics Health Economic Evaluation Database (HEED), LILACS (Latin America health bibliographic database) and NEVALAT (Latin American Network on HEE) to identify HEEs published between 1980 and 2004. We included individual patient- and model-based HEEs (cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, cost-benefit and cost-consequences analyses) that involved at least one LAC country. Data were extracted by three independent reviewers using a checklist validated by regional and international experts. From 521 studies retrieved, 72 were full HEEs (39% randomized controlled trials [RCTs], 32% models, 17% non-randomized studies and 12% mixed trial-modeling approach). Over one-third of identified studies did not specifically report the type of HEE. Cost-effectiveness and cost-consequence analyses accounted for almost 80% of the studies. The three Latin American countries with the highest participation in HEE studies were Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. While we found relatively good standards of reporting the study's question, population, interventions, comparators and conclusions, the overall reporting was poor, and evidence of unfamiliarity with international guidelines was evident (i.e. absence of incremental analysis, of discounting long-term costs and effects). Analysis or description of place-to-place variability was infrequent. Of the 49 trial-based analyses, 43% were single centre, 33% multinational and 18% multicentre national. Main reporting problems included issues related to sample representativeness, data collection and data analysis. Of the 32 model-based studies (most commonly using epidemiological models), main problems, range selection for sensitivity ana-included the inadequacy of search strategy lysis and theoretical justifications. There are a number of issues associated with the reporting and methodology used in multinational and local HEE studies relevant for LAC that preclude the assessment of their generalizability and potential transferability. Although the quality of reporting and methodology used in model-based HEEs was somewhat higher than those from trial-based HEEs, economic evaluation methodology was usually weak and less developed than the analysis of clinical data. Improving these aspects in LAC HEE studies is paramount to maximizing their potential benefits such as increasing the generalizability/transferability of their results.","[Augustovski, Federico; Rubinstein, Adolfo; Garcia Marti, Sebastian] Hosp Italiano Buenos Aires, Inst Efectividad Clin & Sanitaria, Serv Med Familiar & Comunitaria, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Iglesias, Cynthia; Manca, Andrea; Drummond, Michael] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Iglesias, Cynthia] Univ York, Dept Hlth Sci, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires; University of Buenos Aires; University of York - UK; University of York - UK,"Augustovski, F (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåViamonte 2146,3d Floor,C1056ABH, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",faugustovski@iecs.org.ar,,,,,,,92,37,40,1,11,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2009,27.0,11,,,,,919,929,,10.2165/11313670-000000000-00000,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,539QM,19888792.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000273272300004,0

The key idea is a regression estimator for the Doob martingale part of the approximative Snell envelope, which preserves the martingale property. The so constructed martingale can be employed for computing tight dual upper bounds without nested simulation. In general, this martingale can also be used as a control variate for simulation of conditional expectations. In this context, we develop a variance reduced version of the nested primal-dual estimator.

Asset returns are modelled by a Markov-switching model which allows for two market regimes with completely different risk-return structures. Using major stock indices, calm and turbulent market periods are identified for the time period between 1987 and 2009 and the correlation structures in the respective periods are compared. It turns out that the correlations between as well as within the asset classes under investigation are far from being stable and vary significantly between calm and turbulent market periods as well as in time. Finally, the impact of these findings is examined in a portfolio optimization context. To accomplish this, a case study using the mean-variance and the mean-conditional-value-at-risk framework as well as two levels of risk aversion is conducted. The results show that an explicit consideration of different market conditions in the modelling framework yields better portfolio performance as well as lower portfolio risk compared to standard approaches. These findings hold true for all investigated optimization frameworks and risk-aversion levels.","[Bernhart, German; Hoecht, Stephan; Neugebauer, Michael; Neumann, Michael; Zagst, Rudi] Tech Univ Munich, HVB Inst Math Finance, D-85748 Garching, Germany",Technical University of Munich,,hoecht@tum.de,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,1,UNIVERSE ACADEMIC PRESS TORONTO,TORONTO,"1 SPADINA CRESCENT, ROOM 205, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 3G3, CANADA",,,978-1-926642-01-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,608,616,,,,,,9,"Business; Economics; Management; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BLY20,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271409600106,0

Methods: A Markov model was constructed to analyse lifetime medical costs and QALYs from the perspective of the healthcare payer. The cycle length was 5 years. Both costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% annually. The cohort of smokers was classified by sex and age, and we assumed that smokers started smoking at the age of 20 years and received smoking-cessation therapy at the ages of 30, 40, 50, 60 or 70 years (five separate models were run). The healthcare costs and QALYs were calculated throughout the term until the age of 90 years. In the base-case analysis, success rates of varenicline plus counselling and counselling alone were assumed to be 37.9% and 25.5%, respectively, in male smokers, and 22.2% and 16.1%, respectively, in female smokers, based on a randomized controlled trial conducted in Japan. Both univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: Prescribed varenicline was shown to be more effective and less costly than smoking-cessation counselling alone. Varenicline would save direct medical costs of Japanese Yen ((sic))43 846 ($US381; $US1 = (sic)115; Oct 2007) and generate an increase of 0.094 QALYs in male smokers. In females the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was (sic)346 143 per QALY gained. Varenicline is estimated to save (sic)23.7 billion ($US206 million) of the medical costs for tobacco-associated diseases for the whole population. Overall savings are (sic)9.5 billion. Sensitivity analyses suggested the robustness of the results. Conclusion: As with any data of this nature, there is some uncertainty in the results kind further research is warranted. However, based on the results of this pharmacoeconomic evaluation, varenicline, the first non-nicotine, oral treatment developed for smoking cessation, appears to be cost effective and may contribute to future medical cost savings in Japan.","[Igarashi, Ataru; Tsutani, Kiichiro] Univ Tokyo, Dept Drug Policy & Management, Grad Sch, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Takuma, Hiroki] Nihon Univ, Res Unit Social & Adm Pharm Sci, Coll Pharm, Chiba, Japan; [Fukuda, Takashi] Univ Tokyo, Dept Hlth Econ & Epidemiol Res, Grad Sch Med, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo; Nihon University; University of Tokyo,"Igarashi, A (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Tokyo, Dept Drug Policy & Management, Grad Sch, 7-3-1 Hongo Bunkyo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",atarui1@mac.com,,"igarashi, ataru/0000-0001-6307-6916","Pfizer Inc., New York, USA","Pfizer Inc., New York, USA(Pfizer)","The analyses for this manuscript were partly funded by Pfizer Japan Inc.

Objective: To compare annual indirect costs between privately insured US employees with MS and matched employee controls. Methods: A retrospective analysis of a privately insured claims database containing disability data from 17 US companies was conducted. Employees with >= 1 NIS diagnosis (ICD-9-CM: 340.x) after 1 January 2002, aged 18-64 years, were selected. Employees with MS were matched by age and sex to employee controls without MS. All were required to have continuous health coverage 3 months before MS diagnosis (baseline) and 12 months after (study period). Main outcomes measures included study period annual indirect (disability and medically related absenteeism) costs. For completeness, we also included measures of direct (medical and drug) costs. Chi-squared tests were used to compare baseline co-morbidities and differences in indirect resource use (disability and medically related absenteeism) between employees with MS and controls. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used for univariate comparisons of disability and medically related absenteeism days and associated annual indirect and direct costs between employees with MS and controls. Generalized linear models, controlling for differences in baseline characteristics, were used to estimate risk-adjusted annual costs for employees with MS and controls. Results: Employees with MS (n = 989) averaged 44 years of age, and 66% were female. Compared with employee controls, employees with MS had significantly higher rates of mental health disorders, other neurological disorders and physical disorders measured by the Charlson Co-morbidity Index. Employees with MS were more likely to have short-term or long-term disability than employee controls (21.4% vs 5.2%, respectively; p < 0.000 1), resulting in a higher mean number of disability days per year (29.8 vs 4.5; p<0.0001). Employees with MS also had a higher rate of medically related absenteeism and associated absenteeism days than employee controls. On average, annual costs (year 2006 values) for disability were significantly higher for employees with MS ($US3868) than employee controls ($US414; p<0.0001). Annual medically related absenteeism costs were also higher for employees with MS than for controls ($US1901 vs $US1003, respectively; p<0.0001). On average, total annual indirect costs for employees with MS were $US5769 compared with $US1417 for controls (p<0.0001). Conclusions: MS is a chronic and debilitating disease that poses a substantial employer burden in terms of medically related absenteeism and disability costs. Indirect costs of employees with MS were >4 times those of employee controls.","[Ivanova, Jasmina I.; Samuels, Seth] Anal Grp Inc, New York, NY 10020 USA; [Birnbaum, Howard G.; Davis, Matthew] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA USA; [Phillips, Amy L.; Meletiche, Dennis] EMD Serono Inc, Rockland, MA USA",Analysis Group Inc.; Analysis Group Inc.; Merck KGaA; EMD Serono Inc.,"Ivanova, JI (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåAnal Grp Inc, 10 Rockefeller Plaza,15th Floor, New York, NY 10020 USA.",jivanova@analysisgroup.com,,,"Analysis Group, Inc.","Analysis Group, Inc.","Research support was provided to Analysis Group, Inc. by EMD Serono, Inc.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of ertapenem versus piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of diabetic foot infections (DFIs) from the UK NHS perspective, accounting for the development of antibacterial resistance over time. Methods: A decision-tree model was developed to estimate the cost effectiveness of ertapenem versus piperacillin/tazobactam at different timepoints in the 36 months following introduction of treatment. Development of antibacterial resistance was incorporated in the analysis using a previously published compartment (susceptible-infected-susceptible) model. The development of resistance was a function of the clearance rate of pathogens and the size of the proportion of the population prescribed the antibacterial. The microbiological clearance rate and clinical success rates were assumed to be related and were obtained from the SIDESTEP study. These data included resistant pathogens (either acquired or intrinsic resistance) such as Enterobacteriaceae, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Model outcomes over time included lifetime QALYs, direct medical costs (year 2006 values) and cost per QALY saved. Clinical efficacy of second-line treatment, direct medical costs and utilities were derived from other existing studies. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken to estimate the uncertainty of model outcomes. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3.5% per annum. Results: The model suggested savings of 407 pound (95% uncertainty interval [UI] -337, 1501) per patient when DFIs were treated with ertapenem instead of piperacillin/tazobactam after 1 month's treatment. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested a 91% probability of the incremental cost per QALY saved being within a threshold for cost effectiveness of 20000 pound. After 3 years it is expected that the antibacterial resistance profile with piperacillin/tazobactam would increase at a greater rate than with ertapenem. As a result, the cost savings with ertapenem are expected to increase to 3465 pound (95% UI 2502, 4564), and ertapenem will additionally result in greater clinical success rates and lifetime QALY savings (1.16; 95% UI 0.46, 2.06). Conclusion: Ertapenem appears to be a cost-saving and possibly an economically dominant therapy over piperacillin/tazobactam for the treatment of patients with DFIs from the UK NHS perspective.","[Jansen, Jeroen P.] Mapi Values, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Kumar, Ritesh] Merck & Co Inc, Outcome Res, Whitehouse Stn, NJ USA; [Carmeli, Yehuda] Tel Aviv Univ, Tel Aviv Sourasky Med Ctr, Div Epidemiol, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",Merck & Company; Sackler Faculty of Medicine; Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center,"Jansen, JP (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåMapi Values, 133 Portland St, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",Jeroen.jansen@mapivalues.com,,"Jansen, Jeroen Paul/0000-0003-2686-9217",Merck Co,Merck Co(Merck & Company),"This study was funded by Merck & Co, which manufactures ertapenem.

The value of these options is much less than Black-Scholes prices for corresponding market-traded options due to the suboptimal exercising strategies of the holders, which arise from risk aversion, trading and hedging constraints, and job termination risk. We analyze the combined effect of all of these factors along with the standard ESO features of multiple exercising rights, and vesting periods. This leads to the study of a chain of nonlinear free-boundary problems of reaction-diffusion type. We find that job termination risk, vesting, finite maturity and non-zero interest rates are significant contributors to the ESO cost. However, we find that in the presence of vesting, the impact of allowing multiple exercise rights on ESO cost is negligible.","[Sircar, Ronnie] Princeton Univ, ORFE Dept, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Leung, Tim] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Princeton University; Johns Hopkins University,"Sircar, R (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåPrinceton Univ, ORFE Dept, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",sircar@princeton.edu,"Leung, Siu-Tang (Tim)/A-3400-2010; Leung, Tim/O-5649-2019; Leung, Tim/G-8480-2012","Leung, Siu-Tang (Tim)/0000-0002-0023-6289; Leung, Tim/0000-0002-0023-6289;","NSF [DMS-0306357, DMS-0456195]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),Work partially supported by NSF grants DMS-0306357 and DMS-0456195.,,35,50,58,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

Scant information exists on willingness to pay (WTP) for a QALY based oil direct elicitation of preferences from community members or patients. We had the opportunity to evaluate WTP per QALY using data from a survey on temporary health outcomes related to herpes zoster. Our aims were to (i) describe how much Community members are willing to pay to save a QALY based on scenarios describing temporary health states; (ii) evaluate how WTP per QALY varies based on experience with the disease being described and with demographic variables; and (iii) evaluate how the duration and intensity of pain in a scenario influences WTP per QALY. Methods: Community members drawn from a nationally representative survey research panel (n = 478) completed an Internet-based survey using time trade-off (TTO) and WTP questions to value a series of scenarios that described herpes zoster cases of varying pain intensity (on a scale of 0-10) and duration (30 days to I year). Patients with shingles (n = 354) or postherpetic neuralgia (PHN; n = 120) [defined as having symptoms for 90 days or more] from two large healthcare systems completed telephone interviews with similar questions. Mean and median WTP per QALY values were calculated by dividing the WTP amount by the discounted time traded for each scenario. Responses with a WTP value of more than zero and a TTO Value of zero (which would have resulted in an undefined value) were excluded. TTO values were discounted by 3% per year. WTP per QALY means were calculated after trimming the top and bottom 2.5% of responses. Multivariate analyses were conducted using generalized linear mixed models that assumed a negative binomial distribution. Results: Among all respondents, the WTP per QALY ranged from a median of $US7000 to $US11000 and a trimmed mean of $US26 000 to $US45 000 (year 2005 values), depending on the scenario described. WTP per QALY values varied significantly with respondent characteristics, as well as among respondents with similar characteristics. In multivariate analyses, the mean WTP per QALY was higher among respondents who were younger, male or had higher educational or income levels. After adjusting for these demographic variables, patients who had experienced shingles gave responses with the highest WTP per QALY values. Patients who had experienced PHN gave the lowest values, and community members gave values intermediate to the shingles and PHN groups. In multivariate models that evaluated the effects of pain and duration of the hypothetical zoster scenario, lower duration was associated with higher WTP per QALY. This effect appeared to be due to people increasing the amounts of time they would be willing to trade as duration increased, without proportional increases in the amounts of money they would be willing to pay. Conclusions: Community members and patients gave mean WTP per QALY values that varied significantly based on age, sex, socioeconomic status, experience with shingles and duration of the health state evaluated. The variability in WTP per QALY suggests that it may be difficult to define a unitary threshold of dollars per QALY for policy making based on cost-effectiveness analyses.","[Lieu, Tracy A.; Kleinman, Ken; Rusinak, Donna; Prosser, Lisa A.] Harvard Pilgrim Hlth Care, Dept Ambulatory Care & Prevent, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Lieu, Tracy A.; Kleinman, Ken; Rusinak, Donna; Prosser, Lisa A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA USA; [Lieu, Tracy A.] Childrens Hosp, Div Gen Pediat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ray, G.

The lifetime risk of HZ is about 20-30% and the incidence increases with age. The protective effect of the HZ vaccine has been shown in a large clinical trial; however, the effectiveness of the vaccine decreased with age of vaccination. Objective: We sought to compare the incremental cost and health benefits of HZ vaccine over status quo (no HZ vaccine) from the perspective of the Canadian healthcare payer. Methods: We developed a discrete-event simulation model comparing the costs and QALYs accrued to patients receiving HZ vaccine to those who did not. The effect of the vaccine on the (i) incidence of severe, moderate or mild HZ; (ii) severity and duration of HZ; (iii) incidence of PHN among patients with HZ; (iv) duration of PHN; and (v) costs associated with treating HZ and PHN were modelled. Data from published literature, including the Shingle Prevention Study, were used for transition probabilities. Health resource utilizations were estimated using administrative data retrieved from the British Columbia Medical Services Plan and hospital separation databases in British Columbia from 1994 to 2003. Utility estimates were obtained from various published sources. Canadian 2008 costs were used and both cost and QALYs were discounted at a 5% annual rate in the base-case analyses. Results: On average, receiving the vaccination lowered mean direct medical costs (excluding the vaccine costs) by $Can35 per person. The incremental cost and QALYs per person receiving the vaccine versus no vaccination were $Can115 and 0.0028 QALYs, respectively, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $Can41 709 per QALY gained for a cohort of elderly Subjects aged >= 60 years. Results were robust in probabilistic and univariate sensitivity analyses. Expected value of perfect information was estimated at $Can47.72 per person, reflecting the expected monetary losses that could be avoided by having perfect information on all model parameters. Conclusion: HZ vaccination of adults, especially for individuals aged 60-75 years, seems to be a cost-effective intervention and might be considered by Canadian decision makers.","[Marra, Carlo A.] CHEOS, Vancouver, BC V6Z 1Y6, Canada; [Najafzadeh, Mehdi; Marra, Carlo A.] Univ British Columbia, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, CORE, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Galanis, Eleni; Patrick, David M.] BC Ctr Dis Control, Epidemiol Serv, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Patrick, David M.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Healthcare & Epidemiol, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia,"Marra, CA (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåCHEOS, 1081 Burrard St, Vancouver, BC V6Z 1Y6, Canada.",carlo.marra@ubc.ca,"Marra, Carlo/AAE-4904-2021","Marra, Carlo/0000-0002-2625-2121",,,,,30,34,37,0,1,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2009,27.0,12,,,,,991,1004,,10.2165/11314010-000000000-00000,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,539QN,19908924.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000273272400003,0

When the underlying asset price rise, the investors could earn a lot from accumulator contracts, on the contrary, there are huge potential risks if the price falls. At present, the accumulator causes enormous losses to lots of investors, even resulting in bankruptcy. These investors were not fully aware of the potential risks. This paper uses financial building blocks approach to decompose the accumulator into a number of well-known financial derivatives, helping investors to analyze the potential investment risks of accumulator contracts in different economic situations. Then based on the essential characteristics of accumulator, this paper proposes and testifies the proposal of hedging, making investors be fully aware of the risks of accumulator and managing the financial risks.","[Ye, Yonggang; Lv, Siying] Wuhan Univ, Econ & Management Sch, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China",Wuhan University,,ygye@whu.edu.cn; lsying85@yahoo.com.cn,,,,,,,11,0,0,1,5,UNIVERSE ACADEMIC PRESS TORONTO,TORONTO,"1 SPADINA CRESCENT, ROOM 205, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 3G3, CANADA",,,978-1-926642-01-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,244,248,,,,,,5,"Business; Economics; Management; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BLY20,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271409600040,0

Especially it caused a low income household to spend more on energy out of total budget as well as prevented it from buying energy enough for living. Consequently, our household economy faces risk associated with energy prices. There are established government policies such as unemployment insurance and various subsidy plans to help households in poverty. However, there are no public measures that alleviate their financial difficulty when a low income household is squeezed by high energy prices. The purpose of this study is to see how high energy prices influence Korean households and how seriously they cause risk to household economy. We develop a risk measure by employing variance of ratios of energy expenditure to current income. Then we use the risk measure to see how differently high energy prices generate risk across expenditure segments during energy prices hike. Also we use it to shed a light on how diverse income brackets are exposed to risk. We find energy experienced an increase in risk faster than other expenditures. Also we notice that a low income household faced the same result compared to upper income households. Base on these findings, we recommend additional energy subsidy be provided to a low income family automatically if energy price index rises above a certain level. The measure will mitigate energy risk the society faces.","[Youn, Hyungho] Chungbuk Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Cheongju, Choongchungbuk, South Korea",Chungbuk National University,,younh@sdi.re.kr; billforest@hanmail.net; eylee@kunsan.ac.kr; yrchoi@inha.ac.kr,"Choi, Yongrok/GRJ-6248-2022; Choi, Yongrok/AFN-7905-2022",,,,,,26,0,0,0,0,UNIVERSE ACADEMIC PRESS TORONTO,TORONTO,"1 SPADINA CRESCENT, ROOM 205, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 3G3, CANADA",,,978-1-926642-01-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,44,53,,,,,,10,"Business; Economics; Management; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BLY20,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271409600006,0

Examples include Dickson and Willmot (2005) in the classical Poisson model with exponential interclaim times, and Borovkov and Dickson (2008), who used a duality argument in the case with exponential claim amounts. The aim of this paper is not only to unify previous methodology through the use of Lagrange's expansion theorem, but also to provide insight into the nature of the series expansions by identifying the probabilistic contribution of each term in the expansion through analysis involving the distribution of the number of claims until ruin. The (defective) distribution of the number of claims until ruin is then further examined. Interestingly, a connection to the well-known extended truncated negative binomial (ETNB) distribution is also established. Finally, a closed-form expression for the joint density of the time to ruin, the surplus prior to ruin, and the number of claims until ruin is derived. In the last section, the formula of Dickson and Willmot (2005) for the density of the time to ruin in the classical risk model is re-examined to identify its individual contributions based on the number of claims until ruin.

As a result, a region of equilibrium appears, which can be located by geometric methods. In this area, the players can move around in an almost-equilibrium situation and do not necessarily have to adopt the same position.","[Dolores Lopez, Ma] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Matemat Aplicada, ETSI Caminos Canales & Puertos, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Abellanas, Manuel] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Matemat Aplicada, Fac Informat, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Rodrigo, Javier] Univ Pontificia Comillas Madrid, Dept Matemat Aplicada, ETS Ingn, Madrid, Spain; [Lillo, Isabel] IES Juan Cierva, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Comillas Pontifical University,"L√≥pez, MD (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Politecn Madrid, Dept Matemat Aplicada, ETSI Caminos Canales & Puertos, Ciudad Univ S-N, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",marilo.lopez@upm.es,"L√≥pez, M¬™ Dolores/F-3892-2014","Rodrigo, Javier/0000-0003-3590-8791",,,,,19,0,0,0,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

Using our method for the calculation of hundreds of Asian strike options, the pricing errors (in terms of the root mean square errors) are reasonably small. Compared with the Monte Carlo benchmark method, our method is shown to be rapid and accurate.

For all models we give some option price approximations that are very useful for speeding up the pricing process. In addition, these approximations allow us to compare different models by conveniently aggregating the parameters, and they highlight the ability of the Wishart-based models to control separately the smile and the skew effects.

This formalism, novel to financial applications, allows us to study analytically the structure of optimal policies and MVF representations under endogenous liabilities in a multidimensional and multiperiod setting.

Under this scenario, these tests spuriously reject the null hypothesis too often. We generalize this result to generalized method of moments-based (GMM-based) tests. We also extend the method proposed in Bera and Yoon (1993, Econometric Theory 9, 649-658) for constructing RS tests that are robust to local misspecification to GMM-based tests. Finally, a further generalization for general estimating and testing functions is developed. This framework encompasses both likelihood and GMM-based results.","[Bera, Anil K.] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Montes-Rojas, Gabriel] City Univ London, London, England; [Sosa-Escudero, Walter] Univ San Andres, Victoria, Buenos Aires, Argentina",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; City University London; Universidad de San Andres Argentina,"Bera, AK (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Illinois, Dept Econ, 1407 W Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",abera@ad.uiuc.edu,"Montes-Rojas, Gabriel/M-4750-2015","Montes-Rojas, Gabriel/0000-0002-8447-4929",,,,,21,13,14,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

The separation method differs from the chain-ladder in that when the chain-ladder only assumes claim proportionality between the development years, the separation method also separates the claim delay distribution from influences affecting the calendar years, e.g. inflation. Since the inflation contributes to the uncertainty in the estimate of the claims reserve it is important to consider its impact in the context of risk management, too. In this paper we present a method for assessing the prediction error distribution of the separation method. To this end we introduce a parametric framework within the separation model which enables joint resampling of claim counts and claim amounts. As a result, the variability of Taylor's predicted reserves can be assessed by extending the parametric bootstrap techniques of Bjorkwall et al. (2009).

The new solvency regime of the European Union (Solvency II) also uses worst-case scenarios for the calculation of solvency capital requirements for life insurance business. Surprisingly, the actuarial literature so far offers no exact method for the construction of biometric scenarios that let premiums and reserves be always on the safe side with respect to a given confidence band for the biometric second-order basis. The present paper partly fills this gap by introducing a general method that allows one to construct such scenarios for homogenous portfolios of life insurance policies. The results are especially informative for life insurance policies with mixed character (e.g. survival and occurrence character). Two examples are given that illustrate the new method, demonstrate its usefulness for the calculation of premiums and reserves, and show how the new approach could improve the calculation of biometric solvency reserves for Solvency II.

Each voter recognizes that, during experimentation, other voters also learn about their preferences. As a result, pivotal voters today are biased against experimentation because it reduces their likelihood of remaining pivotal. This phenomenon reduces equilibrium experimentation below the socially efficient level, and may even result in a negative option value of experimentation. However, one can restore efficiency by designing a voting rule that depends deterministically on time. Another main result is that even when payoffs of a reform are independently distributed across the population, good news about any individual's payoff increases other individuals' incentives to experiment with that reform, due to a positive voting externality.","Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Strulovici, B (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåNorthwestern Univ, Dept Econ, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",b-strulovici@northwestern.edu,,,,,,,19,69,88,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0012-9682,,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAY,2010,78.0,3,,,,,933,971,,10.3982/ECTA8011,0.0,,,39,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,600IW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000277980400003,0

The structure of the B&H model implies that the future hazard rate is proportional to the stochastic component, thus inducing two questionable features. First, in the B&H model, the uncertainty of the future hazard rate will be enlarged as the base hazard rate increases. However, an increase in the base hazard rate may not cause a dramatic increase suggested by the exponential component of B&H (2006). Second, in the B&H model, the uncertainty of the future hazard rate will be larger in the group which is older and will be greatly augmented by the interaction of age and time. But the uncertainty of the future hazard rate may not increase with an increase in age. The problems can be resolved by our additive structure which is the sum of a deterministic estimator and a stochastic component. Since using the additive structure will contribute to the fact that the stochastic component is independent of age and the base hazard rate, in our model the uncertainty of the future hazard rate will not be affected by an increase in age or in the base hazard rate. We further demonstrate an application of our model by calculating reserves of longevity risks for pure endowments and various common annuity products in the UK. We also compare our results with those of the B&H model. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we apply the models on the monthly M3 time series competition data (around a thousand time series). There have been very few, if any, large scale comparison studies for machine learning models for the regression or the time series forecasting problems, so we hope this study would fill this gap. The models considered are multilayer perceptron, Bayesian neural networks, radial basis functions, generalized regression neural networks (also called kernel regression), K-nearest neighbor regression, CART regression trees, support vector regression, and Gaussian processes. The study reveals significant differences between the different methods. The best two methods turned out to be the multilayer perceptron and the Gaussian process regression. In addition to model comparisons, we have tested different preprocessing methods and have shown that they have different impacts on the performance.","[Atiya, Amir F.] Cairo Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Giza, Egypt; [Ahmed, Nesreen K.] Purdue Univ, Dept Comp Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [El Gayar, Neamat] Cairo Univ, Fac Comp & Informat, Giza, Egypt; [El-Shishiny, Hisham] IBM Cairo Technol Dev Ctr, IBM Ctr Adv Studies Cairo, Giza, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University; International Business Machines (IBM),"Atiya, AF (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåCairo Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Giza, Egypt.",amir@alumni.caltech.edu,,"Atiya, Amir/0000-0001-8766-5600; El Gayar, Neamat/0000-0003-1467-1115",,,,,53,344,403,8,93,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

Water is the same essential resource for many economic sectors and the issue of water scarcity is significantly pronounced in China. This paper aims to study the change of Chinese industrial water intensity during the period from 1996 to 2006, using LMDI (Logistic Mean Decomposition Index) analysis. The findings show that the industrial water intensity has been decreasing from 1996 to 2006. To probe into the inner driving force, it is found that the technology effect which leads to the enhancement of sectoral water efficiency is the most important factor while the structural shift toward the water-intensive sector curbs the decrease of water intensity, to some extent. Therefore, speeding technology upgrade and adjusting the industrial structure is the strategy of water sustainable use and construction of the water-saving society.","[Chen Wen; Zhu Shu-jin; Lai Ming-yong] Hunan Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Changsha 410079, Hunan, Peoples R China",Hunan University,,,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,7,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,745,751,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100103,0

We also examine the different roles the two absorptive capacity subsets play in the development of firms' competitive advantage when knowledge types vary. With a sample of 286 corporations in China, our structural model analysis shows that the type of konwledge does moderate the relationships between communication, absorptive capacity and firms' competitive advantage. This study contributes to the literature by empirically proving that the knowledge type is an important variable to consider in the study of firms' absorptive capacity. It also suggests that business practitioners should take the type of the knowledge their partners possess into consideration if they want to optimize their learning outcome.","[Chen Yin] Beijing Foreign Studies Univ, Int Sch Business, Beijing 100089, Peoples R China; [Xu Er-ming] Renmin Univ China, Sch Business, Haidian Qu 100872, Peoples R China",Beijing Foreign Studies University; Renmin University of China,"Chen, Y (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåBeijing Foreign Studies Univ, Int Sch Business, Beijing 100089, Peoples R China.",,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [70972127]; Beijing Foreign Studies University Research Foundation,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Foreign Studies University Research Foundation,"Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (70972127) and Beijing Foreign Studies University Research Foundation.

These models ignore the fact that the characteristics of firms change through time, and thus they may suffer from a loss of predictive power. In recent years, a discrete-time parametric hazard model has been proposed for bankruptcy prediction using panel data from firms. This model has been demonstrated by many examples to be more powerful than the traditional models. In this paper, we propose an extension of this approach allowing for a more flexible choice of hazard function. The new method does not require the assumption of a parametric model for the hazard function. In addition, it also provides a tool for checking the adequacy of the parametric model, if necessary. We use real panel datasets to illustrate the proposed method. The empirical results confirm that the new model compares favorably with the well-known discrete-time parametric hazard model.","[Hwang, Ruey-Ching] Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Finance, Hualien, Taiwan; [Cheng, K.

In most search based advertising services, a company sets a budget, selects keywords, bid for each keyword and pay for each click received. Thus the profit of the company highly lies on the reward of each keyword, i.e. conversion rate. With many keywords available and uncertain conversion rate associated with the ad for each keyword, identifying the most profitable keywords becomes challenge for companies. In this research, we consider the challenge as the exploitation and exploration trade-off problem which advertisers must choose between maximizing its expected reward according to its current knowledge about the keywords and trying to learn more knowledge about other keywords, since this might find keywords with higher reward. We first show the similarity of the keyword problem to the multi-armed bandit problem and use Gittins indices to solve the problem with 1-keyword per stage. We also propose four policies for the problem with multiple keywords per stage and suggest the best policy for different context by simulation.","[Li Yi-jun; Chen Li-gang; Ai Wen-guo] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology,,,,,,,,,22,10,11,0,44,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,3,8,,10.1109/ICDMA.2010.100,0.0,,,6,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100001,0

Due to the strategic role of the corporate image, some organizations are looking for new ways to consummate corporate image so as to acquire more excellent talents to enhance competitive advantage. However, in the era of knowledge based economy demands more high-level talents, which leads to freer talent flow. Then the issue of how corporate image could influence the corporate attractiveness for talents is a tough task, which should be studied theoretically and practically. This paper examined the influence of the corporate image on the corporate attractiveness for talents in Chinese labor market. We began by providing a concept model and present some hypotheses, then dimensional compositions of the corporate image in the opinion of Chinese young educated public was proceeding, and the investigation was performed among the postgraduates of business major in China. Two kinds of corporate image (background corporate image and decisive corporate image) were taken into the model that used for estimating the influence of corporate image on the corporate attractiveness for talents. So the test model will be modified according to the actual situation in China. Our results showed that corporate image had a significant positive effect on the corporate attractiveness for talents under the intermediaries of information exposure and individual cognition in Chinese labor market. Accordingly, we provide some managerial suggestions.","[Song Hong; Zhang Pei-li; Ma Yong] Hubei Univ, Sch Business, Wuhan 430062, Peoples R China",Hubei University,,,,,,,,,27,1,2,1,7,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,674,681,,,,,,8,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100095,0

Study on organizational citizenship behavior of university faculty members not only contribute to the effectiveness of universities, but also help solve other problems the education sector facing. From this perspective, this paper takes university faculty members as our research focus to explore the relationship among OS, OC and OCB. Extant literature shows that OS and OC have significant influence on OCB. To see if OS and OC have significant influence on OCB in the particular background and particular culture, based on previous literature, this research has conducted a questionnaire survey among university faculty members. The result of the statistical analysis indicates a positive relationship between OS and OCB. It also shows that OC is a mediator between OS and OCB of university faculty members.

Its importance in applications (e.g., insurance, finance, economics, engineering and numerous other fields) can hardly be overstated and is widely documented. However, despite the sound theoretical basis and wide applicability, fitting of this distribution in practice is not a trivial exercise. Traditional methods such as maximum likelihood and method-of-moments are undefined in some regions of the parameter space. Alternative approaches exist but they lack either robustness (e.g., probability-weighted moments) or efficiency (e.g., method-of-medians), or present significant numerical problems (e.g., minimum-divergence procedures). In this article, we propose a computationally tractable method for fitting the GPD, which is applicable for all parameter values and offers competitive trade-offs between robustness and efficiency. The method is based on 'trimmed moments'. Large-sample properties of the new estimators are provided, and their small-sample behavior under several scenarios of data contamination is investigated through simulations. We also study the effect of our methodology on actuarial applications. In particular, using the new approach, we fit the GPD to the Danish insurance data and apply the fitted model to a few risk measurement and ratemaking exercises. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We show that in this setting standard inference based on ordinary least squares estimation of an augumented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) regression may not be reliable, because (a) clusters of outliers may lead to inconsistent estimation of the autoregressive parameters and (b) large outliers induce it jump component in the asymptotic distribution of UR test statistics. In the benchmark case of known outlier location, we discuss why the augmentation of the ADF regression with appropriate dummy variables not only ensures consistent parameter estimation but also gives rise to UR tests with significant power gains, growing with the number and the size of the outliers. In the case of unknown outlier location, the dummy-based approach is compared with a robust, mixed Gaussian, quasi maximum likelihood (QML) approach, novel in this context. It is proved that, When the ordinary innovations are Gaussian, the QML and the dummy-based approach are asymptotically equivalent, yielding UR tests with the same asymptotic size and power. Moreover, as a by-product of QML the outlier dates can be consistently estimated. When the innovations display tails fatter than Gaussian, the QML approach ensures further power gains over the dummy-based method. Simulations show that the QML ADF-type t-test, in conjunction with standard Dickey-Fuller critical values, yields the best combination of finite-sample size and power.","[Cavaliere, Giuseppe] Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Georgiev, Iliyan] Univ Nova Lisboa, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal",University of Bologna; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Cavaliere, G (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Via Belle Arti 41, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",giuseppe.cavaliere@unibo.it,"; CAVALIERE, GIUSEPPE/O-7592-2015","Georgiev, Iliyan/0000-0002-1249-7734; CAVALIERE, GIUSEPPE/0000-0002-2856-0005; Georgiev, Iliyan/0000-0003-3392-806X",,,,,41,8,8,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

Following Hansen (2007, Econometrica 75, 1175-1189) we recommend averaging the structural break estimates with the no-break estimates where the weight is selected to minimize the Mallows criterion. This estimator is simple to compute, as the weights are a simple function of the ratio of the penalty to the Andrews SupF test statistic. To assess performance we focus on asymptotic mean-squared error (AMSE) in a local asymptotic framework. We show that the AMSE of the estimators depends exclusively on the parameter variation function. Numerical comparisons show that the unrestricted least-squares and pretest estimators have very large AMSE for certain regions of the parameter space, whereas Our averaging estimator has AMSE close to the infeasible optimum.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Hansen, BE (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Wisconsin, Dept Econ, 1180 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",bhansen@ssc.wisc.edu,"Hansen, Bruce E/B-3892-2009; Hansen, Bruce E/AAZ-5224-2020",,,,,,6,31,42,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

The principal finding is that estimation effects from the correct specification of the conditional mean (regression) function can be asymptotically nonnegligible. This implies that certain procedures, such as the asymmetry tests of Engle and No. (1993, Journal of Finance 48. 1749-1777) and the nonlinearity test of Lundbergh and Terasvirta (2002, Journal of Econometrics 110, 417-435), are asymptotically invalid. A second contribution is the proposed use of alternative tests for asymmetry and/or nonlinearity that, it is conjectured, should enjoy improved power properties.

This created the challenge of developing a pricing framework that can simultaneously handle European options, forward-starts, options on the realized variance and options on the VIX. In this paper we propose a new approach to this problem using spectral methods. We use a regime switching model with jumps and local volatility defined by Albanese and Mijatovic and calibrate it to the European options on the S&P 500 for a broad range of strikes and maturities. The main idea of this paper is to 'lift' (i.e. extend) the generator of the underlying process to keep track of the relevant path information, namely the realized variance. The lifted generator is too large a matrix to be diagonalized numerically. We overcome this difficulty by applying a new semi-analytic algorithm for block-diagonalization. This method enables us to evaluate numerically the joint distribution between the underlying stock price and the realized variance, which in turn gives us a way of pricing consistently European options, general accrued variance payoffs and forward-starting and VIX options.","[Mijatovic, Aleksandar] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Math, London SW7 2PE, England; [Lo, Harry] Swiss Re, London, England; [Albanese, Claudio] Kings Coll London, London, England",Imperial College London; University of London; King's College London,"Mijatovic, A (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Math, 180 Princes Gate, London SW7 2PE, England.",a.mijatovic@imperial.ac.uk,,,,,,,28,11,12,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In contrast, other results in the literature show that other ways of applying the bootstrap, m out of n bootstrap, and subsampling do lead to uniformly asymptotically valid confidence sets in moment inequality models.

However, the existing MSV with leverage models are unclear about the definition of leverage, specifically the timing of the relationship between the innovations in financial returns and the associated shocks to volatility, as well as their connection to partial correlations. This paper proposes a new MSV with leverage (MSVL) model in which leverage is defined clearly in terms of the innovations in both financial returns and volatility, such that the leverage effect associated with one financial return is not related to the leverage effect of another. News impact surfaces are developed for MSV models with leverage based on both log-volatility and volatility and are compared with the special case of news impact functions for their univariate counterparts. In order to capture heavy tails in each return distribution, we incorporate an additional factor for the volatility of each return. An empirical example based on bivariate data for Standard and Poor's 500 Composite Index and the Nikkei 225 Index is presented to illustrate the usefulness of the new MSVL model and the associated news impact surfaces. Likelihood ratio (LR) tests are considered for model selection. The LR tests show that the two-factor MSVL model is supported, indicating that the restrictions considered in the paper are empirically adequate under heavy-tailed return distributions.","[Asai, Manabu] Soka Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo 1928577, Japan; [McAleer, Michael] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Taichung 402, Taiwan; [McAleer, Michael] Erasmus Univ, Inst Econ, Erasmus Sch Econ, NL-3000 Rotterdam, Netherlands",Soka University; National Chung Hsing University; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Asai, M (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåSoka Univ, Fac Econ, 1-236 Tangi Cho, Tokyo 1928577, Japan.",m-asai@soka.ac.jp; michael.mcaleer@gmail.com,"McAleer, Michael/K-8780-2019; McAleer, Michael/A-2407-2008; McAleer, Michael/B-2978-2010; Asai, Manabu/D-3044-2011","Asai, Manabu/0000-0002-6682-4622","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Australian Academy of Science; Australian Research Council; Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Australian Academy of Science; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT))","The authors wish to thank the Editor and two referees for insightful comments and suggestions and Yoshi Baba, Massimiliano Caporin and Christian Gourieroux for helpful discussions.

However, both the T test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test of the paired-samples show that there appears to be no significant change in the systematic equity risk after a firm has issued convertible bonds. Although the conclusion is different from previous studies, it is consistent with and gives further support to the conjecture that firms try to stabilize the level of systematic risk of their common stock.

The paper employs the DID estimation method and controls for simultaneity of the government R&D subsidy using a two stage least squares procedure and a GMM methodology. Our empirical results suggest that there is no crowding-out effect of the government subsidy in Korean manufacturing SMEs.

The set-up studied allows for non-normality, heteroscedasticity, non-linear serial dependence of unknown forms as well as for discrete distributions. We consider a mediangale structure-the median-based analogue of a martingale difference-and show that the signs of mediangale sequences follow a nuisance-parameter-free distribution despite the presence of non-linear dependence and heterogeneity of unknown form. We point out that a simultaneous inference approach in conjunction with sign transformations yield statistics with the required pivotality features-in addition to usual robustness properties. Monte Carlo tests and projection techniques are then exploited to produce finite-sample tests and confidence sets. Further, under weaker assumptions, which allow for weakly exogenous regressors and a wide class of linear dependence schemes in the errors, we show that the procedures proposed remain asymptotically valid. The regularity assumptions used are notably less restrictive than those required by procedures based on least absolute deviations (LAD). Simulation results illustrate the performance of the procedures. Finally, the proposed methods are applied to tests of the drift in the Standard and Poor's composite price index series (allowing for conditional heteroscedasticity of unknown form).","[Coudin, Elise] Inst Natl Stat & Etud Econom, Ctr Rech Econ & Stat, F-92245 Malakoff, France; [Dufour, Jean-Marie] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada; [Dufour, Jean-Marie] Ctr Interuniv Rech Anal Org, Montreal, PQ H3A 2A5, Canada; [Dufour, Jean-Marie] Univ Montreal, Ctr Interuniv Rech Econ Quantitat, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada",McGill University; Universite de Montreal,"Coudin, E (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåInst Natl Stat & Etud Econom, Ctr Rech Econ & Stat, 15 Blvd Gabriel Perl, F-92245 Malakoff, France.",elise.coudin@ensae.fr; jean-marie.dufour@mcgill.ca,,,,,,,69,20,22,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1368-4221,1368-423X,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

Hinich's test has the advantage of focusing directly on nonlinear serial dependencein contrast to subsequent approaches, which actually test for serial dependence of any kind (nonlinear or linear) on data which have been pre-whitened. The Hinich test tends to have low power, however, and (in common with most statistical procedures in the frequency domain) requires the specification of a smoothing or window-width parameter. In this article, we develop a modification of the Hinich bispectral test which substantially ameliorates both of these problems by the simple expedient of maximizing the test statistic over the feasible values of the smoothing parameter. Monte Carlo simulation results are presented indicating that the new test is well sized and has substantially larger power than the original Hinich test against a number of relevant alternatives; the simulations also indicate that the new test preserves the Hinich test's robustness to misspecifications in the identification of a pre-whitening model.","[Rusticelli, Elena; Dagum, Estela Bee] Univ Bologna, Dept Stat, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Ashley, Richard A.; Patterson, Douglas M.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",University of Bologna; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Dagum, EB (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Bologna, Dept Stat, Via Belle Arti 41, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",estellebee@dagum.us,,"Patterson, Douglas/0000-0001-5829-082X",,,,,18,11,12,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

This is not true for empirical data: the Epps curves do not scale with market activity. The latter result indicates that the time scale of the phenomenon is related to the reaction time of market participants (this we denote as the human time scale), independent of market activity.

The main conclusions are that it is difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises to satisfy the requirements of banks, and financing constraints have significantly negative influences on enterprises.

Methods: Maintenance regimens of adalimumab (40mg every other week) and infliximab (5 mg/kg) were compared using primary data from the CHARM and published data from the ACCENT I clinical trials. Differences in study samples were minimized by matching and weighting baseline characteristics (Crohn's Disease Activity Index score, age and sex) between the patient groups using the primary clinical trial data. Utilization data were estimated from trial data. Unit costs of TNF antagonists (year 2007 values), hospitalizations (year 2006 values), and other medical costs (year 2006 values) were derived from a systematic literature search. Standard gamble-calculated primary data were used to derive health-utility estimates. Data were analysed in a cost-utility framework from a private payer perspective over a 56-week time horizon. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to explore uncertainty related to the base-case cost-utility analysis. Given the time horizon, costs and effects were not discounted. Results: Adalimumab- and infliximab-treated patients were in remission for 47.2% and 37.1% of the 56-week period, respectively. Hospital admissions were 34-40% lower for adalimumab than for infliximab, based on the model and observed data, respectively. Patients treated with adalimumab accrued greater expected QALYs (0.014; 95% CI 0.000, 0.022) and lower costs (-$US4852; 95%.CI -6758, 491) in the first year of therapy than patients treated with infliximab. Compared with infliximab maintenance therapy, adalimumab had lower drug and administration costs, less drug waste, and lower hospitalization rates. Univariate and multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analyses suggested that these results were robust. Conclusions: This analysis suggests that adalimumab maintenance therapy is a dominant strategy versus infliximab maintenance therapy for patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. Adalimumab appeared more effective and less costly than infliximab.","[Yu, Andrew P.; Johnson, Scott; Wang, Si-Tien; Atanasov, Pavel; Tang, Jackson; Wu, Eric] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA 02199 USA; [Chao, Jingdong; Mulani, Parvez M.] Abbott Labs, Abbott Pk, IL USA",Analysis Group Inc.; Abbott Laboratories,"Yu, AP (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåAnal Grp Inc, 111 Huntington Ave,10th Floor, Boston, MA 02199 USA.",ayu@analysisgroup.com,"Tang, Jackson/C-9675-2017","Tang, Jackson/0000-0002-1248-9603",Abbott Laboratories,Abbott Laboratories(Abbott Laboratories),"This analysis was performed by Analysis Group, Inc., under contract with Abbott Laboratories.

The major part of our analysis examines the case in which public signals about the large player's actions are distorted by a Brownian motion and the large player is either a normal type, who plays strategically, or a behavioral type, who is committed to playing a stationary strategy. We obtain a clean characterization of sequential equilibria using ordinary differential equations and identify general conditions for the sequential equilibrium to be unique and Markovian in the small players' posterior belief. We find that a rich equilibrium dynamics arises when the small players assign positive prior probability to the behavioral type. By contrast, when it is common knowledge that the large player is the normal type, every public equilibrium of the continuous-time game is payoff-equivalent to one in which a static Nash equilibrium is played after every history.

A MCS is a set of models that is constructed such that it will contain the best model with a given level of confidence. The MCS is in this sense analogous to a confidence interval for a parameter. The MCS acknowledges the limitations of the data, such that uninformative data yield a MCS with many models, whereas informative data yield a MCS with only a few models. The MCS procedure does not assume that a particular model is the true model; in fact, the MCS procedure can be used to compare more general objects, beyond the comparison of models. We apply the MCS procedure to two empirical problems. First, we revisit the inflation forecasting problem posed by Stock and Watson (1999), and compute the MCS for their set of inflation forecasts. Second, we compare a number of Taylor rule regressions and determine the MCS of the best regression in terms of in-sample likelihood criteria.","[Hansen, Peter R.] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lunde, Asger] Aarhus Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Aarhus, Denmark; [Nason, James M.] Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19106 USA",Stanford University; Aarhus University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Philadelphia,"Hansen, PR (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåStanford Univ, Dept Econ, 579 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",peter.hansen@stanford.edu; alunde@econ.au.dk; Jim.Nason@phil.frb.org,"Lunde, Asger/AAH-2136-2020","Lunde, Asger/0000-0002-0805-0892; Hansen, Peter Reinhard/0000-0001-9728-4860",Danish Research Agency [24-00-0363]; Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta; Danish National Research Foundation,Danish Research Agency; Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta; Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond),"The authors thank Joe Romano, Barbara Rossi, Jim Stock, Michael Wolf, and seminar participants at several institutions and the NBER Summer Institute for valuable comments, and Thomas Trimbur for sharing his code for the Baxter-King filter.

Most prior research on the diversion of prescription stimulants for misuse, particularly those used in the treatment of ADHD, has focused on the 'end users' of diverted medications rather than the suppliers. Furthermore, little is known about the direct costs of diversion for third-party insurance payers in the US. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to estimate the prevalence in the US of people whose private insurance paid costs for ADHD prescriptions that they gave or sold to another person (diversion), and to estimate medication costs of diversion to private insurers. Methods: Estimates are from a cross-sectional survey of respondents from two Internet survey panels targeting individuals aged 18-49 years in the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population, principally for those who filled prescriptions for ADHD medications in the past 30 days that were covered by private health insurance. Analysis weights were post-stratified to control totals from the Current Population Survey and National Health Interview Survey. Weighted prevalence rates and standard errors for diversion are reported, as are the costs of diverted pills using drug prices reported in the 2008 Thomson Reuters RED BOOK (TM). Sensitivity analyses were conducted that varied the cost assumptions for medications. Results: Among individuals aged 18-49 years whose private insurance paid some costs for ADHD medications in the past 30 days, 16.6% diverted medications from these prescriptions. Men aged 18-49 years for whom private insurance paid some costs of ADHD drugs in the past 30 days were more than twice as likely as their female counterparts to divert medications from these prescriptions (22.5% vs 9.1%; p = 0.03). After a pro-rated co-payment share was subtracted, the estimated value of diverted medications in a 30-day period was $US8.0 million. Lower- and upper-bound estimates were $US6.9 million to $US17 million, for a range of $US83 million to $US204 million annually. Overall, diversion accounted for about 3.6% of the total costs that private insurers paid for ADHD medications (range: 3.5-4.5%). The percentages varied by medication category, although relative differences were sensitive to inclusion of a pro-rated co-payment. A higher percentage of the costs of extended-release (XR) medications was lost to diversion compared with that for immediate-release (IR) medications. Conclusions: Costs of ADHD medications paid for by private insurers that were lost to diversion were small relative to the total estimated medication costs and relative to total estimated healthcare costs for treating ADHD. Nevertheless, there may be significant cost savings for insurers if diversion can be reduced, particularly for XR medications. These findings represent a first step to informing policies to reduce diversion both in the interest of public health and for direct and indirect cost savings to insurers.","[Aldridge, Arnie P.; Kroutil, Larry A.; Cowell, Alexander J.; Reeves, Daniel B.] RTI Int, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Van Brunt, David L.] Eli Lilly & Co, Global Hlth Outcomes, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA",Research Triangle Institute; Eli Lilly,"Aldridge, AP (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåRTI Int, 3040 Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",aaldridge@rti.org,"Cowell, Alexander/AAR-9324-2021","Aldridge, Arnie/0000-0003-4513-470X",Eli Lilly and Company,Eli Lilly and Company(Eli Lilly),"The design, methods and analysis for this study were conducted by RTI International (a trade name of Research Triangle Institute, or RTI) with funding from Eli Lilly and Company, a pharmaceutical manufacturer.

The introduction of realistic investment constraints complicates the determination of the optimal solution, which is solved using a genetic algorithm that mimics the mechanism of natural evolution. We analyse the impact of the liquidation risk, of the investment constraints and of the agent's degree of risk aversion on the optimal allocation and on the optimal certainty equivalent of hedge fund portfolios. We observe, in particular, that the portfolio weights and their performance are significantly affected by liquidation risk. Finally, tight portfolio constraints can only provide limited protection against liquidation risk.

The Liverpool Reviews and Implementation Group (LRiG) at the University of Liverpool was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG) for this appraisal. The ERG reviewed the clinical- and cost-effectiveness evidence in two stages and in accordance with the decision problem defined by NICE. The analysis of the submitted models assessed the appropriateness of the approach taken by the manufacturer in modelling the decision problem. Analysis also included reliability of model implementation and the extent of conformity to published standards and prevailing norms of practice within the health economics modelling community. Particular attention was paid to issues likely to have substantial impact on the base-case cost-effectiveness results. Clinical evidence was derived from a multi-centre, double-blind, randomized, phase III study designed to address the overall population of NSCLC patients. Outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The recruited population was mainly from outside of Western Europe and no patients in the pivotal trial had received pemetrexed as a first-line therapy, which is now accepted clinical practice in the UK. The evidence considered in this article includes only the population for whom marketing authorizations has been received that is, patients with stable disease following first-line therapy. The trial reported a small but statistically significant increase in both PFS and OS in patients with stable disease receiving erlotinib compared with placebo. However, no significant difference was identified in OS when patients with non-squamous disease and stable disease were considered as a subgroup. The economic evidence was focussed on the ERG's assessment of three economic models that related to patients with stable disease and compared erlotinib with placebo in the squamous and non-squamous populations and erlotinib with pemetrexed in the non-squamous population. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) reported by the manufacturer were 39 936 per QALY gained (stable disease, all); 35 491 per QALY gained (stable disease, squamous); and 40020 per QALY gained (stable disease, non-squamous). In comparison with pemetrexed, in the cases where erlotinib was considered to be superior or equivalent, erlotinib dominated. In the cases where erlotinib was considered to be slightly inferior, then the ICERs ranged between 91 789 and 511 351 per QALY gained; these ICERs appear in the south-west corner of a cost-effectiveness plane, i.e. erlotinib is cheaper but less effective than pemetrexed. The ERG recalculated the base-case cost-effectiveness results in the manufacturer's submission, considering nine key areas where corrections and/or adjustments were required, related to time horizon, discounting logic, costs of erlotinib and pemetrexed, cost of second-line chemotherapy, unit costs, utility values, PFS and OS. This resulted in ERG-revised ICERs for the stable disease squamous population of 44812 per QALY gained, in the stable disease non-squamous population of 68 120 per QALY gained, and, when erlotinib was compared with pemetrexed, the result was 84029 per QALY gained. All values were above NICE's perceived willingness-to-pay threshold. After the second Appraisal Committee meeting, the Committee did not recommend the use of erlotinib in this patient population.","[Dickson, Rumona; Bagust, Adrian; Boland, Angela; Blundell, Michaela; Dundar, Yenal; Hockenhull, Juliet; Saborido, Carlos Martin; Oyee, James] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Reviews & Implementat Grp, Liverpool L69 3GB, Merseyside, England; [Davis, Helen] NW Med Informat Ctr, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Ramani, Vidhya Sagar] Univ Liverpool, Sch Canc Studies, Liverpool L69 3GB, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool; University of Liverpool,"Dickson, R (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Liverpool, Liverpool Reviews & Implementat Grp, Whelan Bldg, Liverpool L69 3GB, Merseyside, England.",rdickson@liv.ac.uk,"Dundar, Yenal/JZT-0760-2024; Dundar, Yenal/AAU-8336-2020; Martin Saborido, Carlos/B-7271-2015","Dundar, Yenal/0000-0002-9847-1622; Martin Saborido, Carlos/0000-0002-3969-6768",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) [08/40/01],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 08/40/01) and will be published as part of a compendium of ERG articles in Health Technology Assessment.

While the proposed bootstrap test for a unit root shares the power enhancing properties of its asymptotic counterpart (Ling and Li, 2003), it offers a number of important advantages. In particular, the bootstrap procedure does not require explicit estimation of nuisance parameters that enter the distribution of the test statistic and corrects the substantial size distortions of the asymptotic test that occur for strongly heteroskedastic processes. The simulation results demonstrate the excellent finite-sample properties of the bootstrap unit root test for a wide range of GARCH specifications.","[Gospodinov, Nikolay; Tao, Ye] Concordia Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada; [Gospodinov, Nikolay] CIREQ, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Concordia University - Canada; Universite de Montreal,"Gospodinov, N (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåConcordia Univ, Dept Econ, 1455 Maisonneuve Blvd W, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada.",nikolay.gospodinov@concordia.ca,,,FQRSC; IFM2; SSHRC,FQRSC; IFM2; SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We would like to thank the editor and two anonymous referees for helpful comments and suggestions.

However, previous research suggests that, in practice, productivity costs are often neglected. This may considerably bias the results of cost-effectiveness studies, particularly those regarding treatments targeted at diseases with a high incidence rate in the working population, such as depressive disorders. Objectives: This study aimed to, first, investigate whether economic evaluations of treatments for depressive disorders include productivity costs and, if so, how. Second, to investigate how the inclusion or exclusion of productivity costs affects incremental costs. Methods: A systematic literature review was performed. Included articles were reviewed to determine (i) whether productivity costs had been included and (ii) whether the studies adhered to national health economic guidelines about the inclusion or exclusion of these costs. For those studies that did include productivity costs, we calculated what proportion of total costs were productivity costs. Subsequently, the incremental costs, excluding productivity costs, were calculated and compared with the incremental costs presented in the original article, to analyse the impact of productivity costs on final results. Regression analyses were used to investigate the relationship between the level of productivity costs and the type of depressive disorder, the type of treatment and study characteristics such as time horizon used and productivity cost valuation method. Results: A total of 81 unique economic evaluations of treatments for adults with depressive disorders were identified, 24 of which included productivity costs in the numerator and one in the denominator. Approximately 69% of the economic evaluations ignored productivity costs. Two-thirds of the studies complied with national guidelines regarding the inclusion of productivity costs. For the studies that included productivity costs, these costs reflected an average of 60% of total costs per treatment arm. The inclusion or exclusion of productivity costs substantially affected incremental costs in a number of studies. Regression analyses showed that the level of productivity costs was significantly associated with study characteristics such as average age, the methods of data collection regarding work time lost, the values attached to lost work time, the type of depressive disorder, the type of treatment provided and the level of direct costs. Conclusions: Studies that do not include productivity costs may, in many cases, poorly reflect full societal costs (or savings) of an intervention. Furthermore, when comparing total costs reported in studies that include productivity costs, it should be noted that study characteristics such as the methods used to assess productivity costs may affect their level.","[Krol, Marieke; Papenburg, Joce; Koopmanschap, Marc; Brouwer, Werner] Erasmus Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Krol, Marieke; Koopmanschap, Marc; Brouwer, Werner] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Krol, M (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåPOB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",krol@bmg.eur.nl,"Krol, Marieke/HGA-7950-2022; Brouwer, Werner/HSB-9241-2023","Brouwer, Werner/0000-0002-0476-8397; Krol, Marieke/0000-0002-6153-0828",,,,,126,89,91,0,11,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2011,29.0,7,,,,,601,619,,10.2165/11539970-000000000-00000,0.0,,,19,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,793CC,21545189.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000292797000005,0

Following an updated review of RCC-related economic studies, we supplemented the costs of RCC reported in the literature with estimates from the latest US databases that capture the utilization of several newly approved targeted agents. Method: We conducted analyses using the 1991-2007 SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results)-Medicare and 1996-2007 Market Scan Commercial Claims and Encounter (CCAE) and Medicare Supplemental databases, and based our estimates on a prevalent cohort of patients with RCC or kidney cancer constructed from each database. All cost estimates were normalized to $US, year 2009 values. The incremental costing approach was applied to estimate the annual cost of RCC by treatment phases using a prevalent cohort of patients with RCC identified from the 2005 SEER-Medicare database. We used the method of extended estimation equations to estimate the impact of patients' use of targeted therapies on the annual costs of RCC, while controlling for confounding factors such as patients' age, sex, tumour characteristics, co-morbidity and geographic regions. The method was applied to two elderly cohorts of RCC patients identified from the SEER-Medicare and the MarketScan Medicare Supplemental databases and a non-elderly cohort of patients with RCC identified from the MarketScan CCAE database. Results: Compared with the cost of treating an elderly, non-cancer patient in the matched sample, the average cost of treating an elderly patient with RCC was $US11 169 (95% CI 10683, 11 655) more per year, based on our analyses of the latest SEER-Medicare data. The annual cost to treat patients with RCC who received targeted therapies was 3- to 4-fold greater than the cost to treat patients with RCC who received other therapies. Results from the multivariate analysis showed that, after controlling for potential confounders, the annual medical cost was $US31 000-65000 higher for RCC patients treated with targeted therapies, with the largest increase observed among the non-elderly patients. Conclusion: The economic burden of RCC is likely to grow with an increasing use of targeted therapies. Future research is needed to understand the impact of various forces on the economic burden of RCC, such as increased disease incidence, use of minimally invasive surgical techniques and more prevalent adoption of emerging targeted therapies.","[Shih, Ya-Chen T.; Xu, Ying; Pan, I-Wen] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Div Quantitat Sci, Dept Biostat, Sect Hlth Serv Res, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Chien, Chun-Ru] China Med Univ Hosp, Dept Radiat Oncol, Taichung, Taiwan; [Smith, Grace L.; Buchholz, Thomas A.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Radiat Oncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA",University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; China Medical University Taiwan; China Medical University Hospital - Taiwan; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center,"Shih, YCT (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Chicago, Sect Hosp Med, 5841 S Maryland,MC 2007, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",tinashih@uchicago.edu,"Pan, Iwen/M-2335-2016","Pan, Iwen/0000-0002-2781-2629; Smith, Grace/0000-0002-3171-2911; Shih, Ya-Chen Tina/0000-0001-7290-3864","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) [R01 HS018535]; China Medical University Hospital, Taiwan [DMR-98-132]; Department of Health, Taiwan [DOH99-TD-C-111005]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality); China Medical University Hospital, Taiwan; Department of Health, Taiwan","This research was partially funded by a grant from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ, R01 HS018535) to Ya-Chen Tina Shih, and a grant from the China Medical University Hospital, Taiwan (DMR-98-132) and a grant from the Department of Health, Taiwan (DOH99-TD-C-111005) to Chun-Ru Chien.

For the cointegration model, the feasible quasi-generalized least squares (FQGLS) version of the Andrews and Kim (2006) P test is considered and is shown, by simulations, to be more robust to serial correlation in the error process and to have power no less than Andrews and Kim's original test. For the linear time trend model, the FQGLS version of the Andrews (2002) S test is considered with the error process allowed to be nonstationary up to one unit root, and the new test is shown to be robust to potentially nonstationary serial correlation.

Observable quantities in such models are invariant under regular affine transformations of the underlying diffusion process. In their canonical form, the models in Dai and Singleton (2000) are based on diffusion processes with diagonal diffusion matrices. This motivates the following question: Can the diffusion matrix of an affine diffusion process always be diagonalized by means of a regular affine transformation? We show that if the state space of the diffusion is of the form D = R(+)(m) x R(N-m) for integers 0 <= m <= N satisfying m <= 1 or m >= N - 1, there exists a regular affine transformation of D onto itself that diagonalizes the diffusion matrix. So in this case, the Dai-Singleton canonical representation is exhaustive. On the other hand, we provide examples of affine diffusion processes with state space R(+)(2) x R(2) whose diffusion matrices cannot be diagonalized through regular affine transformation. This shows that for 2 <= m <= (N - 2), the assumption of diagonal diffusion matrices may impose unnecessary restrictions and result in an avoidable loss of generality.","[Filipovic, Damir] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Swiss Finance Inst, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Kimmel, Robert L.] EDHEC Business Sch, Lille, France; [Cheridito, Patrick] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Swiss Finance Institute (SFI); Universite Catholique de Lille; EDHEC Business School; Princeton University,"Cheridito, P (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåORFE Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",dito@princeton.edu,"Kimmel, Robert L/C-6054-2016; Filipovic, Damir/AAF-9781-2021",,NSF [DMS-0642361]; Rheinstein Award; Peek Fellowship; WWTF; Swissquote,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Rheinstein Award; Peek Fellowship; WWTF; Swissquote,"We thank Kenneth Singleton for helpful comments.

For this enlarged class of values, explicit relationships to the Shapley value are exploited in order to axiomatize such values with reference to a slightly adapted inessential game property, continuity, and a similar associated consistency.

It is shown that the optimal bandwidth for the kernel-smoothed normalized curvature estimator should diverge at a slower rate than that of the HAC estimator using the same kernel. An implementation method of the optimal bandwidth for the HAC estimator, which is analogous to the one for probability density estimation by Sheather and Jones (1991), is also developed.

To accommodate this dependence, we introduce a model of decision making under uncertainty that takes as primitive a family of preferences indexed by partitions of the state space. Each partition corresponds to a description of the state space. We characterize the following partition-dependent expected utility representation. The decision maker has a nonadditive set function nu over events. Given a partition of the state space, she computes expected utility with respect to her partition-dependent belief, which weights each cell in the partition by nu. Nonadditivity of nu allows the probability of an event to depend on the way in which the state space is described.

We quantitatively investigate the impact of two types of financial frictions on this correlation. One is limited enforcement, where contracts are enforced by the threat of default penalties. The other is limited spanning, where the only asset available is noncontingent bonds. We find that the calibrated model with both frictions produces a savings-investment correlation and a volume of capital flows close to the data. To solve the puzzle, the limited enforcement friction needs low default penalties under which capital flows are much lower than those in the data, and the limited spanning friction needs to exogenously restrict capital flows to the observed level. When combined, the two frictions interact to endogenously restrict capital flows and thereby solve the Feldstein-Horioka puzzle.","[Bai, Yan] Arizona State Univ, Dept Econ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Zhang, Jing] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Bai, Y (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåArizona State Univ, Dept Econ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",yan.bai@asu.edu; jzhang@umich.edu,,"Bai, Yan/0000-0001-5149-2197",,,,,39,70,84,1,21,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0012-9682,,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAR,2010,78.0,2,,,,,603,632,,10.3982/ECTA6619,0.0,,,30,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,581GB,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000276508500005,0

The study is done in a one-period economy with one risk-free asset and one risky asset, and the reference point corresponds to the terminal wealth arising when the entire initial wealth is invested into the risk-free asset. When it exists, the optimal holding is a function of a generalized Omega measure of the distribution of the excess return on the risky asset over the risk-free rate. It conceptually resembles Merton's optimal holding for a CRRA expected-utility maximizer. We derive some properties of the optimal holding and illustrate our results using a simple example where the excess return has a skew-normal distribution. In particular, we show how a CPT investor is highly sensitive to the skewness of the excess return on the risky asset. In the model we adopt, with a piecewise- power value function with different shape parameters, loss aversion might be violated for reasons that are now well-understood in the literature. Nevertheless, we argue that this violation is acceptable.","[Bernard, Carole; Ghossoub, Mario] Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Bernard, C (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",c3bernar@uwaterloo.ca; ghossoub@umich.edu,"Bernard, Carole/K-4006-2015","Bernard, Carole/0000-0002-3996-9260; Ghossoub, Mario/0000-0002-6718-783X",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),"We would like to thank Phelim Boyle, Virginia Young and Harry Panjer for helpful discussions, and an anonymous referee whose comments and suggestions have significantly improved this paper.

A group of heterogeneous players compete for a prize with the probability of winning for a player depending on his strength as well as the distribution of strengths among his rivals. Players can pool their strengths together to increase their probabilities of winning as a group through coalition formation. The players in the winning coalition will compete further until one individual winner is left. We show that in any equilibrium there are only two coalitions in the initial stage of the contest. In the case of three players, the equilibrium often has a coalition of the two weaker players against the strongest. The equilibrium coalition structure with four players mainly takes one of the two forms: a coalition of the three weaker players against the strongest or a coalition of the weakest and strongest players against a coalition of the remaining two. Our findings imply that the rivalry with the possibility of coalition formation in our model exhibits a pattern of two-sidedness and a balance of power. We further study the impact of binding agreements by coalition members on equilibrium coalition structures. Our analysis sheds some light on problems of temporary cooperation among individuals who are rivals by nature.","[Wang, Ruqu] Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Tan, Guofu] Univ So Calif, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Wang, Ruqu] Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China",Queens University - Canada; University of Southern California; Zhejiang University,"Wang, RQ (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåQueens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",wangr@econ.queensu.ca,,,,,,,33,13,16,0,18,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

The calcimimetic agent cinacalcet can attenuate the mineral and hormonal imbalances characteristic of SHPT and may improve outcomes in such patients. Here we describe a cost-utility analysis of cinacalcet for SHPT in dialysis patients in Italy. Methods: We developed a probabilistic Markov model to simulate the effect of cinacalcet on Ca, P and PTH levels in dialysis patients with SHPT, based on data from a European, multicentre, open-label study. The model then correlated these levels with mortality and morbidity (CV events, fractures and parathyroidectomies) using data from the literature, and incorporated Italian data for dialysis, drugs and management of events according to the national cost structure. The simulation horizon was patient lifetime; simulated treatment alternatives were standard treatment (mainly vitamin D sterols and phosphate binders) and cinacalcet + standard treatment. A 3.5% discount rate was applied to life expectancy (LE), quality-adjusted life-expectancy (QALE), costs and times below the upper ranges (time in range [TiR]) recommended by the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality initiative for PTH, Ca, P and Ca x P. Utilities were derived from the published literature and took into account dialysis and the impairment of quality of life due to the occurrence of CV events and fractures. Costs were evaluated in year 2009 values from the perspective of the Italian National Healthcare System. Results: Baseline results were calculated with 10 000 iterations. Compared with standard treatment alone, addition of cinacalcet was associated with a mean (SD) increase in TiR of 5.26 (6.59), 3.63 (6.87), 1.70 (6.66) and 2.68 (5.55) discounted patient-years for PTH, Ca and P, respectively, and combined PTH, Ca, P and Ca x P. Cinacalcet increased LE by 1.20 (3.75) life-years (LYs) and QALE by 0.89 (2.59) QALYs. When including the cost for dialysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was (sic)50 012 per LY and (sic)67 361 per QALY, while, if dialysis costs were not included, the ICER was (sic)23 473 per LY and (sic)31 616 per QALY. Conclusions: The results suggest that cinacalcet treatment could be considered cost effective for treatment of SHPT in the Italian healthcare setting, but further investigations are needed to confirm these findings.","[Pradelli, Lorenzo; Iannazzo, Sergio] AdRes Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, I-10123 Turin, Italy; [Eandi, Mario] Univ Turin, Turin, Italy; [Chiroli, Silvia] Amgen Europe GmbH, Zug, Switzerland; [Pontoriero, Giuseppe] Alessandro Manzoni Hosp, Nephrol & Dialysis Unit, Lecce, Italy",University of Turin; Amgen; AMGEN Europe,"Iannazzo, S (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåAdRes Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Piazza Carlo Emanuele II 19, I-10123 Turin, Italy.",s.iannazzo@adreshe.com,"Pradelli, Lorenzo/H-2824-2019","Pradelli, Lorenzo/0000-0002-7648-8917","Amgen (Europe) GmbH, Zug, Switzerland; AdRes; Amgen","Amgen (Europe) GmbH, Zug, Switzerland(Amgen); AdRes; Amgen(Amgen)","L.

Although the process of deregulations has been slow, many countries in the region are heading toward a more integrated market despite current global turmoil. Financial market integration in South Asia could have synchronised economic activities of the countries in the region due to the impact of consolidation. This suggests that when the region's economies grow/contract, all countries could follow the same path or co-movement of growth rates is possible. When economic growth rates are similar for a region, it may be easier to formulate economic policies to achieve a common goal. As the political leadership of South Asia has agreed to work towards forming an economic block similar to that of the European Union and ASIAN, examining co-movement of growth rates could shed more lights on the issue of the success of market integration in the region. The objective of this study is to study market integration by analysing financial markets, trade and economic growth data to spot whether there is any co-movement of growth rates among South Asian countries due to financial market deregulation policies implemented so far.

Consequently, when using an Euler discretization, one must carefully think about how to fix negative variances. Our contribution is threefold. Firstly, we unify all Euler fixes into a single general framework. Secondly, we introduce the new full truncation scheme, tailored to minimize the positive bias found when pricing European options. Thirdly and finally, we numerically compare all Euler fixes to recent quasi-second order schemes of Kahl and Jackel, and Ninomiya and Victoir, as well as to the exact scheme of Broadie and Kaya.

We adapt to the unknown smoothness in the model by consistently estimating the optimal bandwidth rate and using linear combinations of ADE estimators for different kernels and bandwidths. Linear combinations of estimators (i) can have smaller asymptotic mean squared error (AMSE) than an estimator with an optimal bandwidth and (ii) when based on estimated optimal rate bandwidth can adapt to unknown smoothness and achieve rate optimality.

We further empirically test the impact of technology spillover of international trade on skill demand using data in China's manufacturing.

The debated cash additive axiom is relaxed into the cash subadditive axiom to preserve the original difference between the numeraire of the current reserve amounts and future positions. Consequently, cash subadditive risk measures can model stochastic and/or ambiguous interest rates or defaultable contingent claims. Practical examples are presented, and in such contexts cash additive risk measures cannot be used. Several representations of the cash subadditive risk measures are provided. The new risk measures are characterized by penalty functions defined on a set of sublinear probability measures and can be represented using penalty functions associated with cash additive risk measures defined on some extended spaces. The issue of the optimal risk transfer is studied in the new framework using inf-convolution techniques.

These are n-player stochastic games played on a product state space S (1) x ... x S (n) , in which player i controls the transitions on S (i) . For the general n-player case, we establish the existence of 0-equilibria. In addition, for the case of two-player zero-sum games of this type, we show that both players have stationary 0-optimal strategies. In the analysis of product-games, interestingly, a central role is played by the periodic features of the transition structure. Flesch et al. (Math Oper Res 33, 403-420, 2008) showed the existence of 0-equilibria under the assumption that, for every player i, the transition structure on S (i) is aperiodic.

A simple version of the model is an autoregression with a separate intercept for each unit in the cross section, with errors that are independent and identically distributed with a normal distribution. There is a parameter of interest gamma and a nuisance parameter tau, a N x K matrix, where N is the cross-section sample size. The focus is on dealing with the incidental parameters problem created by a potentially high-dimension nuisance parameter. We adopt a fixed-effects approach that seeks to protect against any sequence of incidental parameters. We transform tau to (delta, rho, omega), where delta is a J x K matrix of coefficients from the least-squares projection of tau on a N x J matrix x of strictly exogenous variables, rho is a K x K symmetric, positive semidefinite matrix obtained from the residual sums of squares and cross-products in the projection of tau on x, and omega is a (N - J) x K matrix whose columns are orthogonal and have unit length. The model is invariant under the actions of a group on the sample space and the parameter space, and we find a maximal invariant statistic. The distribution of the maximal invariant statistic does not depend upon omega. There is a unique invariant distribution for omega. We use this invariant distribution as a prior distribution to obtain an integrated likelihood function. It depends upon the observation only through the maximal invariant statistic. We use the maximal invariant statistic to construct a marginal likelihood function, so we can eliminate omega by integration with respect to the invariant prior distribution or by working with the marginal likelihood function. The two approaches coincide. Decision rules based on the invariant distribution for omega have a minimax property. Given a loss function that does not depend upon omega and given a prior distribution for (gamma, delta, rho), we show how to minimize the average-with respect to the prior distribution for (gamma, delta, rho)-of the maximum risk, where the maximum is with respect to omega. There is a family of prior distributions for (delta, rho) that leads to a simple closed form for the integrated likelihood function. This integrated likelihood function coincides with the likelihood function for a normal, correlated random-effects model. Under random sampling, the corresponding quasi maximum likelihood estimator is consistent for gamma as N -> infinity, with a standard limiting distribution. The limit results do not require normality or homoskedasticity (conditional on x) assumptions.","[Chamberlain, Gary; Moreira, Marcelo J.] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Moreira, Marcelo J.] FGV EPGE, BR-22250 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Harvard University; Escola de Pos-Graduacao em Economia (EPGE),"Chamberlain, G (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåHarvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",gary_chamberlain@harvard.edu; mjmoreira@columbia.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-0819761]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0819761] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",We thank two referees and a co-editor for helpful comments.

We find that the distribution of all three quantities decays asymptotically as a power law, but that of FPT has significantly fatter tails than that of TTF. Thus a simple first passage time model cannot account for the observed TTF of limit orders. We propose that the origin of this difference is the presence of cancelations. We outline a simple model that assumes that prices are characterized by the empirically observed distribution of the first passage time and orders are canceled randomly with lifetimes that are asymptotically power law distributed with an exponent lambda(LT). In spite of the simplifying assumptions of the model, the inclusion of cancelations is sufficient to account for the above observations and enables one to estimate characteristics of the cancelation strategies from empirical data.","[Eisler, Zoltan] Capital Fund Management, Sci & Finance, Paris, France; [Eisler, Zoltan; Kertesz, Janos] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Theoret Phys, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Kertesz, Janos] Aalto Univ, Lab Computat Engn, FIN-02150 Espoo, Finland; [Lillo, Fabrizio; Mantegna, Rosario N.] Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Fis & Tecnol Relat, I-90128 Palermo, Italy; [Lillo, Fabrizio] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; [Lillo, Fabrizio; Mantegna, Rosario N.] CNR, INFM, Unita Operativa Roma, Ctr Ric & Sviluppo SOFT, Rome, Italy",Budapest University of Technology & Economics; Aalto University; University of Palermo; The Santa Fe Institute; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto Nazionale per la Fisica della Materia (INFM-CNR),"Eisler, Z (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåCapital Fund Management, Sci & Finance, Paris, France.",eisler@maxwell.phy.bme.hu,"Kert√©sz, J√°nos/B-3411-2012; Lillo, Fabrizio/E-6793-2014; Mantegna, Rosario N/H-3652-2014","Mantegna, Rosario N/0000-0003-4177-171X",MIUR; EU [NEST-DYSONET 12911]; [COST-STSM-P10-917]; [OTKA T049238],"MIUR(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); EU(European Union (EU)); ;","We would like to thank two anonymous referees for useful comments and suggestions.

Whereas copulas are well studied in the bivariate case, the higher-dimensional case still offers several open issues and it is far from clear how to construct copulas which sufficiently capture the characteristics of financial returns. For this reason, elliptical copulas (i.e. Gaussian and Student-t copula) still dominate both empirical and practical applications. On the other hand, several attractive construction schemes have appeared in the recent literature promising flexible but still manageable dependence models. The aim of this work is to empirically investigate whether these models are really capable of outperforming its benchmark, i.e. the Student-t copula and, in addition, to compare the fit of these different copula classes among themselves.","[Fischer, Matthias; Koeck, Christian; Schlueter, Stephan; Weigert, Florian] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Stat & Econometr, Erlangen, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Fischer, M (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Stat & Econometr, Erlangen, Germany.",Matthias.Fischer@wiso.uni-erlangen.de,,"Schluter, Stephan/0000-0001-5816-3337",Hans Frisch-Stiftung,Hans Frisch-Stiftung,This research was kindly supported by the Hans Frisch-Stiftung.

This paper studies nonparametric identifiability of type probabilities and type-specific component distributions in finite mixture models of dynamic discrete choices. We derive sufficient conditions for nonparametric identification for various finite mixture models of dynamic discrete choices used in applied work under different assumptions on the Markov property, stationarity, and type-invariance in the transition process. Three elements emerge as the important determinants of identification: the time-dimension of panel data, the number of values the covariates can take, and the heterogeneity of the response of different types to changes in the covariates. For example, in a simple case where the transition function is type-invariant, a time-dimension of T = 3 is sufficient for identification, provided that the number of values the covariates can take is no smaller than the number of types and that the changes in the covariates induce sufficiently heterogeneous variations in the choice probabilities across types. Identification is achieved even when state dependence is present if a model is stationary first-order Markovian and the panel has a moderate time-dimension (T >= 6).","[Kasahara, Hiroyuki] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Econ, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada; [Shimotsu, Katsumi] Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Queens University - Canada,"Kasahara, H (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Western Ontario, Dept Econ, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada.",hkasahar@uwo.ca; shimotsu@econ.queensu.ca,"Shimotsu, Katsumi/K-5352-2012","Shimotsu, Katsumi/0000-0002-4566-3137",SSHRC,SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The authors are grateful to the co-editor and three anonymous referees whose comments greatly improved the paper.

A.",,,Utilities of the EQ-5D Transferable or Not?,PHARMACOECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,VALUATIONS; US,"Background: Within the framework of economic evaluations, the transferability of utility scores between jurisdictions remains unclear. The EQ-5D is a generic instrument for measuring health-related quality of life in economic evaluations, which can be used for comparing utility scores across countries. At present, the EQ-5D has several national value sets or tariffs. Nevertheless, utility estimates from foreign studies are often used directly for cost-effectiveness estimates, without adapting by applying the appropriate national value set. It is unclear if this practice is advisable, due to dissimilarities between the national value sets. Objective: To examine the effects of differences in national EQ-5D value sets on absolute and marginal utilities of health states, and determine to what degree these differences can be explained by methodological factors. Methods: First, the relative importance of the EQ-5D domains for the utility estimates was compared across the 15 value sets. Second, two hypothetical health states for a depressed patient and a pain patient (21232 and 33321) were selected for additional analysis, by comparing the utilities as scored by the value sets. The marginal influence of a one-level deterioration in a domain of these health states on the utility estimate was then determined. Third, the differences between the value sets were examined in more detail by using multilevel analysis to examine the role of methodological differences in the valuation studies. Results: Differences can be perceived between the national value sets of the EQ-5D in the preferences for the domains. The utilities of the two hypothetical health states show that the value sets differ substantially. Furthermore, the differences between the marginal values of the deteriorations are large, which can be explained partly by the type of valuation method. Other methodological differences also influence the value sets. Conclusion: All results indicate that the differences between the EQ-5D value sets are considerable and should not be ignored. The differences can largely be explained by methodological differences in the valuation studies. The remaining differences may reflect cultural dissimilarities between countries. Therefore, further research should focus on investigating the transferability or utilities across Countries or agreeing on a standard to perform valuation studies.

Two new orally active anticoagulants have recently become licensed in Ireland for the primary prevention of venous thromboembolism in adult patients undergoing elective total hip replacement (THR) or total knee replacement (TKR). Rivaroxaban (Xarelto (R)) is a direct factor Xa inhibitor and dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa (R)) is a prodrug of the active compound dabigatran, which inhibits thrombin. Objective: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of rivaroxaban and dabigatran etexilate compared with enoxaparin sodium for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing elective THR and TKR in the Irish healthcare setting. Methods: The evaluation was conducted from the Irish health-payer perspective. A static decision-tree model was developed with a 180-day post-surgery time horizon. Separate models for the disease states THR and TKR were run to accommodate the different venous thromboembolism risks associated with each procedure. Outcome measures were QALYs and life-years gained (LYG). Costs were valued in E, year 2008 values. One-way sensitivity analysis of all probabilities in the model was performed. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis using second-order Monte Carlo simulation was performed to determine the probability of cost effectiveness at a (sic)45 000 per QALY threshold. Results: In the THR base-case model, rivaroxaban dominated both dabigatran etexilate and enoxaparin sodium. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for dabigatran etexilate relative to enoxaparin were (sic)23 934 per LYG and (sic)17835 per QALY. In the TKR base-case model, rivaroxaban dominated both dabigatran etexilate and enoxaparin sodium. Dabigatran etexilate also dominated enoxaparin sodium. In the one-way sensitivity analysis, the THR model was robust to all but four probability variations; the TKR model was robust to all variations. At a cost-effectiveness threshold of (sic)45 000 per QALY, the probability that rivaroxaban was the most cost-effective strategy after THR was 39%, followed by dabigatran etexilate at 32% and enoxaparin sodium at 29%. The probability that rivaroxaban was the most cost-effective strategy after TKR was 46%, followed by dabigatran etexilate at 30% and enoxaparin sodium at 24%. Conclusion: Base-case analysis indicates that when both rivaroxaban and dabigatran etexilate are compared with enoxaparin sodium, rivaroxaban is the less costly and more effective option after THR and TKR. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicates that rivaroxaban is the most cost-effective strategy at a cost-effectiveness threshold of (sic)45 000 per QALY; however, there is uncertainty regarding this strategy being more cost effective than dabigatran etexilate when both are compared with enoxaparin sodium.","[McCullagh, Laura; Tilson, Lesley; Walsh, Cathal; Barry, Michael] St James Hosp, Natl Ctr Pharmacoecon, Dublin 8, Ireland; [Walsh, Cathal] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Stat, Dublin, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin; Trinity College Dublin,"McCullagh, L (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåSt James Hosp, Natl Ctr Pharmacoecon, Dublin 8, Ireland.",lmccullagh@stjames.ie,"McCullagh, Laura/HOF-9342-2023; maiza, marisa/L-6168-2013; Walsh, Chloe/AAM-1093-2020","McCullagh, Laura/0000-0001-8342-8739; Walsh, Cathal/0000-0001-6599-9562; Barry, Michael/0000-0002-6232-3003",,,,,51,60,66,0,14,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2009,27.0,10,,,,,829,846,,10.2165/11313800-000000000-00000,0.0,,,18,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,518XI,19803538.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271728700004,0

Twenty years investigation results show that the cultivars differ in their productivity. The purpose of this work was to investigate and evaluate yield and chemical composition of A. kolomikta fruits. The amount of dry matter, soluble solids, vitamin C and soluble sugars was determined. The investigation data shows that 'Lande' produces the biggest yield of fruits - 16.04 t ha(-1). The biggest amounts of dry matters were established in fruits of 'Laiba' cultivar plants - 23.95 %. The highest content of soluble solids (12.57 %) was accumulated in 'Lande' fruits. The biggest amounts of vitamin C were in fruits of 'Paukstes Sakarva' - 4670 mg kg(-1).

While cost-of-illness studies for PD from developed countries have recently been published, data for Eastern Europe and Asia are still lacking. Objective: To prospectively evaluate direct and indirect costs in a cohort of Russian patients with PD in order to identify cost-driving factors. Methods and Patients: We recruited 100 patients with idiopathic PD who visited the outpatient department for movement disorders of the Russian Medical State University in Moscow between October 2004 and December 2005. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale was used to evaluate clinical status. Economic data were collected in a 'bottom-up' approach and evaluated from the societal perspective. Indirect costs were estimated using a human capital approach. Russian currency was converted into (sic), year 2005 values, using the purchasing power parity. All costs were then inflated to (sic), year 2008 values, using the Medical Care Component of the Consumer Price Index. Independent cost predictors were identified by means of multivariate regression analyses. Results: From the societal perspective, total costs per patient over 6 months amounted to (sic)2620 (95% CI 2050, 3200), with direct costs accounting for 67% and indirect costs for 33% of the total. Patients' expenditures accounted for 43% of their private income. The primary burden on patients was due to informal care and drugs. Only 10% of home care was provided by the formal service sector. Costs for the nation are estimated at (sic)1.1 billion per year. Conclusion: The economic burden of PD in Russia is considerable, especially when taking into account low private incomes. Further development of a formal care system and better reimbursement systems for drugs are necessary in Russia.","[Winter, Yaroslav; von Campenhausen, Sonja; Reese, Jens P.; Oertel, Wolfgang H.; Dodel, Richard] Univ Marburg, Dept Neurol, D-35039 Marburg, Germany; [Winter, Yaroslav] Univ Tubingen, Klinikum Stuttgart, Ctr Mental Hlth, Tubingen, Germany; [von Campenhausen, Sonja; Boetzel, Kai] Univ Munich, Dept Neurol, D-8000 Munich, Germany; [Popov, Georgy; Gusev, Eugene; Guekht, Alla] Russian State Med Univ, Dept Neurol, Moscow 117437, Russia; [Klotsche, Jens] Tech Univ, Dept Psychol & Psychotherapy, Dresden, Germany",Philipps University Marburg; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; University of Munich; Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University; Technische Universitat Dresden,"Dodel, R (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Marburg, Dept Neurol, Rudolf Bultmannstr 8, D-35039 Marburg, Germany.",richard.dodel@med.uni-marburg.de,"Guekht, Alla B./Y-6725-2018","Guekht, Alla/0000-0002-1170-6127",European commission [QLRT-2001-00020]; Competence Network Parkinson Syndromes; Bundesininisterium fur Bildting und Forschung [01G19901],European commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Competence Network Parkinson Syndromes; Bundesininisterium fur Bildting und Forschung,"This study was supported by I grant from the European commission (No: QLRT-2001-00020) for the European Cooperative Network for Research, Diagnosis, and Therapy in Parkinson's disease (EuroPa), and by the Competence Network Parkinson Syndromes (funded by the Bundesininisterium fur Bildting und Forschung; Nr.: 01G19901).; We would like to thank the members of Europa for their help and contribution: Paolo Barone, University of Napoli, Italy; Klaus Leenders, Groningen, the Netherlands; Andrew Lees, London, UK; Olle Lindvall, University of Lund, Sweden-, E.

Factor loadings are assumed to be smooth functions of time, which allows considering the model as locally stationary while permitting empirically observed time-varying second moments. Factor loadings are estimated by the eigenvectors of a nonparametrically estimated covariance matrix. As is well known in the stationary case, this principal components estimator is consistent in approximate factor models if the eigenvalues of the noise covariance matrix are bounded.

In this article, we propose a copula regression model for dependent lines of business that can be used to predict unpaid losses and hence determine loss reserves. The proposed method, relating the payments in different run-off triangles through a copula function, allows the analyst to use flexible parametric families for the loss distribution and to understand the associations among lines of business. Based on the copula model, a parametric bootstrap procedure is developed to incorporate the uncertainty in parameter estimates. To illustrate this method, we consider an insurance portfolio consisting of personal and commercial automobile lines. When applied to the data of a major US property-casualty insurer, our method provides comparable point prediction of unpaid losses with the industry's standard practice, chain-ladder estimates. Moreover, our flexible structure allows us to easily compute the entire predictive distribution of unpaid losses. This procedure also readily yields accident year reserves, calendar year reserves, as well as the aggregate reserves. One important implication of the dependence modeling is that it allows analysts to quantify the diversification effects in risk capital analysis. We demonstrate these effects by calculating commonly used risk measures, including value at risk and conditional tail expectation, for the insurer's combined portfolio of personal and commercial automobile lines.","[Shi, Peng] No Illinois Univ, Div Stat, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA; [Frees, Edward W.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Business, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Northern Illinois University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Shi, P (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåNo Illinois Univ, Div Stat, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA.",pshi@niu.edu; jfrees@bus.wisc.edu,"FREES, EDWARD/KBC-8981-2024",,Assurant Health Insurance,Assurant Health Insurance,"We thank Michael Merz, Piet de Jong, as well as an anonymous reviewer for comments that helped improve the paper.

Instead, simple NadarayaWatson non-parametric estimation of a cointegrating regression equation is consistent irrespective of the endogeneity in the regressor. The present paper shows that some closely related results apply in the case of structural non-parametric regression with independent data when there are continuous location shifts in the regressor. Some interesting cases are discovered where non-parametric regression is consistent, whereas parametric regression is inconsistent even when the true regression functional form is known and used in regression. This appears to be a paradox, as knowing the true functional form should not in general be detrimental in regression. The paradox arises because additional correct information is not necessarily advantageous when information is incomplete. In this case, endogeneity in the regressor introduces bias when the true functional form is known, but interestingly does not do so in local non-parametric regression. We propose two new consistent estimators for the parametric regression, which address the endogeneity in the regressor by means of spatial bounding and bias correction using non-parametric estimation.","[Phillips, Peter C.

We discuss the suitability of six stochastic mortality models for forecasting future mortality and estimating the density of mortality rates at different ages. In particular, the models are assessed individually with reference to the following qualitative criteria that focus on the plausibility of their forecasts: biological reasonableness; the plausibility of predicted levels of uncertainty in forecasts at different ages; and the robustness of the forecasts relative to the sample period used to fit the model. An important, though unsurprising, conclusion is that a good fit to historical data does not guarantee sensible forecasts. We also discuss the issue of model risk, common to many modelling situations in demography and elsewhere. We find that even for those models satisfying our qualitative criteria, there are significant differences among central forecasts of mortality rates at different ages and among the distributions surrounding those central forecasts.

We provide details of the algorithm including rules for stopping the iterative process and consequently assess its performance using extensive Monte Carlo experiments. To assist in its extension to several dimensions, we discuss procedures for identifying the crucial parameters in order to achieve desirable results especially as the size of the dimension increases. Finally, for practical illustration, we demonstrate the use of the algorithm to price First-to-Default credit swap, an important credit derivative instrument in the financial market.

However, this assumption may not be realistic: several studies have shown that there is a positive correlation between types of claim. Here we introduce different multivariate Poisson regression models in order to relax the independence assumption, including zero-inflated models to account for excess of zeros and overdispersion. These models have been largely ignored to date, mainly because of their computational difficulties. Bayesian inference based on MCMC helps to resolve this problem (and also allows us to derive, for several quantities of interest, posterior summaries to account for uncertainty). Finally, these models are applied to an automobile insurance claims database with three different types of claim. We analyse the consequences for pure and loaded premiums when the independence assumption is relaxed by using different multivariate Poisson regression models together with their zero-inflated versions.

The dependence on the volatility is more subtle, as short-term volatility has a positive influence, while the longer term is negative. The cubic nonlinearity in the weighted price trend shows that a percentage daily gain of up to 2.78% tends to yield higher prices, but larger gains lead to lower prices. Thus, the nonlinearity of price trend establishes an empirical and quantitative basis for both underreaction and overreaction within one large data set, facilitating an understanding of these competing motivations in markets. Increasing money supply is found to have a significant positive effect on stock price, while proximity to recent high prices has a negative effect.

Part of this success may be attributed to the development of new cancer agents, collectively called 'targeted therapies', that are more specific to key components of tumour growth. Worldwide, however, one of the main factors that limit patient access to these important new drugs is their cost, which is higher than traditional chemotherapy. In this review, the clinical and pharmacoeconomic data of selected targeted agents are discussed.

Every CEA is based on a number of assumptions, some of which may not be accurate, introducing uncertainty. Sensitivity analysis (SA) formalizes ways to measure and evaluate this uncertainty. Specific sources of uncertainty in CEA have been noted by various researchers. In this work, we consolidate across all sources of uncertainty, discuss the imbalanced attention to SA across different sources, and discuss criteria for conducting and reporting SA to help bridge the gap between guidelines and practice. Guidelines on how to perform SA have been published for many years in response to requests for greater standardization among researchers. Decision makers tasked with reviewing new health technologies also seem to appreciate the additional information conveyed by a robust SA, including the attention to important patient subgroups. Yet, past reviews have shown that there is a substantial gap between the guidelines' suggestions and the quality of SA in the field. Past reviews have also focused on one or two but not all three sources of uncertainty. The objective of our work is to comprehensively review all different sources of uncertainty and provide a concise set of criteria for conducting and presenting SA, stratified by common modelling approaches, including decision analysis and regression models. We first provide an overview of the three sources of uncertainty in a CEA (parameter, structural and methodological), including patient heterogeneity. We then present results from a literature review of the conduct and reporting of SA based on 406 CEA articles published between 2000 and mid-2009. We find that a minority of papers addressed at least two of the three sources of uncertainty, with no change over time. On the other hand, the use of some sophisticated techniques, such as probabilistic SA, has surged over the past 10 years. Lastly, we identify criteria for reporting uncertainty-robust SA and also discuss how to conduct SA and how to improve the reporting of SA for decision makers. We recommend that researchers take a more comprehensive view of uncertainty when planning SA for an economic evaluation.","[Grabner, Michael; Onukwugha, Eberechukwu] Univ Maryland, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Hlth Serv Res, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Jain, Rahul] Univ Georgia, Coll Pharm, Dept Clin & Adm Pharm, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Onukwugha, E (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Maryland, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Hlth Serv Res, 220 Arch St,Off Level 1, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",eonukwug@rx.umaryland.edu,,,,,,,64,48,57,0,13,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2011,29.0,4,,,,,297,314,,10.2165/11584630-000000000-00000,0.0,,,18,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,746TV,21395350.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000289271500003,0

This paper provides a formal method of testing for nonstationary long memory against the alternative of a particular form of nonlinear ergodic processes; namely, exponential smooth transition autoregressive processes. In this regard, the current paper provides a significant generalization to existing unit root tests by allowing the null hypothesis to encompass a much larger class of nonstationary processes. The asymptotic theory associated with the proposed Wald statistic is derived, and Monte Carlo simulation results confirm that the Wald statistics have reasonably correct size and good power in small samples. In an application to real interest rates and the Yen real exchange rates, we find that the tests are able to distinguish between these competing processes in most cases, supporting the long-run Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) and Fisher hypotheses. But, there are a few cases in which long memory and nonlinear ergodic processes display similar characteristics and are thus confused with each other in small samples.","[Kapetanios, George] Queen Mary Univ London, London E14 4NS, England; [Shin, Yongcheol] Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of Leeds,"Kapetanios, G (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåQueen Mary Univ London, Mile End Rd, London E14 4NS, England.",G.Kapetanios@qmul.ac.uk,,,ESRC [RES-000-22-3161],ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We are grateful to the Editor, the Associated Editor, two anonymous referees, Richard Baillie, Peter Phillips and the seminar participants at Universities of Leeds and Edinburgh for their helpful comments on an earlier version of this paper.

GSNC is defined as a set of restrictions on joint distributions of random variables with observable sample counterparts, whereas PONC combines restrictions on partially unobservable variables (potential outcomes) with different identifying assumptions that relate potential outcome variables to their observable counterparts. Based on the Robins' dynamic model of potential outcomes, we find that in general neither of the concepts implies each other without further (untestable) assumptions. However, the identifying assumptions associated with the sequential selection of the observables link these concepts such that GSNC implies PONC, and vice versa.","Univ St Gallen, Swiss Inst Empir Econ Res SEW, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Lechner, M (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv St Gallen, Swiss Inst Empir Econ Res SEW, Varnbuelstr 14, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",Michael.Lechner@unisg.ch,,"Lechner, Michael/0000-0003-4308-1579",,,,,61,15,17,0,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

In practice it can be easily seen that even one outlier can lead to a huge over- or underestimation of the overall reserve when using the chain-ladder method. This indicates that individual claims can be very influential when determining the chain-ladder estimates. In this paper the effect of contamination is mathematically analyzed by calculating influence functions in the generalized linear model framework corresponding to the chain-ladder method. It is proven that the influence functions are unbounded, confirming the sensitivity of the chain-ladder method to outliers. A robust alternative is introduced to estimate the generalized linear model parameters in a more outlier resistant way. Finally, based on the influence functions and the robust estimators, a diagnostic tool is presented highlighting the influence of every individual claim on the classical chain-ladder estimates. With this tool it is possible to detect immediately which claims have an abnormally positive or negative influence on the reserve estimates. Further examination of these influential points is then advisable. A study of artificial and real run-off triangles shows the good performance of the robust chain-ladder method and the diagnostic tool. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

List (2003a) found that the most experienced dealers acting in a well functioning market are not subject to this exchange asymmetry, suggesting that a significant amount of market experience is required to overcome it. To understand this market-experience effect, we introduce a distinction between two types of uncertainty-choice uncertainty and trade uncertainty-both of which could lead to exchange asymmetry. We conjecture that trade uncertainty is most important for exchange asymmetry. To test this conjecture, we design an experiment where the two treatments impact differently on trade uncertainty, while controlling for choice uncertainty. Supporting our conjecture, we find that forcing subjects to give away their endowment in a series of exchanges eliminates exchange asymmetry in a subsequent test. We discuss why markets might not provide sufficient incentives for learning to overcome exchange asymmetry.","[Engelmann, Dirk] Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Econ, Vvi, Prague, Czech Republic; Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Expt Econ, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark; Paris Sch Econ, F-75647 Paris 13, France; CNRS, F-75647 Paris 13, France",University of Mannheim; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; University of Copenhagen; Paris School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Engelmann, D (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Mannheim, Dept Econ, L7 3-5, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",dirk.engelmann@uni-mannheim.de; guillaume.hollard@univ-paris1.fr,"Engelmann, Dirk/H-2943-2014",,"Royal Holloway; Economics Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v.v.i.

In particular, if it is necessary for (point) identification that the weights take arbitrarily large values, then the parameter of interest, though point identified, cannot be estimated at the regular (parametric) rate and is said to be irregularly identified. This rate depends on relative tail conditions and can be as slow in some examples as n-1/4. This nonstandard rate of convergence can lead to numerical instability and/or large standard errors. We examine two weighted model examples: (i) the binary response model under mean restriction introduced by Lewbel (1997) and further generalized to cover endogeneity and selection, where the estimator in this class of models is weighted by the density of a special regressor, and (ii) the treatment effect model under exogenous selection (Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983)), where the resulting estimator of the average treatment effect is one that is weighted by a variant of the propensity score. Without strong relative support conditions, these models, similar to well known identified at infinity models, lead to estimators that converge at slower than parametric rate, since essentially, to ensure point identification, one requires some variables to take values on sets with arbitrarily small probabilities, or thin sets. For the two models above, we derive some rates of convergence and propose that one conducts inference using rate adaptive procedures that are analogous to Andrews and Schafgans (1998) for the sample selection model.","[Khan, Shakeeb] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Duke University; Northwestern University,"Khan, S (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåDuke Univ, Dept Econ, 213 Social Sci Bldg, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",shakeebk@econ.duke.edu; tamer@northwestern.edu,,,National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank a co-editor and three referees for comments that improved the content and exposition in the paper.

We demonstrate how to estimate quantities of interest in claims reserving and compare the estimates to those obtained from classical and credibility approaches. In this context, a novel numerical procedure utilizing a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique, ABC and a Bayesian bootstrap procedure was developed in a truly distribution-free setting. The ABC methodology arises because we work in a distribution-free setting in which we make no parametric assumptions, meaning we cannot evaluate the likelihood point-wise or in this case simulate directly from the likelihood model. The use of a bootstrap procedure allows us to generate samples from the intractable likelihood without the requirement of distributional assumptions; this is crucial to the ABC framework. The developed methodology is used to obtain the empirical distribution of the DFCL model parameters and the predictive distribution of the outstanding loss liabilities conditional on the observed claims.

Workers have private information about their characteristics at the time they apply for jobs. Firms value these characteristics differently and can observe them once workers apply. They hire the worker they most prefer. However, the characteristics are not contractible, so firms cannot condition their wages on them. This paper shows how to extend arguments from directed search to handle this, allowing for arbitrary distributions of worker and firm types. The model is used to provide a functional relationship that ties together the wage distribution and the wage-duration function. This relationship provides a testable implication of the model. This relationship suggests a common property of wage distributions that guarantees that workers who leave unemployment at the highest wages also have the shortest unemployment duration. This is in strict contrast to the usual (and somewhat implausible) directed search story in which high wages are always accompanied by higher probability of unemployment.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Peters, M (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv British Columbia, Dept Econ, 997-1873 E Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada.",peters@econ.ubc.ca,,,SSHRC,SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"I am grateful to Daron Acemoglu, Rob Shimer, and a number of referees for substantive and expositional help.

Under the assumptions that the insurance price depends only on the policy's actuarial value, and the insured seeks to maximize the expected utility of his terminal wealth, we show that coverage above a deductible up to a cap is the optimal contract, and the relaxation of insurer's loss limit will increase the insured's expected utility. When the insurance price is given by the expected value principle, we show that a positive loading factor is a sufficient and necessary condition for the deductible to be positive. Moreover, with the expected value principle, we show that the optimal deductible derived in our model is not greater (lower) than that derived in Arrow's model if the insured's preference displays increasing (decreasing) absolute risk aversion. Therefore, when the insured has an IARA (DARA) utility function, compared to Arrow model, the insurance policy derived in our model provides more (less) coverage for small losses, and less coverage for large losses. Furthermore, we prove that the optimal insurance derived in our model is an inferior (normal) good for the insured with a DARA (IARA) utility function, consistent with the finding in the previous literature. Being inferior, the insurance can also be a Giffen good. Under the assumption that the insured's initial wealth is greater than a certain level, we show that the insurance is not a Giffen good if the coefficient of the insured's relative risk aversion is lower than 1.

The posterior of the structural parameters is estimated by a new Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with mixing parallel sequences. The parallel extension improves the global maximization property of the algorithm, simplifies the parameterization for an appropriate acceptance ratio, and allows a simple implementation of the estimation on parallel computers.

Objective: To examine trends in the economic content of medical device and pharmaceutical advertisements in medical journals. Methods: Three reviewers examined pharmaceutical and medical device advertisements in six leading medical journals from 1997 through 2006. Product characteristics, economic claims and evidence to support those claims were evaluated. Results: Economic content appeared in 23.5% (561/2389) of pharmaceutical and device advertisements; 11.9% made market share claims and 12.7% made other economic claims. From 1997 through 2006, the percentage of medical device advertisements containing economic content declined from 26.7% to 6.7% (p = 0.02), whereas the percentage of pharmaceutical advertisements containing economic content remained stable (21.6-22.0%; p = 0.99). For pharmaceuticals, price claims declined significantly (15.7-4.2%; p < 0.01) and market share claims increased (2.8-11.5%; p = 0.09), and both consistently presented evidence (83% and 98%, respectively) while other types did not (e.g. 13.5% of formulary claims). Medical device economic claims differed from pharmaceutical economic claims; they made fewer market share claims (1.1% vs 12.8%) but more cost-effectiveness (6.5% vs 0.6%) and reimbursement (4.9% vs 0.8%) claims. Fewer than 2% of device advertisements with economic claims provided supporting evidence. Conclusion: The prevalence and type of economic content in pharmaceutical and device advertisements changed between 1997 and 2006, which may reflect evolving market dynamics, such as changes in reimbursement systems. Furthermore, the lack of supporting evidence in medical device advertisements and pharmaceutical formulary claims are potential areas of concern that require additional scrutiny by regulators and journal editors.","[Ackerly, D.

In contrast, the existing literature has paid inadequate attention to the volatility spillover between stockholders and warrant holders. This 'risk-shifting effect' has significant implications for warrant pricing, since any formula that assumes a constant volatility of stock returns produces a bias. In this paper we show that a CEV process with a specific elasticity parameter properly models the stochastic volatility of stock returns for a firm with warrants outstanding.

A key condition in generating bimodality is independence of the observations in the underlying data-generating process (DGP). The paper highlights the strikingly different implications of lack of correlation versus statistical independence in DGPs with infinite moments and shows how standard inference can be invalidated in such cases, thereby pointing to the need for adapting estimation and inference procedures to the special problems induced by thick-tailed (TT) distributions. The paper presents theoretical results for the Cauchy case and develops a new distribution termed the 'double-Pareto', which allows the thickness of the tails and the existence of moments to be determined parametrically. It also investigates the relative importance of tail thickness in case of finite moments by using TT distributions truncated on a compact support, showing that bimodality can persist even in such cases. Simulation results highlight the dangers of relying on naive testing in the face of TT distributions. Novel density estimation kernel methods are employed, given that our theoretical results yield cases that exhibit density discontinuities.","[Fiorio, Carlo V.] Univ Milan, I-20122 Milan, Italy; [Fiorio, Carlo V.] Econpubblica, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Hajivassiliou, Vassilis A.] London Sch Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Hajivassiliou, Vassilis A.] Financial Markets Grp, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Phillips, Peter C.

The objective of this study is therefore to describe the direct medical resource use and cost of healthcare for HIV patients at a university clinic in Sweden. Methods: A patient registry database for HIV treatment at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, between 2000 and 2005 provided information on patient characteristics, antiretroviral drugs and dosages, tests and diagnostic procedures, outpatient visits and inpatient stays. The review used publicly available unit costs with a county council perspective, expressed in 2006 Euros. Results: Two hundred and eighty-five patients with a mean age of 38 years in 2000 (64% men) were followed for 1368 patient-years. They had a mean (median) of 6.3 (0) inpatient days, 4.1 (3.7) physician visits, 4.2 (3.8) nurse visits, 2.6 (0.7) counsellor visits and 11.5 (7.7) tests and diagnostic procedures per patient-year. Only 12 deaths were recorded during the study period, and the proportion of treated patients with successful treatment (HIV-RNA <50 copies/mL) increased from 74% to 92% during the period. The mean cost per patient-month amounted to (sic)1069. The main cost driver was HIV drugs (51%), followed by inpatient stays (including hospitalizations for opportunistic infections; 22%), outpatient physician, nurse or therapist visits (19%) and diagnostics and tests (7%). All non-drug costs increased with a decreasing CD4 cell count. Conclusions: Overall, approximately half of the direct costs of HIV treatment were not related to antiretroviral treatment. The non-antiretroviral costs were inversely correlated with HIV-induced immune deficiency.","[Ghatnekar, Ola; Hjortsberg, Catharina] Swedish Inst Hlth Econ IHE, S-22002 Lund, Sweden; [Gisslen, Magnus] Gothenburg Univ, Sahlgrenska Acad, Dept Infect Dis, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Lindback, Stefan] Tibotec, Stockholm, Sweden; [Lothgren, Mickael] Janssen Cilag AB, Stockholm, Sweden",University of Gothenburg; Johnson & Johnson,"Ghatnekar, O (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåSwedish Inst Hlth Econ IHE, Box 2127, S-22002 Lund, Sweden.",og@ihe.se,"Gisslen, Magnus/D-7454-2015","Gisslen, Magnus/0000-0002-2357-1020","Tibotec, a division of Janssen-Cilag AB; Janssen-Cilag AB; Bristol Myers Squibb; GlaxoSmithKline; Abbott; Tibotec","Tibotec, a division of Janssen-Cilag AB; Janssen-Cilag AB; Bristol Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb); GlaxoSmithKline(GlaxoSmithKline); Abbott(Abbott Laboratories); Tibotec","The authors would like to thank Lissie Johansson and Elisabeth Pamryd for assistance with data collection.

In contrast to the prevailing line of arguments of the current orthodoxy on the reasons for the crises, this paper provides an explanation for the current crisis in simple real, rather than financial market, terms. First, we show theoretically the relationship between financial bubbles with both consumption and de-industrialization. Then, by estimating models, based on cross-country panel data, we derive a worldwide trend linking industrialisation to an improving balance of payments and foreign debt position, while, de-industrialisation is found to be correlated with balance of payments deficit and foreign debt. This might be an indication that post-industrial economic development, as it has been evolving so far, is no-through road, for Western nations, reducing opportunities for employment and ultimately leading to decreases in standard of living.

Moreover, the existence of Indonesia government support through Go Organic 2010 mission makes organic food as an interesting topic to be discussed recently and become evident to be investigated. Regarding previous studies in organic food area, most of the researchers had investigated about factors driving consumers' behavior toward buying organic food and profiling organic conscious consumer based on demographic factor. Whereas, a research that considering brand extension concept in investigating consumers' attitude and intention to buy organic food has not been discover. Thus, the author aim to fill this gap through answered this research question as follow: What is consumers' attitude toward organic food in both context of brand extension (unfit and fit association)? and Does their attitude correlate with their intention to buy? Before and after (pre and post-test) type of experimental design was used to test the research hypothesis. The experiment was conducted two times since in the first experiment, there was misperception of subjects in treatment group 2 toward the stimulus so that obscured the independent variable. Besides, we conducted preliminary experiment before the second experiment held. Additionally, exploration study which aim to identified important criteria of milk according to consumers was required before conducted the first experiment. Then, the screening process was conducted to obtain organic conscious consumers that would be participated as subjects in the experiment. After conducting the second experiment, exploration study was required to provide additional explanation for the experiment questionnaires results. There were 33 persons attended in the first experiment whereas in the second experiment, there were 43 persons out of 100 persons invited were participated as subjects. Subjects were randomly assigned into two treatment groups. Control technique required in the experiment was achieved in some ways, such as: matching the subjects and assigned them randomly into two treatment groups, selected the same condition of classroom for each group, and assuming price and availability variable are constant. Stimulus in both treatment groups were given through written media (power point slide and flyer). The data collected from the questionnaire was processed using SPSS 16.0 and it is found that brand extension (unfit and fit association) as the stimulus in the experiment did not influence consumers' attitude toward organic food. Thus, H1a and H1b are not supported. Then, the consumers' attitude correlated with their intention to buy, so that H2a and H2b are supported. Based on the exploration study conducted after the experiment, subjects reported that there were some factors that they are more concerned to, such as: taste of milk, price, benefit of the product, and brand image. Besides, the condition between non-organic parent brand and organic brand extension are not perceived by the subjects in treatment group 1 as unfit association that could influence their attitude since the parent brand and its extension are in the same product category. Nevertheless, the author noticed that attention blocking was occurred in the experiment so that contributes to the unsupported hypothesis.","[Nasution, Reza Ashari; Tarigan, Mila Miranda] Inst Teknol Bandung, Sch Business & Management, Bandung, Indonesia; [Dhewanto, Wawan] Monash Univ, Dept Management, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Institute Technology of Bandung; Monash University,"Nasution, RA (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåInst Teknol Bandung, Sch Business & Management, Bandung, Indonesia.",,"Dhewanto, Wawan/Q-1101-2019; Nasution, Reza/D-7885-2014","Dhewanto, Wawan/0000-0002-6705-5191; Nasution, Reza/0000-0003-2487-4012",,,,,14,0,0,0,11,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,503,511,,,,,,9,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100070,0

Firstly, this paper analyzed the actual situation and historical evolvement trend of income disparity between urban and rural residents in China. We concluded that since the reform and opening up, the urban-rural income disparity in China shows the phase change characteristics of reduced-expanded-again reduced-again expanded-flattened. Then, according to the statistical data from 1978 to 2008, multiple linear regression models were built to test the relationship between urban-rural income disparity and its effecting factors. Empirical results indicate that the urban-rural dual economic structure, urbanization level, growth rate of per capita GDP and employment structure has a positive correlation with the urban-rural income disparity, but a negative correlation between the level of rural financial development and the urban-rural income disparity. Finally, some countermeasures and suggestions on how to narrow the income disparity between urban and rural residents are proposed.","[Tong Guang-ji; Li Cun-gui] NE Forestry Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China",Northeast Forestry University - China,,,,,,,,,19,0,0,2,14,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,1855,1862,,,,,,8,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100250,0

The weights are subsequently used to synthesize individual IVIFN assessments into an aggregated IVIFN value for each alternative. In order to rank alternatives based on their aggregated IVIFN values, a novel method is developed for comparing two IVIFNs by introducing the formula of possibility degree and the ranking vector of the possibility degree matrix.

Additionally, a crash in one stock (or index) can increase the risk of crashes in other stocks (or indices). Our paper explicitly takes this contagion risk into account and studies its impact on the portfolio decision of a CRRA investor both in complete and in incomplete market settings. We find that the investor significantly adjusts his portfolio when contagion is more likely to occur. Capturing the time dimension of contagion, i.e. the time span between jumps in two stocks or stock indices, is thus of first-order importance when analyzing portfolio decisions. Investors ignoring contagion completely or accounting for contagion while ignoring its time dimension suffer large and economically significant utility losses. These losses are larger in complete than in incomplete markets, and the investor might be better off if he does not trade derivatives. Furthermore, we emphasize that the risk of contagion has a crucial impact on investors' security demands, since it reduces their ability to diversify their portfolios. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this paper is to select, tailor, and develop extreme value methods for use in wind storm insurance. The methods are applied to the 1982-2005 losses for the largest Swedish insurance company, the Lansforsakringar group. Both a univariate and a new bivariate Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) gave models which fitted the data well. The bivariate model led to lower estimates of risk, except for extreme cases, but taking statistical uncertainty into account the two models lead to qualitatively similar results. We believe that the bivariate model provided the most realistic picture of the real uncertainties. It additionally made it possible to explore the effects of changes in the insurance portfolio, and showed that loss distributions are rather insensitive to portfolio changes.

Our main assumption is a large game property, dictating that the actions of relatively small subsets of players cannot have large affects on the payoffs of other players.","[Wooders, Myrna] Vanderbilt Univ Nashville, Dept Econ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Cartwright, Edward] Univ Kent, Keynes Coll, Dept Econ, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England",Vanderbilt University; University of Kent,"Wooders, M (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåVanderbilt Univ Nashville, Dept Econ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",E.J.Cartwright@kent.ac.uk; myrna.wooders@vanderbilt.edu,,"Cartwright, Edward/0000-0003-0194-9368",,,,,22,5,5,1,3,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

The results of the paper are important to other nonlinear GARCH models. The proposed model nests some of the previous specifications found in the literature and has the following advantages. First, contrary to most of the previous models, more than two limiting regimes are possible, and the number of regimes is determined by a simple sequence of tests that circumvents identification problems that are usually found in nonlinear time series models. The second advantage is that the novel stationarity restriction on the parameters is relatively weak, thereby allowing for rich dynamics. It is shown that the model may have explosive regimes but can still be strictly stationary and ergodic. A simulation experiment shows that the proposed model can generate series with high kurtosis and low first-order autocorrelation of the squared observations and exhibit the so-called Taylor effect, even with Gaussian errors. Estimation of the parameters is addressed, and the asymptotic properties of the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator are derived under weak conditions. A Monte-Carlo experiment is designed to evaluate the finite-sample properties of the sequence of tests. Empirical examples are also considered.","[Medeiros, Marcelo C.; Veiga, Alvaro] Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio de Janeiro, Dept Econ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro,"Medeiros, MC (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåPontificia Univ Catolica Rio de Janeiro, Dept Econ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",mcm@econ.puc-rio.br,"; Medeiros, Marcelo/I-9133-2014","VEIGA, Alvaro/0000-0003-0200-6724; Medeiros, Marcelo/0000-0001-8471-4323",,,,,73,27,31,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

Methods: Claims data for US privately insured employees (1999-2004) were analysed. Analysis included adult employees with >= 1 diagnosis of MDD and >= 1 prescription for specific antidepressants following a 6-month washout period. Patients were first classified into treatment pattern groups (switchers/discontinuers/maintainers/augmenters), then stratified into mutually exclusive treatment groups - nonstable, stable and intermediate - based on evidence of stability in treatment therapy. Rates of mental and physical co-morbidities, injuries/accidents, substance abuse and urgent care use were analysed across treatment pattern groups. Direct (medical/drug) costs were calculated per patient per year and disaggregated into depression- and non-depression-related components. A two-part multivariate model controlled for baseline characteristics. Costs were also estimated for patients with MDD only, patients with MDD and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and patients with MDD and any type of anxiety. Results: Annual per patient adjusted costs (year 2005 values) were significantly lower among stable patients ($US6215) than among intermediate ($US7317) and nonstable patients ($US9948; p<0.001). Stable patients also had lower depression- and non-depression-related costs. Patients with MDD and comorbid GAD or any type of anxiety had significantly higher costs than MDD-only patients. Conclusions: Nonstability of treatment is associated with higher comorbidity rates, more urgent care use and higher total, depression- and non-depression-related direct costs. The stable group represents continuity of care and is associated with significant cost savings. Co-morbidities are associated with increased costs.","[Birnbaum, Howard G.; Ben-Hamadi, Rym; Greenberg, Paul E.; Hsieh, Matthew; Tang, Jackson] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA 02199 USA; [Reygrobellet, Camille] Sanofi Aventis, Paris, France",Analysis Group Inc.; Sanofi-Aventis,"Birnbaum, HG (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåAnal Grp Inc, 111 Huntington Ave,10th Floor, Boston, MA 02199 USA.",Hbirnbaum@analysisgroup.com,"Tang, Jackson/C-9675-2017","Tang, Jackson/0000-0002-1248-9603",sanofi-aventis,sanofi-aventis(Sanofi-Aventis),"This research was supported by funding from sanofi-aventis to Analysis Group, Inc., and was presented at the 2007 American Psychiatric Association Annual Meeting, San Diego, CA, USA 19-24 May 2007.

The technical requirements for the implementation of the tests of rank of a general matrix differ and hence there are merits to all of them that justify their use in applied work.

To become the global hub in a newly emerging Northeast Asian logistics network, the efficiency of the ports and their success factors are important for sustainable development. Thus, the comparison of port efficiency may shed light on this newly emerging Northeast Asian logistics network. This paper analyzes empirical results on the efficiencies of major ports by applying the generally acceptable methodology of data envelope analysis (DEA) and its variant models. This paper concludes that the scale- or supply-oriented policies should be changed to emphasize more the governance of port operations. Also, the paper concludes that investment in infrastructure does not improve efficiency; rather self-created logistics demand and strategic alliances, such as anchor companies, do improve the efficiency as demonstrated by the Tobit model.","[Choi, Yongrok] Inha Univ, Dept Int Trade, Inchon 402751, South Korea",Inha University,,yrchoi@inha.ac.kr,"Choi, Yongrok/AFN-7905-2022; Choi, Yongrok/GRJ-6248-2022",,,,,,22,2,2,0,6,UNIVERSE ACADEMIC PRESS TORONTO,TORONTO,"1 SPADINA CRESCENT, ROOM 205, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 3G3, CANADA",,,978-1-926642-01-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,17,22,,,,,,6,"Business; Economics; Management; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BLY20,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271409600003,0

This can provide a reference for government and industry management in decision-making and guidance of regional sediment brick makers' development.","[Liu, Hong-Mei] Hohai Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Hohai University,,liu.hm@hhu.edu.cn,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,UNIVERSE ACADEMIC PRESS TORONTO,TORONTO,"1 SPADINA CRESCENT, ROOM 205, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 3G3, CANADA",,,978-1-926642-01-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,574,579,,,,,,6,"Business; Economics; Management; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BLY20,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271409600099,0

The review of the AHWM Programme is largely based on information collated through targeted surveys of participating and non-participating farmers and veterinary practices in five different Scottish regions. The questionnaires were divided in four main sections including introductory questions, questions in relation to benchmarking indicators, economic aspects and the overall impact on farmers' perceptions on animal welfare and the support programme itself In addition, available information and data from a literature review and official data sets and statistics such as data from the SIACS database, Farm Account Survey data sets, Farm Management Handbook and the AHWM benchmarking database have been incorporated. The review shows that the scheme has encouraged a closer link between farmer and veterinarian and both farmers and veterinarians indicate reductions in animal health and welfare problems particularly in areas such as abortions and lameness in sheep. It underlines that measures to improve animal welfare in the CAP play an important role in improving the health and welfare of Europe's farm animals and can provide an important contribution to rural development programmes in the EU.","[Schwarz, Gerald] Humboldt Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Social Sci, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Wilson, Ron] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH9 3JN, Midlothian, Scotland; [Goddard, Pete; Lozada-Ellison, Luz Maria] Macaulay Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland",Humboldt University of Berlin; University of Edinburgh; James Hutton Institute,"Schwarz, G (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåHumboldt Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Social Sci, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",schwarzg@agrar.hu-berlin.de; Ron.Wilson@ed.ac.uk; p.goddard@macaulay.ac.uk; l.lozada@macaulay.ac.uk,"Goddard, Pete/H-3346-2011",,,,,,13,0,0,0,4,LITHUANIAN UNIV AGRICULTURE,KAUNO RAJ,"STUDENTU 11, AKADEMIJA, KAUNO RAJ, LT-53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2009,,,,,,,408,413,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BNL14,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000274845200071,0

Methods: Adjuvant therapy comprised 24 weeks of treatment with either oral capecitabine 1250 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle or intravenous bolus FU 500 mg/m(2) and LV 250 mg/m(2) weekly for 6 weeks of an 8-week cycle (Roswell Park regimen). The analysis comprised short-term (1 year after initiation of adjuvant therapy) and long-term (up to 15 years) components. The long-term analysis involved a three-state (disease-free, recurrence and death) Markov model. Estimates for transition probabilities, costs and utilities were derived from the X-ACT trial, a Japanese phase 11 trial, and other published sources. Cost estimates were considered from the perspective of a healthcare payer. Costs were expressed in Japanese Yen ( Y), year 2007 values. A discount rate of 3% was applied to costs and outcomes. Cost effectiveness was expressed as a cost per QALY. The effects of uncertainty were explored through one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: In the 1-year analysis, direct costs were Y440 000 ($US4000) less per patient with capecitabine than with FU/LV. In the long-term analysis, differences between treatments in direct medical costs ranged from Y470000 ($US4300) to Y580000 ($US5300) depending on the time horizon used. Capecitabine was also projected to increase the number of QALYs compared with FU/LV. The sensitivity analysis suggested that the model outcome was robust. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis estimate of capecitabine being the dominant regimen was 96.6% at a zero willingness to pay. Direct costs remained lower with capecitabine if the price of generic LV was >= 50% of the branded product. Conclusion: This analysis suggests that capecitabine improves health outcomes and lowers direct costs compared with bolus FU/LV (i.e. dominant treatment strategy) when used as adjuvant therapy in patients with stage 3 colon cancer in Japan.","[Shiroiwa, Takeru; Tsutani, Kiichiro] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Drug Policy & Management, Tokyo, Japan; [Fukuda, Takashi] Univ Tokyo, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Econ & Epidemiol Res, Tokyo, Japan; [Shimozuma, Kojiro] Ritsumeikan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Dept Biomed Sci, Kusatsu, Japan; [Ohashi, Yasuo] Univ Tokyo, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo; Ritsumeikan University; University of Tokyo,"Shiroiwa, T (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Tokyo, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Drug Policy & Management, Tokyo, Japan.",t.shiroiwa@gmail.com,"Takeru, Shiroiwa/O-7926-2019","Shiroiwa, Takeru/0000-0003-3055-9932",,,,,31,18,20,0,4,ADIS INT LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 1311, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2009,27.0,7,,,,,597,608,,10.2165/11310110-000000000-00000,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,506YU,19663530.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000270815700007,0

The model assumes partial narrow framing. Investors follow a two-step approach. First, they optimally allocate wealth among investment goals. Second, they determine an optimal investment strategy for each investment goal separately. We show that when loss aversion is according to the experimental findings, investors mainly invest their wealth to reach long-term goals and adopt investment strategies with high leverage to reach short-term goals. The overall strategy also display high leverage. The same patterns is observed when loss aversion is extreme and goals are very ambitious. By contrast, when loss aversion is extreme but goals are not too ambitious, investors mainly invest to reach short-term goals and adopt safe investment strategies for this purpose.","[De Giorgi, Enrico G.] Univ St Gallen, Dept Econ, Bodanstr 6, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"De Giorgi, EG (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv St Gallen, Dept Econ, Bodanstr 6, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",enrico.degiorgi@unisg.ch,"De+Giorgi, Enrico/AAQ-5269-2020","De Giorgi, Enrico/0000-0001-8017-9618",Swiss National Science Foundation [105214-130078]; National Center of Competence in Research Financial Valuation and Risk Management (NCCR-FINRISK); Foundation for Research and Development of the University of Lugano,Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); National Center of Competence in Research Financial Valuation and Risk Management (NCCR-FINRISK)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Foundation for Research and Development of the University of Lugano,"Financial support from the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant 105214-130078), the National Center of Competence in Research Financial Valuation and Risk Management (NCCR-FINRISK) and the Foundation for Research and Development of the University of Lugano is gratefully acknowledged.

It differs from the usual worst-case approach in that a (dynamic) portfolio is evaluated not only by its performance when there is an adversarial opponent (nature), but also by its performance relative to a stochastic benchmark. The benchmark corresponds to the wealth of a fictitious benchmark investor who invests optimally given knowledge of the model chosen by nature, so in this regard, our objective has the flavor of min-max regret. This relative performance approach has several important properties: (i) optimal portfolios seek to perform well over the entire range of models and not just the worst case, and hence are less pessimistic than those obtained from the usual worst-case approach; (ii) the dynamic problem reduces to a convex static optimization problem under reasonable choices of the benchmark portfolio for important classes of models including ambiguous jump-diffusions; and (iii) this static problem is dual to a Bayesian version of a single period asset allocation problem where the prior on the unknown parameters (for the dual problem) correspond to the Lagrange multipliers in this duality relationship. This dual static problem can be interpreted as a less pessimistic alternative to the single period worst-case Markowitz problem. More generally, this duality suggests that learning and robustness are closely related when benchmarked objectives are used.","[Lim, Andrew E.

Aggregate claims of an insurer follow a compound Poisson process and premiums are collected at a constant rate with additional random fluctuation. The insurer is allowed to invest the surplus into a risky asset with volatility dependent on the level of the investment, which permits the incorporation of rational investment strategies as proposed by Berk and Green (2004). The return on investment is modulated by a Markov process which generalizes previously studied settings for the evolution of the interest rate in time. The Gerber-Shiu expected penalty-reward function is studied in this context, including ruin probabilities (a first-passage problem) as a special case. The second order integro-differential system of equations that characterizes the function of interest is obtained. As a closed-form solution does not exist, a numerical procedure based on the Chebyshev polynomial approximation through a collocation method is proposed.

Optimal pension management in a stochastic framework. Insurance: Math. Econ. 34, 79-95]. When there are three types of asset, cash, bond and stock, and a non-hedgeable wage risk, the optimal pension portfolio composition is horizon dependent for pension plan members whose terminal utility is an exponential function of real wealth (nominal wealth-to-price index ratio). With market parameters usually assumed, wealth invested in bond and stock increases as retirement approaches, and wealth invested in cash asset decreases. The present study also shows that there are errors in the formulation of the wealth process and control variables in solving the optimization problem in the study of Battocchio and Menoncin, which render their solution erroneous and lead to wrong results in their numerical simulation.

The distinguishing feature of our analysis is that we impose on the model two important features of the tax code: the limited use of capital losses and the inability to wash sell. We show that under remarkably mild conditions, the lack of pre-tax arbitrage implies the lack of post-tax arbitrage with the limited use of capital losses. The conditions are that the risk free interest rate be positive and that tax rates on interest income exceed capital gains tax rates. The result also holds when only a wash sale constraint is imposed and no investor holds a portfolio with a large capital loss. We allow investors to face different tax rates and have different bases for the calculation of capital gains taxes. The characterizations we provide have important implications for both asset pricing and portfolio choice. Our results imply that models that use arbitrage-free pre-tax models continue for derivative pricing and hedging are also arbitrage free in a world with taxes. Similarly, portfolio choice models with taxes typically specify pre-tax arbitrage free price processes and then analyze portfolio choice in the presence of taxes. In these models, it is unclear if portfolio recommendations are based on risk-return tradeoffs or on the arbitrage opportunities present in the model. Our results imply that if the above features of the tax code are modeled explicitly, then we can isolate the post-tax risk-return tradeoffs.","[Gallmeyer, Michael] Univ Virginia, McIntire Sch Commerce, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Srivastava, Sanjay] OS Financial Trading Syst, Pittsburgh, PA USA",University of Virginia,"Gallmeyer, M (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Virginia, McIntire Sch Commerce, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",mgallmeyer@virginia.edu; srivastavafts@gmail.com,,,DeMong-Pettit Research Fund at the McIntire School of Commerce,DeMong-Pettit Research Fund at the McIntire School of Commerce,"An earlier version was circulated under the title No Arbitrage and Portfolio Choice with Taxes.

This difference between the aggregate stock market and individual stocks is analyzed in a dynamic general equilibrium setting with incomplete information. The main findings are as follows. First, consistent with existing empirical evidence, the correlation between stock returns and earnings surprises is, on average, positive at the individual stock level and is lower or even negative at the aggregate level. Second, a stock's return is less sensitive to its earnings surprises if the expected earnings growth of the stock is more pro-cyclical. Third, a decrease of information quality of a stock increases its risk premium if the stock accounts for a small fraction of the economy, but decreases its risk premium if the stock accounts for a large fraction.","[Yan, Hongjun] Yale Sch Management, 135 Prospect St,POB 208200, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Yan, HJ (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåYale Sch Management, 135 Prospect St,POB 208200, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",hongjun.yan@yale.edu,,,,,,,54,0,1,0,1,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

We estimate national and regional housing factors from a comprehensive set of U. S. price and quantity data available at mixed frequencies and over different time spans. Our housing factors pick up the common components in the data and are less affected by the idiosyncratic noise in individual series. This allows us to get more reliable estimates of the consumption effects of housing market shocks. We find that shocks at the national level have large cumulative effects on retail sales in all regions. Though the effects of regional shocks are smaller, they are also significant. We analyse the driving forces of housing market activity by means of factor-augmented vector autoregressions. Our results show that lowering mortgage rates has a larger effect than a similar reduction of the federal funds rate.

Questions have been raised about the sensitivity of these measures in COPD. Limitations in detecting adequate patient-level changes in HR-QOL over time in stable and exacerbation states compared with disease-specific instruments could also result in underestimation of known treatment benefits. The purpose of this article was to present and discuss the empirical evidence on the validity of generic MAU measures within the COPD population. We built upon a previously conducted validation review for the period 1997-2007 that used 'respiratory disease' and 'EQ-5D' as keywords. For this discussion, PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched for articles in English from 1988 to August 2009, using similar search words. Based on the performance of MAU measures in COPD and exacerbations, they appear to have limited discriminatory ability, particularly between moderate and severe COPD, despite known differences in HR-QOL. Sensitivity to clinically relevant change in stable COPD over time due to treatment also appears limited. Current research suggests adequate sensitivity regarding detecting the onset and resolution of an exacerbation; however, sensitivity is limited in the short term, such as daily changes in health status. The evidence suggests responsiveness of MAU measures may be restricted to large within-patient change, which leads to difficulties in evaluating the subtle but important impact of exacerbations. Studies presenting alternative methods of deriving COPD-related utilities are also discussed. Overall, the insensitivities of generic MAU measures in COPD can lead to biased cost-effectiveness analyses and ill-informed economic decisions. Alternative measures such as condition-specific preference-based measures may be used in circumstances where more sensitivity is needed. The trade-off allows relevant and sensitive matters most important to patients to be evaluated; however inevitable gaps such as those related to adverse events are not considered.","[Petrillo, Jennifer] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Serv Res & Policy, London WC1, England; [van Nooten, Floortje] United BioSource Corp, London, England; [Jones, Paul] Univ London, London, England; [Rutten-van Molken, Maureen] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, Rotterdam, Netherlands",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; United Biosource Corporation; University of London; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Petrillo, J (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåLondon Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Serv Res & Policy, London WC1, England.",jennifer.petrillo@lshtm.ac.uk,"Molken, Maureen PMH Rutten-van/G-8481-2014; Molken, Maureen Rutten-van/X-8712-2019","Molken, Maureen PMH Rutten-van/0000-0001-8706-3159; Molken, Maureen Rutten-van/0000-0001-8706-3159",Nycomed,Nycomed,"The development of this article was supported by funds from Nycomed to United BioSource Corporation (UBC).

It starts with a risk-adjusted assessment given by a set of test probabilities of the future cash-flows coming from a company business plan and attempts to define terms of a supervisory accounting mode. First, inspired by the idea of representation of obligations by equivalent assets, we define the supervisory provision (or liability) attached to existing obligations. This provision is market consistent according to the mathematical definition by Cheridito, Filipovic and Kupper and satisfies a property of equilibrium between supervision's wish for stress testing and management's possibility for appropriate choice of assets. The comparison between the initial market price of assets and the supervisory provision defines solvability of existing obligations. In a second step the paper defines a required solvency capital as related to the level of discrepancy between assets and obligations of a company. Solvency of a business plan is defined by requiring as initial market value an additional amount over the one needed for solvability: this is the required solvency capital. A business plan with zero required solvency capital is said to have an optimal replicating asset portfolio. It is shown that under a natural additional condition, that of a market prudent set of test probabilities solvability of an obligation allows for solvency of a related business plan, by choice of the asset portfolio. The paper emphasizes the distinction between supervisory and market oriented accounting hinted to in the CEIOPS CP 20 consultative paper.","[Artzner, Philippe; Eisele, Karl-Theodor] Univ Strasbourg, Inst Rech Math Avancee, FR-67084 Strasbourg, France; [Artzner, Philippe; Eisele, Karl-Theodor] CNRS, FR-67084 Strasbourg, France; [Artzner, Philippe; Eisele, Karl-Theodor] Lab Rech Gest, FR-67084 Strasbourg, France",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Artzner, P (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Strasbourg, Inst Rech Math Avancee, FR-67084 Strasbourg, France.",artzner@unistra.fr; eisele@unistra.fr,,,AERF/CKER; Actuarial Foundation,AERF/CKER; Actuarial Foundation,"Partial support from AERF/CKER, The Actuarial Foundation is gratefully acknowledged.",,12,7,7,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,NOV,2010,40.0,2,,,,,569,585,,10.2143/AST.40.2.2061128,0.0,,,17,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,710SK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000286533700006,0

The firm's objective is to minimize the total deviation of its cash-balance process to some pre-set target levels by selecting an appropriate premium policy. Our problem is totally new and has three distinguishable features: (1) both full and partial information cases are investigated here; (2) the state is subject to terminal constraint; (3) a forward-backward stochastic differential equation formulation is given which is more systematic and mathematically advanced. This formulation also enables us to continue further research in a generalized stochastic recursive control framework (see Duffie and Epstein (1992), El Karoui et al. (2001), etc.). The optimal premium policy with the associated optimal objective functional are completely and explicitly derived. In addition, a backward separation technique adaptive to forward-backward stochastic systems with the state constraint is presented as an efficient and convenient alternative to the traditional Wonham's (1968) separation principle in our partial information setup. Some concluding remarks are also given here. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Following Bresnahan and Reiss (1990, 1991), a discrete game is a generalization of a standard discrete choice model where utility depends on the actions of other players. Using recent algorithms to compute all of the Nash equilibria to a game, we propose simulation-based estimators for static, discrete games. We demonstrate that the model is identified under weak functional form assumptions using exclusion restrictions and an identification at infinity approach. Monte Carlo evidence demonstrates that the estimator can perform well in moderately sized samples. As an application, we study entry decisions by construction contractors to bid on highway projects in California. We find that an equilibrium is more likely to be observed if it maximizes joint profits, has a higher Nash product, uses mixed strategies, and is not Pareto dominated by another equilibrium.","[Bajari, Patrick] Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Hong, Han] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ryan, Stephen P.] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Stanford University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Bajari, P (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Minnesota, Dept Econ, 4-127 Hanson Hall,1925 4th St S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",bajari@econ.umn.edu; hanhong@stanford.edu; sryan@mit.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-0339328, SES-0452143]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0924784] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We would like to thank the editor, four anonymous referees for comments that greatly improved the quality of the paper, seminar participants, and Victor Aguirregabiria, Lanier Benkard, Federico Ciliberto, Jeremy Fox, Stephanie Houghton, John Krainer, Andy McLennan, Andrew Sweeting, and Chris Timmins for helpful discussions.

Assuming that the premium calculation principle is a convex functional we prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions and provide a necessary optimality condition (via needle-like perturbations, widely known in optimal control).

Under this approach the objective is an increasing function of the relative performance of the asset portfolio compared to a benchmark. The benchmark can be, for example, a function of an insurer's liability payments, or the (either contractual or target) payments of a pension fund. The benchmarking approach tolerates but progressively penalizes shortfalls, while at the same time progressively rewards outperformance. Working in a general, possibly non-Markovian setting, a solution to the optimization problem is presented, providing insights into the impact of benchmarking on the resulting optimal portfolio.

In the Report to the seventeenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China has pointed out that we should unswervingly develop and expand socialist democracy, improve institutions for democracy, diversify democratic forms and widen democratic channels to guarantee the people's rights to participate and to oversee. To ensure scientific and democratic decision-making, we will improve its transparency and expand public participation in it. Under the guidance of the CPC Central Committee, some areas such as Wenling in Zhejiang province have already started Participatory Budgeting (PB) reform. This paper applies these early reality-based cases, i.e. combining the cases in China and America, in order to generalize the common forms, implementing procedures and operating bottlenecks of PB. On base of stating the cases, the essay applies theoretical analysis and comparative study to PB, to propose the countermeasures of those bottlenecks, as well as build a common model of PB. As a useful tool, the model would provide reference for reform of PB all over China, so as to improve the effectiveness of government operation, the use efficiency of financial funds as well as better our public financial system.","[Dong Xiao-hui; Tan Ting] Dalian Univ Technol, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China",Dalian University of Technology,,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,6,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,1817,1823,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100244,0

We find that readers have an economically significant preference for like-minded news.

The framework is a first-order autoregressive panel data model allowing for heterogeneity in the intercept but not in the autoregressive parameter. The tests are all based on usual t-statistics corresponding to least squares estimators of the autoregressive parameter resulting from different transformations of the observed variables. The performance of the tests is investigated and compared by deriving the local power of the tests when the autoregressive parameter is local-to-unity. The results show that the assumption concerning the initial values is extremely important in this matter. The outcome of a simulation experiment demonstrates that the local power of the tests provides a good approximation to their actual power in finite samples.","[Madsen, Edith] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Madsen, Edith] Univ Copenhagen, CAM, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen,"Madsen, E (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Oster Farimagsgade 5, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",edith.madsen@econ.ku.dk,,,Danish National Research Foundation,Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond),"I wish to thank J.

The symptoms of MS can restrict the individual's physical activity and income-earning ability, resulting in a major financial burden on the patient, family, health system and society. This systematic literature review was conducted to document the economic burden of MS. Employing pre-defined search terms and inclusion/exclusion criteria, systematic searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Health Economic Evaluations Database (HEED), the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (EED) and the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) website as well as conference abstracts. We identified 29 cost-of-illness studies that met the a priori inclusion criteria. The cost categories responsible for the majority of costs associated with MS varied across countries. There was a significant increase in costs associated with an increase in disease severity as measured by the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. The increase in magnitude was coupled with changes in the distribution of costs; although direct medical costs were important contributors in earlier stages of disease, they were outweighed by indirect costs in later stages, mainly due to relapses and productivity losses. Considering the increased costs associated with relapse occurrence and increasing disease severity, pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical interventions aimed at delaying the progression of disease may help to reduce the economic burden of MS.","[Naci, Huseyin] United BioSource Corp, Ctr Hlth Econ & Sci Policy, London WC1A 2NS, England; [Fleurence, Rachael] United BioSource Corp, Ctr Hlth Econ & Sci Policy, Bethesda, MD USA; [Birt, Julie; Duhig, Amy] Eli Lilly & Co, Global Hlth Outcomes, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA",United Biosource Corporation; United Biosource Corporation; Eli Lilly,"Naci, H (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUnited BioSource Corp, MHS Ctr Hlth Econ & Sci Policy, 20 Bloomsbury Sq, London WC1A 2NS, England.",huseyin.naci@unitedbiosource.com,,,Eli Lilly and Company,Eli Lilly and Company(Eli Lilly),"The authors acknowledge Alissa Shaul for her assistance in the study identification and selection phase of writing this manuscript, and Julia Green for her help in validating the data extraction.

J,"O'Neill, P; Devlin, NJ",,,,"O'Neill, Phill; Devlin, Nancy J.",,,An Analysis of NICE's 'Restricted' (or 'Optimized') Decisions,PHARMACOECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Background: A common way of describing UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) decisions is to distinguish between cases where NICE recommended use of a healthcare technology by all relevant patients ('yes'); those where it did not recommend use ('no'); and those where its decisions are a mixture of 'yes' to some patient subgroups, and 'no' to others. Over half of NICE's decisions are of this mixed type, which involve restricting (or 'optimizing') patient use in some way. Objective: To report an attempt to develop a robust and defensible means of measuring and describing the degree of patient access in mixed NICE decisions. Methods: A list of mixed decisions made from 2006 to the end of 2009 was identified using HTAinSite (TM). The following calculation was used: M=(p/P)x100, where M is a measure of the level of patient access (0 = no access, 100=full access), P is the set of patients considered in the guidance as Potential candidates for treatment (given the licensed use and the scope of NICE's appraisal), and p is a subset of those patients, for whom NICE did recommend treatment. M can be estimated either for a specific product or for a group of technologies (Multiple Technology Appraisals). Both product-specific and overall M were estimated, using estimates of p obtained from NICE costing templates. These data are subject to some important limitations, so the results should be regarded as illustrative. Results: Of the 69 medicines that have received a mixed decision since January 2006, 34 included details that allowed the estimation of M. Of these 34 decisions, 24 (71%) had a product-specific M <= 50, 16 (47%) M <= 25 and 11 (32%) M <= 10. That is, in just under three-quarters of the mixed decisions for which P and p were available, NICE recommended use for less than half of patients for whom the medicine is licensed, and in nearly one-third of these sorts of decisions, NICE recommended use in <= 10% of potential patients. The estimates of M for groups of technologies provide a slightly different picture: for example, grouped M was <= 10 in <20% of decisions. Conclusions: The measure of patient access, M, proposed here has the potential to provide a more informative way of reporting all NICE decisions, particularly 'restricted' (or 'optimized') decisions.","[O'Neill, Phill; Devlin, Nancy J.] Off Hlth Econ, London SW1 2DY, England",,"Devlin, NJ (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåOff Hlth Econ, London SW1 2DY, England.",ndevlin@ohe.org,"Devlin, Nancy/M-3816-2014",,Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI),Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI),"The authors acknowledge with thanks, helpful comments received on an earlier draft of this paper from Jon Sussex and Adrian Towse (Office of Health Economics), Peter Littlejohn and Sarah Garner (NICE) and three anonymous referees for PharmacoEconomics.

The reliability of model results is greatly dependent on accuracy of model inputs but on occasion, data sources may not provide all the required inputs. Therefore, calibration of model inputs to epidemiological endpoints informed by existing data can be a useful tool to ensure credibility of the results. Objective: To compare different computational methods of calibrating a Markov model to US data. Methods: We developed a Markov model that simulates the natural history of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and subsequent cervical disease in the US. Because the model consists of numerous transition probabilities that cannot be directly estimated from data, calibration to multiple disease endpoints was required to ensure its predictive validity. Goodness of fit was measured as the mean percentage deviation of model-predicted endpoints from target estimates. During the calibration process we used the manual, random and Nelder-Mead calibration methods. Results: The Nelder-Mead and manual calibration methods achieved the best fit, with mean deviations of 7% and 10%, respectively. Nelder-Mead accomplished this result with substantially less analyst time than the manual method, but required more intensive computing capability. The random search method achieved a mean deviation of 39%, which we considered unacceptable despite the ease of implementation of that method.

And the LSTAR model with two thresholds is used to the empirical study of RMB exchange rate. The conclusion is that if RMB exchange rate relative to PPP three months earlier is undervalued more than 2.44% or is overvalued more than 1.09%, RMB exchange rate now has the tendency to PPP, otherwise has no tendency to PPP, but is highly persistent.","[Xu Jia-jie] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Finance, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang Gongshang University,,,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,1290,1295,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100177,0

Then, using the Laplace transform, we derive a defective renewal equation satisfied by the survival probability. For the exponential claim sizes, we present the explicit recursion expression for the survival probability, by which we can exactly solve the survival probability step-by-step.

This bias vanishes as the sample size increases, but in small samples can be significant. In this article it is shown that an unbiased nonparametric estimator of the CTE does not exist. In addition, the asymptotic behavior of the bias of the empirical CTE is studied, and a closed form expression for its first order term is derived. This expression facilitates the study of the behavior of the empirical CTE with respect to the underlying distribution, and suggests an alternative (to the bootstrap) approach to bias correction.

Only now do we have a study of a common disorder (breast cancer) that accounts for the risk associated with multiple genes. Such a collection of genes is called a polygene. We take two approaches to modelling the severity of adverse selection which may result from insurers being unable to take account of tests for polygenes as well as major genes. First, we look at several genetic testing scenarios, with a corresponding range of possible insurance-buying behaviours, in a market model for CI insurance. Because a relatively large proportion of the population is exposed to adverse polygenic risk, the costs of adverse selection are potentially much greater than have been associated with rare single genes. Second, we use utility models to map out when adverse selection will appear, and which risk groups will cause it. Levels of risk aversion consistent with some empirical studies do not lead to significant adverse selection in our model, but lower levels of risk aversion could effectively eliminate the market.","[Macdonald, Angus S.] Heriot Watt Univ, Dept Actuarial Math & Stat, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Macdonald, Angus S.] Heriot Watt Univ, Maxwell Inst Math Sci, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland",Heriot Watt University; University of Edinburgh; Heriot Watt University,"Macdonald, AS (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåHeriot Watt Univ, Dept Actuarial Math & Stat, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland.",A.S.Macdonald@ma.hw.ac.uk,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This work was carried out at the Genetics and Insurance Research Centre at Heriot-Watt University.

Based on modeling the arrival rates for catastrophe risks, the pricing formulas of contingent capital are derived by the Merton measure.

All workers can search, on or off the job. I characterize an equilibrium and prove its existence. The equilibrium generates a nondegenerate, continuous distribution of employed workers over the values of contracts, despite that all matches are identical and workers observe all offers. A striking property is that the equilibrium is block recursive; that is, individuals' optimal decisions and optimal contracts are independent of the distribution of workers. This property makes the equilibrium analysis tractable. Consistent with stylized facts, the equilibrium predicts that (i) wages increase with tenure, (ii) job-to-job transitions decrease with tenure and wages, and (iii) wage mobility is limited in the sense that the lower the worker's wage, the lower the future wage a worker will move to in the next job transition. Moreover, block recursivity implies that changes in the unemployment benefit and the minimum wage have no effect on an employed worker's job-to-job transitions and contracts.","Univ Toronto, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada",University of Toronto,"Shi, SY (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Toronto, Dept Econ, 150 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada.",shouyong@chass.utoronto.ca,,,Bank of Canada Fellowship; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Bank of Canada Fellowship; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"I thank a co-editor and three anonymous referees for providing thoughtful suggestions that led to significant improvements in the paper.

Many articles addressing pharmacoeconomic topics have reported studies purported to be of the case-control type. However, on examination, these were actually standard cohort studies that were misnamed because they compared cases of a particular illness to 'controls' without the illness. The actual case-control design involves a series of cases with the outcome of interest. In pharmacoeconomic applications, the outcome of interest would typically be high cost, or hospitalization, or return to full quality of life. The illness does not define cases, but rather is actually the 'exposure'. The 'controls' must be a sample of the study base, not subjects without the illness. In this article, we review the features of a proper case-control study and contrast them with those of the more common cohort study. Confusing the control series of a cohort study with the 'controls' in a case-control study leads to serious problems with understanding the research, its strengths and drawbacks (e.g. confounding concerns), and interpretation of the Findings. Although the case-control design has so far been used little to address pharmacoeconomic questions, it can be very efficient in certain situations, particularly when obtaining data on all subjects is burdensome or when conditions provide a ready case series but not the rest of the subjects.","[Caro, J.

Despite this evidence, non-normal multivariate modelling of asset returns does not appear to play an important role in asset management or risk management because of the complexity of estimating multivariate non-normal distributions from market return data. In this paper, we present a new subclass of generalized elliptical distributions for asset returns that is sufficiently user friendly, so that it can be utilized by asset managers and risk managers for modelling multivariate non-normal distributions of asset returns. For the distribution we present, which we call the multi-tail generalized elliptical distribution, we (1) derive the densities using results of the theory of generalized elliptical distributions and (2) introduce a function, which we label the tail function, to describe their tail behaviour. We test the model on German stock returns and find that (1) the multi-tail model introduced in the paper significantly outperforms the classical elliptical model and (2) the hypothesis of homogeneous tail behaviour can be rejected.","[Kring, Sebastian; Rachev, Svetlozar T.; Hoechstoetter, Markus] Univ Karlsruhe, Sch Econ & Business Engn, D-76128 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Kring, Sebastian; Rachev, Svetlozar T.; Hoechstoetter, Markus] KIT, Kollegium Sch, D-76128 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Rachev, Svetlozar T.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Stat & Appl Probabil, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Rachev, Svetlozar T.] FinAnalytica Inc, New York, NY 10168 USA; [Fabozzi, Frank J.] Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Bianchi, Michele Leonardo] Bank Italy, Specialized Intermediaries Supervis Dept, I-00184 Rome, Italy",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Yale University; European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Kring, S (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Karlsruhe, Sch Econ & Business Engn, Bau 2,20-12,R210,Postfach 6980, D-76128 Karlsruhe, Germany.",kring@statistik.uni-karlsruhe.de; rachev@statistik.uni-karlsruhe.de; hoechstoetter@statistik.uni-karlsruhe.de; frank.fabozzi@yale.edu; micheleleonardo.bianchi@bancaditalia.it,"Bianchi, Michele Leonardo/AAE-9702-2020; Rachev, Svetlozar/ABD-9457-2020","Bianchi, Michele Leonardo/0000-0002-1865-6935;",Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft; Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst,Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"The views expressed in this paper are those of the authors and should not be attributed to the institutions to which they belong.

The Polish agricultural land market is at the development stage that can be supported by the increase in prices and lease rents for agricultural land.

All these factor copulas are embedded in a framework of stochastic correlations. We furthermore generalize the linear dependence in the usual factor approach to a more general Archimedean copula dependence between the individual trigger variable and the common latent factor. Our analysis is carried out on a non-homogeneous correlation structure of the underlying portfolio. CDO tranche market premia, even throughout the correlation crisis in May 2005, can be reproduced by certain models.

Using a binary choice model to explain the probability of a firm raising debt and a fractional regression model to explain the relative amount of debt issued, we find strong support for both hypotheses. Confirming recent empirical evidence, we find also that, although larger firms are more likely to use debt, conditional on their having some debt, firm size is negatively related to the proportion of debt used by firms.","[Ramalho, Joaquim J.

In this paper, we minimize the risk that the value of the hedging portfolio falls below the payoff of the claim at time T. We use a coherent risk measure, introduced by Artzner et al., to measure the risk of the shortfall. The dynamic optimization problem of finding a self-financing strategy that minimizes the coherent risk of the shortfall can be split into a static optimization problem and a representation problem. We will deduce necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for the static problem using convex duality methods. The solution of the static optimization problem turns out to be a randomized test with a typical 0-1 structure. Our results improve those obtained by Nakano. The optimal hedging strategy consists of superhedging a modified claim that is the product of the original payoff and the solution to the static problem.","Princeton Univ, Dept Operat Res & Financial Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Rudloff, B (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåPrinceton Univ, Dept Operat Res & Financial Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",brudloff@princeton.edu,,"Rudloff, Birgit/0000-0003-1675-5451",,,,,23,11,14,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Our main results are: (1) identical investors, who use the same statistic to represent risk, hold identical portfolios of risky assets equal to the market portfolio; and (2) heterogeneous investors as expressed by the variance or the extended Gini hold different risky assets in portfolios, and therefore no one holds the market portfolio.","[Yitzhaki, Shlomo] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Cent Bur Stat, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Yitzhaki, Shlomo] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Econ, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Shalit, Haim] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Econ, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Ben Gurion University,"Yitzhaki, S (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåHebrew Univ Jerusalem, Cent Bur Stat, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",shlomo.yitzhaki@huji.ac.il,"SHALIT, HAIM/JRY-3033-2023","SHALIT, HAIM/0000-0003-4359-4614",Ben-Gurion University; Sapir College joint Foundation for Research in Economics and Social Issues,Ben-Gurion University; Sapir College joint Foundation for Research in Economics and Social Issues,This research is supported by the Ben-Gurion University and Sapir College joint Foundation for Research in Economics and Social Issues.

Now lots of researches focus on the software project risk analysis, which apply a number of qualitative methods and quantitative methods. But most of methods ignore the dynamic nature of software project, only paying attention to predict in advance or analyze afterwards, which cannot meet the challenge of software project management. So Bayesian network which can provide real-time analysis is selected to analyze the software project risks. Through literature review and investigation of Chinese software professionals, the paper finds out 12 risk factors. In terms of an ERP project revising above-mentioned risk factors, according to easy expansibility of topological structure and strong self-learning ability of Bayesian network, the paper uses priori knowledge and posterior knowledge to analyze the risk of the ERP project in requirements period.

We consider six such disorders, namely adult polycystic kidney disease, early-onset Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, myotonic dystrophy (MD), hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer; and breast/ovarian cancer. Actuarial models based on the epidemiological literature exist for all these except MD. We parameterise a suitable model of MD, then synthesize the results from all six models to estimate the adverse selection costs arising from restrictions on insurers' use of genetic information. These are all very small, only in the most extreme cases rising above 1% of premiums. In the worst case - females displaying 'extreme' adverse selection in a 'small' critical illness insurance market, with the use of family history banned - the cost is about 3% of premiums. Our model includes the most common single-gene disorders relevant to insurance, and includes representatives of most important classes of these disorders. While the 'bottom-up' approach could be continued by modelling more and more diseases, we suggest that our model is adequate to draw robust conclusions.","[Macdonald, Angus] Heriot Watt Univ, Dept Actuarial Math & Stat, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Macdonald, Angus] Heriot Watt Univ, Maxwell Inst Math Sci, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland",Heriot Watt University; Heriot Watt University; University of Edinburgh,"Macdonald, A (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåHeriot Watt Univ, Dept Actuarial Math & Stat, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland.",A.S.Macdonald@hw.ac.uk,,,Association of British Insurers,Association of British Insurers,"This work was carried out at the Genetics and Insurance Research Centre at Heriot-Watt University, which receives funding from a consortium of insurance companies through the Association of British Insurers.

In order to manage the risk borne by annuity providers, one needs to take into account all sources of uncertainty that affect the value of future obligations under the contract. In this paper, we define the concept of annuity rate as the conditional expected present value random variable of future payments of the annuity, given the future dynamics of its risk factors. The annuity rate deals with the non-diversifiable systematic risk contained in the life annuity contract, and it involves mortality risk as well as investment risk. While it is plausible to assume that there is no correlation between the two risks, each affects the annuity rate through a combination of dependent random variables. In order to understand the probabilistic profile of the annuity rate, we apply cornonotonicity theory to approximate its quantile function. We also derive accurate upper and lower bounds for prediction intervals for annuity rates. We use the Lee Carter model for mortality risk and the Vasicek model for the term structure of interest rates with an annually renewable fixed-income investment policy. Different investment strategies can be handled using this framework. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This paper studies different insurance policies in the context of capital reduction for a range of extreme loss models and insurance policy scenarios in a multi-period, multiple risk setting. A Loss Distributional Approach (LDA) for modeling of the annual loss process, involving homogeneous compound Poisson processes for the annual losses, with heavy-tailed severity models comprised of alpha-stable severities is considered. There has been little analysis of such models to date and it is believed insurance models will play more of a role in OpRisk mitigation and capital reduction in future. The first question of interest is when would it be equitable for a bank or financial institution to purchase insurance for heavy-tailed OpRisk losses under different insurance policy scenarios? The second question pertains to Solvency II and addresses quantification of insurer capital for such operational risk scenarios. Considering fundamental insurance policies available, in several two risk scenarios, we can provide both analytic results and extensive simulation studies of insurance mitigation for important basic policies, the intention being to address questions related to VaR reduction under Basel II, SCR under Solvency II and fair insurance premiums in OpRisk for different extreme loss scenarios. In the process we provide closed-form solutions for the distribution of loss processes and claims processes in an LDA structure as well as closed-form analytic solutions for the Expected Shortfall, SCR and MCR under Basel II and Solvency II. We also provide closed-form analytic solutions for the annual loss distribution of multiple risks including insurance mitigation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

There are many reasons to use nonlinear techniques for predicting bankruptcy from financial ratios. Here we propose the so-called Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict the default risk of German firms. Our analysis is based on the Creditreform database. In all tests performed in this paper the nonlinear model classified by SVM exceeds the benchmark logit model, based on the same predictors, in terms of the performance metric, AR. The empirical evidence is in favor of the SVM for classification, especially in the linear non-separable case. The sensitivity investigation and a corresponding visualization tool reveal that the classifying ability of SVM appears to be superior over a wide range of SVM parameters. In terms of the empirical results obtained by SVM, the eight most important predictors related to bankruptcy for these German firms belong to the ratios of activity, profitability, liquidity, leverage and the percentage of incremental inventories. Some of the financial ratios selected by the SVM model are new because they have a strong nonlinear dependence on the default risk but a weak linear dependence that therefore cannot be captured by the usual linear models such as the DA and logit models.","[Chen, Shiyi] Fudan Univ, China Ctr Econ Studies, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Haerdle, W.

Our interest in static and GBH strategies is motivated by the fact that these strategies are intuitive and straightforward to implement in practice. The myopic strategy, while more difficult to implement, is often close to optimal and so we use it to obtain tight bounds on the performance of the true optimal dynamic trading strategy. We find that while this optimal dynamic strategy often significantly outperforms the GBH strategy, this is not true in general when no-borrowing or no-short-sales constraints are imposed on the investor. This has implications for investors when a dynamic trading strategy is too costly or difficult to implement in practice. For the class of security price dynamics under consideration, we also show that the optimal GBH strategy is always superior to the optimal static strategy. We also demonstrate that the dual approach is even more tractable than originally considered. In particular, we show it is often possible to solve for the theoretically satisfying upper bounds on the optimal value function that were suggested when the dual approach was originally proposed.","[Haugh, Martin B.] Columbia Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Operat Res, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Jain, Ashish] Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University; Columbia University,"Haugh, MB (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåColumbia Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Operat Res, New York, NY 10027 USA.",martin.b.haugh@gmail.com,,,,,,,35,6,7,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Yet, when the number of assets is large, there are some general characteristics of optimal portfolios that hold 'almost surely'. This paper investigates these characteristics. We analytically show that the proportion of assets held short converges to 50% as the number of assets grows. This is a fundamental and robust property of mean-variance optimal portfolios, and it does not depend on the parameter estimation method, the investment horizon, or on a special covariance structure. While it is known that optimal portfolios may all have positive weights in some special situations (e.g. uncorrelated assets), the analysis shows that these cases occupy a zero measure in the parameter space, and therefore should not be expected to be observed empirically. Thus, our analysis offers a general explanation for the empirical finding of many short positions in optimal portfolios.","[Levy, Moshe] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Sch Business Adm, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Ritov, Ya'acov] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Stat, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Levy, M (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåHebrew Univ Jerusalem, Sch Business Adm, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",mslm@mscc.huji.ac.il,"Ritov, Yaacov/JPX-2841-2023",,Zagagi Fund,Zagagi Fund,We are grateful to the editors and two anonymous referees for their helpful comments and suggestions.

However, the wide range of unquantifiable factors which increase the uncertainty should be considered when using any method to estimate the amount of outstanding claims based on past data. Unlike traditional methods in claims analysis, fuzzy set approaches can tolerate imprecision and uncertainty without loss of performance and effectiveness. In this paper, hybrid fuzzy least-squares regression, which is proposed by Chang (2001), is used to predict future claim costs by utilizing the concept of a geometric separation method. We use probabilistic confidence limits for designing triangular fuzzy numbers. Thus, it allows us to reflect variability measures contained in a data set in the prediction of future claim costs. We also propose weighted functions of fuzzy numbers as a defuzzification procedure in order to transform estimated fuzzy claim costs into a crisp real equivalent. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We consider risk minimization with the risk function being the predictive classification error. We study the convergence rates of empirical risk minimization in both the frequentist and Bayesian approaches. The Bayesian treatment uses a Gibbs posterior constructed directly from the empirical risk instead of using the usual likelihood-based posterior. Therefore these approaches do not require a correctly specified probability model. We show that the proposed methods have near optimal performance relative to a class of linear classification rules with selected variables.

It is demonstrated that this problem can be solved, combining specific risk and performance measures, under some relatively general assumptions for the risk model, under which the premium income is modelled by any non-negative, non-decreasing function, claim arrivals follow a Poisson process and claim amounts are modelled by any continuous joint distribution. As a performance measure, we define the expected profits at time x of the direct insurer and the reinsurer, given their joint survival up to x, and derive explicit expressions for their numerical evaluation. The probability of joint survival of the direct insurer and the reinsurer up to the finite time horizon x is employed as a risk measure. An efficient frontier type approach to setting the limiting and the retention levels, based on the probability of joint survival considered as a risk measure and on the expected profit given joint survival, considered as a performance measure is introduced. Several optimality problems are defined and their solutions are illustrated numerically on several examples of appropriate claim amount distributions, both for the case of dependent and independent claim severities.

The bootstrap test offers significant improvements in terms of size properties over the asymptotic test, while having similar power properties.

To put this discussion into its proper context, we give a synopsis of the financial crisis and a brief introduction to some of the common credit derivatives and highlight the difficulties in valuing some of them.

We compare two plans that differ in terms of how pension rights are accrued. In one plan, the participant accrues the right to receive a single life annuity, and can exchange that annuity for an actuarially equivalent joint and survivor annuity at retirement date. The opposite holds in the other plan. We show that both plans are affected by longevity risk in two ways. First, the participants' choices at retirement age affect the ratio of survivor benefits over single life benefits, and, therefore, affect the natural hedge potential that arises from combining single life and survivor annuities. Second, uncertainty in the rate at which the participant will be allowed to exchange one type of annuity for the other at retirement date induces uncertainty in the level of the nominal rights for single life and Survivor annuities, respectively.

We build on the resilience model proposed by Obizhaeva and Wang (2005) but allow for a general shape of the LOB defined via a given density function. Thus, we can allow for empirically observed LOB shapes and obtain a nonlinear price impact of market orders. We distinguish two possibilities for modelling the resilience of the LOB after a large market order: the exponential recovery of the number of limit orders, i.e. of the volume of the LOB, or the exponential recovery of the bid-ask spread. We consider both of these resilience modes and, in each case, derive explicit optimal execution strategies in discrete time. Applying our results to a block-shaped LOB, we obtain a new closed-form representation for the optimal strategy of a risk-neutral investor, which explicitly solves the recursive scheme given in Obizhaeva and Wang (2005).

Literature available to date has shown that timely selection of the most appropriate antibacterial may reduce mortality. One tool that may help with this selection is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that distinguishes methicillin (meticillin)-resistant S. aureus (M RSA) from methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) in less than 1 hour. To date, no information is available evaluating the impact of this PCR technique on clinical or economic outcomes. Objective: To evaluate the effect of a rapid PCR assay on mortality and economics compared with traditional empiric therapy, using a literature-derived model. Methods: A literature search for peer-reviewed European (EU) and US publications regarding treatment regimens, outcomes and costs was conducted. Information detailing the rates of infection, as well as the specificity and sensitivity of a rapid PCR assay (Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture PCR (TM)) were obtained from the peer-reviewed literature. Sensitivity analysis varied the prevalence rate of M RSA from 5% to 80%, while threshold analysis was applied to the cost of the PCR test. Hospital and testing resource consumption were valued with direct medical costs, adjusted to year 2009 values. Adjusted life-years were determined using US and WHO life tables. The cost-effectiveness ratio was defined as the cost per life-year saved. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated to determine the additional cost necessary to produce additional effectiveness. All analyses were performed using TreeAge Software (2008). Results: The mean mortality rates were 23% for patients receiving empiric vancomycin subsequently switched to semi-synthetic penicillin (SSP) for MSSA, 36% for patients receiving empiric vancomycin treatment for M RSA, 59% for patients receiving empiric SSP subsequently switched to vancomycin for MRSA and 12% for patients receiving empiric SSP for MSSA. Furthermore, with an MRSA prevalence of 30%, the numbers of patients needed to test in order to save one life were 14 and 16 compared with empiric vancomycin and SSP, respectively. The absolute mortality difference for MRSA prevalence rates of 80% and 5% favoured the PCR testing group at 2% and 10%, respectively, compared with empiric vancomycin and 18% and 1%, respectively, compared with empiric SSP. In the EU, the cost-effectiveness ratios for empiric vancomycin- and SSP-treated patients were is an element of 695 and is an element of 687 per life-year saved, respectively, compared with is an element of 636 per life-year saved for rapid PC R testing. In the US, the cost-effectiveness ratio was $US898 per life-year saved for empiric vancomycin and $US820 per life-year saved for rapid PCR testing. ICERs demonstrated dominance of the PCR test in all instances. Threshold analysis revealed that PCR testing would be less costly overall, even at greatly inflated assay prices. Conclusion: Rapid PCR testing for M RSA appears to have the potential to reduce mortality rates while being less costly than empiric therapy in the EU and US, across a wide range of MRSA prevalence rates and PCR test costs.","[Brown, Jack; Paladino, Joseph A.] SUNY Buffalo, Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Brown, Jack] SUNY Buffalo, Sch Publ Hlth, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Brown, Jack] Univ Rochester, Med Ctr, Dept Pharm, Rochester, NY 14642 USA; [Paladino, Joseph A.] CPL Associates LLC, Amherst, NY USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; University of Rochester,"Brown, J (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåSUNY Buffalo, Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, 223 Cooke Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",JB322@Buffalo.edu,,,"Cepheid, Inc., Sunnyvale (CA), USA","Cepheid, Inc., Sunnyvale (CA), USA","This analysis was funded in part by an unrestricted grant from Cepheid, Inc., Sunnyvale (CA), USA.",,19,55,58,1,5,ADIS INT LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 1311, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2010,28.0,7,,,,,567,575,,10.2165/11533020-000000000-00000,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,626SL,20550222.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000279987100004,0

It has been shown to improve on the GMM estimator in the first differenced model in terms of bias and root mean squared error. However, we show in this paper that in the covariance stationary panel data AR(1) model the expected values of the concentration parameters in the differenced and levels equations for the cross-section at time t are the same when the variances of the individual heterogeneity and idiosyncratic errors are the same. This indicates a weak instrument problem also for the equation in levels. We show that the 2SLS biases relative to that of the OLS biases are then similar for the equations in differences and levels, as are the size distortions of the Wald tests. These results are shown to extend to the panel data GMM estimators.","[Bun, Maurice J.

This paper explores the effects that model specification has on our ability to do that. Asymptotic power, a natural choice to quantify these effects, does not accurately predict finite-sample power. Instead, here the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the unit root null and any alternative is used and its numeric and analytic properties detailed. Numerically it behaves in a similar way to finite-sample power. However, because it is analytically available we are able to prove that it is a minimizable function of the degree of trending in any included deterministic component and of the correlation of the underlying innovations. It is explicitly confirmed, therefore, that it is approximately linear trends and negative unit root moving average innovations that minimize the efficacy of unit root inferential tools. Applied to the Nelson and Plosser macroeconomic series the effect that different types of trends included in the model have on unit root inference is clearly revealed.","Univ York, Dept Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Marsh, P (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv York, Dept Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",pwnm1@york.ac.uk,,"Marsh, Patrick/0000-0002-6322-4736",,,,,24,5,5,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

We analyze the equilibrium behavior of a game in which committee members (the players) interview candidates sequentially, either hiring or going on to the next one. The players have differing evaluations of candidates (e.g. one cares about typing skills; the other about IT skills), which become their utilities if the candidate is hired. We then consider the optimal design (rules of the game) of such a committee, from the point of view of the firm. That is, which rules hire candidates which maximize the firm's utility. Our committee game has a first round in which the members sequentially, by order of player number, say 'yea' or 'nea' to the candidate. If there are sufficient 'yeas' then she is tentatively hired; otherwise she is rejected. In the former case, members who said nea can veto the candidate in the second round. Thus the candidate is either hired, rejected, or vetoed. In the last case, the member casting a veto has one less to use on later candidates. We analyze equilibria where a player may say 'yea' to a candidate he would prefer not to hire, in order to force the other player to use up a valuable veto. We show that for the uniform candidate distribution there is a unique equilibrium and better candidates for the firm are hired when there are more vetoes. However we exhibit a candidate distribution where increasing the numbers of vetoes results in hiring worse candidates.","[Alpern, Steve] London Sch Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Alpern, Steve] Visiting Tech Univ, Delft, Netherlands; [Gal, Shmuel] Univ Haifa, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Haifa,"Alpern, S (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåLondon Sch Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England.",s.alpern@lse.ac.uk; sgal@univ.haifa.ac.il,,,NATO collaborative research [CLG 983583],NATO collaborative research(NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation)),Both authors are supported by NATO collaborative research grant CLG 983583.,,15,7,10,0,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

The protection is typically provided by a guaranty fund. In the case of continuous monitoring, i.e., where the market values of the company's assets and liabilities are continuously observable, and where the market values of assets and liabilities follow continuous processes, regulators can liquidate the insurance company at the instant the market value of its assets equals the market value of its liabilities, implying that the credit protection is worthless. When jumps are included in the claims process, the protection provided by the guaranty fund has a strictly positive market value. The ability to continuously monitor asset prices with continuous sample paths eliminates economic losses from default. Our analysis suggests that economic losses from default stem from jumps in continuously observed asset prices and/or that asset prices are not continuously observed.","[Lindset, Snorre] Trondheim Business Sch, HIST Avdeling TOH, N-7004 Trondheim, Norway; [Persson, Svein-Arne] Norwegian Sch Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance & Management Sci, N-5045 Bergen, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Lindset, S (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåTrondheim Business Sch, HIST Avdeling TOH, N-7004 Trondheim, Norway.",snorre.lindset@hist.no; svein-arne.persson@nhh.no,,,,,,,11,2,2,0,6,PEETERS,LEUVEN,"BONDGENOTENLAAN 153, B-3000 LEUVEN, BELGIUM",0515-0361,,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,NOV,2009,39.0,2,,,,,577,589,,10.2143/AST.39.2.2044649,0.0,,,13,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,531DA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000272641700010,0

The motivation for this paper was the study of a multi-currency setting where it is natural to use simultaneously a domestic and a foreign asset as investment vehicles to inject the capital necessary to make an unacceptable position acceptable.

In this paper, we study such risk measures on Orlicz hearts. This includes coherent, convex, and monetary risk measures on L-p-spaces for 1 <= p < infinity and covers a wide range of interesting examples. Moreover, it allows for an elegant duality theory. We prove that every coherent or convex monetary risk measure on an Orlicz heart which is real-valued on a set with non-empty algebraic interior is real-valued on the whole space and admits a robust representation as maximal penalized expectation with respect to different probability measures. We also show that penalty functions of such risk measures have to satisfy a certain growth condition and that our risk measures are Luxemburg-norm Lipschitz-continuous in the coherent case and locally Luxemburg-norm Lipschitz-continuous in the convex monetary case. In the second part of the paper we investigate cash-additive hulls of transformed Luxemburg-norms and expected transformed losses. They provide two general classes of coherent and convex monetary risk measures that include many of the currently known examples as special cases.

However, the practical application of CEA in the regulatory process is often limited by some critical barriers, and decisions in clinical practice are frequently influenced by factors that do not contribute to efficient resource allocation, leading to inappropriate drug prescription and utilization. Moreover, most of the time there is uncertainty about the real cost-effectiveness profile of an innovative intervention, with the consequence that it is usually impossible to obtain an immediate and perfect substitution of a product with another having a better cost-effectiveness ratio. The objective of this article is to propose a rational approach to CEA within regulatory processes, basing our analysis in a Bayesian decision-theoretic framework and proposing an extension of the application of well known tools (such as the expected value of information) to such cases. The regulator can use these tools to identify the economic value of reducing the uncertainty surrounding the cost-effectiveness profile of the several alternatives. This value can be compared with the one that is generated by the actual market share of the different treatment options: one that is the most cost effective and others in the same therapeutic category that, despite producing clinical benefits, are less cost effective.","[Baio, Gianluca] Univ Milano Bicocca, Biostat Unit, Dept Stat, I-820126 Milan, Italy; [Baio, Gianluca] UCL, London, England; [Russo, Pierluigi] Agenzia Italiana Farmaco, Rome, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca; University of London; University College London; Italian Medicines Agency - AIFA,"Baio, G (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Milano Bicocca, Biostat Unit, Dept Stat, Via Bicocca Arcimboldi, I-820126 Milan, Italy.",gianluca@statistica.it,"Baio, Gianluca/A-2947-2012; Embrett, Mark G./H-4466-2014","Embrett, Mark G./0000-0002-3969-0219; Baio, Gianluca/0000-0003-4314-2570; Russo, Pierluigi/0000-0003-4881-5703",,,,,32,8,9,0,4,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2009,27.0,8,,,,,645,655,,10.2165/11310250-000000000-00000,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,506YV,19712008.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000270815800004,0

However, until very recently, comparisons between these two drugs have been difficult due to lack of direct comparative clinical evidence and differences in trial patient populations. Objective: To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing docetaxel with paclitaxel regimens in the treatment of MBC previously treated with an anthracycline from the perspective of the UK NHS. Methods: A cost-utility analysis was performed using a Markov model to compare taxanes in MBC patients who had progressed after treatment with an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen: docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) 1-hour intravenous (IV) infusion every 21 days versus paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) 3-hour IV infusion every 21 days (Pac3w). In parallel, additional analyses were performed versus paclitaxel administered in 1-weekly cycles (Pac1w), and a nano albumin-bound form of paclitaxel (Nab-P) given every 3 weeks. Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and adverse events used in the model were derived from a randomized trial directly comparing docetaxel with Pac3w; the comparisons of docetaxel versus the other two paclitaxel regimens were indirect, using patient-level data from a trial comparing Pac3w with Pac1w, and from the published literature comparing Pac3w with Nab-P. Utility values for response, progression and adverse events were derived from the literature. Direct treatment costs related to progression, best supportive care and adverse events were estimated using clinical trials data, published literature, NHS reference costs and published drug prices. The estimated costs of growth colony-stimulating factors and blood transfusion were also included in the model. The model was used to predict the expected total costs ( pound, year 2005-6 values), QALYs gained, incremental cost/life-year gained (LY) and cost/QALY over a 10-year time period. Results: In the base-case analysis, docetaxel improved QALYs by 0.33, 0.29 and 0.22 compared with Pac3w, Paclw and Nab-P, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for docetaxel were 12032 pound/QALY versus Pac3w, 4583 pound/QALY versus Paclw and 14694 pound/QALY versus Nab-P. The ICER was sensitive to the hazard ratios for PFS and OS between the comparators, the drug cost of initial treatment and the treatment costs after progression. Taking into account parameter uncertainty, and comparing all four treatments simultaneously, at a willingness to pay of 20 pound 000 per QALY gained, the probability of docetaxel being the most cost-effective treatment was around 70%. Conclusion: In the base-case scenario, docetaxel compared with Pac3w is estimated to have a cost-effectiveness ratio that falls within the acceptable threshold in the UK. The study also suggests that docetaxel may be cost effective versus Pac1w and Nab-P, although there is more uncertainty around these findings.","[Benedict, Agnes] United BioScurce Corp, London, England; [Cameron, David A.] Univ Leeds, Dept Med Oncol, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Corson, Helene] Sanofi Aventis Res & Dev, Paris, France; [Jones, Stephen E.] US Oncol Res, Houston, TX USA",United Biosource Corporation; University of Leeds; Sanofi-Aventis; Sanofi France; US Oncology Network,"Benedict, A (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)Ôºå20 Bloomsbury Sq, London WC1A 2NS, England.",agnes.benedict@unitedbiosource.com,"Cameron, David A/C-7781-2013","Cameron, David A/0000-0002-2717-7979",Sanofi-Aventis,Sanofi-Aventis(Sanofi-Aventis),"Agnes Benedict is an employee of United BioSource Corporation, which received research funding and a consulting fee from Sanofi-Aventis.

Although a firm's entrepreneurial processes may facilitate the pursuit of new entry opportunities that enhance its performance, adopting a strong entrepreneurial orientation is increasingly considered necessary but insufficient for wealth creation by new ventures. A better understanding of the conditions under which an entrepreneurial orientation enhances firm performance benefits he implementation of EO. Thus, this paper examines the impact of EO on new firm performance and the moderating effect of dynamic environment on the relationship between them. The empirical results from a sample of 384 new firms in China reveal several important findings. Innovative and proactive firm behaviors were positively associated with firm performance, while risk-taking displayed a U-shaped curvilinear relationship with performance under the background of Chinese culture. Furthermore, the results indicate that dynamic environment moderate the relationship between three sub-dimension of EO and new firm performance.","[Cai Li; Zhu Xiumei; Yu Xiaoyu; Yang Yang] Jilin Univ, Dept Management Sch, Changchun 130025, Peoples R China",Jilin University,,zhuxiumei@email.jlu.edu.cn,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,11,UNIVERSE ACADEMIC PRESS TORONTO,TORONTO,"1 SPADINA CRESCENT, ROOM 205, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 3G3, CANADA",,,978-1-926642-01-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,1069,1076,,,,,,8,"Business; Economics; Management; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BLY20,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271409600182,0

By these two methods, this paper has put forward the evolutionary model of our national corporate competitiveness at different stage of life cycle, which is of significant referential importance of the establishment of corporate competitive strategy.","[Cao Yu; Chen Xiao-hong; Ma Yue-ru] Cent S Univ, Sch Business, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China",Central South University,,xiaoyu198549@126.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,2,UNIVERSE ACADEMIC PRESS TORONTO,TORONTO,"1 SPADINA CRESCENT, ROOM 205, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 3G3, CANADA",,,978-1-926642-01-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,1006,1016,,,,,,11,"Business; Economics; Management; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BLY20,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271409600171,0

In recent years, the Weibull and generalized beta distributions have been used to fit the risk-neutral density from option prices. In this article, we also propose the use of the generalized gamma distribution for recovering the risk-neutral density. In terms of complexity, this distribution, having three parameters, falls between the Weibull and generalized beta distributions. New option pricing formulas for European call and put options are derived under the generalized gamma distribution. The empirical evidence based on a set of interest rate derivatives data indicates that this distribution is capable of producing the same type of performance as the Weibull, generalized beta, and Burr3 distributions.

Studies of resource use and costs associated with primary open-angle glaucoma have used varying methodologies. Most have focused on consumption of healthcare resources at various stages of disease to anticipate costs. The direct costs associated with the disease often continue to increase as glaucoma progresses from the earliest to most advanced stages. Determinations of the costs associated with glaucoma progression and prevention should also incorporate the chance of patient non-compliance with treatment. Since glaucoma severity most often correlates with increased costs, minimizing or halting visual field loss and increasing patient treatment compliance may all contribute to a reduction in the overall economic burden of glaucoma.","[Fiscella, Richard G.] Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Lee, Jeff; Davis, Elizabeth J.

A common approach to elicit utility scores is the use of the time trade-off (TTO) method; however, the data on TTO utility scores in patients with mental disorders are scarce. Objective: To analyse the TTO method in patients with mental disorders in terms of discriminative ability, validity and the refusal to trade life time (zero trade). Methods: In patients with affective (n=172), schizophrenia spectrum (n=166) and alcohol-related (n=160) mental disorders, TTO utilities were administered through a standardized interview. Measures of quality of life (QOL) [EQ-5D, WHOQOL-BREF], subjective (SCL-90R) and objective (CGI-S) psychopathology, and functioning (GAF, GARF, SOFAS, HoNOS) provided comparison. Discriminative ability was analysed by assessing frequency distributions of TTO utilities. Validity was analysed by assessing the correlation of TTO utilities with all other scores. The association of a patient's QOL, sociodemographic and disease-related variables with zero trade was analysed by logistic regression. Results: Of patients with affective/schizophrenic/alcohol-related mental disorders, 153/143/145 (89/86/91%), respectively, completed the TTO elicitation; 29/43/28% of the respondents were zero traders. The mean TTO utility was 0.66/0.75/0.61 and the median was 0.85/0.95/0.75. TTO utility scores discriminated well among more impaired mental health states, but discrimination was limited among less impaired health states. In patients with affective and alcohol-related mental disorders, TTO utility scores were significantly correlated (mostly moderate: 0.3<0.5) with all other scores. However, in schizophrenic patients, TTO utility scores were only a little correlated with other subjective measures and not correlated with objective measures. QOL was significantly associated with zero trade; the influence of the other variables on zero trade was negligible. Conclusions: TTO utility scores in patients with affective or alcohol-related mental disorders were reasonably valid, but discriminative ability was compromised by a ceiling effect due to zero trade. In schizophrenic patients, validity of TTO utility scores was not demonstrated.","[Koenig, Hans-Helmut; Guenther, Oliver H.; Roick, Christiane] Univ Leipzig, Hlth Econ Res Unit, Dept Psychiat, D-04317 Leipzig, Germany; [Angermeyer, Matthias C.] Ctr Publ Mental Hlth, Gosing Am Wagram, Austria",Leipzig University,"K√∂nig, HH (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Leipzig, Hlth Econ Res Unit, Dept Psychiat, Johannisallee 20, D-04317 Leipzig, Germany.",hans-helmut.koenig@medizin.uni-leipzig.de,"K√∂nig, Hans-Helmut/P-1211-2018",,,,,,56,18,19,0,8,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2009,27.0,5,,,,,405,419,,,,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,485ZC,19586078.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000269164000005,0

However, they are complex, have intensive data requirements and are often difficult for decision makers to understand. Recent developments in modelling software have made it possible to use discrete-event simulation (DES) to model outcomes in HIV. Using published results from 48-week trial data as model inputs, Markov model and DES modelling approaches were compared in terms of clinical outcomes at 5 years and lifetime cost-effectiveness estimates. Methods: A randomly selected cohort of 100 anti retroviral-naive patients with a mean baseline CD4+ T-cell count of 175cells/mm(3) treated with lopinavir/ritonavir was selected from Abbott study M97-720. Parameter estimates from this cohort were used to populate both a Markov and a DES model, and the long-term estimates for these cohorts were compared. The models were then modified using the relative risk of undetectable viral load as reported for atazanavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in the published BMS 008 study. This allowed us to compare the mean cost effectiveness of the models. The clinical outcomes included mean change in CD4+ T-cell count, and proportion Of Subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA (viral load [VL]) <50 copies/mL, VL 50-400 copies/mL and VL >400 copies/mL. US wholesale acquisition costs (year 2007 values) were used in the mean cost-effectiveness analysis, and the cost and QALY data were discounted at 3%. Results: The results show a slight predictive advantage of the DES model for clinical outcomes. The DES model could capture direct input of CD4+ T-cell count, and proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA VL <50 copies/mL, VL 50-400copies/mL and VL >400 copies/mL over a 48-week period, which the Markov model could not. The DES and Markov model estimates were similar to the actual clinical trial estimates for 1-year clinical results; however, the DES model predicted more detailed outcomes and had slightly better long-term (5-year) predictive validity than the Markov model. Similar cost estimates were derived from the Markov model and the DES. Both models predict cost savings at 5 and 10 years, and over a lifetime for the lopinavir/ritonavir treatment regimen as compared with an atazanavir regimen. Conclusion: The DES model predicts the course of a disease naturally, with few restrictions. This may give the model superior face validity with decision makers. Furthermore, this model automatically provides a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, which is cumbersome to perform with a Markov model. DES models allow inclusion of more variables without aggregation, which may improve model precision. The capacity of DES for additional data capture helps explain why this model consistently predicts better survival and thus greater savings than the Markov model. The DES model is better than the Markov model in isolating long-term implications of small but important differences in crucial input data.","[Simpson, Kit N.] Med Univ S Carolina, Coll Hlth Profess, Dept Hlth Policy & Adm, Charleston, SC 29425 USA; [Dietz, Birgitta] Abbott GmbH & Co KG, Ludwigshafen, Germany; [Rajagopalan, Rukmini] Abbott Labs, Abbott Pk, IL 60064 USA",Medical University of South Carolina; ABBOTT GMBH & CO.

Since exact methods for computing and maximizing the likelihood function are usually not feasible, approximate solutions, based on Monte Carlo or numerical methods, have to be considered. Here, we concentrate on a different approach based on a simple pseudolikelihood, called pairwise likelihood. Its merit is to reduce the computational burden so that it is possible to fit highly structured statistical models, even when the use of standard likelihood methods is not possible. We discuss pairwise likelihood inference for state space models, and we present some touchstone examples concerning autoregressive models with additive observation noise and switching regimes, the local level model and a non-Makovian generalization of the dynamic Tobit model.","[Varin, Cristiano] Ca Foscari Univ, Dept Stat, I-30121 Venice, Italy; [Vidoni, Paolo] Univ Udine, Dept Stat, I-33100 Udine, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; University of Udine,"Varin, C (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåCa Foscari Univ, Dept Stat, Cannaregio 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy.",sammy@unive.it,"VARIN, CRISTIANO/E-8269-2015; VARIN, CRISTIANO/Q-4484-2018","VARIN, CRISTIANO/0000-0002-5591-5705; Vidoni, Paolo/0000-0003-0063-011X",,,,,29,37,41,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

Examples include research-based or commission-based companies. In this context, Avanzi and Gerber (2008) showed how to determine the expected present value of dividends, if a barrier strategy is followed. In this paper, we further include capital injections and allow for (proportional) transaction costs both on dividends and capital injections. We determine the optimal dividend and (unconstrained) capital injection strategy (among all possible strategies) when jumps are hyperexponential. This strategy happens to be either a dividend barrier strategy without capital injections, or another dividend barrier strategy with forced injections when the surplus is null to prevent ruin. The latter is also shown to be the optimal dividend and capital injection strategy, if ruin is not allowed to occur. Both the choice to inject capital or not and the level of the optimal barrier depend on the parameters of the model. In all cases, we determine the optimal dividend barrier and show its existence and uniqueness. We also provide closed form representations of the value functions when the optimal strategy is applied.

The first one is classical, and serves to see how the indices behave with respect to the Shapley and Banzhaf values in the case of the EU parliament and in the UN Security Council. The second one is much more recent: it deals with the microarray games, introduced in Moretti et al. (TOP, 15: 256-280, 2007), which are average of unanimity games. The idea is to rank genes taken from DNA of patients affected by a specific disease, with the aim of singling out a group of genes potentially responsible of the disease.

This measure aims at covering the risk of the variation in the projection year as well as the risk of changes in the best estimate projection for future years. This paper addresses the issue how to determine this Value-at-Risk for longevity and mortality risk. Naturally, this requires stochastic mortality rates. In the past decennium, a vast literature on stochastic mortality models has been developed. However, very few of them are suitable for determining the one-year Value-at-Risk. This requires a model for mortality trends instead of mortality rates. Therefore, we will introduce a stochastic mortality trend model that fits this purpose. The model is transparent, easy to interpret and based on well known concepts in stochastic mortality modeling. Additionally, we introduce an approximation method based on duration and convexity concepts to apply the stochastic mortality rates to specific insurance portfolios. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The method consists of applying the standard moving blocks bootstrap of Kunsch (1989, Annals of Statistics 17, 1217-1241) and Liu and Singh (1992, in R. LePage & L. Billiard (eds.), Exploring the Limits of the Bootstrap) to the vector containing all the individual observations at each point in time. We show that this bootstrap is robust to serial and cross-sectional dependence of unknown form under the assumption that n (the cross-sectional dimension) is an arbitrary nondecreasing function of T (the time series dimension), where T -> infinity, thus allowing for the possibility that both n and T diverge to infinity. The time series dependence is assumed to be weak (of the mixing type), but we allow the cross-sectional dependence to be either strong or weak (including the case where it is absent). Under appropriate conditions, we show that the fixed effects estimator (and also its bootstrap analogue) has a convergence rate that depends on the degree of cross-section dependence in the panel. Despite this, the same studentized test statistics can be computed without reference to the degree of cross-section dependence. Our simulation results show that the moving blocks bootstrap percentile-t intervals have very good coverage properties even when the degree of serial and cross-sectional correlation is large, provided the block size is appropriately chosen.","[Goncalves, Silvia] Univ Montreal, CIREQ, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Goncalves, Silvia] Univ Montreal, CIRANO, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada",Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal,"Gon√ßalves, S (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Montreal, CIREQ, Dept Sci Econ, CP 6128,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.",silvia.goncalves@umontreal.ca,,,,,,,30,42,46,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

The traditional autoregression (AR) based unit root test (ADF test), used in testing co-integration, cannot give a sound explanation when a time series passes the ADF test. However, its largest root in the AR polynomial is extremely close to, but less than, one, which is most likely the result of a mixture of random-walk and mean-reverting processes in the time series data. With this background, we put an LMAR model into the co-integration framework to identify baskets that have a large spread but are still well co-integrated. A sufficient condition for the stationarity of the LMAR model is given and proved using a Markovian approach. A two-step estimating procedure, combining least-squares estimation and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, is given. The Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is used in model selection. The co-integrated LMAR model is applied to basket trading, which is a widely used tool for arbitrage. We use simulation to assess the model in basket trading strategies with the statistical arbitrage feature in equity markets. Data from several sectors of the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index are used in a simulation study on basket trading. Empirical results show that a portfolio using the co-integrated LMAR model has a higher return than portfolios selected by traditional methods. Although the volatility in the return increases, the Sharpe ratio also increases in most cases. This risk-return profile can be explained by the shorter converging period in the co-integrated LMAR model and the larger volatility in the 'mean-reverting' regime.","[Cheng, Xixin; Yu, Philip L.

MEDLINE, CINAHL, EconLit, AMED and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to March 2010 for English-language COI articles. Content analysis was used to extract common themes about dementia cost from the conclusions of articles that passed title, abstract and full-text screening. These themes informed our exploration of the policy-making relevance of COI studies in dementia. The literature search retrieved 961 articles and data were extracted from 46 articles. All except three articles reported data from the US; 27 articles included Alzheimer's dementia only. Common themes pertained to general observations about dementia cost, cost drivers in dementia, caregiver cost, items that may lower dementia cost, social service cost, Medicare and Medicaid cost, and cost comparisons with other diseases. The common themes suggest policy-oriented research for the future. However, the extracted COI studies were typically not conducted for policy-making purposes and they did not commonly provide prescriptive policy options. Researchers and policy makers need to consider whether the optimal research focus in dementia should be on programme evaluations instead of more COI studies.","[Oremus, Mark; Aguilar, S.

The monovalent rotavirus vaccine RIX4414 (Rotarix (TM)) is administered as a two-dose oral series in infants and has demonstrated protective efficacy against RVGE in clinical trials conducted in developed countries. In addition, various naturalistic studies have demonstrated 'real-world' effectiveness after the introduction of widespread rotavirus vaccination programmes in the community setting. Numerous cost-effectiveness analyses have been conducted in developed countries in which a universal rotavirus vaccination programme using RIX4414 was compared with no universal rotavirus vaccination programme. There was a high degree of variability in base-case results across studies even when conducted in the same country, often reflecting differences in the selection of data sources or assumptions used to populate the models. In addition, results were sensitive to plausible changes in a number of key input parameters. As such, it is not possible to definitively state whether a universal rotavirus vaccination programme with RIX4414 is cost effective in developed countries, although results of some analyses in some countries suggest this is the case. In addition, international guidelines advocate universal vaccination of infants and children against rotavirus. It is also difficult to draw conclusions regarding the cost effectiveness of rotavirus vaccine RIX4414 relative to that of the pentavalent rotavirus vaccine, which is administered as a three-dose oral series. Although indirect comparisons in cost-effectiveness analyses indicate that RIX4414 provided more favourable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios when each vaccine was compared with no universal rotavirus vaccination programme, results were generally sensitive to vaccine costs. Actual tender prices of a full vaccination course for each vaccine were not known at the time of the analyses and therefore had to be estimated.","Adis, Auckland 0754, New Zealand",Adis International,"Plosker, GL (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåAdis, 41 Centorian Dr,Private Bag 65901, Auckland 0754, New Zealand.",demail@adis.co.nz,,,,,,,78,14,16,0,6,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2011,29.0,5,,,,,439,454,,10.2165/11207130-000000000-00000,0.0,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,763KQ,21504245.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000290555600011,0

The University of Aberdeen Health Technology Assessment Group were commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG); the role of the ERG being to appraise the manufacturer's submission and to produce an independent report. This article provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and NICE's subsequent decisions. The manufacturer considered that denosumab would be appropriate for patients unable to take, comply with or tolerate oral bisphosphonates. Comparator treatments selected for the submission were, therefore, 'no treatment', raloxifene, strontium ranelate, intravenous zoledronic acid, intravenous ibandronate and teriparatide. The main effectiveness evidence for denosumab was derived from a large randomized controlled trial comparing denosumab with placebo. Given by subcutaneous injection at 6-monthly intervals for 3 years, denosumab reduced the incidence of hip fracture by 40%, and reduced the incidence of clinical vertebral fracture by 69%. An indirect treatment comparison was used to derive adjusted relative risk (RR) estimates for different types of fracture for each comparator versus placebo. The RRs (95% CI) applied for denosumab were 0.316 (0.208, 0.478) for clinical vertebral fracture, 0.605 (0.373, 0.983) for hip fracture and 0.842 (0.638, 1.110) for wrist fracture. Despite a number of concerns surrounding the methodology of the indirect comparison, the ERG was satisfied with the robustness of the effect estimates. The RR estimates were applied in a good-quality Markov model that took account of drug costs, administration and monitoring costs, costs associated with fractures, and long-term nursing home costs. Utility weights were used to adjust time spent in fracture states, allowing QALYs to be estimated. The base-case analysis was conducted for women aged 70 years with a T-score of -2.5 or less and no prior fracture, and women aged 70 years with a T-score of -2.5 or less with a prior fragility fracture. Subgroup analyses based on T-score and independent clinical risk factors were also undertaken. Applying a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 30 000 per QALY, the manufacturer's results suggested that denosumab would offer a cost-effective alternative to all treatment comparators for the primary and secondary prevention of fractures. The ERG was concerned about an assumption that denosumab would be administered in general practice at the average cost of two standard GP visits a year. As a result, the ERG requested some further sensitivity analysis and undertook some further modelling, applying an assumption that denosumab would be provided primarily in secondary care. This modification altered the cost effectiveness of denosumab versus 'no treatment' (in women with no prior fragility fracture) and zoledronic acid. The NICE Appraisal Committee concluded that, as a treatment option for the prevention of osteoporotic fractures, denosumab should be recommended only in post-menopausal women at increased risk of fracture who cannot comply with the special instructions for administering oral bisphosphonates, or have an intolerance of, or contraindication to, those treatments. For primary prevention, the Appraisal Committee also stipulated specific levels of fracture risk at which denosumab is recommended.","[Scotland, Graham; McNamee, Paul] Univ Aberdeen, Hlth Econ Res Unit, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland; [Waugh, Norman; Royle, Pamela] Univ Aberdeen, Dept Publ Hlth, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland; [Henderson, Rob] NHS Highland, Publ Hlth Med, Inverness, Scotland; [Hollick, Rosemary] Aberdeen Royal Infirm, Dept Rheumatol, Aberdeen, Scotland",University of Aberdeen; University of Aberdeen; University of Aberdeen,"Scotland, G (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Aberdeen, Hlth Econ Res Unit, Polwarth Bldg, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland.",g.scotland@abdn.ac.uk,,"Hollick, Rosemary/0000-0001-6558-7189; McNamee, Paul/0000-0002-4540-8718","National Institute for Health [08/231]; Chief Scientist Office [HERU1, HERU2] Funding Source: researchfish",National Institute for Health; Chief Scientist Office(Chief Scientist Office - Scotland),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 08/231).

Our main objective is to Find the optimal policy to minimize its probability of ruin. The main novelty of this paper is the introduction of a dynamic Value-at-Risk (VaR) constraint. This provides a way to control risk and to fulfill the requirement of regulators on market risk. This problem is formulated as an infinite horizontal stochastic control problem with a constrained control space. The dynamic programming technique is applied to derive the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation and the Lagrange multiplier method is used to tackle the dynamic VaR constraint. Closed-form expressions for the minimal ruin probability as well as the optimal investment-reinsurance/new business policy are derived. It turns out that the risk exposure of the insurance company subject to the dynamic VaR constraint is always lower than otherwise. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate our results.

However, there remain many ways to use the defactored residuals to construct a test. In this paper, we use the panel analysis of nonstationarity in idiosyncratic and common components (PANIC) residuals to form two new tests. One estimates the pooled autoregressive coefficient, and one simply uses a sample moment. We establish their large-sample properties using a joint limit theory. We find that when the pooled autoregressive root is estimated using data detrended by least squares, the tests have no power. This result holds regardless of how the data are defactored. All PANIC-based pooled tests have nontrivial power because of the way the linear trend is removed.","[Bai, Jushan] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Bai, JS (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåColumbia Univ, Dept Econ, 1022 IAB,420 W 118th St, New York, NY 10027 USA.",jushan.bai@columbia.edu,"Ng, Serena/AAA-1003-2020","Ng, Serena/0000-0003-2684-364X",,,,,28,106,113,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

Since contemplation is costly, our key axiom, aversion to contingent planning, reflects the individual's preference to learn the menu from which she will be choosing prior to engaging in contemplation about her tastes for the alternatives. Our representation models contemplation strategies as subjective signals over a subjective state space. The subjectivity of the state space and the information structure in our representation makes it difficult to identify them from the preference. To overcome this issue, we show that each signal can be modeled in reduced form as a measure over ex post utility functions without reference to a state space. We show that in this reduced-form representation, the set of measures and their costs are uniquely identified.

We prove that any Equal Income Walrasian allocation for the true preferences can be supported as an equilibrium allocation of any direct revelation game associated with subsolutions of the No-Envy solution, but also non-efficient allocations can be supported.","[Bevia, Carmen] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ & Hist Econ, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Bevia, Carmen] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, CODE, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Bevi√°, C (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ & Hist Econ, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",carmen.bevia@uab.es,"Bevia, Carmen/I-7938-2018","Bevia, Carmen/0000-0002-1877-7921",Barcelona GSE; Generalitat of Catalunya; Acciones Complementarias [SEJ2006-27589-E]; FEDER; Consolidated Group-C [ECO2008-04756]; [2005SGR-00454],Barcelona GSE; Generalitat of Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); Acciones Complementarias; FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); Consolidated Group-C;,"I thank Luis Corchon, Bernardo Moreno and the two anonymous referees for their very helpful comments.

By appropriately relaxing the assumptions of individual rationality and anonymity we provide a complete characterization of the family of quota rules with (possibly) unequal pricing. We prove that these quota rules are the only cost sharing rules satisfying four conditions: strategy-proofness, non-bossiness, weak continuity and weak anonymity. In addition, the specification of the degree to which individual rationality may be violated results in the selection of a specific quota for the referendum. While all these rules are almost always efficient when providing the public good and they are also almost everywhere coalitionally strategy-proof, only one family of rules from this class satisfies these two properties everywhere. The rules satisfying these two properties are Moulin's Conservative Equal Costs Rule and unequal cost sharing variants of Moulin's rule.","[Deb, Rajat; Seo, Tae Kun] So Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA",Southern Methodist University,"Deb, R (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåSo Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA.",rdeb@mail.smu.edu; tseo@mail.smu.edu,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

There are two aspects of value creation: the match value when two agents actually trade and the probability of trading governed by the search technology. We show that positive assortative matching obtains when complementarities in the former outweigh complementarities in the latter. This happens if and only if the match-value function is root-supermodular, that is, its nth root is supermodular, where n reflects the elasticity of substitution of the search technology. This condition is weaker than the condition required for positive assortative matching in markets with random search.","[Eeckhout, Jan; Kircher, Philipp] Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19140 USA; [Eeckhout, Jan] UPF Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Kircher, Philipp] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England",University of Pennsylvania; Pompeu Fabra University; University of Oxford,"Eeckhout, J (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Penn, Dept Econ, 3718 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19140 USA.",eeckhout@ssc.upenn.edu; kircher@econ.upenn.edu,"Eeckhout, Jan/A-3981-2008","Eeckhout, Jan/0000-0001-6509-4296","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0752076] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,33,70,90,1,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAR,2010,78.0,2,,,,,539,574,,10.3982/ECTA7953,0.0,,,36,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,581GB,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000276508500003,0

A symmetrically multilateral-bargained (SMB) allocation is a core allocation such that any agent's payoff remains invariant after a negotiation process between all agents based on what they could receive-and use as a threat-in their preferred alternative matching to any given optimal matching. We prove that, for balanced multi-sided assignment games, the set of SMB is always nonempty and that, unlike the two-sided case, it does not coincide in general with the kernel (Davis and Maschler, Naval Res Logist Q 12:223-259, 1965).
