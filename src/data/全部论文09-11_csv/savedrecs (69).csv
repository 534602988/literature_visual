Our results concern both exact and virtual mixed implementation. For exact implementation, we identify a strengthening of Bayesian monotonicity, which we refer to as mixed Bayesian monotonicity. It is shown that, in economic environments with at least three agents, mixed Bayesian implementation is equivalent to mixed Bayesian monotonicity, incentive compatibility and closure. For implementing a social choice function, the case of two-agents is also covered by these conditions and mixed Bayesian monotonicity reduces to Bayesian monotonicity. Following parallel steps, mixed virtual implementation is shown to be equivalent to mixed virtual monotonicity, incentive compatibility and closure. The key condition, mixed virtual monotonicity, is argued to be very weak. In particular, it is weaker than Abreu-Matsushima's measurability, thereby implying that: (1) virtual implementation in mixed Bayesian equilibrium is more permissive than virtual implementation in iteratively undominated strategies, and (2) non-regular mechanisms are essential for the implementation of rules in that gap.

This has led to calls for these behaviors to be defined and measured separately to characterize medication-taking behavior comprehensively. Current prescription refill models of compliance are, however, unable to appropriately distinguish between noncompliant and nonpersistent behaviors. To address this limitation, a prescription refill model of medication-taking behavior in which noncompliance and nonpersistence are treated as competing risks is presented. Methods: The proposed competing risks model of compliance and persistence is compared with a selection of widely applied prescription refill models of compliance and persistence using a common cohort of patients prescribed statin therapy. Results: The competing risks model allows the simultaneous measurement of noncompliance and nonpersistence, the partitioning of their individual contributions to medication-taking behavior, and the estimation of noncompliance risk for patients with varying treatment persistence. The results from this model provide information about the relative and overall contributions of noncompliant and nonpersistent behaviors to medication-taking behavior. The methodology also allows an assessment of the differential influence of various risk factors on these behaviors. Conclusions: The proposed competing risks model differentiates between noncompliant and nonpersistent behaviors using prescription refill data. Results from the model provide insights into the dynamics of noncompliant and nonpersistent behaviors that have not been possible with current prescription refill methodologies.","[Barron, T.

We replicate a frequently cited paper by Lichtenberg on drug offsets and find the results disappear using a more appropriate model or updated dataset. Further, we test the suitability of similar methods using newer hypertension drugs. We find our observational results run counter to well-established clinical evidence on comparative efficacy and conclude that our model, as well as other studies that do not adequately control for unobserved characteristics that jointly determine drug choice and health expenditures, are likely subject to significant bias.

In this paper we show how using CEACs differs from maximizing expected net benefit (NB) and when it can lead to inconsistent decisions. In the case of comparing two alternatives we show the limits of the discrepancy between CEAC and expected NB approach and link it with expected value of perfect information. We also show how the shape of CEAC is influenced by the skewness of estimate of expected NB distribution, the correlation between cost and effect estimates and their variance. In the case of more than two options we show when using CEACs can lead to non-transitive choices in pair-wise comparisons and when it lacks independence of irrelevant alternatives property in joint comparisons.

Differences between National Pharmacoeconomic Guidelines,VALUE IN HEALTH,,,English,Article,,,,,,comparison; guidelines; lost productivity; transferability,FRICTION-COST METHOD; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; ECONOMIC-EVALUATION; HEALTH-CARE; RECOMMENDATIONS; PROGRAMS; WORK,"For at least two decades, there has been an intense debate on whether and how to include the value of lost productivity in economic evaluations. This debate is often reflected in pharmacoeconomic guidelines, which have been developed to indicate the methods and requirements for the design, execution, and reporting of economic evaluations in a particular country. Objective: To examine what various national pharmacoeconomic guidelines recommend regarding the identification, measurement, and valuation of lost productivity. Methods: First, the theoretical framework on how lost productivity can be identified, measured, and valued is described. Second, a summary sheet has been used to identify various pharmacoeconomic guidelines recommendations regarding the value of lost productivity. Results: Twenty-two of the 30 guidelines identified recommend performing economic evaluations using the societal perspective. Nevertheless, even if the societal perspective is recommended, it is not always clear how the value of lost productivity should be taken into account. Most guidelines recommend including the costs of absenteeism from paid and/or unpaid work. In addition, although no agreement exists on how lost productivity should be valued, none of the guidelines recommended using the US panel approach for the valuation of lost productivity. Discussion: The different recommendations hinder international transferability of the value of lost productivity. This difficulty is mainly caused by different recommendations regarding identification and valuation. These differences result from the debate and lack of consensus on including the value of lost productivity losses in economic evaluations. It will become easier to transfer data across jurisdictions if all data are reported transparently.","[Knies, Saskia] Maastricht Univ, Dept Hlth Org Policy & Econ, Sch Publ Hlth & Primary Care CAPHRI, Fac Hlth Med & Life Sci, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Severens, Johan L.] Maastricht Univ Med Ctr, Dept Clin Epidemiol & MTA KEMTA, Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University; Maastricht University; Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC),"Knies, S (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Dept Hlth Org Policy & Econ, Sch Publ Hlth & Primary Care CAPHRI, Fac Hlth Med & Life Sci, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",s.knies@beoz.unimaas.nl,"Evers, Silvia/ABG-2128-2020","Evers, Silvia/0000-0003-1026-570X",School for Public Health and Primary Care (CAPHRI); Netherlands School of Primary Care Research (CaRe); Royal Dutch Academy of Science (KNAW),School for Public Health and Primary Care (CAPHRI); Netherlands School of Primary Care Research (CaRe); Royal Dutch Academy of Science (KNAW),"Source of financial support: Financial support for this study was provided entirely by a grant from the School for Public Health and Primary Care (CAPHRI), which participates in The Netherlands School of Primary Care Research (CaRe), acknowledged by the Royal Dutch Academy of Science (KNAW).

Then Carmona proved that each finite game in an upper tail of such a sequence admits an approximate Nash equilibrium in pure strategies. Noguchi (2009) and Yannelis (2009) recently proved that a Nash equilibrium in pure strategies exists in a continuum game with asymmetric information in which players are endowed with private information, a prior probability and choose strategies that are compatible with their private information and maximize their interim expected payoffs. The aim of this paper is to extend Carmona's result to the broader context of Bayesian equilibria and demonstrate that the existence result obtained for continuum games with asymmetric information approximately holds for large but finite games belonging to an upper tail of a sequence of finite games with asymmetric information.

Using a state-level panel dataset spanning the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s, we find that tolerance is negatively associated with the HIV rate. We then investigate the causal mechanisms potentially underlying this relationship. We find evidence consistent with the theory that tolerance for homosexuals causes low-risk men to enter the pool of homosexual partners, as well as causes sexually active men to substitute away from underground, anonymous, and risky behaviors, both of which lower the HIV rate.

In 2008 however an important change occurred in the island's life: it was placed on the UNESCO World Heritage list. Now that the island is recognised both as a material heritage and as an immaterial heritage, the question rises how this will or can be used for fostering development. What are the changes that can be observed and put into connection with these recognitions? What is the potential economic impact? What are the inhabitants' perceptions? The paper addresses these and associated issues.","[Belyaev, D.] Lusophone Univ Human & Technol, Lisbon, Portugal",Lusofona University,,,,,,,,,13,2,2,0,2,GREEN LINES INST SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,BARCELOS,"AV ALCAIDES DE FARIA 377 S 12, BARCELOS, 00000, PORTUGAL",,,978-989-95671-3-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,19,27,,,,,,9,Cultural Studies; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Cultural Studies; Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BVJ43,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291664400003,0

At the same time, some researchers have also made the case that too simplistic a design might be counterproductive given that such designs may result in issues of omitting important decision variables. This paper aims to take another look at the effects of design complexity on model results. Specifically, we make use of an approach devised by Hensher (2004) 1 in which different respondents in the study are presented with designs of different complexity, and look specifically at effects on model scale in a UK context, adding to previous Chilean evidence by Caussade et al. (2005). The results of our study indicate that the impact of design complexity may be somewhat lower than anticipated, and that more complex designs may not necessarily lead to poorer results. In fact, some of the more complex designs lead to higher scale in the models. Overall, our findings suggest that respondents can cope adequately with large number of attributes, alternatives and choice sets. The implications for practical research are potentially significant, given the widespread use, especially in Europe, of stated choice designs with a limited number of alternatives and attributes.","[Chintakayala, Phani Kumar; Hess, Stephane] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Chintakayala, Phani Kumar] Accent Mkt & Res Ltd, Kingston, Jamaica; [Hess, Stephane] Inst Transport Studies, Econ & Behav Modelling, Davis, CA USA; [Hess, Stephane] European Transport Conf, Innovat Methods Transport Anal Planning & Apprais, Frankfurt, Germany; [Rose, John M.] Univ Sydney, Transport & Logist Management & Program, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Rose, John M.] Univ Sydney, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Wardman, Mark] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Transport Demand Anal, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Wardman, Mark] Inst Transport Studies, Frankfurt, Germany",University of Leeds; University of Sydney; University of Sydney; University of Leeds,"Chintakayala, PK (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",,"Rose, John/AAO-2897-2021; Hess, Stephane/AAX-2672-2020","Hess, Stephane/0000-0002-3650-2518; Rose, John/0000-0003-4211-0980",,,,,26,3,3,0,2,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84950-772-1,,,,2010,,,,,,,195,215,,,,,,21,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Psychology, Mathematical; Transportation",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Psychology; Transportation,BE0JU,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000366173200009,0

However, there is growing recognition of the need to understand the value of the existing building stock and its contribution to the broader dimensions of sustainable development. The concept of value lies at the very centre of cultural heritage conservation theory and practice in Australia. This paper focuses on built heritage, drawing on existing literature to examine the multivalent nature of heritage buildings. Although the values approach adopted in the Burra Charter is used as a starting point, this paper explores beyond the established socio-cultural and economic values to consider the value to environmental sustainability; the concept of heritage value is reinterpreted and extended to environmental performance. A review of empirical studies illustrates that methods such as LCA offer promising potential as an instrument for better understanding of the environmental impact and energy performance of heritage buildings, and can provide scientific evidence to substantiate credibility of claims of environmental sustainability. Most sustainability assessment tools do not take into consideration heritage values. Therefore, there is a need to develop new frameworks and practices that reconcile requirements to improve environmental performance of heritage buildings with heritage significance. This paper forms part of a research project to investigate how new expectations for energy performance and retention of cultural heritage significance can be achieved to meet society's aspirations.","[Judson, P.; Iyer-Raniga, U.] RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),,,,,,,,,64,0,0,0,7,GREEN LINES INST SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,BARCELOS,"AV ALCAIDES DE FARIA 377 S 12, BARCELOS, 00000, PORTUGAL",,,978-989-95671-3-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,535,545,,,,,,11,Cultural Studies; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Cultural Studies; Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BVJ43,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291664400060,0

It then considers the role of local community participation in achieving sustainability; since communities are predictably divided, in various respects, the central issue is equitable inclusion of all community interests. Thus all heritages need to be represented and none dissonantly marginalised, and all heritage interests should participate in associated tourism. The relationship of this principle to the tourist-historic city is considered, in the light of contemporary Western urban multicultural pluralism. Local sustainable development is argued to be promoted not only through inclusive heritage and its presentation to global tourism markets, but by the reciprocal influence of global tourism values upon local heritage presentation, resulting in a local-global 'creolisation' of heritage values. Global tourism can stimulate more comprehensive valuation of local communities' multiple heritages, as well as generating the resources to maintain their material basis, thus further promoting the sustainable development of the communities concerned. Some of the issues discussed are related to current situations in the Mediterranean basin, particularly those involving cultural tension; and the presentation will be concluded with regard to its regional relevance.","[Tunbridge, J.] Carleton Univ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",Carleton University,,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,6,GREEN LINES INST SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,BARCELOS,"AV ALCAIDES DE FARIA 377 S 12, BARCELOS, 00000, PORTUGAL",,,978-989-95671-3-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,325,331,,,,,,7,Cultural Studies; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Cultural Studies; Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BVJ43,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291664400036,0

The challenges of creating a translation for use in multiple countries are discussed, and the criteria for a global translation project explained. Based on a thorough translation and linguistic validation methodology including a concept elaboration, multiple forward translations, two back translations, reviews by in-country clinicians and the instrument developer, pilot testing in each target country and multiple sets of proofreading, the key concept of the global translation methodology is consistent international harmonization, achieved through the involvement of linguists from each target country at every stage of the process. This methodology enabled the successful resolution of the translation issues encountered, and resulted in consistent translations of the CLDQ-HCV that were linguistically and culturally appropriate for all target countries.","[Two, Rebecca; Verjee-Lorenz, Aneesa; Clayson, Darren] PharmaQuest Ltd, Jeffersons Business Ctr, Banbury OX16 9AA, Oxon, England; [Dalal, Mehul; Grotzinger, Kelly] GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA USA; [Younossi, Zobair M.] Inova Fairfax Hosp, Ctr Liver Dis, Falls Church, VA USA",GlaxoSmithKline; Inova Fairfax Hospital,"Verjee-Lorenz, A (通讯作者)，PharmaQuest Ltd, Jeffersons Business Ctr, 6 South Bar, Banbury OX16 9AA, Oxon, England.",aneesa.verjeelorenz@pharmaquest-ltd.com,"Younossi, Zobair M./JRY-9916-2023",,,,,,8,25,26,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2010,13.0,1,,,,,128,131,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00585.x,0.0,,,4,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,541PI,19695006.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273429000021,0

A particular issue is whether prisons should contract out for health care. Contracting out has been growing over the past few decades. The stilted motivation for this change ranges from a desire to improve the prison healthcare system, sometimes in response to a court mandate, to a desire to reduce costs. This study is a first attempt to quantify the impact of this change on inmate health. As morbidity measures are not readily obtainable, we focus on mortality. More specifically, we use a panel of state prisons from 1979 to 1990 and a fixed effects Poisson model to estimate the change in mortality associated with increase in the percentage of medical personnel employed under contract. In contrast to the first stilted aim of contracting, we find that a 13% increase in percentage of medical personnel employed under contract increases mortality by 1.3%.

Methods: Researchers were purposively selected from Thai academics and both public and private research organizations related to EE. Decision-makers at the provincial level were purposively selected from the members of the Management Committees of provincial Health Offices, and those at hospital level were randomly selected from members of the public and private hospital formulary drug committees throughout Thailand. The self-administered postal questionnaires were distributed. Univariate and bivariate analyses were applied. Results: Of the total 2575 questionnaires distributed, 758 (29.4% response rate) were completed and sent back. The majority of researchers and decision-makers were not familiar with technical terms commonly used in health EE, e.g., incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, discounting, and sensitivity analysis. More decision-makers (70.6%) had never had EE training compared to researchers (50.0%). Both roles indicated that value for money was one of the important issues to consider for health technology adoption. Conclusions: An extensive unmet demand for EE training among Thai researchers and decision-makers still exists.

This study compares imatinib with interferon in newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-CP) patients from the Chinese public health-care system perspective (CPHSP). Methods: One-year cost responder and lifetime cost-utility analyses were conducted, respectively. Complete cytogenetic response was used to define a responder. Direct medical costs were included. Response rates as well as survival estimates were obtained from published literature. Results: The cost per responder for interferon was close to 20 times higher than that for imatinib. The cost per additional responder was RMB36,545. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) comparing imatinib with interferon was RMB73,674 (95% confidence interval RMB67,712-RMB79,637) per quality-adjusted life-year. Conclusion: In newly diagnosed CML-CP the cost per responder for patients treated with imatinib is much lower than that for patients treated with interferon. In the cost-utility analysis, the ICER is below the cost-effectiveness threshold recommended by the World Health Organization for developing countries. Therefore, imatinib is more cost-effective than interferon from the CPHSP.","[Feng, Weiwei] Novartis Pharmaceut, Oncol Business Unit, Beijing 100004, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chun] Shanghai First Peoples Hosp, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Chen, Zi; Xu, Xiaoping] Shanghai Fudan Univ, Affiliated Huashan Hosp, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Novartis; Fudan University,"Feng, WW (通讯作者)，Novartis Pharmaceut, Oncol Business Unit, 13-F,China World Tower 2,1 JianGuoMen Wai Ave, Beijing 100004, Peoples R China.",weiwei.feng@novartis.com,"chen, si/JPK-4258-2023; C, Z/HPG-2330-2023; Chen, Xiaojia/JYV-2395-2024",,,,,,12,13,14,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,NOV-DEC,2009,12.0,,,3,2,,S85,S88,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00635.x,0.0,,,4,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,524KG,20586990.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272141600018,0

Like the solution theory in cooperative games of how the Harsanyi dividend of each coalition is distributed among a set of players, this new class of allocation rules focuses on the distribution of the dividend of each network. The dividend of each network is allocated in proportion to some measure of each player's effort, which is called an effort function. With linearity of the allocation rules, an allocation rule is specified by the effort functions. These types of allocation rules are called linear proportional effort allocation rules. Two famous allocation rules, the Myerson value and the position value, belong to this class of allocation rules. In this study, we provide a unifying approach to define the two aforementioned values. Moreover, we provide an axiomatic analysis of this class of allocation rules, and axiomatize the Myerson value, the position value, and their non-symmetric generalizations in terms of effort functions. We propose a new allocation rule in network games that also belongs to this class of allocation rules. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The complementary nature of prescription drugs and physician service use alongside the reliance on private finance for drugs may induce all income gradient in the use of physicians. We use established econometric methods based oil concentration curves to measure equity in physician utilization and its contributors in the province of Ontario. We find that individuals with prescription drug insurance make more physician visits than do those without insurance, and the effect on utilization is stronger for the likelihood of a visit than the conditional number of visits. and stronger for individuals with at least one chronic condition than those with no conditions. Results of the equity analyses reveal that the most important contributors to the pro-rich inequity in physician utilization are income and private prescription drug insurance, while public insurance, which covers older people and those on social assistance, has a pro-poor effect. These findings highlight that inequity in access to and use of publicly funded services may arise from the interaction with privately financed health services that are complements to the use of public services.

Unit root quantile autoregression inference,journal of the American Statistical Association 99, 775-787] to allow stationary covariates and a linear time trend. The limiting distribution of the test is a convex combination of Dickey-Fuller and standard normal distributions, with weight determined by the correlation between the equation error and the regression covariates. A simulation experiment is described, illustrating the finite sample performance of the unit root test for several types of distributions. The test based on quantile autoregression turns Out to be especially advantageous when innovations are heavy-tailed. An application to the CPI-based real exchange rates using four different Countries suggests that real exchange rates are not constant unit root processes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We address the endogencity of the selection in and out of caregiving using an instrumental variable approach, using the death of the care recipient and sibling characteristics. We also carefully control for baseline health and work status of the adult child. We explore flexible specifications, such as Arellano-Bond estimation techniques. Continued caregiving over time increases depressive symptoms and decreases self-rated health for married women and married men. In addition, the increase in depressive symptoms is persistent for married women. While depressive symptoms for single men and women are not affected by continued caregiving, there is evidence of increased incidence of heart conditions for single men, and that these effects are persistent. Robustness checks indicate that these health changes can be directly attributable to caregiving behavior, and not due to a direct effect of the death of the mother. The initial onset of caregiving has modest immediate negative effects on depressive symptoms for married Women and no immediate effects on physical health. Negative physical health effects emerge 2 years later., however, suggesting that there are delayed effects on health that would be missed with a short recall period. Initial caregiving does not affect health of married men.

Drawing on the distinction between circumstance and effort variables in John Roemer's work on equality of opportunity, circumstances are proxied by parental socioeconomic status and childhood health; effort is proxied by health-related lifestyles and educational attainment. Stochastic dominance tests are used to detect inequality of opportunity in the conditional distributions of self-assessed health in adulthood. Two alternative approaches are used to measure inequality of opportunity. Econometric models are estimated to illuminate and quantify the triangular relationship between circumstances, effort and health. The results indicate the existence of a considerable and persistent inequality Of opportunity in health. Circumstances affect health in adulthood both directly and through effort factors such as educational attainment. This indicates that, while the influence of some unjust circumstances can only be tackled during childhood. the implementation of complementary educational policies may be of paramount importance.

The proposed test is very attractive compared to the existing ones. In particular, implementation of this test is extremely simple for two reasons: first, the researcher does not need to specify the order of the autocorrelation tested, since the test automatically chooses this number; second, its asymptotic null distribution is chi-square with one degree of freedom, so there is no need of using a bootstrap procedure to estimate the critical values. In addition, the test is robust to the presence of conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown form. Finally, the proposed test presents higher power in simulations than the existing ones for models commonly employed in empirical finance. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Method: A previously validated health economic model was used to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of CSII compared with MDI using published clinical and cost data. The primary input variable was change in HbA(1c), and was assumed to be an improvement of -0.9% to -1.2% for CSII compared with MDI for child/young adult and adults, respectively. A series of Markov constructs simulated the progression of diabetes-related complications. Results: CSII was associated with an improvement in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained of 1.061 versus MDI for adults and 0.799 versus MDI for children/young adults. ICERs were $16,992 and $27,195 per QALY gained for CSII versus MDI in adults and children/young adults, respectively. Improved glycemic control from CSII led to a lower incidence of diabetes complications, with the most significant reduction in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), end stage renal disease (ESRD), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). The number needed to treat (NNT) for PDR was nine patients, suggesting that only nine patients need to be treated with CSII to avoid one case of PDR. The NNT for ESRD and PVD was 19 and 41, respectively. Conclusions: Setting the willingness to pay at $50,000/QALY, the analysis demonstrated that CSII is a cost-effective option for patients with T1DM in the United States.","[Lynch, Peter; Graham, Claudia] Medtron Diabet, Northridge, CA 91325 USA; [St Charles, Meaghan; Minshall, Michael E.] IMS Hlth, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Noblesville, IN USA",,"Lynch, P (通讯作者)，Medtron Diabet, 18000 Devonshire St, Northridge, CA 91325 USA.",peter.m.lynch@medtronic.com,,,Medtronic Diabetes,Medtronic Diabetes,Source of financial support: This study was supported by an unrestricted grant from Medtronic Diabetes,,38,31,32,0,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2009,12.0,5,,,,,674,686,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00478.x,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,459SR,19171006.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267130200008,0

Indeed, we establish the consistency and asymptotic mixed normality of the maximum likelihood estimator and show that the conventional method of inference is valid for this class of models. The models we explicitly consider comprise a special - yet useful - class of models that may be employed to extract the common stochastic trend from multiple integrated time series. Such models can be very useful to obtain indices that represent fluctuations of various markets or common latent factors that affect a set of economic and financial variables simultaneously. Moreover, our derivation of the asymptotics of this class makes it clear that the asymptotic Gaussianity and the validity of the conventional inference for the maximum likelihood procedure extends to a larger class of more general state space models involving integrated time series. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this class of models extracting a common stochastic trend from three sets of time series involving short- and long-term interest rates, stock return volatility and trading volume, and Dow Jones stock prices.

In a Black-Scholes world they are lognormal distributions, but in practice volatility changes and the distribution deviates from log-normality. In order to study the degree of this leviation, we estimate SPDS using EUREX option data on the DAX index via a nonparametric estimator of the second derivative of the (European) call pricing function. The estimator is constrained so as to satisfy no-arbitrage constraints and corrects for the intraday covariance structure in option prices. In contrast to existing methods, we do not use any parametric or smoothness assumptions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The vintage of a drug is the first year in which it was marketed anywhere in the world. We use annual data on the utilization of over 1100 cardiovascular drugs (active ingredients) in 20 OECD Countries during the period 1995-2003. Countries with larger increases in the share of cardiovascular drug doses that contained post-1995 ingredients had smaller increases in the cardiovascular disease hospital discharge rate, controlling for the quantity of cardiovascular medications consumed per person, the use of other medical innovations (computed tomography scanners and magnetic resonance imaging units), potential risk factors (average Consumption of calories, tobacco, and alcohol), and demographic variables (population size and age structure, income, and educational attainment). The estimates also indicate that the use of newer cardiovascular drugs has reduced the average length of stay and the age-adjusted cardiovascular mortality rate, but not the number of potential years of life lost due to cardiovascular disease before age 70 per 100000 population. The estimates indicate that if drug vintage had not increased during 1995-2004, hospitalization and mortality would have been higher in 2004. We estimate that per capita expenditure on cardiovascular hospital stays would have been 70% ($89) higher in 2004 had drug vintage not increased during 1995-2004. Per capita expenditure on cardiovascular drugs Would have been lower in 2004 had drug vintage not increased during 1995-2004. However, our estimate of the increase in expenditure on cardiovascular hospital stays is about 3.7 times as large as our estimate of the reduction in per capita expenditure for cardiovascular drugs that would have occurred ($24).

The aim of this paper is to study the delay time associated with this detector. As our main result, we derive the limit distribution of the delay time and provide thereby a theory that extends the benchmark average run-length concept utilized in most of the sequential monitoring literature.

But Such high taxes raise concerns over regressivity. Most econometric estimates of elasticities by income group use historic price data that are low, and the usefulness Of Such estimates is therefore questionable on account of the serious 'out of sample' prediction problem. To address that problem, this paper estimates price elasticities for different socioeconomic groups using recent Canadian survey data for a period during which prices rose to a level of about $7 per pack. The results provide little reason to overturn the traditional concerns about regressivity. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to estimate health-care resource use and costs of treating AF in Germany. A 6-month multicenter prospective observational cohort study with additional 3-month retrospective clinical data collection was performed in physician practices. AF-related resource use was documented by 3-month retrospective and 6-month prospective clinical data from physician charts and prospectively by patient questionnaires at 3 and 6 months. Cost calculation was from the health-care payer perspective. A total of 361 patients (mean age 71 +/- 9 years, 61% male) were recruited from 45 physician practices. Of 311 (86.1%) patients with complete data, 75% had persistent AF; oral anticoagulation and/or aspirin were prescribed in 98%. A rhythm-control strategy was applied in 27%, rate control in 58%, and 15% received neither antiarrhythmic medication nor cardioversion. A higher proportion of rhythm-control patients had paroxysmal AF (P < 0.001). Mean annual AF-related per-patient cost was 827 Euro +/- 1476 (median 386 Euro). 50% of total costs were incurred by 11% of patients, driven by AF-related hospitalizations (44%). Antiarrhythmics and stroke prophylaxis accounted for 20% and 15% of expenditures, respectively. Mean annualized costs were higher for rhythm-control patients than for rate-control patients or those without antiarrhythmic treatment (1572 vs. 780 vs. 544 Euro, P < 0.001). This evaluation provides an overview of current treatment modalities and cost of AF management in Germany. Efforts to reduce the economic burden of AF should focus on avoidance of AF hospital admissions and optimization of stroke prevention and rhythm control.","[McBride, Doreen; Mattenklotz, Anna M.; Willich, Stefan N.; Brueggenjuergen, Bernd] Charite Univ Med Ctr, Inst Social Med Epidemiol & Hlth Econ, D-10098 Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin,"McBride, D (通讯作者)，Charite Univ Med Ctr, Inst Social Med Epidemiol & Hlth Econ, D-10098 Berlin, Germany.",doreen.mcbride@charite.de,,,"AstraZeneca GmbH, Wedel, Germany","AstraZeneca GmbH, Wedel, Germany(AstraZeneca)","Source of financial support: AstraZeneca GmbH, Wedel, Germany.",,46,40,41,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2009,12.0,2,,,,,293,301,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00416.x,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,408WY,18657103.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000263467500015,0

In his comments on our paper, Bradley critiques our definitions of affordability and offers some suggestions for improving their empirical implementation. He also proposes alternative definitions of affordability and a corresponding set of policies to address uninsurance. We believe that Bradley's concerns, particularly regarding our empirical work, arise primarily because our proposed definitions do not reflect his views on how affordability should be defined. In this reply, we discuss the conceptual differences between our approaches to defining affordability and identify how these differences affect Bradley's interpretation of our models.

The joint hypothesis is supported if the revealed choices satisfy an extended version of Richter's congruence axiom together with a con traction-expansion axiom that models the noncooperative behavior.

Experimental research were carried out in two production cowshed with different thermal factors (one cowshed uninsulated, another with insulated roof - partly insulated) and different operation of ventilation systems. Both cowsheds dimensions of the ventilation system were designed sufficient size. The difference between the predicted and observed temperature humidity regime of uninsulated cowshed was non-essential, and average relative humidity of the indoor air was in line with the minimum possible. But for partly insulated cowshed observed difference between indoor and outdoor temperature humidity was too much, and in winter the indoor air humidity usually exceed the minimum possible and sometime reached 100%.

In the 1990s we find the productivity (in terms of patenting rates and patent quality) of inventors with university backgrounds begins to exceed the productivity of the inventors without such experience.

In the consumer electronics industry, retail giants such as Wal-Mart and Best Buy have embraced standards created by EPCglobal, the worldwide leader in RFID standards development.

Methods: The model is a multistate Markov model with time varying transition rates specified by age, sex, smoking status, COPD disease severity, and/or exacerbation type. The model simulates annual changes in COPD prevalence due to COPD incidence, exacerbations, disease progression (annual decline in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second as percentage of the predicted value), and mortality. The main outcome variables are quality-adjusted life years, total exacerbations, and COPD-related health care costs. Exacerbation-related input parameters were based on quantitative meta-analysis. All important model parameters are entered into the model as probability distributions. To illustrate the potential use of the model, costs and effects were calculated for 3-year implementation of three different COPD interventions, one pharmacologic, one on smoking cessation, and one on pulmonary rehabilitation using a time horizon of 10 years for reporting outcomes. Results: Compared with minimal treatment the cost/quality-adjusted life year was (sic)17,300 for the pharmacologic intervention, (sic)10,800 for the smoking cessation therapy, (sic)8,700 for the combination of the pharmacologic intervention and the smoking cessation therapy, and (sic)17,200 for the pulmonary rehabilitation program. The probability of the interventions to be cost-effective at a ceiling ratio of (sic)20,000 varied from 58% to 100%. Conclusions: The COPD model provides policy makers with information about the long-term costs and effects of interventions over the entire chain of care, from primary prevention to care for very severe COPD and includes uncertainty around the outcomes.","[Hoogendoorn, Martine; Rutten-van Molken, Maureen P.

Additionally, they characterized a solution concept for this augmented bargaining problem. We propose and axiomatically characterize a new solution concept for bargaining problems with a reference point: the Tempered Aspirations solution. In Kalai and Smorodinsky (1975), aspirations are given by the so called ideal or utopia point. In our setting, however, the salience of the reference point mutes or tempers the negotiators' aspirations. Thus, our solution is defined to be the maximal feasible point on the line segment joining the modified aspirations and disagreement vectors. The Tempered Aspirations solution can be understood as a dual version of the Gupta-Livne solution or, alternatively, as a version of Chun and Thomson's (1992) Proportional solution in which the claims point is endogenous. We also conduct an extensive axiomatic analysis comparing the Gupta-Livne to our Tempered Aspirations solution. Published by Elsevier B.V.","[Balakrishnan, P. V.

A non-bossy social aggregator depends only on those cells of the individual partitions the society members classify themselves in. This fact allows us to concentrate on a corresponding opinion graph for each profile of views. By means of natural sovereignty, liberalism, and equal treatment requirements, we characterize the non-bossy aggregators generating partitions in which the social classes are refinements of the weakly connected components of the opinion graph.

One largely ignored issue is lapse or cancellation of policies. Individuals who let a LTCI policy lapse face resumed risk of LTC expenditures while suffering the financial loss of premiums paid. The motivation for lapse has been poorly understood, though some have hypothesized that improvements in health risk may be responsible. We use 1996-2006 Health and Retirement Study data from 3974 respondents who report having private LTCI to estimate baseline and dynamic predictors of lapse and test for ex post adverse selection. Individuals who lapse are generally poorer, less educated, less healthy, and more likely to be racial and ethnic minorities than those who retain their policies. Changes in health status play a relatively small role in lapse, and we find little evidence for adverse selection associated with lapse. We conclude that lapse of LTCI is more an issue of finances and alternatives than a reassessment of health risk. Because lapse rates are highest among the least healthy individuals, lapse should be considered explicitly in efforts to expand the LTCI market.

Methods: FACT-M and EQ-5D scores were collected during a prospective study of melanoma-related quality of life at a tertiary cancer care center in the United States. The study sample was divided into development and validation datasets with equal distributions by cancer stage and treatment status. Censored Least Absolute Deviation (CLAD) and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analyses were performed using the developmental dataset to derive mapping functions, and model performance was examined through comparisons of residuals and measures of fit in the validation dataset. Exploratory analyses examined the predictive ability of clinical factors and individual subscales. Results: Of 273 patients, 75 were undergoing treatment with 198 in follow-up surveillance. Relatively even distributions were observed by melanoma stage: I/II (n = 102), III (n = 100), and IV (n = 71). OLS regression resulted in a mapping function of EQ-5D = 0.0037*FACT-M + 0.2238 with an R-2 0.499. CLAD regression resulted in a mapping function of EQ-5D = 0.0042*FACT-M + 0.1648 with pseudo R-2 0.328. When applied to the validation dataset, correlations between observed and predicted values resulted in identical coefficients (r = 0.824, P < 0.001). Though the mapping functions were similar, residuals were smaller at the 20th, 40th, and 60th percentiles using the OLS model. The CLAD derived mapping function resulted in smaller residuals only for patients whose EQ-5D = 1. Conclusions: The OLS mapping function demonstrated better predictive ability and will facilitate the derivation of utilities when direct population preference measures are not available.","[Cormier, Janice N.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Surg Oncol, Unit 1484, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Swartz, Richard J.] Rice Univ, Houston, TX USA",University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; Rice University,"Cormier, JN (通讯作者)，Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Surg Oncol, Unit 1484, 1400 Hermann Pressler Dr,POB 301402, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",jcormier@mdanderson.org,"Gershenwald, Jeff/AAX-4367-2020; Askew, Robert/AAX-3452-2020","Gershenwald, Jeff/0000-0003-4519-5369; Cantor, Scott/0000-0002-7072-6048; Askew, Robert/0000-0002-9579-2279",National Institutes of Health [5-K12-CA088084]; University of Texas; National Cancer Institute [CA 16672],National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); University of Texas; National Cancer Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)),"the current study was funded in part by a Clinician Investigator Award from the National Institutes of Health (5-K12-CA088084) and the University of Texas MD Anderson Patient-Reported Outcomes, Survey, and Population Research (PROSPR) Shared Resource, National Cancer Institute funded (#CA 16672).",,46,40,41,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2011,14.0,6,,,,,900,906,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.04.003,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BJ,21914512.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299081600015,0

The application of our methodology to analyzing the usefulness of no-arbitrage restrictions for forecasting the term structure of interest rates reveals that: (1) the restrictions have become less useful over time; (2) when using a statistical measure of accuracy, the restrictions are a useful way to reduce parameter estimation uncertainty, but are dominated by restrictions that do the same without using any theory; (3) when using an economic measure of accuracy, the no-arbitrage restrictions are no longer dominated by atheoretical restrictions, but for this to be true it is important that the restrictions incorporate a time-varying risk premium.

Tests for determining the usefulness of these predictors are typically oversized, overstating their importance. Similarly, hypothesis tests on cointegrating vectors will typically be oversized if there is not an exact unit root. This paper uses a control variable approach where adding stationary covariates with certain properties to the model can result in asymptotic normal inference for prediction regressions and cointegration vector estimates in the presence of possibly non-unit root trending covariates.

Generally, disease-specific measures provide more clinical information than generic measures but do not provide a utility weight. The aim of this study was to assess the comparability of the information captured by a disease-specific measure, the Oxford Hip Score (OHS), and a generic measure, the EQ-5D, and the viability of mapping between them to obtain utilities for the OHS. Methods: Data for 439 National Health Service patients in England before and 6 months after undergoing total hip replacement were analyzed. The information provided by the OHS and EQ-5D was assessed using principal component analysis and analysis of the correlation matrix. The predictive performance of four mapping models was based on the mean absolute error. Results: The results of the exploratory and confirmatory principal component analyses showed that the OHS data can be associated with three constructs relating to pain, mobility, and usual activity. Compared to the EQ-5D, the OHS items are multidimensional and the same construct is detected by different OHS items. These differences between the OHS and the EQ-5D do not impede the merits of either instrument when used for their own purposes. Conclusions: Conceptual differences between the two instruments mean that mapping is unlikely to provide an appropriate basis for estimating utilities for the OHS.","[Oppe, Mark] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Devlin, Nancy] Off Hlth Econ, London, England; [Black, Nick] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Serv Res & Policy, London WC1, England",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Oppe, M (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment iMTA, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",oppe@bmg.eur.nl,"Devlin, Nancy/M-3816-2014",,EuroQol Group,EuroQol Group,Funding for this project was provided by the EuroQol Group.,,18,21,21,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2011,14.0,6,,,,,884,891,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.03.003,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BJ,21914510.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299081600013,0

These models include systems of equations with limited dependent variables and unobserved individual effects, and sample selection models with unobserved individual effects. Our two-step approach first estimates the reduced form by fixed effects procedures to obtain estimates of the time varying heterogeneity underlying the endogeneity/selection bias. We then estimate the primary equation by fixed effects including an appropriately constructed control variable from the reduced form estimates as an additional explanatory variable. The fixed effects approach in this second step captures the time invariant heterogeneity while the control variable accounts for the time varying heterogeneity. Since either or both steps might employ nonlinear fixed effects procedures it is necessary to bias adjust the estimates due to the incidental parameters problem. This problem is exacerbated by the two-step nature of the procedure. As these two-step approaches are not covered in the existing literature we derive the appropriate correction thereby extending the use of large-T bias adjustments to an important class of models. Simulation evidence indicates our approach works well in finite samples and an empirical example illustrates the applicability of our estimator. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We aim to provide guidance on analysing resource use and costs focusing on randomised trials, although methods often have wider applicability. Twelve broad categories of methods were identified: (I) methods based on the normal distribution, (II) methods following transformation of data, (III) single-distribution generalized linear models (GLMs), (IV) parametric models based on skewed distributions outside the GLM family, (V) models based on mixtures of parametric distributions, (VI) two (or multi)-part and Tobit models, (VII) survival methods, (VIII) non-parametric methods, (IX) methods based on truncation or trimming of data, (X) data components models, (XI) methods based on averaging across models, and (XII) Markov chain methods. Based on this review, our recommendations are that, first, simple methods are preferred in large samples where the near-normality of sample means is assured. Second, in somewhat smaller samples, relatively simple methods, able to deal with one or two of above data characteristics, may be preferable but checking sensitivity to assumptions is necessary. Finally, some more complex methods hold promise, but are relatively untried; their implementation requires substantial expertise and they are not currently recommended for wider applied work.

Scientific research may thus not be driven by the direct practical benefit to others in the way that private-sector innovation is. Alternatively, some - yet largely unexplored - mechanisms drive the direction of scientific research to respond to the expected public benefit. We test these two competing hypotheses of scientific research. This is important because any coherent specification of what constitutes the socially optimal allocation of research requires that scientists take the public practical benefit of their work into account in setting their agenda. We examine whether the composition of medical research responds to changes in disease prevalence, while accounting for the quality of available research opportunities. We match biomedical publications data with disease prevalence data and develop new methods for estimating the quality of research opportunities from textual information and structural productivity parameters.

Methods: The preparatory stage included the organization of the research network, analysis of availability of epidemiologic data, and a survey to health decision makers to explore country-specific information needs. The development stage involved the harmonization of a methodology to retrieve local relevant parameters and develop the model structure. Calibration and validation was performed using a selected country dataset (Argentina 2005). Predicted event rates were compared to the published rates used as model inputs. External validation was undertaken against epidemiologic studies that were not used to provide input data. Results: Sixty-eight decision makers were surveyed. A microsimulation HEM was built considering the availability and quality of epidemiologic data and relevant outcomes conceived to suit the identified information needs of decision makers. It considers all tobacco-related diseases (i.e., heart, cerebrovascular and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia/influenza, lung cancer, and nine other neoplasms) and can incorporate individual-and population-level interventions. The calibrated model showed all simulated event rates falling within +/- 10% of the sources (-9%- +/- 5%). External validation showed a high correlation between published data and model results. Conclusions: This evidence-based, internally and externally valid HEM for the assessment of the effects of smoking and SCIs incorporates a broad spectrum of tobacco related diseases, SCI, and benefit measures. It could be a useful policymaking tool to estimate tobacco burden and cost-effectiveness of SCI.","[Pichon-Riviere, Andres; Augustovski, Federico; Bardach, Ariel; Colantonio, Lisandro] Univ Buenos Aires, Inst Clin Effectiveness & Hlth Policy, RA-1414 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Pichon-Riviere, Andres; Augustovski, Federico] Univ Buenos Aires, Sch Publ Hlth, RA-1414 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",University of Buenos Aires; University of Buenos Aires,"Pichon-Riviere, A (通讯作者)，Univ Buenos Aires, Inst Clin Effectiveness & Hlth Policy, Arevalo 1457, RA-1414 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",pichon-riviere@post.harvard.edu,"Bardach, Ariel/H-9566-2019; Bardach, Ariel E/E-6153-2012","Bardach, Ariel/0000-0003-4437-0073; Colantonio, Lisandro/0000-0001-8742-1788; Pena Torres, Esperanza/0000-0003-0039-6036; Pichon-Riviere, Andres/0000-0001-6052-025X; LOZA MUNARRIZ, CESAR/0000-0003-4545-9969",International Clinical Epidemiology Network; Initiative for Cardiovascular Health Research in the Developing Countries; International Development Research Centre; Institut National du Cancer France; Department for International Development UK; Canadian Tobacco Control Research Initiative; American Cancer Society; Cancer Research UK,International Clinical Epidemiology Network; Initiative for Cardiovascular Health Research in the Developing Countries; International Development Research Centre(International Development Research Centre - IDRC); Institut National du Cancer France(Institut National du Cancer (INCA) France); Department for International Development UK; Canadian Tobacco Control Research Initiative; American Cancer Society(American Cancer Society); Cancer Research UK(Cancer Research UK),"The study was made possible by unrestricted research grants awarded by the International Clinical Epidemiology Network, the Initiative for Cardiovascular Health Research in the Developing Countries; and the International Development Research Centre, Canadian Tobacco Control Research Initiative, American Cancer Society, Cancer Research UK, Institut National du Cancer France, and Department for International Development UK.",,39,28,33,0,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2011,14.0,5,,S,,,S51,S59,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.05.010,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BE,21839900.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299081000013,0

We also investigated the relationship between Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) scale scores and EQ-5D utilities. Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to the following four chemotherapy regimens: four cycles of anthracycline followed by paclitaxel (ACP), four cycles of anthracycline-containing regimens followed by docetaxel (ACD), eight cycles of paclitaxel (PTX), and eight cycles of docetaxel (DTX). Of 1060 registered, the first 300 consecutive patients were included in the current utility study. Utility scores were assessed using the EQ-5D instrument at baseline; cycles 3, 5, and 7; 7 months; and 1 year. We also evaluated the correlation between these scores and FACT-G, -B, and -Taxane scores at each time point. Results: Utility scores were significantly lower in the DTX group than in the ACP and ACD groups. Mean utility scores in the DTX group were lowest at 7 months and tended to remain low for a long time. The combined anthracycline followed by taxane group had significantly higher utility scores that the taxane-alone group, with no significant difference depending on the type of taxane. Only the FACT-G social/family well-being subscale had no relationship with EQ-5D responses and utility scores. Conclusions: Although the regimens in this study were similar in that they included taxane, the mean utility scores and longitudinal patterns of utility scores were different among regimens.","[Shiroiwa, Takeru; Shimozuma, Kojiro] Ritsumeikan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Dept Biomed Sci, Kyoto, Shiga, Japan; [Fukuda, Takashi] Univ Tokyo, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Econ & Epidemiol Res, Tokyo, Japan; [Kuranami, Masaru] Kitasato Univ, Dept Surg, Sch Med, Kanagawa, Japan; [Suemasu, Kimito] Arche Clin, Saitama, Japan; [Ohashi, Yasuo] Univ Tokyo, Dept Biostat, Sch Publ Hlth, Tokyo, Japan; [Watanabe, Toru] Hamamatsu Oncol Ctr, Shizuoka, Japan",Ritsumeikan University; University of Tokyo; Kitasato University; University of Tokyo,"Shiroiwa, T (通讯作者)，1-1-1 Noji Higashi, Kusatsu, Shiga 5258577, Japan.",t.shiroiwa@gmail.com,"Takeru, Shiroiwa/O-7926-2019","Shiroiwa, Takeru/0000-0003-3055-9932",Public Health Research Foundation,Public Health Research Foundation,"Source of financial support: This study was funded by the Comprehensive Support Project for Oncology Research (CSPOR) and for Health Outcomes Study (CSP-HOR) of Public Health Research Foundation.

We estimate the break dates and other parameters jointly by minimizing the check function over all permissible break dates. The limiting distribution of the estimator is derived and the coverage property of the resulting confidence interval is assessed via simulations. A procedure to determine the number of breaks is also discussed.

Methods: A mathematical model was constructed simulating the experience of women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Three strategies were modeled: primary prophylaxis (G-CSFs administered in all cycles), secondary prophylaxis (G-CSFs administered in all cycles after an FN event), and no G-CSF prophylaxis. Three G-CSFs were considered: filgrastim, lenograstim, and pegfilgrastim. Costs were taken from UK databases and utility values from published sources. A systematic review provided data on G-CSF efficacy. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses examined the effects of uncertainty in model parameters. Results: In the UK, base-case analysis with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 20K pound per quality-adjusted life year gained and also using list prices, the most cost-effective strategy was primary prophylaxis with pegfilgrastim for a patient with baseline FN risk greater than 38%, secondary prophylaxis with pegfilgrastim for baseline FN risk 11% to 37%, and no G-CSFs for baseline FN risk less than 11%. Using a WTP threshold of 30K pound and list prices, primary prophylaxis with pegfilgrastim was cost-effective for baseline FN risks greater than 29%. In all analyses, pegfilgrastim dominated filgrastim and lenograstim. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that higher WTP threshold, younger age, earlier stage at diagnosis, or reduced G-CSF prices result in G-CSF prophylaxis being cost-effective at lower baseline FN risk levels. Conclusion: Pegfilgrastim was the most cost-effective G-CSF. The most cost-effective strategy (primary or secondary prophylaxis) was dependent on the FN risk level for an individual patient, patient age and stage at diagnosis, and G-CSF price.","[Whyte, Sophie; Cooper, Katy L.; Stevenson, Matt D.; Madan, Jason; Akehurst, Ron] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Whyte, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",sophie.whyte@sheffield.ac.uk,"Cooper, Katy L/A-3546-2010","Madan, Jason/0000-0003-4316-1480; , Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877; Cooper, Katy/0000-0002-7702-8103",Amgen Ltd.; Amgen (EUROPE),Amgen Ltd.(Amgen); Amgen (EUROPE)(Amgen),"The research underlying this study was funded by Amgen Ltd., and a research grant from Amgen (EUROPE) GmbH was provided to support the production of the article.

With such ambitious goals, traditional combinations of research designs and analytical methods used in CER may lead to disappointing results. In this paper, I study how alternate regimes of comparative effectiveness information help shape the marginal benefits (demand) curve in the population and how such perceived demand curves impact decision-making at the individual patient level and welfare at the societal level. I highlight the need to individualize comparative effectiveness research in order to generate the true (normative) demand curve for treatments. I discuss methodological principles that guide research designs for such studies. Using an example of the comparative effect of substance abuse treatments on crime, I use novel econometric methods to salvage individualized information from an existing dataset.

The problem is exacerbated when the moment conditions are serially correlated. Several block bootstrap techniques have been proposed to correct the problem, including Hall and Horowitz (1996) and Inoue and Shintani (2006). We propose an empirical likelihood block bootstrap procedure to improve inference where models are characterized by nonlinear moment conditions that are serially correlated of possibly infinite order. Combining the ideas of Kitamura (1997) and Brown and Newey (2002), the parameters of a model are initially estimated by GMM which are then used to compute the empirical likelihood probability weights of the blocks of moment conditions. The probability weights serve as the multinomial distribution used in resampling. The first-order asymptotic validity of the proposed procedure is proven, and a series of Monte Carlo experiments show it may improve test sizes over conventional block bootstrapping.

Arguments in favour of the inclusion of such costs are gaining support, which shifts the question from whether to how to include these costs. This paper elaborates on the issue how to include cost in life years gained in cost effectiveness analysis given the current practice of economic evaluations in which costs of related diseases are included. We combine insights from the theoretical literature on the inclusion of unrelated medical costs in life years gained with insights from the so-called 'red herring' literature. It is argued that for most interventions it would be incorrect to simply add all medical costs in life years gained to an ICER, even when these are corrected for postponement of the expensive last year of life. This is the case since some of the postponement mechanism is already captured in the unadjusted ICER by modelling the costs of related diseases. Using the example of smoking cessation, we illustrate the differences and similarities between different approaches. The paper concludes with a discussion about the proper way to account for medical costs in life years gained in economic evaluations. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[van Baal, Pieter H.

This assumption is consistent with theoretical expectations when costs are a small fraction of total income. We analyze the results of five DCEs that allow direct tests of this assumption. Tests indicate that marginal utility often violates theoretical expectations. We suggest that this result is an artifact of a cognitive heuristic that recodes cost levels from a numerical scale to qualitative categories. Instead of evaluating nominal costs in the context of a budget constraint, subjects may recode costs into categories such as 'low', 'medium', and 'high' and choose as if the differences between categories were equal. This simplifies the choice task, but undermines the validity of WTP estimates as welfare measures. Recoding may be a common heuristic in health-care applications when insurance coverage distorts subjects' perception of the nominal costs presented in the DCE instrument. Recoding may also distort estimates of marginal rates of substitution for other attributes with numeric levels. Incorporating 'cheap talk' or graphic representation of attribute levels may encourage subjects to be more attentive to absolute attribute levels.

Methods: In the TORCH (Towards a Revolution in COPD Health) trial, the SGRQ and EQ-5D were administered at baseline and every 24 weeks for 3 years. To map EQ-5D utility from the SGRQ, ordinary least squares (OLS), generalized linear models (GLMs) and two-part models were used. Algorithms were developed in a fitting sample and used to predict utility scores in a validation sample and selected based on root-mean-square error (RMSE). QALYs were estimated from the algorithm and compared to QALYs derived from EQ-5D utility scores collected in the trial. Results: A simple OLS algorithm was found to perform as well as algorithms developed using more complex modeling structures. The resulting model was (RMSE 0.1723): EQ-5D = 0.9617 - 0.0013 x SGRQ total - 0.0001 x SGRQ total(2) + 0.0231 x male. Ordering of treatments by QALY gain was dependent on the method of utility estimation. Conclusion: A mapping algorithm can be used to predict EQ-5D utility scores from the SGRQ and may be useful in some situations; however, for use in a health technology assessment (HTA) submission in which precision of estimation is important, it is in the interests of both the manufacturer and the HTA body that utility scores be directly derived from the clinical trial population.

Studies that account for only one system will omit the out-of-system health-care use at the patient level. Combining data across systems and comparing utilization patterns across health systems creates complications for both aggregation and accuracy because data-generating processes (DGPs) tend to vary across systems. We develop a hybrid methodology for aggregation across systems, drawing on the strengths of the DGP in each system, and demonstrate its validity for answering research questions requiring cross-system assessments of health-care utilization. Positive and negative predictive probabilities can be useful to assess the impact of the hybrid methodology. We illustrate these issues comparing public sector (administrative records from the US Department of Veterans Affairs system) and private sector (billing records from the US Medicare system) patient level data to identify primary-care utilization. Understanding the context of a particular health system and its effect on the DGP is important in conducting effective valid evaluations.

This study provides new quantitative information about how to make jobs in rural areas more attractive to newly educated clinical officers (COs). A unique data set stemming from a discrete choice experiment with CO finalists in Tanzania is applied. The results show that offering continuing education after a certain period of service is one of the most powerful recruitment instruments the authorities have available. Increased salaries and hardship allowances will also substantially increase recruitment in rural areas. Offers of decent housing and good infrastructure, including the provision of equipment, will increase recruitment to rural remote areas but not as much as higher wages and offers of education. Women are less responsive to pecuniary incentives and are more concerned with factors that directly allow them to do a good job, while those with parents living in a remote rural area are generally less responsive to the proposed policies. When the willingness to help other people is a strong motivating force, policies that improve the conditions for helping people appear particularly effective.

Rumen biopsies were performed in 12 pregnant rumen-cannulated Holstein-Friesian cows in their first lactation in week -8, -6 and -2 before the expected date of calving and at day 3, 7, 14, 28 and 56 after calving. First, samples of rumen fluid were taken to measure pH and volatile fatty acid content. Then a full rumen evacuation was performed, rumen content was weighed and samples of rumen papillae were taken with a sharp biopsy forceps at four locations. Inspected locations were 1) in the dorsal rumen sac, right rumen wall, directly across the cannula opening (A); 2) in the atrium ruminis, front right rumen wall (B); 3) in the caudodorsal blind sac (C); and 4) in the caudoventral blind sac (D). Based on the dimension (length and width) of rumen papillae the rumen scores at each location were determined. The current contribution presents results based on one cow as an example. The average pH at week -8 to -2 relative to calving was 6.99 (+/- 0.43). After calving (from day 3 to 56) the average pH decreased to 6.39 (+/- 0.36). There was a tendency for increasing amount of fresh feed in the rumen from one week postpartum, whereas body weight of the cow decreased after calving. The average rumen score was highest in regions C and D. In contrast, rumen papillae density and dimensions were lowest in the region B.","[Cermakova, J.; Dolezal, P.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Nutr & Forage Prod, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Goselink, R.

We compare ECM specifications with a set of benchmark univariate time series representations using ARMA(p,q) specifications applied to the first differences of each of the nine core endogenous variables in turn (six domestic variables and three foreign variables). The basic macroeconomic framework is a core small open economy model consisting of five long-run relationships based on production technology and output determination, arbitrage conditions, long-run solvency requirements and accounting identities and stock-flow relations. The first requirement in the construction of the benchmark model is the selection of an a priori maximum lag order for the autoregressive and moving average processes. We examine 25 different combinations and select our preferred benchmark model on the basis of the Akaike information criterion and the Schwarz Bayesian criterion. We compare the results for estimation and selection of univariate ARMA models using the AIC, SBC and adjusted R-2 statistics for each of the nine endogenous variables. We evaluate the estimated CVAR model and the preferred benchmark ARMA model at the end of this paper.","[Hanclova, Jana] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Math Methods Econ, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,,jana.hanclova@vsb.cz,"Hanclova, Jana/AAJ-8363-2020; Hanclova, Jana/D-7723-2013","Hanclova, Jana/0000-0002-0939-6852;",,,,,15,1,1,0,5,PROFESSIONAL PUBLISHING,PRUHONICE,"NA SIDLISTI 152, PRUHONICE, PRAGUE 252 43, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7431-058-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,212,217,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BBZ07,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000309074600035,0

Nevertheless, there are many possible modifications of the models to solve such types of problems; the proposed models are universal. In addition, in many cases mathematical models enable us to find the optimal solution. The presented model has the following characteristics. The total costs for vehicle ride will be the optimization criterion. The proposed model will include the conditions which ensure better construction of timetable after the resolution of the model.

Very nice applications can be found in areas that rely on modeling via stochastic processes, such as finance. However, since financial quantities, opposed to natural processes, depend on human activity, their modeling is often very challenging. Many scholars therefor suggest to specify some parts of financial models by means of fuzzy set theory. In this contribution the recent knowledge of fuzzy numbers and their approximation is utilized in order to suggest fuzzy-MC simulation to modeling of returns of financial quantities, such as prices of stocks, commodities or exchange rates.

Method: A cross-sectional review of reports of economic models submitted to the Technology Appraisals program was undertaken to review the health-related utility data included. Data reviewed included identification and selection of data and the methods used for utility elicitation. The methods used were compared with those from the 2004 Methods Guide issued by NICE. Results: Appraisals conducted after the implementation of the NICE 2004 Methods Guide were reviewed. After exclusion of documents that did not include a de novo cost-utility analysis, 71 submissions (53 manufacturer submissions, 18 assessment group reports) from 39 appraisals were identified, containing 284 unique utility values. Variation was found in the selection, elicitation, valuation, and use of the utility values. Thirty-nine submissions (55%) took utility values from published studies, of which only 31% were identified through a systematic review. Forty-seven (66%) submissions contained health state descriptions reported by patients, and 55 (77%) submissions applied a valuation set derived from the general population. The EQ-5D was used in 35 (49%) submissions, and mapping to a generic health-related quality of life measure was performed in 19 (27%) submissions. Conclusions: Only 56% of submissions to NICE and assessment reports included utility values that met the NICE 2004 reference case. This highlights variation in the methods used to select and incorporate utility values in economic models for NICE Technology Appraisals.

Economic growth is considered to be a pathway to decrease the level of unemployment. On contrary, the economic crisis can be a potential source of growth in unemployment which could have a serious social impact. Even though the economy seems to be growing again, it may be a while before the unemployment rate begins to decline, and it may even continue rising for some time after the resumption of sustained economic growth. The study is aimed to test long-term relationship between GDP growth and unemployment. Quarterly OECD data were used for the analysis of both GDP and labour market performance. The Johansen test was applied on 1995-2010 data to examine cointegration between the number of the unemployed labour force and real gross domestic product. On the basis of the unit root test, we found that in all countries, both variables are stationary except for their first differences.

This study examined the trend and geographic variation of the burden of smoking by calculating smoking-related QALYs lost from 1993 to 2008 for the US adults and individual states. Methods: Population health-related quality of life scores were estimated from the 1993 to 2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The smoking-related QALYs lost are the sum of QALYs lost due to morbidity and future QALYs lost in expected life years due to premature deaths (mortality). Results: From 1993 to 2008, the percent of US adults who smoked declined from 22.7% to 18.5%, but the smoking-related QALYs lost were relatively stable at 0.0438 QALYs lost per population. Although smoking contributed more QALYs lost for men (0.0535) than for women (0.0339), smoking-related QALYs lost decreased by 2.5% for men but increased by 12.6% for women. Kentucky, Oklahoma, Mississippi, West Virginia, and Tennessee had the most smoking-related QALYs lost wheras Utah, California, Connecticut, Minnesota, and Hawaii had the least QALYs lost. The state tobacco tax rate was strongly and negatively associated with both the percent smoked (r = -0.60) and QALYs lost (r = -0.54), as well as the percentage change in both. Conclusions: This analysis quantified the overall burden of smoking for the nation and individual states from 1993 to 2008. Such data might assist in providing specified quantitative targets for the Healthy People 2020 smoking-related health objectives and for tracking changes on a yearly basis.","[Jia, Haomiao] Columbia Univ, Dept Biostat, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Jia, Haomiao] Columbia Univ, Sch Nursing, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Lubetkin, Erica I.] CUNY City Coll, Dept Community Hlth & Social Med, Sophie Davis Sch Biomed Educ, New York, NY 10031 USA",Columbia University; Columbia University; City University of New York (CUNY) System; City College of New York (CUNY); Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education,"Jia, HM (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Biostat, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, 630 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA.",hj2198@columbia.edu,"Jia, Haomiao/AAU-8276-2021",,,,,,29,3,3,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2010,13.0,8,,,,,958,964,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00760.x,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,691FR,20946184.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285066200014,0

A pre-averaged realised covariance is proposed, and we present an asymptotic theory for this new estimator, which can be configured to possess an optimal convergence rate or to ensure positive semi-definite covariance matrix estimates. We also derive a noise-robust Hayashi-Yoshida estimator that can be implemented on the original data without prior alignment of prices. We uncover the finite sample properties of our estimators with simulations and illustrate their practical use on high-frequency equity data. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We postulate an Ethical Observer (EO) who maximizes intertemporal welfare under this uncertainty, with expected-utility preferences. Various social welfare criteria entail alternative von Neumann Morgenstern utility functions for the EO: utilitarian, Rawlsian, and an extension of the latter that corrects for the size of population. Our analysis covers, first, a cake-eating economy (without production), where the utilitarian and Rawlsian recommend the same allocation. Second, a productive economy with education and capital, where it turns out that the recommendations of the two Eos are in general different. But when the utilitarian program diverges, then we prove it is optimal for the extended Rawlsian to ignore the uncertainty concerning the possible disappearance of the human species in the future. We conclude by discussing the implications for intergenerational welfare maximization in the presence of global warming. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we carefully explore this phenomenon and estimate gravity equations for 'trade' in hospital care using a Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood method. Consistency of the PPML estimator is guaranteed under the null of independence provided that the conditional mean is correctly specified. In our case we find that patients' flows are affected by network autocorrelation. We correct for it by relying upon spatial filtering. Our results suggest that the gravity model is a good framework for explaining patient mobility in most of the examined diagnostic groups. We find that the ability to restrain patients' outflows increases with the size of the pool of enrollees. Moreover, the ability to attract patients' inflows is reduced by the size of pool of enroless for all LHAs except for the very big LHAs. For LHAs in the top quintile of size of enrollees, the ability to attract inflows increases with the size of the pool.

The assumption is weaker than the standard nonsatiation assumption and weak nonsatiation introduced by Allouch and Le Van (2008). In particular, it allows preferences to be satiated only inside the set of individually rational feasible consumptions, while the two nonsatiation assumptions do not. It is also worth noting that just like the two nonsatiation assumptions, our new assumption depends solely on the characteristics of consumers. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Our aim was to develop a conceptual framework of PROs for hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) to support measurement clarity. Methods: Relevant outcome issues were identified from review of recent clinical trials. This provided content for an interview with 15 metastatic HRPC patients and a survey of 10 practitioners. All participants were asked about the relevance and importance of 26 outcomes and were allowed to nominate new outcomes. Practitioners were also asked to determine which outcomes endorsed by patients were attributable to the disease (symptoms) versus treatment (side effects). Analyses of archived clinical trial data were used to verify and augment the interview and survey results. Results: Patients endorsed 11 concerns as relevant and important to HRPC including general pain, bone pain, urinary problems, fatigue, appetite loss, constipation, erectile dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, diarrhea, PSA anxiety, and changes in self image. Practitioner judgments helped classify each concern into one of four categories, disease symptom, treatment side effect, both symptom and side effect, or psychological concern. Additionally, patients endorsed (and practitioners confirmed) the relevance and importance of several general domains of quality of life. Analyses of archived data confirmed the importance of these issues and suggested two additional concerns. Conclusion: Findings were used to propose a conceptual framework of PROs for metastatic HRPC. Such frameworks can be used to help specify targets for assessment in clinical studies such as treatment trials.","[Eton, David T.] Mayo Clin, Dept Hlth Sci Res, Div Hlth Care Policy & Res, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Shevrin, Daniel H.] NorthShore Univ HealthSyst, Kellogg Canc Care Ctr, Evanston, IL USA; [Beaumont, Jennifer; Victorson, David; Cella, David] Northwestern Univ, Dept Med Social Sci, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA",Mayo Clinic; NorthShore University Health System; Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine,"Eton, DT (通讯作者)，Mayo Clin, Dept Hlth Sci Res, Div Hlth Care Policy & Res, Harwick 6-66,200 1st St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA.",eton.david@mayo.edu,"Beaumont, Jennifer/AAA-2825-2020","Beaumont, Jennifer/0000-0002-1484-260X; Eton, David/0000-0001-8715-1511",Bayer Schering Pharma AG,Bayer Schering Pharma AG(Bayer AG),Study supported by Bayer Schering Pharma AG.,,26,27,28,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2010,13.0,5,,,,,613,623,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00702.x,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,635RQ,20230544.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280674200014,0

Our purpose is to identify and describe published quantitative RBA methods for pharmaceuticals. Methods: Using MEDLINE and other Internet-based search engines, a systematic literature review was performed to identify quantitative methodologies for RBA. These distinct RBA approaches were summarized to highlight the implications of their differences for the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory agencies. Results: Theoretical models, parameters, and key features were reviewed and compared for the 12 quantitative RBA methods identified in the literature, including the Quantitative Framework for Risk and Benefit Assessment, benefit-less-risk analysis, the quality-adjusted time without symptoms and toxicity, number needed to treat (NNT), and number needed to harm and their relative-value-adjusted versions, minimum clinical efficacy, incremental net health benefit, the risk-benefit plane (RBP), the probabilistic simulation method, multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), the risk-benefit contour (RBC), and the stated preference method (SPM). Whereas some approaches (e.g., NNT) rely on subjective weighting schemes or nonstatistical assessments, other methods (e.g., RBP, MCDA, RBC, and SPM) assess joint distributions of benefit and risk. Conclusions: Several quantitative RBA methods are available that could be used to help lessen concern over subjective drug assessments and to help guide authorities toward more objective and transparent decision-making. When evaluating a new drug therapy, we recommend the use of multiple RBA approaches across different therapeutic indications and treatment populations in order to bound the risk-benefit profile.","[Guo, Jeff J.; Bian, Boyang] Univ Cincinnati, Hlth Acad Ctr, Coll Pharm, Cincinnati, OH 45267 USA; [Pandey, Swapnil] Kendle Int Inc, Cincinnati, OH USA; [Doyle, John] Columbia Univ, Dept Epidemiol, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, New York, NY USA; [Doyle, John; Lis, Yvonne] Cardiff Univ, Welsh Sch Pharm, Ctr Socioecon Res, Cardiff CF1 3XF, S Glam, Wales; [Raisch, Dennis W.] Univ New Mexico, Coll Pharm, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA",University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati; Columbia University; Cardiff University; University of New Mexico,"Guo, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Cincinnati, Med Ctr, Coll Pharm, 3225 Eden Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45267 USA.",jeff.guo@uc.edu,,,,,,,83,145,154,0,55,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2010,13.0,5,,,,,657,666,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00725.x,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,635RQ,20412543.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280674200020,0

Among the rounding functions with fixed concavity are those based on power means, which include the methods of Adams, Dean, Hill-Huntington, Webster, and Jefferson The thresholds for Dean's and Hill-Huntington's methods had not been evaluated previously. We use the formulas to analyze the behavior of the thresholds for divisor methods with fixed concavity, and compute and compare threshold values for Hill-Huntington's method (used to apportion the US House of Representatives).

Agents may borrow or deposit money at a central bank and use the cash available to them in order to purchase a commodity for immediate consumption. They derive positive utility from consumption and from having cash reserves at the end of the day, whereas being bankrupt entails negative utility. The bank fixes interest rates. The existence of Nash equilibria (both mixed and pure) of the ensuing game is proved under various assumptions. In particular, no agent is bankrupt at equilibrium. Asymptotic behavior of replica markets is discussed, and it is shown that given appropriate assumptions, the difference between a strategic player and a price taker is negligible in a large economy.

The model is based on a dynamic game involving three types of agents: pharmaceutical firms, consumers and a regulatory entity. Pharmaceutical firms choose the level of research investment and its innovative content, then negotiate introductory prices for new drugs with the regulator. Reference pricing affects negatively the intensity of research and it also modifies the types of innovations that are brought to the market, deterring small innovations. The model is calibrated with a small data on statins in France. Our results suggest that reference pricing typically generates a decline in health, whereas discounted expenditures may decrease or increase, depending on the degree of deterrence of cost reducing innovations.

The model generates a recursive system of equations for health and lifestyles, which is then jointly estimated by full information maximum likelihood with freely correlated error terms. The analysis innovates by accounting for the presence of unobserved heterogeneity, therefore addressing the partial-circumstance problem, and by extending the examination of inequality of opportunity to health outcomes other than self-assessed health, such as long-standing illness, disability and mental health. The results provide evidence for the existence of third factors that Simultaneously influence health Outcomes and lifestyle choices, supporting the empirical relevance of the partial-circumstance problem. Accounting for these factors, the paper corroborates that the effect of parental and early circumstances on adult health disparities is paramount. However, the particular set of circumstances that affect each of the analysed health outcomes differs substantially. The results also show that differences in educational opportunities, and in social development in childhood, are crucial determinants of lifestyles in adulthood, which, in turn, shape the observed health inequalities.

Methods: We applied a net benefit framework to patient-level data on costs and quality-of-life of a previous randomized controlled trial. VOI analyses were performed using Monte Carlo simulation. We estimated the total expected value of perfect information (total EVPI), the total expected value of sample information (total EVSI), the partial expected value of perfect information (partial EVPI), and the partial expected value of sample information (partial EVSI). These VOI analyses identified the key parameters and the optimal sample size of future study designs. Sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the robustness of our assumptions about the population to benefit, the willingness-to-pay threshold, and the study costs. The VOI analyses are demonstrated in statistical software (R) and a spreadsheet (Excel) allowing other investigators to apply VOI analysis to their patient-level data. Results: The optimal study design for the treatment of intermittent claudication involves a randomized controlled trial collecting data on the quality-adjusted life expectancy and additional admission costs for 525 patients per treatment arm. The optimal sample size remained between 400 and 600 patients for a willingness-to-pay threshold between 30,000 and 100,000/quality-adjusted life-years, for even extreme assumptions about the study costs, and for a range of 3 to 7 years that future patients will benefit from the results of the proposed study. Conclusions: 1) The optimal study for patients with intermittent claudication collects data on two key parameters for 525 patients per trial arm; and 2) we have shown that value of information analysis provides an explicit framework to determine the optimal sample size and identify key parameters for the design of future clinical trials.","[Koerkamp, Bas Groot; Spronk, Sandra; Hunink, M.

We consider arbitrary normal-form games that are iteratively played by players that observe their own payoffs after each round. Each player's strategy is assumed to depend only past actions and past payoffs of the player. We study a class of autonomous reinforcement-learning rules for such players and show that variants of the adjusted replicator dynamics are asymptotically exact approximations of player strategies for small values of a step-size parameter adopted in learning. We also obtain a convergence result that identifies when a stable equilibrium of the limit dynamics characterizes equilibrium behavior of player strategies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Using the zeatin-O-glucoside (ZOG)-specific beta-glucosidase Zm-p60.1, we have been able to disrupt the zeatin metabolic network during early tobacco seedling development. The maize beta-glucosidase Zm-p60.1 was localized in meristematic root cells of young seedlings of Zea mays, it supplements the developing embryo with active CK. This work will deepen our understanding of the phenotype of plants over-expressing the extracellular version of beta-glucosidase Zm-p60.1 on medium containing exogenous zeatin. Zm-p60.1 was choosen as a suitable molecular tool for detecting changes in zeatin metabolism. Transgenic variants of Nicotiana tabacum L. over-expresing Zm-p60.1 in the extracellular space were chosen for this work. There were no readily observable morphological differences between transgenic seedlings and wild-type seedlings. When grown on medium containing zeatin, transgenic plants did not accumulate fresh weight as observed in other variants of Zm-p60.1. However, when grown on medium without supplement, transgenic plants were signifficantly heavier than wild-type three weeks after sowing. RT-PCR confirmed the expression of Zm-p60.1 in transgenic plants. Zm-p60.1 enzyme was histochemically localised in cotyledons, leaves and ectopic structures at the base of the hypocotyl using an indigogenic substrate for beta-glucosidase. Database searches were conducted to look for N. tabacum orthologues to Arabidopsis response regulators, the effector molecules in cytokinin signal transduction. We used EST databases (N. tabacum L. taxid 4097) and the receiver domain amino acid sequence as a query. Three suitable candidates were found and primers designed to monitor expression of these genes in the transgenic variants mentioned above.","[Chmelik, D.; Dubova, J.] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Expt Biol, Kamenice 753-5, Brno 62500, Czech Republic; [Kiran, N.

My research question Why is the World Heritage of Mozambique Island in its present state? is answered through an exploration of the concept of appropriation and the importance of recognising the invisible and visible complexities of a locality. The appropriation of identity and space only happens when the individual or group concerned think that they would benefit at some level from it. 1 propose that in Mozambique Island there is a case of non-appropriation of its World Heritage due to its complexities, the main being: severe poverty, lack of education, bad governance, inadequate political structuring of organisations, a culture of dependency and poor technical and financial support.","[Dantas e Sa, V.

Methods: A decision-analytic model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of temsirolimus. The clinical effectiveness of temsirolimus compared with interferon-alpha and the utility values (using EQ-5D tariffs) were taken from a recent phase III randomized clinical trial. Cost data were obtained from published literature and based on current UK practice. The effect of parameter uncertainty on cost-effectiveness was explored through extensive one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: Compared to interferon-alpha, temsirolimus treatment resulted in an incremental cost per QALY gained of 94,632; pound based on an estimated mean gain of 0.24 quility-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient, at a mean additional cost of 22,331 pound (inflated to 2007/8). The cost per QALY for patient subgroups ranged from 74,369 pound to 154,752 pound. The probability that temsirolimus is cost-effective compared to interferon-alpha at a willingness to pay threshold of 30,000 pound per QALY for all patient groups is expected to be close to zero. The cost per QALY was sensitive to the clinical effectiveness parameters, health state utilities, drug costs and the cost of administration of temsirolimus. Conclusions: Temsirolimus has been shown to be clinically effective compared to interferon-a offering additional health benefits, however, with a cost per QALY in excess of 90,000 pound, it may not be regarded as a cost-effective use of resources in some health care settings.","[Green, Colin; Thompson-Coon, Jo; Liu, Zulian; Moxham, Tiffany; Stein, Ken] Univ Plymouth, Peninsula Med Sch, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Green, Colin; Thompson-Coon, Jo; Liu, Zulian; Moxham, Tiffany; Stein, Ken] Univ Exeter, Peninsula Med Sch, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Welch, Karen] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England",University of Plymouth; University of Plymouth; University of Exeter; University of Southampton,,martin.hoyle@pms.ac.uk,"Coon, Jo Thompson/C-7923-2017","Hoyle, Martin/0000-0001-5593-9777",UK NHS Research and Development Health Technology Assessment programme [07/72/01],UK NHS Research and Development Health Technology Assessment programme,"The research was carried Out under contract to the UK NHS Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme.

The construction of the cathedral started during the decade of 1520. It was originally a three nave church and is believed to be similar to other temples of the time such as the Funchal or Guarda Cathedrals. During its history, the cathedral was occupied by Muslims who eliminated the naves, leaving only the main altar, one lateral chapel and an outside wall. The space of the naves was used to add several residential buildings and they turned the altar in a bathhouse for women (hammam in Arab). The altar, crowned by a ribbed vault, the lateral chapel whose roof, also vaulted, is missing and one alone standing external wall are the only original parts of the structure that are left. The Cathedral will be soon submitted to a structural intervention.

The objective of this report is to provide guidance and recommendations on how drug costs should be measured for CEAs done from an internationally comparative perspective. Methods: Members of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) Task Force on Good Research Practices-Use of Drug Costs for Cost Effectiveness Analysis (Drug Cost Task Force [DCTF]) subgroup from several countries were experienced developers or users of CEA models, and worked in academia, industry, and as advisors to governments. They solicited comments on drafts from a core group of 174 external reviewers and more broadly, from the members of the ISPOR at the ISPOR 12th Annual International meeting and via the ISPOR Web site. Results: Drug units should be standardized in terms of volume of active ingredient, regardless of packaging and dosing strength variations across countries. Drug costs should be measured in local currency per unit of active ingredient and should be converted to other currencies using sensitivity analyses of purchasing power parities (PPP) and exchange rates, whichever is more appropriate. When using drug prices from different years, the consumer price index for the local currency should be applied before the PPP and/or exchange rate conversion. Conclusion: CEA researchers conducting international pharmacoeconomic analysis should tailor the appropriate measure of drug costs to the international perspective, to maintain clarity and transparency on drug cost measurement in the context of international drug comparison and report the sensitivity of CEA results to reasonable cost conversions.","[Shi, Lizheng] Tulane Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Syst Management, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA; [Hodges, Meredith] Univ Texas Austin, Sch Pharm, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Drummond, Michael] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Ahn, Jeonghoon; Hay, Joel W.] Univ So Calif, Dept Pharmaceut Econ & Policy, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Li, Shu Chuen] Univ Newcastle, Sch Biomed Sci, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Hu, Shanlian] Fudan Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Augustovski, Federico] Inst Clin Effectiveness & Hlth Policy IECS, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Smeeding, Jim] JestaRx Grp, Dallas, TX USA",Tulane University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of York - UK; University of Southern California; University of Newcastle; Fudan University; JeSTARx Group,"Shi, LZ (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Syst Management, 1440 Canal St,Suite 1900, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA.",lshi1@tulane.edu,"LI, SHU CHUEN/G-7911-2013; Ahn, Jeonghoon/CAA-1956-2022","Ahn, Jeonghoon/0000-0002-0177-0192",,,,,34,18,20,0,22,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2010,13.0,1,,,,,28,33,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00662.x,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,541PI,19883403.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273429000008,0

Methods: A decision-analytic model was populated with local age-specific incidence data to simulate the expected health outcomes resulting from 7vPCV vaccination of a birth cohort of 57, 100 children compared with an unvaccinated cohort over a 10-year horizon. primary analyses were conducted from a payer perspective, using local inpatient and ourpatient costs associated with the treatment of pneumococcal disease. Vaccine efficacy rates were consistent with results from pivotal clinical trials. The reduction in adult invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and associated cost avoidance due to the indirect effect of vaccination were estimated in line with published overseas rates. Results: Universal 7vPCV vaccination was estimated to prevent 524 cases of IPD and more than 2580 cases of otitis media in the birth cohort over a 10-year period, leading to a reduction of HK$28.7 million (US$3.7 million) in direct medical costs. Additional cost savings from the indirect prevention of 919 adult cases of IPD during this time period also resulted. Overall, 7vPCV vaccination was estimated to have an incremental cost per life-year gained of HK$50,456 (US$6460) from a payer perspective or HK$46,308 (US$5929) when both direct and indirect costs were included. Conclusion: With reference to the World Health Organization's threshold for cost-effectiveness, results from this study indicate that routine infant vaccination with 7vPCV is a cost-effective intervention because of the added cost savings resulting from the indirect effect of vaccination on adult disease.","[Lee, Kenneth K.

Methods: A decision analytical model was applied. The model used a time horizon of 2 years. The probabilities of treatment response of different agents and the relapse and hospitalization rates were estimated by a Delphi panel of 17 senior psychiatrists in China. The unit cost for each medical service was calculated from the price system database built by China National Development and Reform Commission and the medical resource utilization was estimated by the Delphi panel. The principal efficacy measure was the proportion of patients successfully treated. Various sensitivity analyses were carried out to test the robustness of the model. Results: The proportion of patients successfully treated over the 2-year period was 46.71% for long-acting risperidone, 39.93% for olanzapine, and 31.28% for quetiapine. The mean cost-effectiveness ratios were RMB189,427, RMB202,432, and RMB233,015 per successfully treated patient for long-acting risperidone, quetiapine and olanzapine, respectively.

Methods: This study was a retrospective analysis of the Arkansas Medicaid administrative claims data. Continuously eligible adult schizophrenia (ICD-9-CM = 295.**) patients on antipsychotic monotherapy were identified in the recruitment period from July 2000 through April 2004. Adherence rates to antipsychotic therapy in year 1 were calculated using eight different measures identified from the literature. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to prospectively predict all-cause and mental health-related hospitalizations in the follow-up year. Results: Adherence rates were computed for 3395 schizophrenic patients with a mean age of 42.9 years, of which 52.5% (n = 1782) were females, and 52.8% (n = 1793) were white. The proportion of days covered (PDC) and continuous measure of medication gaps measures of adherence had equal C-statistics of 0.571 in predicting both all-cause and mental health-related hospitalizations. The medication possession ratio (MPR) continuous multiple interval measure of oversupply were the second best measures with equal C-statistics of 0.568 and 0.567 for any-cause and mental health-related hospitalizations. The multivariate adjusted models had higher C-statistics but provided the same rank order results. Conclusions: MPR and PDC were among the best predictors of any-cause and mental health-related hospitalization, and are recommended as the preferred adherence measures when a single measure is sought for use with administrative claims data for patients not on polypharmacy.","[Martin, Bradley C.] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Div Pharmaceut Evaluat & Policy, Dept Pharm Practice, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA; [Karve, Sudeep] Ohio State Univ, Coll Pharm, Dept Pharm Adm, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Cleves, Mario A.] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Dept Pediat, Coll Med, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA; [Helm, Mark] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Dept Pharm Practice, Coll Pharm, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA; [Hudson, Teresa J.] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Dept Psychiat, Coll Med, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA; [West, Donna S.] Univ Mississippi, Coll Pharm, Dept Pharm Adm, University, MS 38677 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Medical Sciences; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Medical Sciences; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Medical Sciences; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Medical Sciences; University of Mississippi,"Martin, BC (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Div Pharmaceut Evaluat & Policy, Dept Pharm Practice, 4301 W Markham St,Slot 522, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA.",BMARTIN@uams.edu,,,,,,,34,96,112,0,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2009,12.0,6,,,,,989,995,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00543.x,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,474SP,19402852.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268304600017,0

We estimate the marginal effect of proximity to death, measured by being within 2 years of death, on the probabilities Of nursing home and formal home care use, and we determine whether this effect differs by availability of informal care - i.e. marital status and co-residence with an adult child. The analysis uses a sample of elderly aged 70 + from the 1993-2002 Health and Retirement Study. Simultaneous probit models address the joint decisions to use long-term care and co-residence with an adult child. Overall, proximity to death significantly increases the probability of nursing home use by 50.0% and of formal home care use by 12.4%. Availability of informal Support significantly reduces the effect of proximity to death. Among married elderly, proximity to death has no effect oil institutionalization. In conclusion, proximity to death is one of the main drivers of long-term care use, but changes in sources of informal support, Such as an increase in the proportion of married elderly, may lessen its importance in shaping the demand for long-term care.

There are two sources of potential dynamic inconsistency, one is arrival of information and the other is changing choice opportunities over time-discarding the current stopping option may change how she stops the game in the future. First we consider a naive planner who prescribes a commitment solution, and illustrate the nature of the inconsistency problem. Then we consider a sophisticated planner who plays backward induction against her 'successive selves'. The resolution of dynamic inconsistency does not in general allow the use of standard dynamic programming technique. We provide, however, a simple characterization of the backward induction strategy, which is given in a recursive formula. We also provide a behavioral implication, that larger indeterminacy of belief may lead to a more aggressive behavior, that is, continuing the gamble longer, which contrasts to the implication of ambiguity aversion.

High profile cases and critical media coverage have sharpened public interest in this issue. In November 2008, the Conservative Party published detailed proposals on NICE outlining policies for improving the systems and processes for making decisions about NHS drug availability. The Conservatives clearly state their support for NICE, but highlight six areas to improve its configuration, structure and efficiency. These areas are consistent with the Conservative commitment to focus on health outcomes rather than central targets. A NICE Charter to codify the Institute's roles and responsibilities; scrapping the current system of Ministerial referral; allowing appraisals to commence at the time of drug licensing; and increasing the use of risk-sharing schemes are among the headline pledges. The policy document also makes clear the need for pharmaceutical companies to better demonstrate product clinical value by shifting the burden of proof from NICE to the manufacturer. Improved cooperation between industry and NICE is promised through the creation of a steering committee. Furthermore, a clear commitment to evaluate wider social costs and benefits is provided. The Conservative proposals make clear that there are no easy solutions to tackle the basic health economic problem of how to best allocate finite NHS resources to satisfy all healthcare needs. However, the proposals offer a solid blueprint for focused reform moving forward.","Holborn, Hlth Econ, London WC1A 2NS, England",,"Carroll, S (通讯作者)，Holborn, Hlth Econ, 20 Bloomsbury Sq, London WC1A 2NS, England.",stuart.carroll@unitedbiosource.com,,"Carroll, Stuart/0000-0002-1237-0370",,,,,14,2,4,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2009,12.0,5,,,,,631,633,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00546.x,0.0,,,3,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,459SR,19402849.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267130200001,0

Both structures can be used for purposes of determining optimal portfolio and risk management strategies through the use of correlation matrices, and for calculating Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecasts and optimal capital charges under the Basel Accord through the use of covariance matrices. A technique is developed to estimate the DC MSV model using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure, and simulated data show that the estimation method works well. Various multivariate conditional volatility and MSV models are compared via simulation, including an evaluation of alternative VaR estimators. The DC MSV model is also estimated using three sets of empirical data, namely Nikkei 225 Index, Hang Seng Index and Straits Times Index returns, and significant dynamic correlations are found. The Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) model is also estimated, and is found to be far less sensitive to the covariation in the shocks to the indexes. The correlation process for the DCC model also appears to have a unit root, and hence constant conditional correlations in the long run. In contrast, the estimates arising from the DC MSV model indicate that the dynamic correlation process is stationary. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Here we present data on the Portuguese validation of the Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST), which was explicitly designed to gauge functioning dimensions empirically linked to bipolar disorder. One hundred patients with bipolar disorder and matched controls were assessed with the FAST, which was evaluated regarding discriminant, content and construct validity, concurrent validity with functioning instruments, internal consistency and test-retest reliability. The FAST displayed a five-factor structure very similar to its conceptualization, successfully discriminated patient and control groups, and correlated highly with other functioning measures; it also showed excellent test-retest reliability and internal consistency. The FAST is a measure with sufficient validity and reliability, with potential for the use in international clinical trials and comparative studies.","[Cacilhas, Alice Aita; da Silva Magalhaes, Pedro Vieira; Cereser, Keila Maria; Walz, Julio Cesar; Weyne, Fernanda; Ribeiro Rosa, Adriane; Kapczinski, Flavio] Hosp Clin Porto Alegre, Mol Psychiat Lab, BR-90035003 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Ribeiro Rosa, Adriane; Vieta, Eduard] Univ Barcelona, Hosp Clin, Clin Inst Neurosci, Bipolar Disorders Program, Barcelona, Spain; [Cacilhas, Alice Aita; da Silva Magalhaes, Pedro Vieira; Cereser, Keila Maria; Walz, Julio Cesar; Weyne, Fernanda; Ribeiro Rosa, Adriane; Kapczinski, Flavio] Hosp Clin Porto Alegre, Bipolar Disorders Program, BR-90035003 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona,"Kapczinski, F (通讯作者)，Hosp Clin Porto Alegre, Mol Psychiat Lab, Ramiro Barcelos 2350, BR-90035003 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",kapcz@terra.com.br,"Magalhães, Pedro/A-8519-2008; rosa, adriane ribeiro/G-6923-2013; Kapczinski, Flavio/J-5803-2014; Vieta, Eduard/Y-2919-2019; Kapczinski, Flavio/D-3175-2013; Cereser, Keila M/B-7733-2009; Kapczinski, Flavio Pereira/JPA-3835-2023","Magalhães, Pedro/0000-0002-5644-6357; rosa, adriane ribeiro/0000-0001-8629-4625; Vieta, Eduard/0000-0002-0548-0053; Kapczinski, Flavio/0000-0001-8738-856X; Walz, Julio Cesar/0000-0001-9576-2443",Research Incentive Fund of the Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre,Research Incentive Fund of the Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre,This study was supported by the Research Incentive Fund of the Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre.

Because more jurisdictions request economic data, the burden on study sponsors and researchers increases. There are many reasons why the cost-effectiveness of health technologies might vary from place to place. Therefore, this report of an ISPOR Good Practices Task Force reviews what national guidelines for economic evaluation say about transferability, discusses which elements of data could potentially vary from place to place, and recommends good research practices for dealing with aspects of transferability, including strategies based on the analysis of individual patient data and based on decision-analytic modeling.","[Drummond, Michael; Sculpher, Mark] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Barbieri, Marco] I3 Innovus, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Cook, John] Merck & Co Inc, N Wales, PA USA; [Glick, Henry A.] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Lis, Joanna] Sanofi Aventis Grp Poland, Warsaw, Poland; [Malik, Farzana] Merck Serono Int SA, Geneva, Switzerland; [Reed, Shelby D.] Duke Clin Res Inst, Durham, NC USA; [Rutten, Frans] Erasmus Univ, Med Ctr, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Severens, Johan] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Severens, Johan] Univ Hosp Maastricht, Maastricht, Netherlands",University of York - UK; i3 Innovus; Merck & Company; University of Pennsylvania; Sanofi-Aventis; Merck & Company; Serono International S.A.; Merck KGaA; EMD Serono Inc.; Duke University; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC; Maastricht University; Maastricht University; Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC),"Drummond, M (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Alcuin A Block, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",md18@york.ac.uk,"Malik, Farzana/JQW-8021-2023","Sculpher, Mark/0000-0003-3746-9913",ISPOR,ISPOR,"We are grateful to ISPOR for financial support and to the many ISPOR members who commented on an earlier version of this report: Michael Adena, RenEe Arnold, Muhammad Ashar Malik, Federico Augustovski, Sixten Borg, Julia Bottomley, Lance Brannman, Tom Burke, Anita Burrell, Isabelle Chabot, Glenn Davies, Joseph DiCesare, Pero Draganic, Janeen DuChane, Isabelle Durand-Zaleski, Ancilla Fernandes, Anna Filonenko, Holger Gothe, Carlos Gouveia Pinto, Wolfgang Greiner, Gijs Hubben, Margaret Hux, Anna Karin, Peter Kaskel, Bengt Liljas, Andrea Manca, Doreen McBride, Mike McClure, Jacqui Miot, Jan Oltvoort, Pedro Plans-Rubio, Wolf Rogowski, Giuseppa Rudelli, Miguel Ruiz, Erik Sarpong, Mark Schulz, Paul Scuffham, Tomas Sechser, D Eldon Spackman, Hans-Martin SpAth, Rosanna Tarricone, George Torrance, Peter Verplanken, F Randy Vogenberg, Adele Weston, Richard Willke, Michael Wonder, Shawn Xie and Hanna Zowall.

However, the development of a sufficiently general asymptotic theory for nonlinear spatial models has been hampered by a lack of relevant central limit theorems (CLTs), uniform laws of large numbers (ULLNs) and pointwise laws of large numbers (LLNs). These limit theorems form the essential building blocks towards developing the asymptotic theory of M-estimators, including maximum likelihood and generalized method of moments estimators. The paper establishes a CLT, ULLN, and LLN for spatial processes or random fields that should be applicable to a broad range of data processes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Lang, J; Xia, LR",,,,"Lang, Jerome; Xia, Lirong",,,Sequential composition of voting rules in multi-issue domains,MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Voting; Multiple elections; Preferential independence; CP-networks,SOCIAL CHOICE; CP-NETS; PREFERENCES; ELECTIONS; PARADOX,"In many real-world group decision making problems, the set of alternatives is a Cartesian product of finite value domains for each of a given set of variables (or issues). Dealing with such domains leads to the following well-known dilemma: either ask the voters to vote separately on each issue, which may lead to the so-called multiple election paradoxes as soon as voters' preferences are not separable; or allow voters to express their full preferences on the set of all combinations of values, which is practically impossible as soon as the number of issues and/or the size of the domains are more than a few units. We try to reconciliate both views and find a middle way, by relaxing the extremely demanding separability restriction into this much more reasonable one: there exists a linear order x(1) > ... > x(p) on the set of issues such that for each voter, every issue x(i) is preferentially independent of x(i+1), ... , x(p) given x(1), ... , x(i-1). This leads us to define a family of sequential voting rules, defined as the sequential composition of local voting rules. These rules relate to the setting of conditional preference networks (CP-nets) recently developed in the Artificial intelligence literature. Lastly, we study in detail how these sequential rules inherit, or do not inherit, the properties of their local components. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

On both the side of physicians and patients, there could be promising channels for increasing immunization rates, but no attempt has yet been made to empirically unravel their respective influences. Using exclusion restrictions implied by an economic model of physician-patient interactions, our study quantifies the particular effects of supply and demand on influenza immunization. On the Supply side, our estimates highlight the importance of physician agency and physician quality, while a patient's education and health behaviors are key demand side factors.

This is because QALYs do not by themselves capture all criteria decision makers need to take into account. Other criteria Such as reducing inequalities, meeting national and local priorities and public acceptability also feature in the decision maker's utility function. Programme budgeting and marginal analysis (PBMA) is an established framework for systematic priority setting in which a 'weighted benefit score' for each option is calculated based oil all relevant decision-making criteria. Ranking options as a ratio of cost to benefit is desirable and necessary to ensure efficiency. In this paper we review a number of approaches to scoring costs and benefits of options in a PBMA context. Several approaches rank by benefit score alone, rather than efficiency (cost per unit of benefit). Of those that do rank by efficiency, we discuss the benefits and drawbacks. The optimal approach is far from clear, with each technique having its own strengths and weaknesses. A deliberative approach using summaries of costs and benefits of options as a basis for discussion may be preferable. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[Wilson, Edward C.

To undertake critical comparisons with alternative models based on the gamma and log-normal distributions. To demonstrate the effect of poorly fitting models on decision-making. The model has the process of hospital stay organized into Markov phases/states that describe stay in hospital before discharge to an absorbing state. Admission is via state 1 and discharge from this first state would correspond to a short stay, with transitions to later states corresponding to longer stays. The resulting phase-type probability distributions provide a flexible modeling framework for length-of-stay data which are known to be awkward and difficult to fit to other distributions. The dataset consisted of 1901 patients' lengths of stay and values for a number of covariates. The fitted model comprised six Markov phases, and provided a good fit to the data. Alternative gamma and log-normal models did not fit as well, gave different coefficient estimates, and statistical significance of covariate effects differed between the models. Models that fit should generally be preferred over those that do not, as they will produce more statistically reliable coefficient estimates. Poor coefficient estimates may mislead decision-makers by either understating or overstating the cost of some event or the cost savings from preventing that event. There is no obvious way of identifying a priori when coefficient estimates from poorly fitting models might be misleading.","[Graves, Nicholas] QUT, Inst Hlth & Biomed Innovat, Brisbane, Qld 4059, Australia; [Pettitt, Anthony] Univ Lancaster, Fylde Coll, Lancaster, England; [Graves, Nicholas] Princess Alexandra Hosp, Ctr Healthcare Related Infect Surveillance & Prev, Brisbane, Qld 4102, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Lancaster University,"Graves, N (通讯作者)，QUT, Inst Hlth & Biomed Innovat, 60 Musk Ave, Brisbane, Qld 4059, Australia.",n.graves@qut.edu.au,"Graves, Nicholas/A-3052-2011","Graves, Nicholas/0000-0002-5559-3267; Pettitt, Anthony/0000-0002-4816-4595",Queensland Health Quality Improvement and Enhancement Programme,Queensland Health Quality Improvement and Enhancement Programme,Source of financial support: This research was supported by the Queensland Health Quality Improvement and Enhancement Programme.,,20,83,99,0,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2009,12.0,2,,,,,309,314,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00421.x,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,408WY,20667062.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000263467500017,0

I find that immigrants with a BA degree did not experience any change in obesity as their stay in the US advanced. Obesity among those without a BA degree, however, increased with duration of stay. Similarly, while some ethnic groups experienced increase in obesity with duration, others did not. For those who experienced increase in obesity with duration, the rise was higher during the first five years of residence than later and greater for those who arrived at a relatively young age.

This analysis uses a reduced-form econometric model and a Unique Survey of community-resident dual enrollees to take a critical step toward understanding the relationships and combinations of state long-term care (LTC) policies and their relative effectiveness in achieving their intended effects: increasing access to care, improving activities of daily living/instrumental activities of daily living (ADL/IADL) assistance, and reducing unmet needs. We then simulate the effects of alternative policies to determine the most effective combination. The combination of policies that was most effective in reducing the percentage of individuals receiving low levels of assistance was high spending in the community relative to nursing home and low Community LTC spending per recipient; that is, spending more on community care and spreading it across more people. Overall, this analysis confirms that Medicaid LTC policy decisions by states, and the combinations of policies that are implemented, result in important variations in levels of assistance to elderly persons with disabilities.

Using U.S. longitudinal data from the National Long-Term Care Survey merged with Medicare claims and other data for 1985-2000, this study assesses whether tort reforms have reduced Medicare payments made on behalf of beneficiaries and the survival probability following an index event. Direct reforms (caps oil damages, abolition of punitive damages, eliminating mandatory prejudgment interest, and collateral source offset) did not significantly reduce payments for Medicare-covered services in any specification. indirect reforms (limitations on contingency fees, mandatory periodic payments, joint-and-several liability reform, and patient compensation funds) significantly reduced Medicare payments only in a specification based on any hospitalization, but not in analysis of hospitalization for each of four common chronic conditions. Neither direct nor indirect reforms had a significant effect on the health outcomes, with one exception. The overall conclusion is that tort reforms do not significantly affect medical decisions, nor do they have a systematic effect on patient outcomes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Three hundred thirty-one Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with usable data participated (mean age 64.7 years; 42.3% female; mean PD duration 8.5 years; HY, 1 to 5). Data quality (missing items < 10%), scale assumptions (item-total correlation = 0.43 - 0.71) and internal consistency of SCOPA-PS (Cronbach's alpha = 0.87; item homogeneity = 0.38) were satisfactory. Factor analysis suggested a unifactorial structure. High convergent validity was found for depression (r(S) = 0.61), anxiety (r(S) = 0.62), and health-related quality of life (r(S) = 0.82). Known-groups validity analyses indicated a gradual influence of severity category and disease duration on SCOPA-PS scores (P < 0.0001). SEM value was 8.24 (7 to 12 in previous studies). These magnitudes may be indicative of the threshold for a real change and a minimum important difference. The Latin American versions of the SCOPA-PS displayed appropriate psychometric attributes.","[Virues-Ortega, Javier; Martinez-Martin, Pablo] Inst Salud Carlos III, Ctr Nacl Epidemiol, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Carod-Artal, Francisco Javier] Sarah Brasilia Hosp, Dept Neurol, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Serrano-Duenas, Marcos] Pontif Catholic Univ Ecuador, Sch Med, Quito, Ecuador; [Ruiz-Galeano, Gabriela; Meza-Rojas, Gloria; Velazquez, Carolina] Cent Social Secur Hosp, Neuroctr, Asuncion, Paraguay; [Micheli, Federico] Jose de San Martin Clin Hosp, Dept Neurol, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Instituto de Salud Carlos III; Centro Nacional de Epidemiologia (CNE); Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Ecuador; University of Buenos Aires,"Virués-Ortega, J (通讯作者)，Inst Salud Carlos III, Ctr Nacl Epidemiol, C Sinesio Delgado 6, Madrid 28029, Spain.",jvirues@isciii.es,"Micheli, Federico E/A-8358-2012; Martinez-Martin, Pablo/E-1329-2013; Martinez-Martin, Pablo/N-9909-2019; Virues-Ortega, Javier/ADJ-8375-2022; Serrano-Duenas, Marcos/E-8845-2015","Martinez-Martin, Pablo/0000-0003-0837-5280; Virues-Ortega, Javier/0000-0003-1713-012X; Serrano-Duenas, Marcos/0000-0002-4496-6654",,,,,40,9,10,1,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2009,12.0,2,,,,,385,391,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00436.x,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,408WY,18657094.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000263467500027,0

Mostly serial ventilators are used to blow air through the layer of grain. Having variable aerodynamic resistance conditions, they are not sufficient for the air drying process. Using active airing method, grains are poured step by step into a granary to the certain limit, therefore aerodynamic resistance increases gradually. The way as the new ventilators are designed and operate under variable aerodynamic resistance conditions, static pressure of 3050 and 3300 Pa can be achieved which allows to dry grains from 8340 to 25000 kg using new ventilators during a given drying.

The main objectives of this study are to follow up the distribution of some heavy and major metals in aquatic plants in the four river Nile delta lakes namely Mariut Edku, Burullus and Manzala, die sites of the last Egyptian use of the Nile water before flowing to the Mediterranean sea. Many samples from these plants were collected then analyzed for Fe, Mn, Mg, Zn, Pb, Cd, Ni, Co, Cu, using atomic absorption spectrophotometeric technique. The bioaccumulation factor (BF) was applied on the results of analysis. Many plant species were found in the northern Nile delta lakes, Potamogeton crispus in Manzala lake; Ceratophillum demersum in Mariut and Edku, while the water hyacinth was found in Manzala, Edku and Mariut. Mariut lake was found to be very rich in phytoplankton abundance, though trace metals were also found to be higher than other stations. Distribution of measured metal concentrations in the different lakes reflect high content of most of these metals in Mariut compared with other lakes. Mariut lake is the most polluted lagoon in the Nile delta. Domestic pollution and heavy industry release large volumes of untreated waste, and an increasing load of agricultural runoff is introduced into the lake via canals and drains. The aquatic plants in the lake recorded elevated concentrations of Mn, Fe and Cu compared with all other measured metals. Appreciable amounts of Cd are accumulated in Ceratophillium demersum in Mariut lake. Mariut lake has become a hazard to the ecological equilibrium of the region and to the health of the inhabitants of the city and its environment because of its pollution.","[Soltan, M.

However, work with time-varying parameter models has largely involved vector autoregressions (VARs), ignoring cointegration. This is despite the fact that cointegration plays an important role in informing macroeconomists on a range of issues. In this paper, we develop a new time varying parameter model which permits cointegration. We use a specification which allows for the cointegrating space to evolve over time in a manner comparable to the random walk variation used with TVP-VARs. The properties of our approach are investigated before developing a method of posterior simulation. We use our methods in an empirical investigation involving the Fisher effect.

Findings indicate that diabetes, estimated wholly, is significantly detrimental to most labor market outcomes. However, separation of type I and II diabetes shows that much of the negative effect is due to type II diabetes. On average a female with type II diabetes can experience a wage penalty of almost 50% relative to a healthy individual. Additionally, estimates of specifically type II diabetes may be subject to endogeneity bias. To account for this, I utilize whether an individual's biological mother has been diagnosed with diabetes as an instrumental variable. This instrument provides both theoretical and statistical explanatory power to separate the causal effect of type II diabetes on labor-force decisions.

We exploit the lift of the abortion ban in December 1989, when communist dictator Ceausescu and his regime were removed from power, to understand its impact on children's health at birth and during early childhood and whether the lift of the ban had an immediate impact on child abandonment. We find insignificant estimates for health at birth outcomes and anthropometric z-scores at age 4 and 5, except for the probability of low birth weight which is slightly higher for children born after abortion became legal. Additionally, our findings suggest that the lift of the ban had decreased the number of abandoned children. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

For purposes of analyzing univariate and multivariate time series data, in particular, smooth transition regression (STR) models have been shown to be very useful for representing and capturing asymmetric behavior. Most SIR models have been applied to univariate processes, and have made a variety of assumptions, including stationary or cointegrated processes, uncorrelated, homoskedastic or conditionally heteroskedastic errors, and weakly exogenous regressors. Under the assumption of exogeneity, the standard method of estimation is nonlinear least squares. The primary purpose of this paper is to relax the assumption of weakly exogenous regressors and to discuss moment-based methods for estimating STR models. The paper analyzes the properties of the STR model with endogenous variables by providing a diagnostic test of linearity of the underlying process under endogeneity, developing an estimation procedure and a misspecification test for the SIR model, presenting the results of Monte Carlo simulations to show the usefulness of the model and estimation method, and providing an empirical application for inflation rate targeting in Brazil. We show that STR models with endogenous variables can be specified and estimated by a straightforward application of existing results in the literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

One explanation for these findings is that religion directly reduces risky behaviors because churches provide youths with moral guidance or with strong social networks that reinforce social norms. An alternative explanation is that both religious participation and risky health behaviors are driven by some common unobserved individual trait. We use data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and implement an instrumental variables approach to identify the effect of religious participation on smoking, binge drinking, and marijuana use. Following Gruber (2005), we use a county-level measure of religious market density as an instrument. We find that religious market density has a strong positive association with adolescent religious participation, but not with secular measures of social capital. Upon accounting for unobserved heterogeneity, we find that religious participation continues to have a significant negative effect on illicit drug use. On the contrary, the estimated effects of attendance in instrumental variables models of binge drinking and smoking are statistically imprecise.

The objective is to assess DIF and compare HRQOL between children with special health-care needs (CSHCN) and children without needs. Methods: Data were collected from 1195 families of children enrolled in Florida's public insurance programs. HRQOL was measured using physical, emotional, social, and school functioning of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL). We identified CSHCN using the CSHCN Screener and assessed DIF related to CSHCN using a multiple group-multiple indicators-multiple causes method (MG-MIMIC). We assessed the impact of DIF by examining expected item/test scores and item/test information function. We tested the discrepancy between underlying HRQOL scores of both groups before and after DIF calibration (allowing parameters of DIF items to be different and DIF-free items to be the same across both groups). Results: Two (25%) and three items (60%) of physical and school functioning, respectively, were identified with nonuniform DIF, and two items (40%) of social functioning were identified with uniform DIF. Expected item/test scores and item/test information function suggest that the impact of DIF is minimal. Before DIF calibration, HRQOL in CSHCN was more impaired than in children without needs (effect sizes -1.04, -0.74, -0.96, and -0.98 for physical, emotional, social, and school functioning, respectively). After DIF calibration, the discrepancy was increased slightly. Conclusions: Although 30% of items on the PedsQL were identified with DIF related to CSHCN status, the impact of DIF is minimal.","[Huang, I-Chan; Shenkman, Elizabeth A.] Univ Florida, Dept Hlth Outcomes & Policy, Coll Med, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA; [Huang, I-Chan; Shenkman, Elizabeth A.] Univ Florida, Inst Child Hlth Policy, Coll Med, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA; [Leite, Walter L.] Univ Florida, Dept Educ Psychol, Coll Educ, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA; [Shearer, Patricia] Univ Florida, Dept Pediat, Coll Med, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA; [Seid, Michael] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Pulm Med, Ctr Hlth Care Qual, Cincinnati, OH USA; [Seid, Michael] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Hlth Policy & Clin Effectiveness, Ctr Hlth Care Qual, Cincinnati, OH USA; [Revicki, Dennis A.] United BioSource Corp, Ctr Hlth Outcomes Res, Bethesda, MD USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center; Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center; United Biosource Corporation,"Huang, IC (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Dept Hlth Outcomes & Policy, Coll Med, POB 100147, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA.",ichuang@ufl.edu,,"Leite, Walter/0000-0001-7655-5668; Shenkman, Elizabeth/0000-0003-4903-1804",NIH/NICHD [K23 HD057146],NIH/NICHD(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),This study is supported in part by the grants of K23 HD057146 from the NIH/NICHD (I.-C.H.).,,58,18,20,0,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2011,14.0,6,,,,,872,883,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.03.004,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BJ,21914509.0,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299081600012,0

Since the weak topology is coarse, this requirement is a priori far from being negligible. In this work, we replace the assumption of weak continuity by monotonicity. More precisely, on the space of lotteries on an interval of the real line, it is shown that any affine preference order which is monotone with respect to the first stochastic order admits a representation in terms of an expected utility for some nondecreasing utility function. As a consequence, any affine preference order on the subset of lotteries with compact support, which is monotone with respect to the second stochastic order, can be represented in terms of an expected utility for some nondecreasing concave utility function. We also provide such representations for affine preference orders on the subset of those lotteries which fulfill some integrability conditions. The subtleties of the weak topology are illustrated by some examples. (C)2011 Elsevier B.V.

We compare monetary systems mediated by durable commodity monies, versus pure fiat monies, in order to understand the separation and eventual independence of the institutionally-created value of money from the values of underlying traded goods. We treat the emergence of monetary function as a problem in mechanism design, modeled by minimal strategic market games that overcome a generalized Jevons failure when agents must commit ahead of time to specialist resource production. We consider in particular the problem of defining closures with respect to both money flows and labor-allocation and trading decisions, and show that minimal models require many of the fundamental institutions of banking and contract enforcement found in real economies, in order to define a self-policing system. We define costs, value, and the efficiencies of the institutions that support trade in terms of a natural money-metric welfare function, and compare the characteristics of commodity and fiat monies by these measures. Through careful treatment of the stock/flow distinction in repeated-game settings, we find that commodity money, even when its value derives heavily from its institutional role, remains defined by its flow characteristics, in contrast to fiat money, for which the control function is defined inherently in terms of stock variables. Our notation is somewhat nonconventional for economics but to do justice to econo-physics concepts such as scaling and dimensional analysis and to stress the distinction between stocks and flows, we believe this notation is justified.

As the numbers of players involved in the finite games increase, the generated profiles will be asymptotically equilibrium. The converse of this result is also true, i.e., a mixed-strategy profile that is not an equilibrium for the nonatomic game will not be able to achieve the above asymptotic rationality for large finite games. The combined finding can be specialized to situations where the nonatomic game is anonymous and where the given equilibrium is pure. Besides their practical values, these results offer yet one more justification for the study of nonatomic games. They also suggest that efforts may be better spent on searching for mixed rather than pure equilibria of nonatomic games. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: One hundred seventy-two patients and 202 physicians were interviewed using a lupus nephritis decision board that describes the treatment options and their potential benefits and risks. Clinical and sociodemographic variables were collected. Participants were asked to indicate their preferred treatment and provide justification for their choice. Descriptive statistics, t tests, and Pearson's chi-square tests were used to determine the significance of differences in the decisions made by the two groups. A logistic regression model determined which factors contributed to treatment decisions. Results: The average age of study participants was 34 +/- 8 years for patients and 31 +/- 7 years for physicians. Sixty-eight percent of patients and 96% of physicians (P < 0.001) selected the oral option. Patients and physicians justified their choice of treatment using different arguments (P < 0.001 in each case). Logistic regression showed that risk potential (P < 0.001) and a history of joint involvement (P = 0.011) were the arguments used most often to explain a patient's decision and the risk of side effects was most relevant among physicians (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Using a decision board, patients and physicians were found to have different preferences for treatment when faced with the same treatment options. Further, the variables that influence their preferences are different.","[de Abreu, Mirhelen Mendes] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Med, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil; [Gafni, Amiran] McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Ferraz, Marcos Bosi] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos; McMaster University; Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP),"de Abreu, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Med, Km 235 SP 310, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.",mirhelen@ufscar.br,,,Sao Paulo Research Foundation (Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo),Sao Paulo Research Foundation (Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo),Sao Paulo Research Foundation (Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo).,,45,1,1,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2011,14.0,5,,S,,,S141,S146,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.05.015,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BE,21839889.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299081000032,0

Methods: A health state-transition model was developed to estimate the incremental costs and effectiveness of capecitabine versus 5-FU/LV. The time horizons studied were: treatment duration (24 weeks) plus 36 months, 48 months, 60 months, 120 months, and lifetime. Costs were expressed in Taiwanese new dollars (NT$). Clinical outcomes, medical resource use, and utilities were extracted from published sources. Unit costs were estimated from BNHI fee schedules, published sources, and local expert opinion. Outcomes and future costs were discounted at 3%. Cost-effectiveness was expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life-month (QALM). The effects of uncertainty were explored through a one-way sensitivity analysis. Results: For the 24-week time period, drug acquisition costs were higher for capecitabine than 5-FU/LV (NT$114,405 vs. NT$4,904 per patient); however, these were offset by the higher administration costs of 5-FU/LV (NT$2,573 vs. NT$204,201 per patient). Overall direct costs for the 24-week treatment period were less with capecitabine than 5-FU/LV (NT$129,327 vs. NT$233,873 per patient). Cost savings with capecitabine were also evident when longer time horizons were considered. Over a lifetime, the projected survival benefit for capecitabine was 7 QALMs. Conclusions: From the perspectives of the BNHI and society in Taiwan, capecitabine not only saves costs but also improves health outcomes compared with 5-FU/LV in the adjuvant treatment of stage III colon cancer.","[Hsu, Tzu-Chi] Mackay Mem Hosp, Taipei, Taiwan; [Hsu, Tzu-Chi] Taipei Med Univ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chen, Hong-Hwa] Chang Gung Univ, Coll Med, Kaohsiung Med Ctr, Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Yang, Ming-Chin] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Publ Hlth, Coll Publ Hlth, Taipei 10764, Taiwan; [Yang, Ming-Chin] Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Publ Hlth, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, Taipei 10764, Taiwan; [Wang, Hwei-Ming] Taichung Vet Gen Hosp, Taichung, Taiwan; [Chuang, Jye-Hann] Kaohsiung Med Univ, Chung Ho Mem Hosp, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Jao, Shu-Wen] Natl Def Med Ctr, Taipei, Taiwan; [Jao, Shu-Wen] Triserv Gen Hosp, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chiang, Hsin-Chieh] Taipei Coll Maritime Technol, Dept Leisure & Tourism, Taipei, Taiwan; [Wen, Chung-Yu; Tseng, Jen-Hao] Roche Prod Ltd, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chen, Li-Tzong] Natl Hlth Res Inst, Natl Inst Canc Res, Tainan, Taiwan",Mackay Memorial Hospital; Taipei Medical University; Chang Gung Memorial Hospital; Chang Gung University; National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University; Taichung Veterans General Hospital; Kaohsiung Medical University; Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital; National Defense Medical Center; Tri-Service General Hospital; Roche Holding; National Health Research Institutes - Taiwan,"Chen, LT (通讯作者)，367 Sheng Li Rd, Tainan 70465, Taiwan.",leochen@nhri.org.tw,"Chen, Li-Tzong/D-2071-2010","YANG, MING-CHIN/0000-0001-7326-8671","Roche Products Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan","Roche Products Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan","Source of financial support: Roche Products Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan.",,21,11,11,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2011,14.0,5,,,,,647,651,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.01.010,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BG,21839401.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299081300004,0

Irrespective of relative country sizes, ER by country H harms country F. Our model is inspired by the wide European experience with this cost-containment policy. Namely, in Europe, drug authorization and price negotiations are carried out by separate agencies. We confirm our main results in two extensions.

Specifically, choice probabilities are given by preference functional differences (given by expected utility, rank-dependent utility, etc.) embedded in cumulative distribution functions. This approach has a problem: Estimated utility function parameters meant to represent agents' degree of risk aversion in the sense of Pratt (1964) do not imply a suggested stochastically more risk averse relation within such models.

Realistic modeling of data revisions is required to guide decision makers in their assessment of current and future conditions. This paper provides a new framework with which to model data revisions. Recent empirical work suggests that measurement errors typically have much more complex dynamics than existing models of data revisions allow. This paper describes a state-space model that allows for richer dynamics in these measurement errors, including the noise, news and spillover effects documented in this literature. We also show how to relax the common assumption that true values are observed after a few revisions. The result is a unified and flexible framework that allows for more realistic data revision properties, and allows the use of standard methods for optimal real-time estimation of trends and cycles. We illustrate the application of this framework with real-time data on US real output growth. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Jacobs, Jan P. A.

Each agent falls in one of two distinct categories: either he (a) has a complete ordinal ranking over the set of individual objects, or (b) has a set of plausible benchmark von Neumann-Morgenstern (vNM) utility functions in whose positive span his true utility is known to lie. An allocation is undominated if there does not exist a preference-compatible profile of vNM utilities at which it is Pareto dominated by another feasible allocation. Given an undominated allocation, we use the tools of linear duality theory to construct a profile of vNM utilities at which it is ex-ante welfare maximizing. A finite set of preference-compatible vNM utility profiles is exhibited such that every undominated allocation is ex-ante welfare maximizing with respect to at least one of them. Given an arbitrary allocation, we provide an interpretation of the constructed vNM utilities as subgradients of a function which measures worst-case domination. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Divisia monetary aggregate growth rates were generally lower than simple-sum aggregate growth rates in the period preceding the Great Moderation, and higher since the mid 1980s.

Results suggest one would generally not weight QALYs, except in a small number of specific cases and in those cases the weights are relatively small.

The system is modelled as a two-dimensional Markov process presented by a state transition diagram and a finite system of linear equations that describes the behaviour of the system in steady state. The steady state probabilities are obtained by numerical solving by means of Matlab. On the basis of the steady state probabilities we can compute several performance measures. The mathematical model is supported by a coloured Petri net model in order to validate the analytical outcomes.

These linguistic expressions can be interpreted as values of linguistic variables representing the characteristics of interest. The classes may be denoted by numbers, usually integers. A fuzzy classification system can then be described by means of a rule base in the following way. On the left-hand side of each rule, there is a combination of values of linguistic variables that defines a particular class. The integer-valued variable, which identifies the same class, is on the right-hand side. For any object described by values of its characteristics, its assignment to a class is determined by correspondence between these values and the left-hand sides of the rules. The output of the fuzzy classification system depends on whether the numeric class identifiers form a nominal, ordinal, or even cardinal scale. In case of a nominal scale, there is no sense in applying any arithmetic operations on class identifiers. The result is processed into information whether the object can be clearly classified or not. If the numeric class identifiers form a uniform cardinal evaluating scale, it is meaningful to perform calculations whose result can be the location of an object in between two classes. In both these cases, a verbal description of the result is desirable.

A one-year field trial was established with the vine variety Ryzlink vlassky (Riesling italico) to evaluate the effect of spring soil applications and 5x repeated foliar application of magnesium. On light soil of the experimental locality Zabcice (ca 25 km south of Brno) visual symptoms of Mg deficiency on vine leaves had been monitored in the past. There were 7 treatments of magnesium fertilization: 1) magnesium non-fertilized control samples; 2) autumn soil application of Kieserit; 3) autumn soil application of Kieserit + 5x foliar application of Epso Combitop solution; 4) spring soil application of Kieserit; 5) spring soil application of Kieserit + 5x foliar application of Epso Combitop solution; 6) 5x foliar application of 5% Epso Combitop solution; 7) 5x foliar application of 5% Epso Top solution. One dose of magnesium was applied for soil fertilisation. Foliar nutrition was applied 5x after the fall of blossoms from late June to early August in intervals of 7-10 days. In terms of quality the grapes were analyzed for the content of sugar, titratable acids and pH. The contents of Mg and S were usually increasing after application of fertilizers. After the foliar application the content of Mn increased 5-7 times and the content of Zn 2-3 times. Grape yields (t.ha(-1)) in treatments 1-7 were the following: 7.04-8.25 t.ha(-1), respectively. All variants with soil application of Kieserit showed a conclusive increase of yield compared to nonfertilized control and foliar application itself as well. The content of sugar (16.4-18.5 degrees NM), titratable acids (11.34-13.25 g.l(-1)) and the pH of must (3.02-3.11) did not differ among the treatments. From results of the one-year trial we concluded that foliar application significantly affected the chemical composition of leaves. Soil application and uptake of nutrients by vine roots is decisive for the macronutrients. Foliar application is a supplementary source.","[Zatloukalova, A.; Losak, T.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Zatloukalová, A (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",andrea.zatloukalova@mendelu.cz,,,,,,,18,0,0,1,11,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-563-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,195,203,,,,,,9,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2HX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341783400020,0

Methods: The basis for the modeling techniques is reviewed. For many health-care decisions, existing data are insufficient to fully inform them, necessitating the use of modeling to estimate the consequences that are relevant to decision-makers. These models must reflect what is known about the problem at a level of detail sufficient to inform the questions. Oversimplification will result in estimates that are not only inaccurate, but potentially misleading. Results: Markov cohort models, though currently popular, have so many limitations and inherent assumptions that they are inadequate to inform most health-care decisions. An event-based individual simulation offers an alternative much better suited to the problem. A properly designed discrete event simulation provides more accurate, relevant estimates without being computationally prohibitive. It does require more data and may be a challenge to convey transparently, but these are necessary trade-offs to provide meaningful and valid results. Conclusion: In our opinion, discrete event simulation should be the preferred technique for health economic evaluations today.","[Caro, Jaime J.] McGill Univ, Dept Epidemiol Biostat & Occupat Hlth, Div Gen Internal Med, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Caro, Jaime J.] United BioSource Corp, Lexington, MA USA; [Moeller, Joergen] UnitedBioSource Corp, Eslov, Sweden; [Getsios, Denis] UnitedBioSource Corp, Halifax, NS, Canada",McGill University; United Biosource Corporation,"Caro, JJ (通讯作者)，430 Bedford St, Lexington, MA 02420 USA.",jaime.caro@mcgill.ca,,"Moller, Jorgen/0000-0002-8194-864X; Caro, Jaime/0000-0001-5470-3754",,,,,14,80,98,0,22,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2010,13.0,8,,,,,1056,1060,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00775.x,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,691FR,20825626.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285066200025,0

The objective of this review was to systematically assess the methods of resource use data collection and costing; and to produce a best practice guide for data capture within economic analyses alongside clinical trials. Methods: All 100 HTA-funded primary research papers published to June 2009 were reviewed for the health economic methods employed. Data were extracted and summarized by: health technology assessed, costing perspective adopted, evidence of planning and piloting, data collection method, frequency of data collection, and sources of unit cost data. Results: Ninety-five studies were identified as having conducted an economic analysis, of which 85 recorded patient-level resource use. The review identified important differences in how data are collected. These included: a priori evidence of analysts having identified important cost drivers; the piloting and validation of patient-completed resource use questionnaires; choice of costing perspective; and frequency of data collection. Areas of commonality included: the extensive use of routine medical records and reliance on patient recall; and the use of standard sources of unit costs. Conclusion: Economic data collection is variable, even among a homogeneous selection of trials designed to meet the needs of a common organization (NHS). Areas for improvement have been identified, and based on our findings and related reviews and guidelines, a checklist is proposed for good practice relating to economic data collection within clinical trials.","[Hughes, Dyfrig A.] Bangor Univ, Ctr Econ & Policy Hlth, Inst Med & Social Care Res, Bangor LL57 1UT, Gwynedd, Wales",Bangor University,"Hughes, DA (通讯作者)，Bangor Univ, Ctr Econ & Policy Hlth, Inst Med & Social Care Res, Dean St, Bangor LL57 1UT, Gwynedd, Wales.",d.a.hughes@bangor.ac.uk,"Hughes, Dyfrig/H-5252-2012","Hughes, Dyfrig/0000-0001-8247-7459","Medical Research Council; Medical Research Council [G0800792, UD99999939] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [G0800792] Funding Source: UKRI",Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"Funded by the Medical Research Council, as part of the North West Hub for Trial Methodology Research.",,41,68,69,0,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2010,13.0,8,,,,,867,872,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00788.x,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,691FR,20946187.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285066200003,0

Sequential binary models with or without normal random effects are an example of such models that can be adopted to estimate discrete duration models with unobserved heterogeneity. But an easy-to-implement estimation may incur a cost. In this paper we conduct a Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the consequences of omitting or misspecifying the unobserved heterogeneity distribution in single-spell discrete duration models.

Method: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a probabilistic decision-analytic model and publicly available data. We adopted a societal perspective. Health gains were measured in terms of quality-adjusted life-years. Costs include those associated with awareness raising, enforcement and the welfare loss associated with the reduction in cellular phone use, less savings in health care and other costs associated with automobile accidents. Results: A ban promotes health and releases resources worth more than the costs. There is an 80% chance that a ban will be 'cost saving', and a 94% chance that a ban will cost less than Can$50 000/QALY. The results are sensitive to the additional risk posed by cellular phone use while driving, and the rate and pattern with which drivers comply with a ban. Conclusion: Under our base line assumptions a cellular phone ban is likely to be cost saving from a societal perspective. The results are sensitive to parameters for which there is very little information or for which the available information is contradictory.

Results: The results of the study showed that the scale is unidimentional, and each item measures a different level of patient anxiety. The rating scale operated well and item and person reliability was good. Furthermore, principal-components analysis of the residuals confirmed the scale measures a unitary concept. A scoring key was generated to allow conversion of raw scores to a continuous measurement. Conclusion: The 6-item Spielberger State Anxiety Scale is shorter than the original version and has good psychometric properties. This would suggest the scale is a valid alternative to the full version for use in primary health-care practice and research.","[Court, Helen] Cardiff Univ, Sch Optometry & Vis Sci, Cardiff CF24 4LU, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,"Court, H (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Sch Optometry & Vis Sci, Cardiff CF24 4LU, S Glam, Wales.",waltersh1@cardiff.ac.uk,"Greenland, Katy/AAW-8225-2020","Greenland, Katy/0000-0003-0096-2851; Margrain, Tom/0000-0003-1280-0809; Court, Helen/0000-0002-3758-7998","Cardiff University; Bausch and Lomb, Ltd.","Cardiff University; Bausch and Lomb, Ltd.","This study was supported by Cardiff University and a grant from Bausch and Lomb, Ltd.",,47,26,31,2,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2010,13.0,6,,,,,813,819,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00758.x,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,648BZ,20561315.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000281666700016,0

We investigate unconstrained estimation, estimation imposing the unit root constraint, pre-test estimation, model selection estimation, and model average estimation. We find that the asymptotic risk depends only on the local-to-unity parameter, facilitating simple graphical comparisons. Our results strongly caution against pre-testing. Strong evidence supports averaging based on Mallows weights. In particular, our Mallows averaging method has uniformly and substantially smaller risk than the conventional unconstrained estimator, and this holds for autoregressive roots far from unity. Our averaging estimator is a new approach to forecast combination. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It examines the extent to which real house prices at the State level are driven by fundamentals such as real per capita disposable income, as well as by common shocks, and determines the speed of adjustment of real house prices to macroeconomic and local disturbances. We take explicit account of both cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity. This allows us to find a cointegrating relationship between real house prices and real per capita incomes with coefficients (1, -1), as predicted by the theory. We are also able to identify a significant negative effect for a net borrowing cost variable, and a significant positive effect for the State level population growth on changes in real house prices. Using this model we then examine the role of spatial factors, in particular, the effect of contiguous states by use of a weighting matrix. We are able to identify a significant spatial effect, even after controlling for State specific real incomes, and allowing for a number of unobserved common factors. We do, however, find evidence of departures from long run equilibrium in the housing markets in a number of States notably California, New York, Massachusetts, and to a lesser extent Connecticut, Rhode Island, Oregon and Washington State.

Methods: Decision analytic modeling was used to synthesize mortality and morbidity data from three randomized controlled trials, the Total Body Hypothermia for Neonatal Encephalopathy Trial (TOBY), National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), and CoolCap trials. Cost data inputs were informed by TOBY, the sole source of prospectively collected resource utilization data for encephalopathic infants. CE was expressed in terms of incremental cost per disability-free life year (DFLY) gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to generate CE acceptability curves (CEACs). Results: Cooling led to a cost increase of 3787 pound (95% confidence interval [CI]: -2516, 12,360) (5115; 95% CI: -3398-16,694; US$5344; 95% CI: -3598, 26,356; using 2006 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) purchasing power parities) and a DFLY gain of 0.19 (95%CI: 0.07-0.31) over the first 18 months after birth. The incremental cost per DFLY gained was 19,931 pound (26,920; US$28,124). The baseline CEAC showed that if decision-makers are willing to pay 30,000 pound for an additional DFLY, there is a 69% probability that cooling is cost-effective. The probability of CE exceeded 99% at this threshold when the throughput of infants was increased to reflect the national incidence of neonatal encephalopathy or when the time horizon of the economic evaluation was extended to 18 years after birth. Conclusions: The probability that cooling is a cost-effective treatment for neonatal encephalopathy is finely balanced over the first 18 months after birth but increases substantially when national incidence data or an extended time horizon are considered.","[Regier, Dean A.; Petrou, Stavros; Henderson, Jane; Eddama, Oya; Patel, Nishma; Strohm, Brenda; Brocklehurst, Peter] Univ Oxford, Natl Perinatal Epidemiol Unit, Oxford OX3 7LF, Oxfordshire, England; [Regier, Dean A.] Univ Oxford Somerville Coll, Oxford OX2 6HD, England; [Petrou, Stavros] Univ Oxford, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Oxford, England; [Edwards, A.

We consider both the uncensored and censored duration cases. The asymptotic null distribution of the LR test statistic is not the standard chi-square, as the standard regularity conditions do not hold. Instead, there is a nuisance parameter identified only under the alternative, and a null parameter value on the boundary of the parameter space, as in Cho and White (2007a). We accommodate these and provide methods delivering consistent asymptotic critical values. We conduct a number of Monte Carlo simulations, comparing the level and power of the LR test statistic to an information matrix (IM) test due to Chesher (1984) and Lagrange multiplier (LM) tests of Kiefer ( 1985) and Sharma ( 1987). Our simulations show that the LR test statistic generally outperforms the IM and LM tests. We also revisit the work of van den Berg and Ridder (1998) on unemployment durations and of Ghysels et al.

From April 2009, generic (EQ-5D) and condition-specific PROMs are being collected from patients before and after four surgical procedures; eventually this will be extended to include a wide range of other NHS services. The aim of this article is to report analysis of the EQ-5D data generated from a pilot study commissioned by the DH and to consider the implications for the use of EQ-5D data in performance indicators and measures of patient benefit. We present two new methods that we have developed for analysing and displaying EQ-5D profile data: a Paretian Classification of Health Change and a health profile grid. We show that EQ-5D profile data can be readily analysed to generate insights into the nature of changes in patient-reported health that would be obscured by summarising these profiles by their index scores, or focusing just on the post operative outcomes. Our methods indicate differences between providers and between sub-groups of patients. Our results also show striking differences in changes in EQ-5D profiles between surgical procedures, which require further investigation.

Instead of specifying a particular distribution for the return innovation, nonparametric Bayesian methods are used to flexibly model the skewness and kurtosis of the distribution while the dynamics of volatility continue to be modeled with a parametric structure. Our semiparametric Bayesian approach provides a full characterization of parametric and distributional uncertainty. A Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling approach to estimation is presented with theoretical and computational issues for simulation from the posterior predictive distributions.

The present study was designed to capture UK (English and Scottish) preference weights for the process of undergoing infusion therapy and the likely outcomes of treatment for children (8-12 years), adolescents (13-17 years), and adults. Methods: Vignette descriptions of T1DM health states (describing infusion therapy and reduced insulin need) were constructed based on qualitative interviews with people with type 1 diabetes, clinicians and findings from a literature review. Utilities were elicited for each health state using the standard gamble interview from the general public, adults with diabetes, and parents of children with diabetes. Participants also completed other outcome measures-EQ-5D, Pediatric Quality-of-Life Inventory, and Hyperglycemic Fear Survey. Mixed model analyseswere used to estimate the influence on utility of different participant characteristics. Results: Self-report questionnaires indicated the nature and degree of impact of T1DM on adults', adolescents', and children's quality of life, with adolescents reporting the lowest health-related quality-of-life profile of all groups. The mixed model analysis indicated that each health state was a significant predictor of utility and the T1DM participants gave significantly higher utilities compared with the general public (P = 0.02). Conclusion: The general public and people with diabetes (or parents of children with diabetes) all place significant value on reducing the need for insulin injections; also, all recognize the disutility of undergoing infusion cycles. These values are suitable for supporting estimates of cost-effectiveness of infusion therapies in T1DM.","[Lloyd, Andrew; Swinburn, Paul] Oxford Outcomes Ltd, Oxford, England; [Boye, Kristina S.; Curtis, Bradley; Sarpong, Eric] Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA; [Goldsmith, Kim] Univ Cambridge, MRC, Biostat Unit, Cambridge, England; [Bode, Bruce] Atlanta Diabet Associates, Atlanta, GA USA; [Aronoff, Stephen] Endocrine Associates, Dallas, TX USA",Eli Lilly; MRC Biostatistics Unit; University of Cambridge,"Lloyd, A (通讯作者)，Seacourt Tower,West Way, Oxford OX2 0JJ, England.",andrew.lloyd@oxfordoutcomes.com,"Goldsmith, Kimberley/B-9107-2011","Goldsmith, Kimberley/0000-0002-0620-7868",Eli Lilly and Company; Macrogenics,Eli Lilly and Company(Eli Lilly); Macrogenics,"A.L., and PS were both employees of Oxford Outcomes Ltd when this project was undertaken.

In sharp contrast with commonly used specifications, ours is invariant with respect to the choice of a baseline alternative for utility differencing. It also nests these standard models as special cases, allowing for data-based selection of the baseline alternatives for the latter. Likelihood evaluation is achieved under an Efficient Importance Sampling (EIS) version of the standard GHK algorithm. Several simulation experiments highlight identification, estimation and pretesting within the new class of multinomial multiperiod probit models. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We analyse the situation in Belgium, a country with a very broad coverage in compulsory social health insurance and where supplemental insurance mainly refers to extra-billing in hospitals. Within this institutional background, we find only weak evidence of adverse selection in the coverage of supplemental health insurance. We find much stronger effects of socio-economic background. We estimate a bivariate probit model and cannot reject the assumption of exogeneity of insurance availability for the explanation of health-care use. A count model for hospital care shows that supplemental insurance has no significant effect on the number of spells, but a negative effect on the number of nights per spell. We comment on the implications of our findings for equality of access to health care in Belgium.

Until now, it remains unclear if the respondent group has an influence on the values obtained. We assessed this issue through meta-analysis. Methods: A literature search was performed for studies reporting valuations given by patients and nonpatients. Studies using indirect utility instruments were excluded. Results: From 30 eligible studies, 40 estimators were retrieved revealing a difference between respondent group (Cohen's d = 0.20, P < 0.01). When elicitation methods were analyzed separately, patients gave higher valuations than nonpatients using the time trade-off (TTO) (N = 25, unstandardized d = 0.05, P < 0.05) and the visual analog scale (VAS) (N = 22, unstandardized d = 0.04, P < 0.05). When the standard gamble was used, no difference was seen (N = 24, unstandardized d = 0.01, P = 0.70). Conclusion: In contrast with Dolders et al., our results show that patients give higher valuations than members of the general public.

These attribute levels in each choice situation are determined by an underlying experimental design. Often, an orthogonal design is used, although recent studies have shown that better experimental designs exist, such as efficient designs. These designs provide more reliable parameter estimates. However, they require prior information about the parameter values, which is often not readily available. Serial efficient designs are proposed in this paper in which the design is updated during the survey. In contrast to adaptive conjoint, serial conjoint only changes the design across respondents, not within-respondent thereby avoiding endogeneity bias as much as possible. After each respondent, new parameters are estimated and used as priors for generating a new efficient design. Results using the multinomial logit model show that using such a serial design, using zero initial prior values, provides the same reliability of the parameter estimates as the best efficient design (based on the true parameters). Any possible bias can be avoided by using an orthogonal design for the first few respondents. Serial designs do not suffer from misspecification of the priors as they are continuously updated. The disadvantage is the extra implementation cost of an automated parameter estimation and design generation procedure in the survey. Also, the respondents have to be surveyed in mostly serial fashion instead of all parallel.","[Bliemer, Michiel C.

The aim of this study was to categorize crowding of dairy cows and to give answer about its duration throughout the year, but also to provide milk production characteristic before and during the crowding period. Cows were housed in cubicles. For the aim of this study we calculated the differences between daily milk yields of June 1, compared to July 1, August 1, September 1 and October 1. Cows were divided by the stage of lactation on 3 groups (first: cows on II, second: cows on III and third: cows on IV lactation + higher lact. up to 7th), with 32.7 +/- 10 cows in each. In the beginning of experiment (June 1) 55% of cows were up to 100 days of lactation, 31% from 100-200 days and 14% >200 days. The cows were monitored with two outdoor network cameras (VIVOTEK technology, IP7330 and PZ6122) from July 2 (approximately 10 days before crowding started) to October 15 (7 days after crowding stop), total of 106 days. We take the snapshots at 14 p. m., because was found that in this period of the day, the crowding if there it is any is always present. To assess the severity of crowding behavior and its characteristics, we developed a scale based to available space per cow and usage of it. We found that in period from July 2, to October 15, 2009 were 84 days when cows were crowded. First crowding was determined at July 11. After that, crowding was almost permanently present until October 8, with shorter breaks. There was found an evident drop in daily mil production after crowding started. Crowding phenomena strongly affects cow's behaviour in one part of the day during summer period. Crowding of dairy cows could contribute to decreasing of milk production and negatively affect comfort of cows.","[Erbez, M.; Falta, D.; Chladek, G.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Breeding, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Erbez, M (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Breeding, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",miljanerbez@gmail.com,"Chládek, Gustav/K-3994-2018; Falta, Daniel/AAT-9509-2020; Falta, Daniel/J-5001-2018","Chládek, Gustav/0000-0002-4223-0934; Falta, Daniel/0000-0002-7679-923X; Falta, Daniel/0000-0002-7679-923X",,,,,8,1,1,0,4,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-453-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,247,252,,,,,,6,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2IA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341786800030,0

To contribute to decision-making process where to establish the plantations we evaluated the water consumption and its relation to biomass yields of poplar hybrid clone (Populus nigra x P. maximowiczii) in representative conditions for Czech-Moravian Highlands. Water availability is usually considered as the main constraint of well profiting SRC culture and therefore we focused on analyzing the linkage between the aboveground biomass increments and the total stand evapotranspiration (ET) and thus on so called water use efficiency (WUE). During the seasons 2008 and 2009 the total stand ET measured by Bowen ratio system constructed above poplar canopy and the stem diameter increments of randomly chosen sample trees were examined. The stem diameters were subsequently converted to total above ground biomass by allometric equation obtained by destructive analysis at the beginning of 2010. The biomass volume and its increment of particular trees were subsequently transformed to the whole canopy growth and correlated with the ET values. Our results revealed that there was a statistically significant relation between water lost and biomass growth with coefficients of determination r(2) 0.96 and 0.57 in 2008 and 2009 respectively. The dynamic of seasonal WUE varied from 4 to 0 g kg(-1) and from 6 to 0 g kg(-1) with means 2.8 and 3.4 g kg(-1) in both executed years respectively. These values are comparable with other broadleaved tree species of temperate climate zone and suggest that economically profitable plantation (defined by yield at least in the range of 10 - 12 Mg ha(-1) year-1 of dry matter content) will consume more than 400 - 450 mm per year and thus will demand a locality with higher and adequately temporally distributed amount of precipitation especially in rain feed areas such as the discussed Czech-Moravian Highlands.,"[Fischer, M.; Trnka, M.; Zalud, Z.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrosyst & Bioclimatol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Kucera, J.] Environm Measuring Sys, Brno, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Fischer, M (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrosyst & Bioclimatol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",fischer.milan@gmail.com,"Fischer, Milan/H-3996-2014; Fischer, Milan/GXZ-9833-2022; Zalud, Zdenek/G-3203-2014; Trnka, Miroslav/F-9428-2014","Zalud, Zdenek/0000-0003-1882-9901; Trnka, Miroslav/0000-0003-4727-8379",,,,,25,1,1,0,6,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-453-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,25,33,,,,,,9,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2IA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341786800002,0

While previous studies demonstrated that GDL reduces teenage involvement in fatal crashes, much remains unanswered. We explore the mechanisms through which GDL influences accident rates as well as its long term effectiveness on teen driving. In particular, we investigate: (1) whether GDL policies improve teenage driving behavior, or simply reduce teenage prevalence on the roads; (2) whether GDL exposed teens become better drivers in later years. We employ a unique data source, the State Data System, which contains all police reported accidents (fatal and non-fatal) during 1990-2005 for 12 states. We estimate a structural model that separately identifies GDL's effect on relative teenage prevalence and relative teenage riskiness. Identification of the model is driven by the relative numbers of crashes between two teenagers, two adults, or a teenager and an adult. We find that the GDL policies reduce the number of 15-17-year-old accidents by limiting the amount of teenage driving rather than by improving teenage driving. This prevalence reduction primarily occurs at night and stricter GDL policies, especially those with night-time driving restrictions, are the most effective. Finally, we find that teen driving quality does not improve ex post GDL exposure. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

I study the relatively recent construction of the Isthmian nation of Panama as an ecotourism destination. Not until recently has tourism been important to Panama. Former President Guillermo Endara (1990-1994) declared tourism a national priority that would contribute to the country's economic development; subsequent administrations (particularly the administration of Ernesto Perez Balladares, 1994-1999) focused on two particular types of tourism, namely heritage tourism and ecotourism. Heritage-based tourism exploits Panama's environmental and cultural diversity, according all minorities (Afro-Antilleans and indigenous peoples in particular) greater symbolic capital than they previously enjoyed. Based on long-term ethnographic research in the Archipelago of Bocas del Toro (province of Bocas del Toro), I address the ways in which Afro-Antilleans are producing ecotourism destinations, and as a result, maintaining, rejecting, marginalizing, replacing, and reinventing behaviors, images, and beliefs associated with their heritage. I specifically focus on the transformations that have taken place among Afro-Antilleans in regard to hunting and consumption of endangered species [particularly leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea), hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) and green turtles (Chelonia midias)] - a practiced rendered traditional by this ethnic group-as a direct result of ecotourism development in the region.","[Montero, C.

The biggest losses are caused in strawberry production (anthracnose of strawberry) in Central Europe and Colletotrichum acutatum has become the most important pathogen of safflower recently. The aim of work was the assessment of the virulence of Colletotrichum acutatum isolates obtained from different host plants to young plants of two varieties of safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L) and ripe fruits of two strawberry varieties (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.). Conventional PCR using specific primers Col1, Col2, CaInt2 and ITS4 was demonstrated that selected isolates belong to the species Colletotrichum acutatum and the specific differences between isolates was detected. Among the various varieties of safflower was not shown a statistical difference. The most important virulence to experimental plants of both varieties had isolate 1209, isolate thus obtained from safflower. Ripe fruits of variety Pegasus of strawberry were more susceptible to Colletotichum acutatum than fruits of variety Elkas. Isolate 710, isolated from Hypericum perforatum L., showed the highest virulence in terms of the index of infection intensity. The frequency of infection of strawberry fruits almost always reached 100%, which led to the conclusion that the strawberry fruits were sensitive to selected isolates of the pathogen significantly. We proved that isolates of pathogen had different virulence to different plant species.","[Stankova, B.; Vichova, J.; Pokorny, R.; Hrudova, E.; Holkova, L.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Crop Sci Breeding & Plant Med, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Stanková, B (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Crop Sci Breeding & Plant Med, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",Stankova.b@seznam.cz,"Hrudova, Eva/K-9853-2018; Jilkova, Barbora/AAO-4346-2021; Hrudova, Eva/AFL-2479-2022; Holková, Ludmila/J-9839-2018; Vichova, Jana/K-9226-2018","Jilkova, Barbora/0000-0002-0502-2028; Hrudova, Eva/0000-0002-1017-9628; Vichova, Jana/0000-0002-2394-0439",,,,,9,0,0,0,2,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-453-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,137,145,,,,,,9,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2IA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341786800016,0

The methodology used to gather primary data between October and December 2007 on the preferred scale of heritage tourism development included questionnaire survey of household heads, in-depth interviews with traditional authorities and opinion leaders, and focus group discussions with the youth and market women. The results show that due to the characteristics of heritage tourism development in the community, residents favour large-scale tourism development, though in a better managed way. Residents perceived both positive and negative impacts of tourism development-socio-economic benefits being considered the most significant indicator of large-scale development. The study then discusses the shortcomings of this short-term approach and suggests that this short term view of 'gain' might be overcome through a greater understanding of how residents interact with the urban environment and its heritage resources.","[Yankholmes, A.

However, previous non- and semi-parametric approaches to the estimation of consumer demand systems do not give estimators that are restricted to satisfy this condition, nor do they offer powerful tests of this restriction. We use nonparametric modeling to test and impose Slutsky symmetry in a system of expenditure share equations over prices and expenditure. In this context, Slutsky symmetry is a set of nonlinear cross-equation restrictions on levels and derivatives of consumer demand equations. The key insight is that due to the differing convergence rates of levels and derivatives and due to the fact that the symmetry restrictions are linear in derivatives, both the test and the symmetry restricted estimator behave asymptotically as if these restrictions were (locally) linear. We establish large and finite sample properties Of Our methods, and show that our test has advantages over the only other comparable test. All methods we propose are implemented with Canadian micro-data. We find that our nonparametric analysis yields statistically significantly and qualitatively different results from traditional parametric estimators and tests. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Our analysis incorporated new findings on vaccine herd protective effects. Methods: Using data from Matlab, Bangladesh, Kolkata, India, North Jakarta, Indonesia, and Beira, Mozambique, we calculated the net public cost per disability-adjusted life year avoided for three immunization strategies: 1) school-based vaccination of children 5 to 14 years of age; 2) school-based vaccination of school children plus use of the schools to vaccinate children aged 1 to 4 years; and 3) community-based vaccination of persons aged 1 year and older. Results: We determined cost-effectiveness when vaccine herd protection was or was not considered, and compared this with commonly accepted cutoffs of gross domestic product (GDP) per person to classify interventions as cost-effective or very-cost effective. Without including herd protective effects, deployment of this vaccine would be cost-effective only in school-based programs in Kolkata and Beira. In contrast, after considering vaccine herd protection, all three programs were judged very cost-effective in Kolkata and Beira. Because these cost-effectiveness calculations include herd protection, the results are dependent on assumed vaccination coverage rates. Conclusions: Ignoring the indirect effects of cholera vaccination has led to underestimation of the cost-effectiveness of vaccination programs with oral cholera vaccines. Once these effects are included, use of the oral killed whole cell vaccine in programs to control endemic cholera meets the per capita GDP criterion in several developing country settings.","[Jeuland, Marc] Univ N Carolina, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Poulos, Christine] RTI Int, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Cook, Joseph] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Clemens, John] Int Vaccine Inst, Seoul, South Korea; [Whittington, Dale] Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Research Triangle Institute; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; International Vaccine Institute; University of Manchester,"Jeuland, M (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, CB 7431, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",jeuland@email.unc.edu,,"Poulos, Christine/0000-0001-7810-3411; Whittington, Dale/0000-0002-6075-8812",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),Funding was provided by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

As it happens with the latter type of data, the asymptotic distributions of the tests are functionals of a Gaussian sheet process, say B(nu), nu is an element of [0, pi](d). Since it is not easy to find a time transformation h(v) Such that B (h(nu)) becomes the standard Brownian sheet, a consequence is that the critical values are difficult, if at all possible, to obtain. So, to overcome the problem of its implementation, we propose employing a bootstrap approach, showing its validity in our context. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: The Rasch measurement properties and differential item functioning (DIF) of the KIDSCREEN-52 were examined in children with CP. Data were available from the KIDSCREEN project from 3219 children aged 8 to 12 years and 2126 parents in the general population; and from the SPARCLE project from 501 children aged 8 to 12 years with CP and 823 parents. Analysis used Zumbo's logistic regression DIF approach. Partial credit model analyses were conducted. Results: All items of the KIDSCREEN self-report version fitted the partial credit model (smallest P-value: 0.256). Only one item of the parent version did not fit the data well (smallest P-value 0.001). Statistically significant DIF was observed in some items, but was of substantial magnitude (Delta R-2 = 0.046, 0.049) for only two items in two dimensions of the parent version. The practical impact of DIF was small. DIF-adjusted standardized mean differences between children with and without CP being 1.07 and 0.34 for the physical and school dimensions, respectively (unadjusted: 1.09 and 0.16). Conclusion: The KIDSCREEN-52 functions in a similar way in children with CP and in the general population. Comparisons of quality of life between such children are therefore likely to be valid.","[Ravens-Sieberer, Ulrike] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Ctr Obstet & Pediat, Dept Psychosomat Children & Adolescents, Head Res Unit Child Publ Hlth, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Dickinson, Heather O.; Colver, Allan] Univ Newcastle, Newcastle, NSW 2308, Australia",University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; University of Newcastle,"Ravens-Sieberer, U (通讯作者)，Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Ctr Obstet & Pediat, Dept Psychosomat Children & Adolescents, Head Res Unit Child Publ Hlth, Martinistr 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.",Ravens-Sieberer@uke.uni-hamburg.de,,,"European Commission [QLG-CT-2000-00751, QLG5-CT-2002-00636]",European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),Source of financial support: The KIDSCREEN and SPARCLE Projects were funded by grants of the European Commission ( EC Grant Numbers QLG-CT-2000-00751 and QLG5-CT-2002-00636).

The models also were estimated in willingness-to-pay (WTP) space instead of conventional utility space. Cheap talk not only affected the coefficient on the cost attribute, but also preferences for other attributes. WTP estimates were generally lower in cheap talk sample, except for the most important attribute and a 2-level attribute.

After finding initial evidence in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) that changes ill the minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) are related to prenatal drinking, we examine whether the drinking age influences birth outcomes. Using data from the National Vital Statistics (NVS) for the years 1978-1988, we find that a drinking age of 18 is associated with adverse Outcomes among births to young mothers-including higher incidences of low birth weight and premature birth, but not congenital anomalies. The effects are largest among black women. We also report evidence that the MLDA laws alter the composition of births that occur. in states with lenient drinking laws, young black mothers are less likely to report paternal information on the birth certificate, Particularly ill states with restrictive abortion policies. The evidence suggests that lenient drinking laws generate poor birth outcomes in part because they increase the number of unplanned pregnancies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A full likelihood approach is possible with a specification of the distribution of the common demand shock. We introduce a reparameterization of the covariance matrix to improve the performance of the random walk Metropolis for covariance parameters. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach with both actual and simulated data. Sampling experiments show that our approach performs well relative to the GMM estimator even in the presence of a mis-specified shock distribution. We view our approach as useful for those who are willing to trade off one additional distributional assumption for increased efficiency in estimation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Examples on monopoly with product quality, countervailing incentives and optimal taxation are also provided to illustrate various sources of non-smoothness in the model, and confirm the adequacy of our methods for deriving the sort of characterization that prevails under the standard conditions of continuity and piecewise differentiability.

This makes it possible to address coordination failures for cases with price indexation or more general price linkages between commodities. We introduce a new equilibrium concept, called quantity constrained equilibrium (QCE), giving a unified treatment to all cases considered in the literature so far. At a QCE the expected trade opportunities on supply and demand are completely determined by a rationing vector satisfying that the prevailing price system maximizes the value of the rationing vector within the set of admissible prices. When the set of admissible prices is compact. we show the existence of a connected set of QCEs. This set connects two trivial no-trade equilibria, one with completely pessimistic expectations concerning Supply opportunities and one with completely pessimistic expectations concerning demand opportunities. Moreover, the set contains for every commodity a generalized Dreze equilibrium, being a QCE at which for that commodity no binding trade opportunities on both supply and demand are expected, and also a generalized supply-constrained equilibrium at which no binding constraints oil demand opportunities are expected and for at least one commodity also not on supply. We apply this main result to several special cases, and also discuss the case of an unbounded set of admissible prices. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Herings, P.

We argue that, in general, policies to combat the disease and promote education must be concentrated, in certain ways, at first on some subgroups of society. This concentration involves what we term the macroeconomics of targeting. The central comparison is then between programs under which supported families enjoy the benefits of spending on health and education simultaneously (DT), and those under which the benefits in these two domains are sequenced (ST). When levels of human capital are uniformly low at the outbreak, DT is superior to ST if the mortality rate exceeds some threshold value. Outside aid makes DT more attractive; but DT restricts support to fewer families initially and so increases inequality. A summary account of the empirical evidence is followed by an application of the framework to South Africa. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Payments for public care are highly concentrated on the better-off whereas benefits are pro-poor. As a consequence, public health care effects significant net redistribution from the rich to the poor. Public care is skewed towards the poor in part not only because Of allocation according to need but also because the rich opt out of the public sector and consume most of the private care. Overall, there is horizontal inequity favouring the rich in general outpatient care and (very marginally) inpatient care. Pro-rich bias in the distribution of private Care outweights the pro-poor bias of public care. A lesser role for private finance may improve horizontal equity of utilisation but Would also reduce the degree of net redistribution through the public sector.

Can the Italian case be useful to ponder over this issue? Except for some circumscribed and privileged situations, Italy cannot be described as a centre of excellence, with regards to e-business practice. Nevertheless, the recent Italian legislative debate about the matter can be studied as a source of an alternative vision of e-government issues - even though the related laws have not been implemented as they should. Some recent Italian laws, in fact, focus on how Public Administration (PA) should be organized in order to assist citizens, namely: (a) when citizens ask for information from the PA, (b) when they need to access PA documents, (c) when they report problems or claims, and (d) when they perform procedures. This legislation is not focused on e-government in itsetf, but rather on the relationship between citizens and the different PA bodies, and on organizational, back-office issues connected with the purpose of achieving citizen satisfaction. Web-based applications are considered within this wider vision: in other words, according to this approach, e-government tends to be fostered by a cultural and organizational innovation within the PA, more than vice versa. It is not a goal in itself, but it is part of a more general endeavor to improve the overall performance of the PA, measured from the citizens' perspective. According to this novel legislative approach, the crucial question is not How should we implement e-government services? but Who should deal with e-government within the PA?. The organizational answer that the Italian law is seeking to provide is: within each PA body, e-government should be designed and managed by a single Department dedicated to a wider purpose: taking care of the whole range of interactions with citizens (traditional face-to-face interactions included). To be successful, this Department must have a strong role (and actual power) in back-office innovation. Field studies are being conducted to assess the soundness of such an approach, and the tentative outcomes are discussed in this paper.","[Ricciardi, Francesca] Univ Cattolica, Brescia, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,,francesca.ricciardi@unicatt.it; datri@luiss.it; marco.demarco@unicatt.it,"Ricciardi, Francesca/P-6330-2014","Ricciardi, Francesca/0000-0002-0645-7031",,,,,9,0,0,0,3,ALFRED UNIV,ALFRED,"ONE SAXON DR, ALFRED, NY 14802 USA",,,978-0-9800510-2-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,570,575,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science,BJZ06,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267479300089,0

The impact of different soil cultivation methods and sowing technologies on soil characteristics, seed bed preparation and seed introduction, germination and yield structure indices were investigated. Seed bed preparation and seed introduction indices were determined by Sweden scientists using Kritz/Hakannson method. Soil cultivation and seed introduction depth evenness, and soil grading composition were estimated. Tests disclosed that in order to introduce winter wheat seed properly with disc drill coulters in no-tillage hard clay loam soil, the yield vegetative residues should be introduced into the soil before the sowing. In dry soil (less than 3% moisture content) big hard lump structure is formed thus the seeds are not always duly introduced in proper depth with drill coulters.

Such spillovers arise, for instance, when health care activity at aggregate level triggers improvements in treatment through learning-by-doing (positive externality) or a deterioration in the quality of care through congestion (negative externality). We combine an age-structured optimal control model at population level with a conventional life cycle model to derive the social and private value of life. We then examine how individual incentives deviate from social incentives and how they can be aligned by way of a transfer scheme. The age-patterns of socially and individually optimal health expenditures and the transfer rate are derived. Numerical analysis illustrates the working of our model. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, the pro-cyclical fluctuations in workplace accidents are not well understood. They could be related to fluctuations in effort and working hours, but workplace accidents may also be affected by reporting behavior. Our paper uses unique data on workplace accidents from an Austrian matched worker-firm dataset to study in detail how economic incentives affect workplace accidents. We find that workers who reported an accident in a particular period of time are more likely to be fired later on. And, we find support for the idea that recessions influence the reporting of moderate workplace accidents: if workers think the probability of dismissals at the firm level is high, they are less likely to report a moderate workplace accident.

Furthermore, the new method does not require strict assumptions on the volatility models of the factors, and therefore is less sensitive to model misspecification. We provide conditions for consistency of the estimator, and study its efficiency relative to maximum likelihood estimation using Monte Carlo simulations.

This study estimates the lost productive time (LPT) and its resulting cost among workers with major depressive disorder (MDD) compared with a comparison group. It also estimates the change in productivity after 8 weeks of outpatient psychiatric treatment with antidepressants. Methods: Working patients diagnosed with MDD without other major physical or mental disorders were recruited (n = 102), along with age-and sex-matched healthy controls from the Seoul Metropolitan area (n = 91). The World Health Organization's Health and Work Performance Questionnaire and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression were utilized to measure productivity and severity of depression, respectively, at baseline and at 8 weeks of treatment. Results: The LPT from absenteeism and presenteeism (reduced performance while present at work) was significantly higher among the MDD group. Workers with MDD aver-aged costs due to LPT at 33.4% of their average annual salary, whereas the comparison group averaged costs of 2.5% of annual salary. After 8 weeks of treatment, absenteeism and clinical symptoms of depression were significantly reduced and associated with significant improvement in self-rated job performance (31.8%) or cost savings of $7508 per employee per year. Conclusions: We confirmed that significant productivity loss arises from MDD and that this loss can be reduced with psychiatric intervention after a time period as short as 8 weeks. Mental health professionals should work with employers to devise a cost-effective system to provide workers with accessible quality care.","[Woo, Jong-Min; Kim, Won] Inje Univ, Seoul Paik Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Sch Med, Seoul, South Korea; [Woo, Jong-Min; Kim, Won; Park, Yu Lee] Inje Univ, Stress Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea; [Hwang, Tae-Yeon; Seo, Yong-Jin] Yong In Mental Hosp, Yongin, South Korea; [Frick, Kevin D.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Choi, Byong Hwi] Gwangmyeong Psychiat Clin, Gwangmyeong, South Korea; [Kang, Eun-Ho] Sungkynkwan Univ, Dept Psychiat, Samsung Med Ctr, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Se Joo] Yonsei Univ, Dept Psychiat, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Kim, Se Joo] Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Inst Behav Sci Med, Seoul, South Korea; [Ham, Byong-Joo] Korea Univ, Anam Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Sch Med, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Jun-Seok] KARF Hosp, Goyang, South Korea",Inje University; Inje University; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Samsung Medical Center; Yonsei University; Yonsei University; Yonsei University Health System; Korea University; Korea University Medicine (KU Medicine),"Woo, JM (通讯作者)，Inje Univ, Seoul Paik Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Sch Med, Seoul, South Korea.",jongmin.woo@gmail.com,"Hwang, Tae-Yeon/AAI-9806-2020; Woo, Jong Min/D-2353-2014","Ham, Byung Joo/0000-0002-0108-2058; Woo, Jongmin/0000-0003-1314-126X; Frick, Kevin/0000-0002-0178-5319; KIM, SE JOO/0000-0002-5438-8210",Stress Research Institute of Inje University; Wyeth Korea,Stress Research Institute of Inje University; Wyeth Korea(Wyeth),"The authors thank Jennifer J.

The economy (epsilon, F) is shown to have the same consumption equilibria as a reduced economy (epsilon, F), for which the set of admissible portfolio allocations is bounded. Building upon the equilibrium existence result for reduced financial economies (epsilon, F) (Aouani and Cornet, 2009), we then deduce the existence of equilibra of (epsilon, F), under standard assumptions on the consumption side and under the aforementioned assumption on the financial side.

The Bell Journal of Economics 12, 380-391] showed that if the strict monotone likelihood ratio property (MLRP) does not hold for a conditional distribution then there exists some non-degenerate prior and pair of signals where the higher-signal posterior does not stochastically dominate the lower-signal posterior. We show that for any non-degenerate prior with bounded support there exists a conditional distribution (satisfying several natural properties) and pair of signals such that the lower signal's posterior stochastically dominates that of the higher signal. Thus, for every bounded prior, higher signals may represent strictly worse news. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
