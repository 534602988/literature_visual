We find evidence for the hypothesis that airlines internalize the effects of self-imposed congestion, but the results for the hub variables are somewhat puzzling. While delays are higher at hub airports, hub airlines experience lower delays than non-hub airlines. This may be at least partly explained by the special characteristics of the hub-and-spoke system in Europe, which is less extensive and more constrained, relative to the US. If introduced in Europe, efficient airport congestion tolls should be carrier-specific to account for the differences in internalization of delays. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This traffic is concentrated at a small number of US seaports. It is therefore important to have an accurate understanding of the flow of containers from their origin country through these seaports to their final destination. This paper develops an optimization model to estimate route flows and a corresponding multi-modal origin-destination table for containers by synthesizing data on international trade and railcar movements with a gravity model for the demand of container traffic. This analysis provides insights into the balance of rail and truck inland transportation from each port. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Analytical modeling of passenger flow in airport terminals under transient demand patterns is especially difficult due to the complex structure of a terminal. Because of this difficulty, the airport terminal capacity planning problem has not been studied in a holistic fashion, such that studies in this area either do not account for expandability or focus only on one particular area of the terminal. In this study, we consider the airport terminal capacity planning problem as a whole. In this regard, we first derive time functions to approximate maximum delays in passageways and processing stations of an airport terminal. We then use these delay functions to develop a multistage stochastic programming model based on a multicommodity flow network representation of the whole airport terminal. The solution of the model, for which we develop an efficient solution algorithm, provides optimal capacity requirements for each area in an airport terminal during the initial building phase, as well as the optimal expansion policy under stochastic future demand. The results of the study are applicable to all similar queuing networks, including other types of passenger terminals. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Given uncertainty about link travel times, there is interest in algorithms that can deliver all the paths that may be optimal, termed collectively a hyperpath, to improve travel time reliability. The actual path taken within the hyperpath will typically be determined by on-trip events, like incidences of congestion leading to delay. In this paper, the Spiess and Florian algorithm for generating hyperpaths in transit networks is adapted to road networks by assuming that drivers follow a risk averse strategy whenever a choice of path arises. To improve the efficiency of the resulting algorithm for vehicle navigation applications, the Astar approach to link selection is incorporated, leading to the Hyperstar algorithm. Proof of the optimality of the algorithm is provided, followed by numerical examples. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

As the global realm of sustainability develops and evolves, it is increasingly accepted that sustainability issues should be put on top of the agenda when contemplating infrastructure development. While many construction organizations will not argue against pursuing sustainability, in practice problems often lie with what should be done, who should do them and how mutual benefits can be obtained. This is compounded by the fact that very often there are no common understandings between the stakeholders, and the gap between advancement of research and real life applications in actual projects is still significant. New approaches should be investigated to both develop and expand the body of sustainability knowledge on infrastructure development and investigate better ways of communicating with and managing it to overcome the various barriers within the sector. Knowledge management (KM) has shown its worth and promise in existing applications in the construction industry. Various attempts are being made to develop tools and mechanisms for the effective management of construction knowledge yet few are capable of handling specific characteristics associated with sustainability concerns and infrastructure works. An ongoing research project, undertaken by Queensland University of Technology in Australia, is introduced in this paper. It enlists two rounds of industry surveys to study the unique characters of infrastructure development as well as how sustainability knowledge is best shared and managed. A holistic KM approach is proposed to facilitate sustainability knowledge creation, capture, sharing and application, and the whole process is encapsulated in a general KM framework for decision making of infrastructure stakeholders. It is expected that this research will build up the links between KM activities, industry environment and organizational performance.","[Yuan Mei; Jay, Yang] Queensland Univ Technol, Fac Built Environm & Engn, Sch Urban Dev, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),,mei.yuan01@gmail.com; j.yang@qut.edu.au,"Yuan, Mei/HOH-0285-2023",,,,,,16,1,1,0,9,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,2480,2486,,,,,,7,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119901162,0

Taking advantage of the fact that traffic states within a congested link can be simplified as free-flow, saturated, and jammed conditions, SPM simulates traffic dynamics by analytically deriving the trajectories of four major shockwaves: queuing, discharge, departure. and compression waves. Unlike conventional macroscopic models, in which space is often discretized into small cells for numerical solutions, SPM treats each homogeneous road segment with constant capacity as a section; and the queuing dynamics within each section are described by tracing the shockwave fronts. SPM is particularly suitable for simulating traffic flow on congested signalized arterials especially with queue spillover problems, where the steady-state periodic pattern of queue build-up and dissipation process may break down. Depending on when and where spillover occurs along a signalized arterial, a large number of queuing patterns may be possible. Therefore it becomes difficult to apply the conventional approach directly to track shockwave fronts. To overcome this difficulty, a novel approach is proposed as part of the SPM, in which queue spillover is treated as either extending a red phase or creating new smaller cycles, so that the analytical solutions for tracing the shockwave fronts can be easily applied. Since only the essential features of arterial traffic flow, i.e., queue build-up and dissipation, are considered, SPM significantly reduces the computational load and improves the numerical efficiency. We further validated SPM using real-world traffic signal data collected from a major arterial in the Twin Cities. The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the model. We expect that in the future this model can be applied in a number of real-time applications such as arterial performance prediction and signal optimization. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper investigates a fundamental problem of finding the most reliable path under different spatial correlation assumptions, where the path travel time variability is represented by its standard deviation. To handle the non-linear and non-additive cost functions introduced by the quadratic forms of the standard deviation term, a Lagrangian substitution approach is adopted to estimate the lower bound of the most reliable path solution through solving a sequence of standard shortest path problems. A subgradient algorithm is used to iteratively improve the solution quality by reducing the optimality gap. To characterize the link travel time correlation structure associated with the end-to-end trip time reliability measure, this research develops a sampling-based method to dynamically construct a proxy objective function in terms of travel time observations from multiple days. The proposed algorithms are evaluated under a large-scale Bay Area, California network with real-world measurements. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Why is the demand for spare parts intermittent and how can we use models developed in maintenance research to forecast such demand? We attempt to answer these questions: we present a novel idea to forecast demand that relies upon the very sources of the demand generation process and we compare it with a well-known time-series method. We conclude that maintenance driven models are associated with a better performance under certain conditions. We also outline an inter-disciplinary agenda for further research in this area.

To provide exhaustive results for service regions of different sizes and demographics, the paper idealizes these regions as squares with uniform demand, and their possible networks as a broad and realistic family that combines the grid and the hub-and-spoke concepts. The paper also shows how to use these results to generate master plans of transit systems for real cities. The analysis reveals which network structure and technology (Bus, Bus Rapid Transit, or Metro) delivers the desired performance with the least cost. It is found that the more expensive the system's infrastructure, the more it should tilt toward the hub-and-spoke concept. Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) competes effectively with the automobile unless a city is big and its demand low. This happens despite the uniform demand assumption, which penalizes collective transport. It is also found that if a city has enough suitable streets on which to run Bus and BRT systems, these outperform Metro even if the city is large and the demand high. Agency costs are always small compared with user costs; and both decline with the demand density. In all cases, increasing the spatial concentration of stops beyond a critical level increases both, the user and agency costs. Too much spatial coverage is counterproductive. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper demonstrates two essential shortcomings of these path-based models. One is that their application requires a given initial path flow pattern, which is typically unidentifiable, i.e. mathematically nonunique and practically unobservable. In particular, we show that, for the path-based models, different initial path flow patterns constituting the same link flow pattern generally gives different day-to-day link flow evolutions. The other shortcoming of the path-based models is the path-overlapping problem. That is, the path-based models ignore the interdependence among paths and thus can give very unreasonable results for networks with paths overlapping with each other. These two path-based problems exist for most (if not all) deterministic day-to-day dynamics whose fixed points are the classic Wardrop user equilibrium. To avoid the two path-based problems, we propose a day-to-day traffic assignment model that directly deals with link flow variables. Our link-based model captures travelers' cost-minimization behavior in their path finding as well as their inertia. The fixed point of our link-based dynamical system is the classic Wardrop user equilibrium. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Then we work out the needed congestion tolls, which account for the congestion imposed on other carriers and the congestion imposed on all passengers.

Therefore, satisfactory beneficiation results for them can be hardly obtained by physical means. Even if iron concentrates almost having a theoretical grade are obtained at the cost of loss of iron recovery, they can not be used in sintering process in large quantity due to the structure of the ores. In view of the problem, a technique of flash magnetizing roasting is developed to transform siderite and limonite into artificial magnetite so as to enlarge the difference between siderite/limonite and gangue minerals and realize effective separation of the ores. Through comparing the results of separation after Magnetizing roasting of siderite and limonite with those by physical means, it is found that the grade of iron concentrates is increased by 6-15%, the recovery of iron by 15-20%.

A typical application is the monitoring of water samples to determine if they contain petroleum. These tests are mandated in many countries to enable environmental agencies to determine if tanks used to store petrol are leaking into local water systems. Chromatographic techniques, typically using gas or liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, allow an analyst to detect a vast array of compounds-potentially in the order of thousands. Accurate analysis relies heavily on the skills of a limited pool of experienced analysts utilising semi-automatic techniques to analyse these datasets-making the outcomes subjective. The focus of current laboratory data analysis systems has been on refinements of existing approaches. The work described here represents a paradigm shift achieved through applying data mining techniques to tackle the problem. These techniques are compelling because the efficacy of preprocessing methods, which are essential in this application area, can be objectively evaluated. This paper presents preliminary results using a data mining framework to predict the concentrations of petroleum compounds in water samples. Experiments demonstrate that the framework can be used to produce models of sufficient accuracy-measured in terms of root mean squared error and correlation coefficients-to offer the potential for significantly reducing the time spent by analysts on this task.","[Holmes, Geoffrey; Fletcher, Dale; Reutemann, Peter; Frank, Eibe] Univ Waikato, Dept Comp Sci, Hamilton, New Zealand",University of Waikato,,,"Frank, Eibe/A-1434-2008","Frank, Eibe/0000-0001-6152-7111; Reutemann, Peter/0000-0002-1226-0948",,,,,10,0,0,1,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1863-5520,1863-5539,978-3-540-88350-0,ENVIRON SCI ENG,Environ.

For these networks, an integrated management approach that also takes the nature of the enterprise and the services it provides into account must be utilized. This is a complex task. While many automated approaches are in use, to a large extent the effectiveness of the integrated management depends on understanding the functions of its components and their relations with one another. In most cases, it is impossible to identify precise crisp models describing the roles, functions, and interactions of such components in a useful manner. One of the main reasons for that, is that characterization of these concepts by human beings and managers has a fuzzy nature. Linguistic variables are extensively used in communication of such understandings.

The questions we care about are how to measure the land-use intensification degree in China? Does the degree of land-use intensification enhance or reduce? The thesis introduces the Growth Drag model to answer those questions. After combing the literature, the thesis discovered that, the former researchers started with the case of Cobb-Douglas production function, in which the elasticity of substitution among production factors is 1. But the hypothesis is not true in the real economy world. So we choose the modified two-level CES production function as the basic model. Meanwhile, the thesis gives hypothesis of land resource limitation, which is the scarce of land resources is more alleviation. Based on the modified two-level CES production function, we deduce the equations of Growth Drag. In the empirical study, firstly, the thesis used the OLS to estimate the parameters, found that the serious autocorrelation between variables violates the basic hypothesis, and then used the Generalized Difference Method to overcome the autocorrelation. The result indicated that the Growth Drag of land resource was 0.46% and 0.37% respectively. From the view of Growth Drag analysis, the thesis drew a conclusion that the degree of land-use intensification degree in 1985-1995 had a larger upgrade than the one in 1996-2005.","[Yang Yang] Shanghai Ocean Univ China, Dept Adm, Sch Humanities, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai Ocean University,,yangyang@shou.edu.cn; wucifang@zju.edu.cn,,,,,,,12,18,24,0,8,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,1,4,,,,,,4,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900001,0

Efficiency wage setting is incorporated in a spatial two-region general equilibrium model, written as a welfare program. In our model, firms set wages above the market clearing level to create an inducement for employees not to shirk. The economy-wide effect (i.e. social welfare or total welfare) consists of the direct effect in transport market and the indirect effect in other markets. We conduct welfare analyses different from the conventional cost-benefit analysis, in which we distinguish between the direct welfare effect based on consumer surplus in the transport market and the indirect welfare effect through changes in regional unemployment, which is captured in the economy-wide effect. In our model, infrastructure improvement may increase unemployment in one region, but overall unemployment levels fall. The indirect welfare effects through decreases in overall unemployment are about 10-20% of the direct welfare effects for most plausible labor market parameters. The indirect welfare effects are larger, the poorer the initial transport infrastructure and the larger the labor market imperfections. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Ecological modernization at the society level is influenced by restructuring policies and regulations. Some of these policies and regulations in China are focusing on enhancing energy savings and pollution reduction (ESPR). Based on a survey of 376 responses, we investigate whether different Chinese manufacturer clusters varying in their extent of implementing GSCM exist from this ecological modernization perspective. We also examine if Chinese manufacturers' awareness of domestic and international environmental ESPR-oriented compliance is related to GSCM implementation and whether a mediating effect of regulatory pressure plays a significant role.

The population density function along the corridor is exogenous, and except for location vehicles are identical. All vehicles travel along the corridor from home to work in the morning rush hour, and have the same work start-time but may arrive early. The two components of costs are travel time costs and schedule delay (time early) costs. Determining equilibrium and optimum traffic flow patterns for this continuous model, and possible extensions, is termed The Corridor Problem. Equilibria must satisfy the trip-timing condition, that at each location no vehicle can experience a lower trip price by departing at a different time.

This paper examines the effects of tolling, in a bottleneck model, with a continuously distributed value of time. With homogeneous users, first-best public tolling has no effect on prices. With heterogeneity it does: low values of time lose, and high values of time gain. The average congestion externality decreases with the heterogeneity in the value of time. Consequently, the welfare gain of first-best tolling also decreases. The more heterogeneous the value of time is, the lower the relative efficiency of a public pay-lane. This finding contrasts with the previous literature. Earlier studies, using static flow congestion, conclude that the relative efficiency increases with this type of heterogeneity. With more heterogeneity in the value of time, the relative efficiency of a private pay-lane is also lower, while that of a public time-invariant toll is higher. Our results suggest that the welfare gains of different tolling schemes are affected differently by heterogeneity. Further, the impact of heterogeneity on the effects of a policy also depends on the type of congestion considered. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Also analyzed is the strong emergence of a third player, online travel portals that act as online travel agencies. We use a multinomial logit model to study the influence of 27 socio-economic factors and trip attributes on passenger purchase channel choice. The results show that the profile of a passenger who has a greater likelihood of making his/her bookings online is that of a young person, a student or educated to a high level, a habitual traveler, booking a simple journey and using an LCC. The factors linked to an increased likelihood of making purchases by phone include: being male, middle-aged, on a business or short trip, and the passengers usually use a travel agency. Finally, passengers who are over 65 years of age, with a lower academic level, who use a travel agency and are going to make a more complicated journey, are more likely to purchase their tickets in-store.

The model is defined by a differential system, to which a consistent numerical scheme is associated The parameters of the model are statistically estimated by maximum likelihood In order to reproduce a heterogeneous traffic flow, vehicles are differentiated by type, and to recreate asymmetric longitudinal behavior, acceleration phases are distinguished from deceleration phases. Introducing a reaction time, inducing a delay in the perception and processing of information about vehicles in interaction, can alter the stability of the flux through appearance of kinematic waves By simulation, the types and domains of parameters which are asymptotically unstable are identified.

We evaluate each fastest indirect connection in terms of waiting times and routing factors to consider the effect of the hubs' coordination and locations. The Chinese network provides the quickest travels for passengers, but this performance is explained by a small number of airports per inhabitant.

Decreasing the distance to the nearest wetland increases house values. The marginal implicit price of reducing the distance to the nearest wetland by 1,000 meter, evaluated at the mean house value yields a 1950 Yuan increase in house value. While there is a preference to be closer to wetlands, the type of wetland does seem to matter. The type of open water wetland has significantly positive effect over other types of wetland. The marginal implicit price for open water over other types, evaluated at the mean house value, indicates an increase in house value of 320 Yuan. The results also shows that structural and neighborhood characteristics are of great importance in explaining the variations of housing prices, especially the distance to CBD, which indicates that traditional commercial center still has strong impact in the city of Hangzhou.

Therefore, recent events emerging from the United States, culminating in widespread housing stock surpluses in that country and others, threaten to destabilise many aspects related to individuals and community. However, despite global impact, the position of housing demand and supply is not consistent. The Australian position provides a strong contrast whereby continued strong housing demand generally remains a critical issue affecting the socio-economic landscape. Underpinned by strong levels of immigration, and further buoyed by sustained historically low interest rates, increasing income levels, and increased government assistance for first home buyers, this strong housing demand ensures elements related to housing affordability continue to gain prominence. A significant, but less visible factor impacting housing affordability particularly new housing development relates to holding costs. These costs are in many ways hidden and cannot always be easily identified. Although it is only one contributor, the nature and extent of its impact requires elucidation. In its simplest form, it commences with a calculation of the interest or opportunity cost of land holding. However, there is significantly more complexity for major new developments - particularly greenfield development. Analysis suggests that even small shifts in primary factors impacting holding costs can appreciably affect housing affordability. Those factors of greatest significance not only include interest rates and the rate of inflation, but even less apparent factors such as the regulatory assessment period. These are not just theoretical concepts but real, measurable price drivers. Ultimately, the real impact is felt by the one market segment whom can typically least afford it new home, first home buyers. They can be easily pushed out of affordability. This paper suggests the stability and sustainability of growing, new communities require this problem to be acknowledged and accurately identified if the well being of such communities is to be achieved.","[Garner Gary Owen] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Urban Dev, Fac Built Environm & Engn, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),,g.garner@qut.edu.au,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,1,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,1222,1235,,,,,,14,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900192,0

The experiments reveal that models with spatial input variables deserve further study and better models could be developed with higher accuracy.","[Kurt, Atakan; Betul, Ayse] Fatih Univ, Dept Comp Engn, TR-34500 Istanbul, Turkey; [Karaca, Ferhat; Alagha, Omar] Fatih Univ, Dept Environm Engn, TR-34500 Istanbul, Turkey",Fatih University; Fatih University,"Kurt, A (通讯作者)，Fatih Univ, Dept Comp Engn, TR-34500 Istanbul, Turkey.",oalagha@fatih.edu.tr,"Alagha, Omar/AAW-1749-2020; AGA, Omer/O-7154-2015; Karaca, Ferhat/G-2353-2011; KURT, Atakan/AAH-6949-2019; Alagha, Omar/ABC-1462-2020; Aalagha, Omar/D-4746-2018; AGA, Omar/D-4746-2018","Alagha, Omar/0000-0002-3056-0768; Alagha, Omar/0000-0003-2816-8932; Aalagha, Omar/0000-0002-3056-0768; AGA, Omar/0000-0002-2793-575X; Oktay, Ayse/0000-0003-0827-173X; Karaca, Ferhat/0000-0002-9604-9348",,,,,6,0,0,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1863-5520,,978-3-540-88350-0,ENVIRON SCI ENG,Environ.

The problem of price of real estate has become the focus of attention. There are many impact factors to the real estate price. The relationship between supply and demand in real estate market is the essence factor. The urbanization level is one important factor of the demand of real estate. In this paper, co-integration analysis and Granger causality analysis are used to analyze the relations between price of real estate and urbanization level in China in the period of 1987-2007. Empirical results show that the improvement of China's real estate price is Granger cause of the level of urbanization in China. There is a long-term stable equilibrium between China's real estate price and the level of urbanization in China. The regression model shows that real estate price will increase by 30.298 units if the level of urbanization increases one unit. Finally, some suggestions are provided.","[Li Weidong] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University,,wdli@bjtu.edu.cn,,,,,,,7,1,1,0,3,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,843,846,,,,,,4,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900132,0

The paper also stresses that the three respects are closely intertwined in practical management environments. Thus, the three respects should be highly coordinated and systematically integrated. The Entrepreneurial Management is generally seen as a practice of the Modern Management involving many factors, which requires a high-level of coordination and integration of the market demands, government supportive policies and protection by relevant laws and regulations in order to make overall plans while taking all relevant factors into consideration and effectively deal with various issues occurring in the course of enterprises development. Thus, it seems safe to suggest that a new mode of Entrepreneurial Management ideally involves the coordination and integration of the factors of market demands, government supports and law protections. A conclusion drawn by the author is that, in today's increasingly competitive market, the Entrepreneurial Management is a process of exploring new and successful business survival mode and a practice of encouraging enterprise to actively seek government assistances and supports and seeking appropriate protection offered by relevant laws and regulations while observing the principle of the market demands in order to ensure a advantageous position when competing with competitive rivals.","[Pan Chengyi] Huaiyin Inst Technol, Huaian 223001, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Huaiyin Institute of Technology,,jshapcy@126.com,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,1,WORLD ACAD UNION-WORLD ACAD PRESS,LIVERPOOL,"113, ACADEMIC HOUSE, MILL LANE, WAVERTREE TECHNOLOGY PARK, LIVERPOOL, L13 4 AH, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84626-075-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,252,255,,,,,,4,"Business, Finance; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BQC56,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000280694900057,0

Up to date, there have been considerable concerns with the issues that whether the investment project of housing security by the government will be a shock to the current soft housing market as the efficiency of the housing market would be affected by the excessive housing security level. However, much of the existing research just tended to analyze the interaction between the housing market and the housing security qualitatively. This paper differed from the existing literatures by estimating a dynamic coupling model from the quantitative aspect. Coupling degree was utilized to express the coordinated relationship between the housing market and the housing security. The model revealed that the elliptic trajectory of the coupling relationship goes through 4 stages, e.g.: low-grade symbiosis, coordinated development, limit development and regeneration development. Taking the condition of Jiangsu province as an example, this paper tried to analyze the evolution process of the coupling degree. The results showed the universal law and matching degree of the coupling relationship between the housing market and the housing security. In particular, these findings provided the quantitative data basis to the balance between the reasonable policies of the government on housing security and the matching housing market.","[Teng, T.

Unlike neural network or regression-based techniques traditionally used in the domain of AQ, our current approach adopts ZCS-DM - Zeroth-level Classifier System for Data Mining - for the production of a set of AQ prediction rules in the urban domain. On this basis, the aim of our experimental investigation is twofold and includes (i) the handling of incomplete data matrices and (ii) the evaluation of ZCS-DM effectiveness against methods widely used in the target domain, namely multi-layer perceptron (MLP), support vector machines (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and classification trees (C4.5). Overall, the obtained results reveal the potential of ZCS-DM as a data mining tool to be used for AQ forecasting, and point to its insensitivity for missing values (cf.

Reviewing the histories of Housing Guarantee Systems in the UK and US, this paper summarizes the main problems the two countries met in the evolutions of public housing systems, and their resolving methods. The two countries' experiences reveal that large numbers of public housing construction in one place will lead to the poverty concentration and serious social problems. This paper introduces how the UK and the US solve the public housing problems, which give us great enlightenments. Finally, whereas the public housing problems we met during the past 10 years, we suggest China should bring forward Mixed Income Communities to guide sustainable development of the housing market.

The model also captures the spatial correlation of all queues adjacent to a node, and derives their joint distribution. The approach builds upon an existing stationary queueing network model that is based on finite capacity queueing theory. The original model is specified in terms of a set of differentiable equations, which in the new model are carried over to a set of equally smooth difference equations. The physical correctness of the new model is experimentally confirmed in several congestion regimes. A comparison with results predicted by the kinematic wave model (KWM) shows that the new model correctly represents the dynamic build-up, spillback and dissipation of queues. It goes beyond the KWM in that it captures queue lengths and spillbacks probabilistically, which allows for a richer analysis than the deterministic predictions of the KWM. The new model also generates a plausible fundamental diagram, which demonstrates that it captures well the stationary flow/density relationships in both congested and uncongested conditions.

We propose to adopt a vendor managed inventory concept that involves establishment of a central warehouse at the port, and apply the Markov Decision Process (MDP) to formulate both ordering and delivery problems, considering different transportation modes, costs, and inventory issues. An efficient algorithm is developed for solving the MDP models. Our computational tests show that the proposed strategy can significantly reduce the overall system costs while maintaining smooth Just-in-Time supplies of coal to the subsidiaries.

These designs are constructed by the analyst, with several different ways of constructing these designs having been proposed in the past. Recently, there has been a move from so-called orthogonal designs to more efficient designs. Efficient designs optimize the design such that the data will lead to more reliable parameter estimates for the model under consideration. The main focus has been on the multinomial logit model, however this model is unable to take the dependency between choice situations into account, while in a stated choice survey usually multiple choice situations are presented to a single respondent. In this paper, we extend the literature by focusing on the panel mixed logit (ML) model with random parameters, which can take the above mentioned dependency into account. In deriving the analytical asymptotic variance-covariance matrix for the panel ML model, used to determine the efficiency of a design, we show that it is far more complex than the cross-sectional ML model (assuming independent choice observations). Case studies illustrate that it matters for which model the design is optimized, and that it seems that a panel ML model SC experiment needs less respondents than a cross-sectional ML experiment for the same level of reliability of the parameter estimates.

Therefore, in a good design respondents may often find themselves close to indifference and thus perception thresholds may be an issue. We propose a discrete choice model to examine the behaviour of individuals with indifference thresholds, i.e. that would make them perceive two or more alternatives as almost identical in stated choice (SC) experiments. Such thresholds may be stochastic, differ among the population and even be a function of socio-economic characteristics and choice conditions. Two estimate this model we need SC data including an indifference option, so that respondents are not forced to choose when finding that the two alternatives are equally attractive. Our formulation allows estimating the parameters of a threshold probability distribution using information about choices. As an illustration, the model is applied both to synthetic and real data; results clearly show that when indifference thresholds exist, using models without them can lead to errors in estimation and prediction.

Numerical simulation results show that transfer waiting time is mainly affected by the capacities and headways of the connecting and feeder services. Simulations also show that compared with the effects of connecting service variables, the corresponding variables of the feeder service usually have greater influences on transfer waiting time.

Incumbent airlines and new entrants must be allocated to the new and old facilities. When spaces at airport terminals are directly allocated, the allocation should be done by taking into account the implications for airlines' competition and social welfare, given the airlines' network configuration. We use a theoretical model in which two airlines compete in prices with differentiated products for a given network structure. The model shows that, in general, if airlines are allocated to different terminals, the level of competition is reduced, the ticket prices are higher and the consumer surplus and social welfare are lower. Only in some routes, and under certain conditions on the market size, ticket prices may be lower. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

There are potential demands for transportation service in both directions. Firms make decisions on prices. The realized demands reflect the price decisions of both firms. Equipment is required to transport demand from one location to the other. To sustain the business, firms have to reposition empty equipment from a surplus location to a shortage location and incur repositioning cost if the realized demands are unbalanced. We build a mathematical model to study the pricing strategy and analyze the outcome of competition. The optimal pricing strategy of a firm is either to achieve the balance of realized demands or treat these two directions as two separate markets. We also study the outcome of competition. In case of a duopoly market, we corroborate how the profit of a firm is affected by potential imbalance, unit loaded equipment movement cost, unit empty equipment repositioning cost, price sensitivity and the competition intensity. It is interesting to find that profit may increase with potential imbalance and with unit empty equipment repositioning cost. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Near Miss, which is defined as a kind of dangerous behaviors of workers and improper conditions of environment, is considered as the precursor of the accidents and applied in other fields. In this paper, a method is proposed to observe and track the Near Miss on the construction site, to analyze the safety condition of the site, and to take some measures to eliminate or reduce the possibility of accidents before the occurrence of them. Firstly, according to the existing accidents and research, the real-time analysis of the characters of the Near Miss of accidents is made and then a database related to Near Miss is established. Secondly, some advanced apparatus are applied to detect the growth of the Near Miss. At the end, the results detected are compared with the rules which are defined by some experts and an early warning is given if the deviation exceeds a certain level. By means of this, it is likely to reduce the possibility of the accidents.","[Hua Jiange; Zhao Xianbo] Southeast Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Construct & Real Estate, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China,,huajiange001@163.com; zxb_19840131@163.com; dengxp2002@sina.com; njlqming@163.com,"Skibniewski, Miroslaw J./P-5310-2018; DENG, Xiaopeng/AGE-5078-2022; Zhao, Xianbo/H-1540-2017","DENG, Xiaopeng/0000-0002-2987-505X; Zhao, Xianbo/0000-0003-0153-5173",,,,,3,0,0,0,7,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,1416,1420,,,,,,5,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900221,0

A continuum theory for the flow of pedestrians. Transportation Research Part B. 36 (6), 507-535]. We first reformulate Hughes' model, and then show that the pedestrian route choice strategy in Hughes' model satisfies the reactive dynamic user equilibrium principle in which a pedestrian chooses a route to minimize the instantaneous travel cost to the destination. In this model, the pedestrian demand is time varying. The pedestrian density, flux, and walking speed are governed by the conservation equation. A generalized cost function is considered. The reformulated problem is solved by the efficient weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme for the conservation equation and the fast sweeping method for the Eikonal equation. A numerical example is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution procedure. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Wong, S.

In terms of managing risk, the purpose of signing construction contract is to allocate the risks between employer and contractor in such a way as to enable risks to be managed efficiently and effectively in the process of construction. Due to the laws, which are applicable to contracts, the principles of risk allocation are different between standard form contracts at home and abroad. The risks usually are classified into natural, political, economic, behavioral, legal risks, which exist under construction. The latest edition of China's Standard Form of Construction Contract (published in 2007) and FIDIC Conditions of Contract for Construction (The New Red Book) are compared in this paper, from a risk-allocation angle. Though both the FIDIC Form and China's Standard Contract advocate the doctrine of sharing risk, the specific division principle is different to some extent. The difference, which is because of development of construction industry in china and developed countries, brings out these differences in terms of specific sharing-risk. Under FIDIC Form, the contract condition is more stringent to contractors than to employers for the sake of putting contractors bearing more risks. While under China's Standard Contract, contractors bear lower risks. Yet clear contract language and proper risk allocation principles can help reduce such impacts and achieve management efficiency, which is the consensus in the domestic and international academic circles. The comparison between two standard forms of construction contracts can help Chinese contractors, who are eager to engaging in the international project contracting market, be familiar with the contract condition and bodies of law which are used in the international projects at large. This study is also helpful for foreign contractors understanding the environment and conditions of contract in China, as well as promoting the further research about the application of FIDIC Forms of Contract in China.","[Huang Nan; Xu Wei; Shen Jie] SE Univ China, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Construct Management & Real Estate, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China,,squirreln@163.com; steven82117@126.com; jieshen@seu.edu.cn,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,13,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,2155,2160,,,,,,6,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119901110,0

From the prospective of construction practice, these criterions play a certain role in regulating government investment projects but as a whole, the performance is still relatively low. In the UK, the construction of public works belongs to the fields of government procurement. There were shortcomings in the course of carrying on public works, such as over-budget, over completion time, low performance, in previous times.

The notion of seat allocation has not been considered explicitly and analytically in previous schedule-based frameworks. The model assumes that passengers use strategies when traveling from their origin to their destination. When loading a vehicle, standing on-board passengers continuing to the next station have priority to get available seats and waiting passengers are loaded on a First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) principle. The stimulus of a standing passenger to sit increases with his/her remaining journey length and time already spent on-board. When a vehicle is full, passengers unable to board must wait for the next vehicle to arrive. The equilibrium conditions can be stated as a variational inequality involving a vector-valued function of expected strategy costs. To find a solution, we adopt the method of successive averages (MSA) that generates strategies during each iteration by solving a dynamic program. Numerical results are also reported to show the effects of our model on the travel strategies and departure time choices of passengers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Ho, H.

Three specific issues are analyzed for meeting functions that exhibit increasing, constant and decreasing returns to scale. Firstly, service quality in terms of customer wait/search time and average profit per taxi are examined jointly in relation to taxi fleet size, and a Pareto-improving win-win situation is identified, where an increase in taxi fleet size leads to improvements in both service quality and market profitability. Such a Pareto-improving situation is found to emerge if and only if the meeting functions show increasing returns to scale. Secondly, the properties of the socially optimal solution are examined. It is found that the taxi fleet size should be chosen such that the total cost of operating vacant taxis equals the total cost of customer waiting time multiplied by an asymmetric factor of the meeting function, and that taxi services should be subsidized at social optimum only when the meeting functions show increasing returns to scale. Thirdly, the Pareto-efficient services are examined for trade-offs between social welfare and profits in the light of partially conflicting objectives of the public sector and the private taxi firms using a bi-objective maximization approach. The taxi utilization rate and the customer wait/search time or service quality are proved to be constant along the Pareto frontier and equal to those at social optimum if the meeting functions show constant returns to scale. Extensions are made to the cases with increasing and decreasing returns to scale. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It has long been known that the Gumbel distribution forms the basis of the multinomial logit model. Although the Gumbel distribution is a good approximation in some applications such as route choice problems, it is chosen mainly for mathematical convenience. This can be restrictive in many other scenarios in practice. In this paper we show that the assumption of the Gumbel distribution can be substantially relaxed to include a large class of distributions that is stable with respect to the minimum operation. The distributions in the class allow heteroscedastic variances. We then seek a transformation that stabilizes the heteroscedastic variances. We show that this leads to a semi-parametric choice model which links the linear combination of travel-related attributes to the choice probabilities via an unknown sensitivity function. This sensitivity function reflects the degree of travelers' sensitivity to the changes in the combined travel cost. The estimation of the semi-parametric choice model is also investigated and empirical studies are used to illustrate the developed method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, the profiles of cumulative flows are piecewise linearized. Both the step function (SF) and linear interpolation (LI) are used to approximate cumulative flows over time. New formulations of the SF-type and LI-type link travel time models are developed. We prove that these two types of link travel time models ensure first-in-first-out (FIFO) and continuity of travel times with respect to flows, and have other desirable properties. Since the LI-type link travel time model does not satisfy the causality property, a modified LI-type (MLI-type) link travel time model is proposed in this paper. We prove that the MLI-type link travel time model ensures causality, strong FIFO and travel time continuity, and that the MLI-type link travel time function is strictly monotone under the condition that the travel time of each vehicle on a link is greater than the free flow travel time on that link. Numerical examples are set up to illustrate the properties and accuracy of the three models. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

It has been used in some large cities especially when there are some major events. This paper analyzes the efficiency of road space rationing schemes by establishing the bounds of the reduction in the system cost associated with the restricted flow pattern at user equilibrium in comparison with the system cost at the original user equilibrium. The bounds are established under the general traffic equilibrium model formulated as variational inequalities and illustrated with a simple example. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model: role of utility function parameters, identification considerations, and model extensions. Transportation Research Part B 42 (3), 274-303]. The MDCNEV model captures inter-alternative correlations among alternatives in mutually exclusive subsets (or nests) of the choice set, while maintaining the closed-form of probability expressions for any (and all) consumption pattern(s). The MDCNEV model is applied to analyze non-worker out-of-home discretionary activity time-use and activity timing decisions on weekdays using data from the 2000 San Francisco Bay Area data. This empirical application contributes to the literature on activity time-use and activity timing analysis by considering daily activity time-use behavior and activity timing preferences in a unified utility maximization-based framework. The model estimation results provide several insights into the determinants of non-workers' activity time-use and timing decisions. The MDCNEV model performs better than the MDCEV model in terms of goodness of fit. However, the nesting parameters are very close to 1, indicating low levels of correlation. Nonetheless, even with such low correlation levels, empirical policy simulations indicate non-negligible differences in policy predictions and substitution patterns exhibited by the two models. Experiments conducted using simulated data also corroborate this result. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

On the contrary, the optimal allocation of plate scanning devices has received very limited attention, even though several authors have demonstrated that plate scanning (route identification) techniques are much more informative than those based on traditional link count information. This paper provides techniques for obtaining the optimal number and location of plate scanning devices for a given prior OD distribution pattern under different situations, i.e. maximum route identifiability or budget constraints. Two rules analogous to the counting location problem are developed, and several integer linear programming models fulfilling these rules are proposed.

They often switch operations between a demand responsive and a fixed-route policy. In designing and running such systems, the identification of the condition justifying the operating switch is often hard to properly evaluate. In this paper, we propose an analytical model and solution of the problem to assist decision makers and operators in their choice. By employing continuous approximations, we derive handy but powerful closed-form expressions to estimate the critical demand densities, representing the switching point between the competing operating policies. Based on the results of one-vehicle and two-vehicle operations for various scenarios, in comparison to values generated from simulation, we verify the validity of our analytical modeling approach.

Several countries such as UK and Australia have developed and implemented relevant effective Guidelines on designing for safety; however, the perceptions, acceptance and practice in Chinese Building Design and Construction Industry still remain unknown. 109 designed survey questionnaires were sent to professional designers in order to study the practice of designing for safety concept in China and 50 valid questionnaires were received, the survey results were presented and comparison with US practice is made wherever suitable. 40% respondents stated that they would accept the designing for safety concept and believe it could minimize or eliminate safety risks in construction sites, but they also mentioned some impacts such as increased liability, the precluding from the culture and nature of construction industry, interferes from the client's investments, etc. In the meantime, the unreasonableness of corporate culture and management of some design institutes also hindered the implementation of the concept. It is deemed that a full range of measures should be adopted to remedy the situation which included affording more new design tools and on-job trainings, issuing relevant guidelines and regulations etc.","[Deng Tiejun; Xie Guibin; Zou, Patrick X.

The stability of housing market is a crucial factor to the overall economy and the welfare of society as well as the mortgage market. During the last decades, however, the tremendous rise in housing price has made the housing market become increasingly volatile. On the other hand, rental price is widely employed to calculate the fundamental value of housing price, which is becoming increasingly fluctuant as well. Hence estimation of the volatility turns to be much more important and difficult when we study housing price mechanism. In this paper, we introduce rental as an independent variable to explain the movement of housing price and estimate volatility during the sample period. This study presents (i) a more efficient and precise measure to comprehend of price movements, (ii) estimate the conditional volatilities and (iii) reduce heteroskedasticity problem of housing market.

Thirty interviews were conducted with the project participants, and interview questions were designed to inquire the construction quality results and quality processes of the degree of supervision and organization procedure by the two methods. The study results show that construction quality has no apparent difference by the two methods. But the quality processes such as the degree of quality supervision and organization procedure are different. In traditional DBB method, the project is more cautiously and rigorously supervised by the government officials feeling with greater responsibility. In the BOT project, procurement is more flexible in which the concessionaire can use its connections, innovation, and efficiency. Although the contactor experience and ability are the most influential factor for construction quality, the adequate degrees of supervision should be planned and organization procedure simplified when executing BOT projects since they also have influence on construction quality.","[Leh Wen-Hao; Chang, Andrew S.] Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Tainan 701, Taiwan",National Cheng Kung University,,killer@kcg.gov.tw; anschang@mail.ncku.edu.tw,,,,,,,6,0,0,2,7,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,2146,2150,,,,,,5,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119901108,0

But they both have limitations. The former is only used for descriptive analysis without considering the relationship among cities, while the latter is restricted by the preciseness of identification. Using the spatial autocorrelation analysis, this paper combines the two methods to investigate the regional and local influence of cities of different sizes from the influenced rather than influencing perspective, which also indicates the agglomeration and dispersion of different sized cities. The empirical study on China's 637 cities with urban land sizes proves the integrated approach feasible and effective. Considering the effect of scales on interaction among cities and the hierarchy of urban service functions, we analyze the issue on regional and local scales with the inverse distance and inverse distance squared as the spatial weight matrix. Regardless the own size of investigated cities, as long as most cities are surrounded by large cities, in other words association types of city sizes are mainly HH or LH, it indicates that large cities with powerful regional or local influence are dominant in the region. Otherwise, the radiation effect of central cities is limited and agglomeration of small cities is the typical characteristic of regional urban system. Cities with the most significant regional influence agglomerate in the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta and the Beijing-Tianjin metropolitan area. Among the five metropolitan areas in Eastern China, super-cities are dominant in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and the Pearl River Delta without the following development of small and medium cities; the Yangtze River Delta and Central-Southern Liaoning are characterized by the collaborative development of different sized cities led by super-cities; cities in Shandong Peninsula cooperate with each other well without a distinguished leading city. The regional influence of central cities in central and western China is limited. There are relatively large numbers of cities in central China, whose local influence domains can completely cover the whole region. At the same time, the regional influence of some (joint) central cities may increase by leaps and bounds. However, the urban size hierarchy is dominated by small cities as lacking large cities in the vast west China. Because of the limited regional and local influence of central cities, many outlying small cities have no chance to share the radiation effect of central cities. Since the influence of a specific central city on non-central cities can't be separated from that of other cities, this integrated approach of inspecting the influence domain of central cities through their influences accepted by others is not perfectly accurate. However, the method provides a new perspective for the study on city's influence domain, which is to combine the regional influence of central cities with the spatial distribution of cities of different sizes through the interaction among them.","[Liu Tao; Cao Guangzhong] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University,,liutao@pku.edu.cn; caogzh@pku.edu.cn,"LIU, Tao/B-6318-2009","LIU, Tao/0000-0002-3568-4882",,,,,29,0,0,0,10,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,1197,1204,,,,,,8,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900188,0

The indeterminacy value of mega-infrastructure is usually depicted by qualitative analysis decision in early research, which is difficult to provide efficient reference for decision-makers and often lead to wrong decision-making and resource waste. In order to overcome above shortcomings, Real Option theory was employed in this paper to develop an investment decision pricing model quantitatively, and a typical case is thus chosen to illustrate how to use the model to make investment decision. This investment decision model is believed to benefit the decision-making by providing quantitative information and a new decision-making thinking to decision-makers. The significance of this research is to quantify large infrastructure's indeterminacy value, comprehensive reflect large infrastructure's value, provide efficient reference to investment decision-makers, promote the rational allocation of limited resources and contribute to the sustainable development of society.","[Mao Liuyan] SE Univ Transportat Coll, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China,,cpmly@163.com,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,1,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,2560,2564,,,,,,5,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119901175,0

Then specific comparison was made between social security housing and its corresponding type, namely the affordable housing, in the US and the UK. It shows that the affordable housing in developed counties is abundant in subsidy and property forms, and social security housing is obscure in its target without a comprehensive allocation mechanism. Furthermore, the paper explores the reasons behind such problem in China. Lacking of housing act to protect residents' housing right will result in the dependence on the state and local authorities' unstable directions which would badly affected the benefits of households in the future.

When the energy is in emergency, the energy-efficient building is put on the agenda again. On one side, the state has increased the promotion of green building and enforced the energy efficiency standards; on the other side, supply chains of related industries which are closely related to controlling construction energy consumption will carry out energy-saving campaign, which is called green supply chain management. The green supply chain management from systematic views and integrative ideas is an effective method which can solve the conflict between the construction industry and the environment.

The conclusions are as follows. (I) In long-run there exit a cointegration relationship between housing price, GDP, interest rate and bank lending. (2) In short-term, housing price increases cause bank loans to expand which stimulates housing price to rise subsequently. There exist two-way Granger causality relationships between housing price and bank lending. (3) Innovations to housing prices have significant and persistent positive effects on bank lending which is similar to housing prices' responses to innovations to bank loans.

To assess the merits of our methods we present a-simulation study based on 2008 travel-demand-data from metropolitan Atlanta. The simulation results indicate that the use of sophisticated optimization methods instead of simple greedy matching rules substantially improve the performance of ride-sharing systems.

According to the Association of American Railroad's study, rail companies move more than 40% of the nation's total freight. Given the fact that the freight railway industry is already running without much excess capacity, better planning and scheduling tools are needed to effectively manage the scarce resources, in order to cope with the rapidly increasing demand for railway transportation. This research develops optimization-based approaches for scheduling of freight trains. Two mathematical formulations of the scheduling problem are first introduced. One assumes the path of each train, which is the track segments each train uses, is given and the other one relaxes this assumption. Several heuristics based on mixtures of the two formulations are proposed. The proposed algorithms are able to outperform two existing heuristics, namely a simple look-ahead greedy heuristic and a global neighborhood search algorithm, in terms of railway total train delay. For large networks, two algorithms based on the idea of decomposition are developed and are shown to significantly outperform two existing algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This predefined grouping of traffic movements may restrict the design of signal timings in the optimisation procedures. More recently, a lane-based design method has been developed to relax the lane markings as binary-type control variables in a mathematical programming approach. The lane marking patterns and the signal timings can then be optimised simultaneously in a unified framework. This paper presents an extension work to further relax the numbers of approach lane in traffic arms as new integer variables which can then be optimised to give optimal lane arrangement in various arms of a junction to manage the given traffic demands more efficiently. All well-defined signal timings variables in the phase-based approach as well as the lane marking and lane flow variables in the lane-based approach together with their governing constraints are all preserved in the new formulation for the reserve capacity optimisation of isolated signal-controlled junctions.

Although it has been shown that the minimization problem can be intuitively formulated as a nonlinear program, the formulation is so complex that only heuristic approaches can be used to solve the problem. In this paper, we transform the nonlinear program into an equivalent mixed-integer linear model. The linearized model is shown to have a graphical interpretation and can be solved using resource constrained shortest path algorithms. A customized Branch-and-Bound technique is then proposed to solve the resource constrained shortest path problem.

Many analytical models related to traffic flow either produce speed as a performance measure, or use speed to determine other measures such as travel time, delay, and the level of service. Mathematical models or distributions used to describe speed characteristics are very useful, especially when they are utilized in the context of simulation and theoretical derivations. Traditionally, normal, log-normal and composite distributions have been the usual mathematical distributions to characterize speed data. These traditional distributions, however, often fail to produce an adequate goodness-of-fit when the empirical distribution of speed data exhibits bimodality (or multimodality), skewness, or excess kurtosis (peakness). This often occurs when the speed data are generated from several different sub-populations, for example, mixed traffic flow conditions or mixed vehicle compositions. The traditional modeling approach also lacks the ability to explain the underlying factors that lead to different speed distribution curves. The objective of this paper is to explore the applicability of the finite mixture of normal (Gaussian) distributions to capture the heterogeneity in vehicle speed data, and thereby explaining the aforementioned special characteristics. For the parameter estimation, Bayesian estimation method via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling is adopted. The field data collected on IH-35 in Texas is used to evaluate the proposed models. The results of this study show that the finite mixture of normal distributions can very effectively describe the heterogeneous speed data, and provide richer information usually not available from the traditional models. The finite mixture modeling produces an excellent fit to the multimodal speed distribution curve. Moreover, the causes of different speed distributions can be identified through investigating the components. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to alleviate the computational load, the approximation was achieved by computing only a limited number of points in the DP state space. In the simulation experiment, the developed algorithm was compared with a recent heuristic algorithm based on de-coupling the relationship between weight and volume. It was found that the approach of this study can generate higher revenue than the de-coupling control for most of the cases. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We alternate a fast heuristic and a truncated branch and bound algorithm for computing train schedules within a short computation time, and investigate the effectiveness of using different neighborhood structures for train rerouting. The computational experiments are based on practical size instances from a dispatching area of the Dutch railway network and include complex disturbances with Multiple late trains and blocked tracks. Several small instances are solved to optimality in order to compare the heuristic solutions with the optimum. For small instances, the new tabu search algorithms find optimal solutions.

The model is applicable to a general transit network. A seat allocation model is proposed to estimate the probability of a passenger waiting at a station or on-board to get a seat. The explicit seating model allows a better differentiation of in-vehicle discomfort experienced by sitting and standing passengers. The paper proposes simulation procedures for calculating the sitting probability of each type of passengers. A heuristic solution algorithm for finding an equilibrium solution of the proposed model is developed and tested. The numerical tests show significant influences of the seat allocation model on equilibrium departure time and route choices of passengers. The proposed model is also applied to evaluate the effects of an advanced public transport information system (APTIS) on travellers' decision-making. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Given the substantial reduction in unconditional yields of the incumbent airlines on routes actually entered by Gol, we perform an econometric analysis of the determinants of pricing power along with the analysis of the pattern of price reactions by incumbent legacy carriers. Using data from a panel of routes disaggregated at the airline level, we obtain that (i) both airport and route presence are relevant at explaining pricing behavior; (ii) price responses vary significantly according to flight distance and the amount of seats supplied by the entrant, in the sense that the shorter the route, and the more the seats offered by the newcomer, the stronger the price reactions from the incumbents, with significant point estimates in the range 22-26% in yield reduction for routes as short its 350 km (approx. 195 miles).

The framework is derived from the input-process-output transformation process, as well as cost, time, and quality. Leading and lagging measures are identified from theoretical research, ISO management requirements, and a typical construction contract's articles. The developed measures are tested for validity against six projects at different construction stages. The results show that these measures can distinguish performances of different projects. Based on the evaluation outcomes, further analysis and actions could be made for improving unsatisfying parts of the construction performance.

The interbank market is represented as a network where the nodes are banks and the links are the reciprocal exposures. The lending relationships between banks and firms is represented by a bipartite graph where the nodes are of two kinds: banks and firms. From the bipartite graph, the network of cofinancing banks is extracted. We observe the leading role of large Italian banks which form a strong core in the network both in the interbank and in the lending market. The small banks act as lenders and the large as borrowers in the interbank market.

With the combination of the lean thinking and SCM in the construction industry, this paper explores that the LC plays a promote role in CSCM. The zero waste thinking of LC has a guiding role to the CSCM. LC thinking and the CSCM conform to a common sociotechnical design with the same goals, activities, and workforce capabilities, therefore the construction enterprise will be built based on the lean SCM as its core competitiveness ability. The effective integration of lean thinking and SCM will promote the CSC economy, high efficiency and quality. In addition, the structure of the supply chain organization can be promoted to be leaner, the organizational synergy can be enhanced, and ultimately promote the development of construction enterprises. Finally, this paper presents some main points when implementing the SCM under the LC term that is focus on strategic management, supplier selection and the information management in CSC. From the perspective of relationship and stakeholder perspective, CSCM with the guidance of lean thinking is necessary and feasible, and the LC is an inevitable trend in the development of CSCM.","[He, Y.; Lu, H.

The rollers used in these industries are made of Chrome Composite Leather-Clads (CCLC) covering fixed to a shaft. The CCLC coverings contain about 18 077 to 30 783 mg/kg (ppm) of chromium particles which is a carcinogenic substance. When the seed-cotton is processed in DR ginning machine, the lint cotton is contaminated with chromium dust of about 110 to 1990 ppm as total chromium, against the safe limits of 0.1 ppm. During the cotton ginning process, due to persistent rubbing of leather over stationery knife, the chromium particles are carried into lint cotton in such a way that the spun yarns contain about 100 to 200 ppm, which according to eco-standards for spun yarns should not be more than 0.1 ppm. The CCLC rollers used in cotton roller ginning machines get powdered during the ginning process as chromium specific dust. Gin and mill workers are directly exposed to this carcinogenic substance and are vulnerable to health hazards. Chromium leak threat to health effects to those who wear cotton[46]. To offset this problem, eco-friendly rubberized cotton fabric (RCF) washers / rollers both for laboratory and commercial studies have been fabricated and experimented [36]. These eco-friendly chrome-less rollers were evaluated for their performances, with a particular reference to techno-commercial and environmental aspects. In this the roller covering is made of multiple layers of fabrics bonded together using white rubber compounding which has a surface finish conducive to high ginning efficiency. On the basis of the design and development of various rollers with subsequent, performance evaluation studies, eco-friendly RCF washers/rollers have been demonstrated with a reference to techno-commercial and eco-friendliness in ginneries. These newly developed RCF rollers were successful in their operation. These were found more effective and efficient than CCLC roller ginneries. They eliminated chromium related contamination and pollution problems. This cleaner technology is a source-at-control preventive measure such that the cotton ginning and textile industries meet the requirements of environmental standards being enforced by many countries and high quality yarns and fabrics meeting international standards are produced. These ginneries have been tested commercially. This was found to be better in all aspects with reference to cotton technological properties, dye-catch properties and physical and chemical properties of CCLC rollers. It could be used commercially as an alternative in the cotton roller ginning industries for the benefit of the environment, textile and gin mill owners, traders, workers, employees of the Government and ultimately the society.","[Iyer, Vijayan Gurumurthy] Dr MGR Univ, Madras 92, Tamil Nadu, India; [Mastorakis, Nikos E.] WSEAS European Off, Athens, Greece",,"Iyer, VG (通讯作者)，Dr MGR Univ, Madras 92, Tamil Nadu, India.",vijayaniyergurumurthy@rediffmail.com; mastor@wseas.org,"Iyer, Gurumurthy/E-7261-2010; Dr., Vijayan Gurumurthy Iyer/F-7375-2018","Dr., Vijayan Gurumurthy Iyer/0000-0003-2443-6573","FACULTY DEVELOPMENT BUREAU OF ALL INDIA TECHNICAL EDUCATION , New Delhi; AICTE EMERITUS FELLOWSHIP","FACULTY DEVELOPMENT BUREAU OF ALL INDIA TECHNICAL EDUCATION , New Delhi; AICTE EMERITUS FELLOWSHIP","The authors of this research paper are thankful to FACULTY DEVELOPMENT BUREAU OF ALL INDIA TECHNICAL EDUCATION , New Delhi for awarding the prestigious faculty-specific AICTE EMERITUS FELLOWSHIP DURING 2005-2008 to the first author.",,24,1,1,0,3,WORLD SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING ACAD AND SOC,ATHENS,"AG LOANNOU THEOLOGOU 17-23, 15773 ZOGRAPHOU, ATHENS, GREECE",1790-5109,,978-960-474-091-8,REC ADV COMPUT ENG,,,2009,,,,,,,237,+,,,,,,3,"Business; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science,BKP13,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000268848300037,0

Since then, there have been numerous complaints for the inferior quality of EMMS provided by PSAs. To improve the quality of EMMS of PSAs for responsibility and accountability to PRH tenants, this paper has focused on the major principles with reference to ISO 9000 standards to which PSAs are able to fulfill in order to achieve the quality assurance towards EMMS for PRH tenants in Hong Kong. The main focus of this study with reference to ISO 9001: 2008 embraces the 'Customer Focus'; 'Leadership'; 'Involvement of People'; 'Process Approach'; 'System Approach to Management'; 'Continual Improvement'; 'Factual Approach to Decision Making'; and 'Mutually Beneficial Supplier Relationships'.

This paper proposes a novel mathematical framework that accurately quantifies oscillation characteristics for a general class of nonlinear car-following laws. This framework builds on the describing function technique from nonlinear control theory and is comprised of three modules: expression of car-following models in terms of oscillation components, analyses of local and asymptotic stabilities, and quantification of oscillation propagation characteristics. Numerical experiments with a range of well-known nonlinear car-following laws show that the proposed approach is capable of accurately predicting oscillation characteristics under realistic physical constraints and complex driving behaviors. This framework not only helps further understand the root causes of the traffic oscillation phenomenon but also paves a solid foundation for the design and calibration of realistic nonlinear car-following models that can reproduce empirical oscillation characteristics.

Increasingly sophisticated methods have been developed to model pavement deterioration and solve for optimal management strategies. However, it is unclear whether these more complex methods are providing more useful results. This paper presents a simple approach for optimizing the frequency and intensity of resurfacing for multiple highway facilities. It builds upon existing optimization methods for the single-facility, continuous-state, continuous-time problem and corresponding results, which include a threshold structure for optimal solutions. This threshold structure allows for mathematical simplifications and for a straightforward optimization approach to be applied to the multi-facility case. The approach is bottom-up rather than top-down, preserving facility-specific features to develop informative budget allocation results. Application of the approach in a case study indicates that solutions are likely to be robust to deterioration model uncertainty, which is consistent with previous facility-level findings. In addition, the methodology is shown to be robust to the form of the deterioration model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, the analysis of loop detector data from a freeway shows that the use of wavelet-based energy can effectively identify the location of an active bottleneck, the arrival time of the resulting queue at each upstream sensor location, and the start and end of a transition during the onset of a queue. Vehicle trajectories were also analyzed using 'NT and our analysis shows that the wavelet-based energies of individual vehicles can effectively detect the origins of deceleration waves and shed light on possible triggers (e.g., lane-changing).

I-80 NGSim data analysis shows that at this scale driving behaviors vary from one vehicle to the another. Then, relations between stochastic Newell's model with heterogeneous drivers and its associated macroscopic pattern are established. This proves that the mean jam spacing is the arithmetic mean of individual jam spacings whereas the mean wave speed is the harmonic mean of individual wave speeds.

The approach builds on standard signal processing techniques to effectively distinguish useful oscillation information from noise and nonstationary traffic trends. Compared with conventional time-domain methods, the proposed methodology systematically provides a range of information on oscillation properties. This paper also shows how to estimate oscillations experienced by drivers using detector data. Applications to real-world data from two sites show that the dominant oscillation period remains relatively invariant at each site when an oscillation propagates. Although the average oscillation periods displayed in detector data significantly vary across sites. the range of oscillations experienced by drivers are found to be more consistent.

The method does not require the researcher to make an a priori assumption on the type of distribution, as is required for example for mixed logit models. It requires a few assumptions to hold true, namely that the valuations to be determined are constant for each individual, and that respondents make choices according to their preferences. These assumptions allow the derivation of lower and upper bounds on the (cumulative) distribution of the values of interest over respondents, by deriving for each choice set the value(s) for which the respondent would be indifferent between the alternatives offered, and next deriving from the choice actually made the respondent's implied minimum or maximum value(s). We also provide an extension of the method that incorporates the possibility that errors are made. The method is illustrated using data from an experiment investigating the value of time and the value of statistical life. We discuss the possibility to improve the information content of stated choice experiments by optimizing the attribute levels shown to respondents, which is especially relevant because it would help in selecting the appropriate distribution for mixed logit estimates for the same data (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The hematite and limonite in the ore integrate closely with fine particles of collophanite, quartz, chamosite, calcite and chalcedony to form concentric ring structure, making the separation of the minerals extremely difficult. Since the tiny hematite crystal can not be liberated during the grinding of the ore the beneficiation can only be accomplished by recovering iron minerals aggregate with hematite as the major component. The previous research results showed that reverse flotation with fatty acid collectors could remove liberated phosphate minerals but not the quartz, chlorite and silicate minerals. This was because the gangue minerals such as quartz were contaminated by iron on the surface and there were high content of iron in some silicate minerals and high content of silicon in iron minerals, causing the floatability difference between the silicon and the iron minerals very small and thus the separation efficiency very low. Experiments were conducted to beneficiate the ore by reverse flotation with different cationic collectors. The results indicated that the flotation separation efficiency with most cationic collectors such as dodecylamine, ether amine, GE601 or GE609 was not satisfactory. However, a novel cationic collector for silicon removal, EM506 was found to be specifically selective to separate the gangue minerals from the iron ore with an increase of TFe grade from 49% to more than 58% and a recovery of TFe greater than 96%, which provided a promising approach for the beneficiation of the refractory oolitic hematite ore.","[Zhang Yushu] Wuhan Univ Technol, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; Chinese Acad Geol Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology; China Geological Survey; Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences,"Zhang, YS (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ Technol, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",zys2621@126.com,"Yan, Wu/JYO-9522-2024",,,,,,7,2,2,0,2,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-1-921712-07-4,,,,2010,,,,,,,25,+,,,,,,2,"Economics; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Management; Mining & Mineral Processing",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Mining & Mineral Processing,BVA21,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000290881600005,0

In general, the universe of RUM consistent models is much larger, even fixing some specification of V due to theoretical and practical considerations. In this paper, we explore an alternative RUM model where the summation of V and E is replaced by multiplication. This is consistent with the notion that choice makers may sometimes evaluate relative differences in V between alternatives rather than absolute differences. We develop some properties of this type of model and show that in several cases the change from an additive to a multiplicative formulation, maintaining a specification of V, may lead to a large improvement in fit, sometimes larger than that gained from introducing random coefficients in V.

In this paper it is applied to the world grain trade which is characteristic of numerous commodities and with complicated and competing logistical channels in world trade. The model provides a longer-run solution by simultaneously allowing for changes in production patterns, trade flows, and intermodal, interport and inter-reach allocation of shipments. Results show that important factors affecting shipments include: changes in demand across countries, delay costs, and the increased domestic use of grains. Findings of interest show delay costs on barges shift movements to rail, other origins and ports. Second, there is much greater uncertainty for projections for more distant periods forward. Finally, the model can be applied similarly to other commodities and/or be used to analyze spatial flows concentrated in other geographic regions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

It is demonstrated after the survey that housing industrialization is the only way of the modernization of housing construction. It has been more than 50 years since the concept of housing industrialization was proposed in China early in the first five-year plan period. However, housing industrialization has not developed substantially as there are still many problems to be solved urgently, such as low labor efficiency in housing construction process, the slow pace of overall technological progress, considerable resource consumption and serious environmental pollution. The housing industrialization must adhere to an effective and sustainable development in order to promote the fundamental conversion in housing construction from extensive and quantitative to intensive and qualitative. The modernization level of housing industry is mainly reflected in the extent of the production industrialization, components commercialization and site-assembly, and in reducing or even avoiding the wet work at site as well as achieving the site assembly of housing (including the interior decoration). Thus, the development of contemporary housing industrialization should be based on the concept of integration with drawing on the experience of the new and high-tech and manufacturing industrialization, and the content involved should be more extensive and in-depth. The concept of integration includes four aspects, which are information integration, physical integration, functional integration and production process integration. The information integration, which is the key to the development of industrialization, leads to the integration of the whole industrial system. In this paper, the definition of industrialization in our country is introduced. Secondly, the relative experiences in the developing process of the housing industrialization abroad and manufacturing industrialization are discussed. Thirdly, industrialization integration system is proposed and elaborated based on the integration theory. At last, aimed at final products, the framework of the housing industrialization and some implementing proposals are suggested in order to achieve demand-oriented market including the mode changes from the piecemeal and manual operation to the integrated industrial production, from simplified pre-fabrication to mass customized.","[Liu, X.; Du, J.] SE Univ China, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Construct Management & Real Estate, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China,,liuxiaojdz007@163.com; cathy_djnj@163.com,,,,,,,5,1,1,0,7,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,1088,1097,,,,,,10,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900170,0

Once accident occurs, the magnitude of injuries and casualties will be overwhelmingly disastrous. To examine this issue more carefully, we conducted a structured review of the literature to identify and characterize potential accidents associated with subways. A secondary goal was to use the Hazard-Barrier-Target (H-B-T) model and Swiss-cheese model to specify safety barriers which could achieve risk reduction if implemented. The detailed mechanism by which these barriers behave has been designed in this stage. Then the definition and classification of safety barrier was analyzed.

In the course of rapid urbanization, in order to guide the healthy development of real estate industry, the Government should set up regulated real estate market and guarantee it operation smoothly, and then regulate the real estate industry through land system, housing security system, tax system, real estate finance system and so on. In a word, the healthy developing real estate plays a great role in improving urbanization.","[Shi Jinhe] Chongqing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Management, Chongqing 400074, Peoples R China",Chongqing Jiaotong University,,autostone@sina.com; tony_l@cqit.edu.cn,,,,,,,5,1,1,3,13,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,573,577,,,,,,5,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900086,0

The practise has been well accepted where the buyers are bound to share the responsibility to the housing development upon the signing the Sale and Purchase Agreement. The buyers ease the developers financially through progress payments as the development progress. Despite the arrangements, the buyers seldom become the victims as developers went into difficulties. The buyers are normally left waiting for the unit and the outstanding interest payment. To better protect the buyer's interest, the Build Then Sell (BTS) concept has been introduced by the government where housing developers have to complete a housing project before selling it to buyers. The concept is different from the current conventional concept of Sell Then Build (STB). This paper analyses the existing methods of housing delivery in Malaysia. It further reviews the concept of build-then sale (BTS) and efforts made by government to promote the implementation of the concept in improving the delivery of housing in Malaysia. The paper shows that incentives provided failed to encourage the developers to adopt BTS. Despite preventing housing projects from being abandoned, the developers argue the system will burden the developer financially and may result in higher selling prices. The analysis shows that many agree that it is time to ensure only financially capable developers should be in business and the matter can only be resolved if developers are required by law to adopt the build-then-sell model.","[Yusof, Aminah Md] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Mat & Struct, Utm Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,,aminahyusof@utm.my,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,1,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,1001,1008,,,,,,8,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900158,0

We present a mixed-integer programming model whose objective is to minimize the nominal cost (the cost when no disruptions occur) while reducing the disruption risk using the p-robustness criterion (which bounds the cost in disruption scenarios). We propose a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm that is based on genetic algorithms, local improvement, and the shortest augmenting path method. Numerical tests show that the heuristic greatly outperforms CPLEX in terms of solution speed, while still delivering excellent solution quality. We demonstrate the tradeoff between the nominal cost and system reliability, showing that substantial improvements in reliability are often possible with minimal increases in cost. We also show that our model produces solutions that are less conservative than those generated by common robustness measures. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The optimization problem at each epoch is a complex multistage stochastic optimization problem: we find good solutions using a two-stage approximation.

The proposed problem is formulated as a scenario-based dynamic programming model consisting of a number of integer linear programming formulations for each single planning period, and the model can be solved efficiently by a shortest path algorithm on an acyclic network. A numerical example is carried out to illustrate the applicability of the proposed model and solution method. The numerical results show that chartering in ships may not always be a better policy for a long-term planning horizon though it is much cheaper than buying ships in the short-term. Purchasing ships seems to be a more profitable investment in the long run. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A mixed logit model is estimated to identify the preferences of air passengers for the new mode.

Broader refers to impacts beyond the geographic boundaries within which the infrastructure investments are undertaken. Approaches to estimate broader impacts in production and cost function models are evaluated. A contribution of this paper is the empirical demonstration with a cross-section of US states' manufacturing data that ignoring broader effects of a spatially lagged dependent variable can lead to mis-statements of the overall productive impacts of public infrastructure. These inaccuracies can arise because of missing indirect effects and from specification bias that may directly impact the infrastructure elasticity.

The modeling approaches consist of the stated preference method and the latent class model. The stated choice experiments were designed based on service attributes in the international airline choice context. Empirical data was collected from airline passengers who have flown from Taipei to Tokyo or from Taipei to Hong Kong. The latent class model accommodating preference heterogeneity outperforms the multinomial logit model as indication of a better approach to analyze airline choice behavior. The latent class model with individual socioeconomic and trip characteristics in segment membership functions also improved model fit relative to the corresponding latent class model without individual characteristics. The values of willingness to pay for service attribute improvements vary across international air routes and segments. Passengers are willing to pay more for better service quality. In order to develop effective marketing and operational strategies for the international air travel market, this study highlights the importance of exploring airline choice behaviors by routes and segments.

In addition, the airport under consideration is serving air carriers who have market power. We find that a profit-maximizing airport would over-invest in capacity in the sense that the marginal (social) benefit of capacity is smaller than the marginal (social) cost. This tendency of overinvestment still holds when the private airport is under the regulatory constraint of cost recovery in its aeronautical operation (the dual-till regulation). We also find that the capacity investment by a public airport will be socially efficient in the sense that the marginal benefit of capacity is equal to the marginal cost of capacity. However, somewhat surprisingly, the capacity investment of the public airport will be inefficient if it is under regulatory constraints. Specifically, the airport will also over-invest in capacity, whether it is under a single-till regulation or a dual-till regulation. Finally, it is noteworthy that the inefficiency in airport investment is driven by the interaction between the airport and the carriers who have market power. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless. a general theory able to explain how queues form and cause delays to the drivers is still missing. Typically, queue dynamics are modelled as deterministic, causal phenomena, and under rather limiting assumptions: however, especially in urban networks, these are far from being deterministic or certain. This paper presents a new probabilistic queuing model that can explain the dynamic and stochastic behaviour of queues at fixed controlled signals. The probabilistic approach allows one to capture the temporal behaviour of queues, and to measure the uncertainty of a queue state prediction by computing the evolution of its probability in time, assumed any temporal distribution of the arrivals. This can be fundamental information in. e.g., travel time estimation, network reliability, design and planning of urban areas, and to estimate complex effects that can be observed in congested networks such as spillback or gridlock. Comparison with microscopic simulation shows very good consistency both under the assumption of stationary and non-stationary arrival distributions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we provide a uniform modeling treatment to all the single allocation variants of the existing hub location problems, under the incomplete hub network design. No network structure other than connectivity is imposed on the induced hub network. Within this context, the single allocation incomplete p-hub median, the incomplete hub location with fixed costs, the incomplete hub covering, and the incomplete p-hub center network design problems are defined, and efficient mathematical formulations for these problems with O(n(3)) variables are introduced.

It is, however, very difficult for truck carriers to solve bid generation and evaluation problems in combinatorial auctions. The objective of this paper is to develop a bidding advisor to help truckload (TL) carriers overcome such challenging problems in one-shot combinatorial auctions. The proposed advisor integrates the load information in e-marketplaces with carriers' current fleet management plans, and then chooses the desirable load bundles. In this paper, a TL carrier's bid generation and evaluation problems in one-shot combinatorial auctions are formulated as a synergetic minimum cost flow problem by estimating the average synergy values between loads through the proposed approximation. The conventional solution approaches for solving the minimum cost flow problems cannot be applied to the synergetic network flow problem. Thus, we propose a column generation approach to solve this specific network flow problem. The main contribution of this paper is that a TL carrier adopting the proposed advisor can easily determine the desirable bid packages without evaluating all 2(n) - 1 possible bundles of loads, where n is the number of loads.

A comprehensive questionnaire was derived from the Loughborough University Safety Climate Assessment Toolkit and several similar surveys. Additional items were designed for an airline cabin work environment. The questionnaire was distributed to four major Taiwanese national airlines and achieved a valid response rate of 84.65%. Structural equation modeling was used to test a hypothesized model concerning safety culture and cabin safety performance. A variety of fit indices confirmed the overall model fit but not all of the paths in the model were statistically significant. The findings show that safety culture was a predictor of cabin safety outcomes. The results indicated that high management commitment was significantly related to high crewmember participation, and that safe cabin work environment was significantly related to crew-member's individual behavior. However, the findings showed no relationship between management commitment and injury incidence which means injury incidence might not be predicted by management commitment. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A Markov chain model is incorporated to capture the relationships between the entries of the transit route matrix, and to reduce the total number of unknown parameters. A Bayesian analysis is then performed to draw inference about the unknown parameters of the Markov model. Unlike many existing methods that rely on iterative algorithms, this new approach leads to a closed-form solution and is computationally more efficient. The relationship between this method and the maximum entropy approach is also investigated. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent years have seen a marked increase in cooperation between the public and private sectors for the development and operation of infrastructure for a wide range of economic activities. In sports field, public stadium belongs to quasi-public goods with the nature of public welfare and externality, which means it is appropriate to be invested in PPP mode. PPP projects are usually subjected to more risks than other traditional construction activities because of their complexity. This paper deals with the reasonable risk allocation of PPP in public stadium construction projects, which is a key factor of successful PPP application. The process of risk allocation between public and private sectors in public stadium construction projects is designed. Game theory and Tops's method based on entropy weight are used to evaluate the risk taking willingness as well as ability of each party in PPP projects. By quantitative analysis, a risk allocation framework is presented to confirm the risk taker in various conditions which would enhance the project's performance. Some suggestions on risk allocation of PPP in public stadium construction projects are also put forward.","[Cheng Min; Shi Xiajun] Shanghai Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Project Management, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China",University of Shanghai for Science & Technology,,chengmin@yeah.net; vane-shi@163.com,,,,,,,6,2,2,1,25,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,1338,1342,,,,,,5,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900208,0

Because of the burst of the global financial crisis, coal enterprises have to face more and more severe situation. Traditional coal enterprises just focus on a single or few aspects, e.g. coal mining. On condition that coal price drops a lot, these enterprises will suffer more. Project portfolio management (PPM) gradually earns more attentions these years, and it has been widely used in a large number of industries. In this paper, the authors try to discuss that use some PPM techniques to improve coal enterprise's competitive strength.

Data were collected from 22 interviewees with rich experiences in the industry. The findings of this study show that affordable housing investment have been considered by the industry practitioners as a risky business in comparison to other private rental housing investment. The main determents of the adoption of PPPs in social infrastructure project are the tenant-related factors, such as the inability of paying rent and the inability of caring the property. The study also suggests the importance of seeking strategic partnership with community-based organisation that has experiences in managing similar tenants' profiles. Current PPP guideline is also viewed as inappropriate for the affordable housing projects, but the principle of VFM framework and risk allocation in PPPs still be applied to the affordable housing projects.

Based on the review of the research on the Life Cycle Design for products in manufacturing industry, and taking the characteristics of public construction projects into consideration, this paper proposes the conception of the Life Cycle Design thinking for public construction projects, and enumerates nine strategies for the Life Cycle Design thinking, including design for reliability and safety, design for maintenance, design for human, and design for constructability, design for scale-enlarging, design for energy-efficiency, design for recycling, design for emergency and design for life cycle costs optimization. Moreover, this paper discusses the symbol of the final implementation of the Life Cycle Design thinking for public construction projects, and brings forward a process framework to carry out the Life Cycle Design thinking and fulfill the overall objective of the project. This process framework consists of the correspondence between the nine strategies above and the Objective Breakdown Structure of the construction project, the special requirements for the designers, the tendering strategies, the adoption of the constructive suggestion from constructors and even potential users, the effective and efficient communication, and the normal operation of public construction projects as well.","[Zhao, X.

Against the background of mineral oil tax remission in Switzerland providers or dealers of energy crops or biofuels in developing countries can do a legally non-binding check if their products qualify for this remission. For this purpose a web-based calculation model is developed that does a lightweight material flow analysis. The data needed for the evaluation process consists of two parts. The first part is data provided by the user in the web-based questionnaire. The second part contains LCI material and energy flow data and impact factors from the ecoinvent database and other data from literature and scientific studies. The LCI data is imported into the database via an XML interface. To ensure easy and worldwide accessibility the SQCB is implemented as a web-based, database-assisted application. It was developed as a module for the web content management system Drupal. The evaluation process covers the whole lifecycle of the biofuel including Cultivation, further processing, transport and usage. The user has to provide information about the crop type, the country, the climatic circumstances, the used fertilizers and pesticides and energy and material data for further processing. In the first calculation step the emissions and material flows for the given scenario are calculated for each phase. In the next step these amounts are rated for different methodologies. The results of each phase are cumulated, related to reference data and visualized.","[Ziep, Tobias; Wohlgemuth, Volker] Univ Appl Sci, HTW Berlin, Ind Environm Informat Unit, Berlin, Germany; [Emmenegger, Mireille Faist; Reinhard, Juergen; Zah, Rainer] Empa, Technol & Soc Lab, Dubendorf, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science & Technology (EMPA),"Ziep, T (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci, HTW Berlin, Ind Environm Informat Unit, Berlin, Germany.",,,,SECO (Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs),SECO (Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs),This development is funded and initiated by the SECO (Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs).

With ongoing advances in pricing technology and ways of communicating information to prospective users, state-dependent congestion pricing is becoming practical. But it is still rare or nonexistent in many potential applications. One explanation is that people dislike uncertainty about how much they will pay. To explore this idea, a model of reference-dependent preferences is developed based on Koszegi and Rabin (2006). Using a facility yields an intrinsic utility and a gain-loss utility measured relative to the probability distribution over states of utility outcomes. Two types of preferences are analyzed: bundled preferences in which gains and losses are perceived for overall utility, and unbundled preferences in which gains and losses are perceived separately for the toll and other determinants of utility. Tolls are chosen to maximize total expected utility plus revenues. With bundled preferences the toll is set above the Pigouvian level when usage conditions are good, and below it when conditions are bad, in order to reduce fluctuations in utility. With unbundled preferences the direction of toll adjustment is less clear and depends on whether supply or demand is variable. For both types of preferences tolls are sensitive to the strength of gain-loss utility. If gain-loss utility is moderately strong, a state-independent toll can be optimal. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We implement the proposed computational method on a representative traffic flow scenario to illustrate the exactness of the analytical solution. We also show that the proposed scheme can handle more complex scenarios including traffic lights or moving bottlenecks.

The problem is shown to be a generalized version of the network design problem and the multi-period network design problem. A heuristic based on radial basis functions is used to solve the problem for continuous link expansion with congestion effects. The second model is a link investment deferral option set, which decomposes the network investment deferral option into individual, interacting link or project investments. This model is a project selection problem under uncertainty, where each link or project can be deferred such that the expanded net present value is maximized. The option is defined in such a way that a lower bound can be solved using an exact method based on multi-option least squares Monte Carlo simulation.

By formulating and estimating an Almost Ideal Demand System and a set of price response equations for competing carriers, we investigate empirically the degree of substitutability between the services provided by Full Service Airlines (FSAs) and Low Cost Carriers (LCCs). Our results indicate that there is a significant differentiation in services provided by FSAs and LCCs. As a result, the presence of LCCs alone will not ensure healthy competition in a market. Therefore, it is important for public policy makers to attempt to maintain competition between FSAs even in the markets where LCCs have substantial market shares. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The SCTM consists of five operational modes corresponding to different congestion levels of the freeway segment. Each mode is formulated as a discrete time bilinear stochastic system. A set of probabilistic conditions is proposed to characterize the probability of occurrence of each mode. The overall effect of the five modes is estimated by the joint traffic density which is derived from the theory of finite mixture distribution. The SCTM captures not only the mean and standard deviation (SD) of density of the traffic flow, but also the propagation of SD over time and space. The SCTM is tested with a hypothetical freeway corridor simulation and an empirical study. The simulation results are compared against the means and SDs of traffic densities obtained from the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) of the modified cell transmission model (MCTM). An approximately two-miles freeway segment of Interstate 210 West (I-210W) in Los Ageles, Southern California, is chosen for the empirical study. Traffic data is obtained from the Performance Measurement System (PeMS). The stochastic parameters of the SCTM are calibrated against the flow-density empirical data of I-210W. Both the SCTM and the MCS of the MCTM are tested. A discussion of the computational efficiency and the accuracy issues of the two methods is provided based on the empirical results. Both the numerical simulation results and the empirical results confirm that the SCTM is capable of accurately estimating the means and SDs of the freeway densities as compared to the MCS.

Dynamic models predict multi-day activity patterns of individuals taking into account dynamic needs as well as day-varying preferences and time-budgets. We formulate an ordered-logit model of dynamic activity-agenda-formation decisions and show how one-day observation probabilities can be derived from the model as a function of the model's parameters and, with that, how parameters can be estimated using standard loglikelihood estimation. A scale parameter cannot be identified because information on within-person variability is lacking in one-day data. An application of the method to data from a national travel survey illustrates the method. A test on simulated data indicates that, given a pre-set scale, the parameters can be identified and that estimates are robust for a source of heterogeneity not captured in the model. This result indicates that dynamic activity-based models of the kind considered here can be estimated from data that are less costly to collect and that support the large sample sizes typically required for travel-demand modeling. We conclude therefore that the proposed approach opens up a way to develop large-scale dynamic activity-based models of travel demand. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The semi-Bayesian D-criterion value of a design is then calculated as the average value of the D-errors over all the draws taken. The traditional way to take draws from a distribution is to use the Pseudo-Monte Carlo approach. However, other sampling approaches are available as well. Examples are Quasi-Monte Carlo approaches using Halton sequences, Faure sequences, modified Latin hypercube sampling and extensible shifted lattice points, a Gauss-Hermite quadrature approach and a method using spherical-radial transformations. Not much is known in general about which sampling scheme is most efficient for calculating semi-Bayesian D-errors when constructing efficient stated choice designs. In this study, we compare the performance of these approaches under various scenarios and identify the most efficient sampling scheme for each situation. The method based on a spherical-radial transformation is shown to outperform the other methods when small numbers of draws are used. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, we develop a systematic approach to constructing kinematic wave solutions to the Riemann problem of merging traffic flow in supply-demand space. In the new framework, Riemann solutions on a link consist of an interior state and a stationary state, subject to admissible conditions such that there are no positive and negative kinematic waves on the upstream and downstream links, respectively In addition, various distribution schemes in Cell Transmission Models are considered entropy conditions In the proposed analytical framework, we prove that the stationary states and boundary fluxes exist and are unique for the Riemann problem for both fair and constant distribution schemes We also discuss two types of invariant merge models, in which local and discrete boundary fluxes are the same as global and continuous ones With numerical examples, we demonstrate the validity of the analytical solutions of interior states, stationary states, and corresponding kinematic waves Discussions and future studies are presented in the conclusion section.

Yet it has never been proven, to the best of our knowledge, whether excluding inside queues yields sub-optimal network performance or, in other words, allowing inside queues can actually further reduce the system travel cost Moreover, it is not clear whether an optimal control policy derived from efficiency considerations can also be a fair policy to all road users. This paper provide answers to these questions in the context of a monocentric network. By analyzing the structure of the access control problem considering all feasible policies (with/without inside queues), we show that the minimal system cost realizable by access control can be obtained without directly solving a non-convex optimization program, and can indeed always be achieved by a control policy excluding all of the inside queues. These optimal policies are defined by a polyhedral set and a Finite Generation Algorithm can be applied to derive the analytical form of this set The optimal policies are not unique in general, thus making it possible to achieve both minimal system cost and fairness simultaneously.

We assume that the choice sets contain all paths connecting each origin-destination pair. Although this is behaviorally questionable, we make this assumption in order to avoid bias in the econometric model. These sets are in general impossible to generate explicitly. Therefore, we propose an importance sampling approach to generate subsets of paths suitable for model estimation. Using only a subset of alternatives requires the path utilities to be corrected according to the sampling protocol in order to obtain unbiased parameter estimates. We derive such a sampling correction for the proposed algorithm. Estimating models based on samples of alternatives is straightforward for some types of models, in particular the multinomial logit (MNL) model. In order to apply MNL for route choice, the utilities should also be corrected to account for the correlation using, for instance, a path size (PS) formulation. We argue that the PS attribute should be computed based on the full choice set. Again, this is not feasible in general, and we propose a new version of the PS attribute derived from the sampling protocol, called Expanded PS. Numerical results based on synthetic data show that models including a sampling correction are remarkably better than the ones that do not. Moreover, the Expanded PS shows good results and outperforms models with the original PS formulation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We also consider that service rates are not identical but may vary among servers and are dependent upon incident characteristics: corresponding districting and dispatching problems are also integrated in the location model. The model is applied using real data for locating freeway service patrol vehicles and results are compared with existing coverage and median models.

A statistical model for space-mean speed measured by an ILD is developed, upon which a Bayesian analysis is carried out to estimate vehicular speed. This results in a set of recursive formulae which is analytically nice and neat. The incurred computational cost for updating the estimate of vehicular speed is kept to be a minimum. As a by-product, a simple method for the calibration of the effective vehicle length of an ILD is also developed. The proposed method is illustrated using simulation studies and a practical example.

Measurement, forecasting, and spatial sampling are three main sources of errors introducing uncertainty into the process. The first two uncertainties are captured in the infrastructure management literature. However, the third one has not been recognized and quantified. This paper presents a methodology where the spatial sampling uncertainty in question is captured and the sample size is incorporated as a decision variable in an optimization framework. An illustrative realistic example is presented to demonstrate an application of the developed framework. The results indicate that by not addressing the sampling uncertainty and decisions, the optimum IM&R decisions would not be achieved, and consequently, marked unnecessary overspending could take place.

The formation of transportation strategy has to be undertaken with a view to satisfying as far as possible, free of congestion and has minimal levels of air and noise pollution. In relation to this, most of the concessionaires are ambivalent about assessing the worth of investment return with regards to infrastructure project because of the multi-faceted issues involved in evaluation of such investment. Thus, an adjusted financial evaluation is introduced with application of Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) as main tools to evaluate the project. This approach is applied to prove the financial viability and feasibility of PMT1 project according to respective proposed business plan.

Thus, actions of stakeholders would ultimately affect the efficiency of a housing policy. From a viewpoint of stakeholders' analysis, an analysis framework was developed to evaluate the social impacts of current housing policies. The results shows that there is no effective interest balance mechanic in current housing policies thus leading to asymmetric interest pattern, and alienation of stakeholders' action prohibit the effects of housing policies.

The overlapping and simultaneous occurrences of different type of disasters bring the difficulties for the prevention and emergency response work, and the domestic economic and people's life and property have faced terrible attacks. Therefore, it can be seen that the natural disaster resistance work is urgent and indispensable. Thus, the establishment of risk management system of natural disaster resistence is necessary and sigfinicant. This paper firstly adopts natural disaster linear programming theory to optimize the costs that each industry has for natural disasters resistance; then AHP method is used for categorizing the industries exposed to natural disasters so as to determine the major ones for disaster prevention and mitigation. Finally, a series of management measures are recommended. By establishing natural disasters management system, developing effective techniques and drafting specified measures, the loss caused by natural disasters can be minimized.","[Jiang Huai; Chang Yuan] Harbin Ins Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China",,,huaij-05@163.com; guanxzr@bicea.edu.cn; changyuan82@yahoo.cn,"Liu, Chang/HOC-0971-2023",,,,,,3,0,0,1,6,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,1430,1434,,,,,,5,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900224,0

Hong Kong SAR has been adopting a Linked Exchange Rate (LER) in relation to the US dollar since 1983, which allows the US-HK exchange rate to fluctuate within a narrow band. Despite numerous other factors affecting property prices (such as land supply, interest rate, per-capita income, etc.), empirical evidence seem to indicate that property prices indices in Hong Kong have moved in relation to exchange rate indices. Yet, from regression analysis, there are still different levels of influence for commercial and residential properties.

In this paper a threshold model of social contagion, originally proposed in the network science literature, is presented to characterize this social influence in the evacuation decision making process. Initiated by a single agent, the condition of a cascade when a portion of the population decides to evacuate has been derived from the model. Simulation models are also developed to investigate the effects of community mixing patterns and the initial seed on cascade propagation and the effect of previous time-steps considered by the agents and the strength of ties on average cascade size. Insights related to social influence include the significant role of mixing patterns among communities in the network and the role of the initial seed on cascade propagation. Specifically, faster propagation of warning is observed in community networks with greater inter-community connections. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This macroscopic approach is based on a microscopic model, that considers smart pedestrians who rationally interact and anticipate the future. This leads to a forward-backward structure in time. We focus on two-population interactions and validate the modeling with simple examples. Two complementary classes of problems are addressed, namely the case of crowd aversion and the one of congestion. In both cases we describe the model and present numerical solvers (based on the optimization formulation and the partial differential equations respectively). Finally we present numerical tests involving anticipation phenomena and complex group behaviors such as lane formation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, relatively little research attention has been devoted to the consideration of relations between greening the supply chain, green innovation, environmental performance and competitive advantage. Hence, this paper aims to bridge this gap by providing empirical evidence to encourage companies to implement green supply chain and green innovation in order to improve their environmental performance, and to enhance their competitive advantage in the global market. A model is constructed to link the aforementioned constructs. Data were collected through a questionnaire-based survey across 124 companies from eight industry sectors in Taiwan. The data are analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling and the results from the final measurement model are used to evaluate the structural model that verifies the significance of the proposed relationships. A prominent result of this study is that greening the supplier through green innovation contributes significant benefits to the environmental performance and competitive advantage of the firm.

Measuring travel times on a real time basis is also a perfect indicator of the level of service in a road link, and therefore is a useful measurement for traffic managers in order to improve traffic operations on the network. In conclusion, accurate travel time measurement is one of the key factors in traffic management systems. This paper presents a new approach for measuring travel times on closed toll highways using the existing surveillance infrastructure. In a closed toll system, where toll plazas are located on the on/off-ramps and each vehicle is charged a particular fee depending on its origin and destination, the data used for toll collection can also be valuable for measuring mainline travel times on the highway. The proposed method allows estimating mainline travel times on single sections of highway (defined as a section between two neighboring ramps) using itineraries covering different origin-destinations. The method provides trip time estimations without investing in any kind of infrastructure or technology. This overcomes some of the limitations of other methods, like the information delay and the excess in the travel time estimation due to the accumulation of exit times (i.e. the time required to travel along the exit link plus the time required to pay the fee at the toll gate). The results obtained in a pilot test on the AP-7 toll highway, near Barcelona in Spain, show that the developed methodology is sound. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Since a temporal shipment consolidation policy is being implemented, the inventory requirements at the vendor are affected by the timing and quantity of shipment release. The vendor's problem is to determine an integrated policy for inventory replenishment and shipment release and to set its parameters. We develop analytical models for computing such integrated policies where it is economical to use common carriage for outbound transportation. We propose algorithmic approaches to set the optimal policy parameter values. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast to the travel time budget (TTB) models that consider only the reliability aspect defined by TTB, this new model hypothesizes that travelers are willing to minimize their mean-excess travel times (MEET) defined as the conditional expectation of travel times beyond the TTB. As a route choice criterion, METT can be regarded as a combination of the buffer time measure that ensures the reliability aspect of on-time arrival at a confidence level a, and the tardy time measure that represents the unreliability aspect of encountering worst travel times beyond the acceptable travel time allowed by TTB in the distribution tail of 1 - alpha. It addresses both questions of how much time do I need to allow? and how bad should I expect from the worse cases? Therefore, travelers' route choice behavior can be considered in a more accurate and complete manner in a network equilibrium framework to reflect their risk preferences under an uncertain environment. The METE model is formulated as a variational inequality problem and solved by a route-based traffic assignment algorithm via the self-adaptive alternating direction method. Some qualitative properties of the model are rigorously proved. Illustrative examples are also presented to demonstrate the characteristics of the model as well as its differences compared to the recently proposed travel time budget models.

In this context, carriers adopt hubbing strategies when costs are sufficiently low, and asymmetric equilibria where one carrier chooses a FC strategy and the other chooses a HS strategy may arise. Quite interestingly, flight frequency can become excessive under HS network configurations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

An empirical study was conducted among Taiwanese airline passengers using the technology acceptance model (TAM) as the basic research model while considering additional factors for further analysis such as external stimuli, perceived service quality, perceived behavioral control, need for service, and perceived risk. The findings revealed that attitude and external stimuli best explain passengers' behavioral intentions to use the kiosks, whereas perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use have little effect on their intentions. These findings suggest that airlines in Taiwan should persuade passengers to acquire a more positive attitude toward the new check-in kiosks and should consider implementation of incentive strategies in encouraging passengers to adopt the self check-in service.

The DNL has been semantically enriched with a bilingual eco- ontology and corresponding algorithms (semantic search, reasoning, consistency checking). The main purpose of the ontology is to allow open and intuitive search facilities for non-expert users. However so far there is no semantic support for temporal queries included yet. Spatio-thematic information is stored in an OWL/DL ontology. Therefore an approach for temporal information is searched which fits seamless in the existing environment. Temporal information is available in the DNL database, however it is often given in a very coarse granularity (months or years), sometimes it is entirely missing. As a consequence the challenge of semantic support for temporal queries in the DNL, also includes handling vague and incomplete temporal information. The work presented here, starts from typical temporal user queries (which were collected in use cases) and checks different approaches for their usability in our real-world eco-database DNL.

Finally, it draws following conclusions through the study: (1) From the descriptive statistics and trend analysis, the fluctuating relationship in two markets is consistent, except for a great fluctuations in 1991-1994. The fluctuations gradually smooth during the rest. (2) The cointegration analysis and vector error correction (VEC) model shows a balanced relationship at the length of period exists in the two markets; the general interaction of time-delay is 2 to 4 years. Actual utilization of foreign investment is on the positive effect of real estate investment, and is the negative effects of real estate sales. But real estate investment and sales are being reflected positively by bank loans. (3) Granger causality test shows that the growth rate of real estate investment, real estate sales and growth rates were both cause and effect relationship between the use of foreign capital. The bank loan is with a one-way causal relationship to the property market, but the contrary does not hold.

This method possessed certain operability and provided a new thought for the ratemaking of inherent defect insurance.","[Tang Bo; Zhang Xing] SE Univ China, Dept Construct Management & Real Estate, Sch Civil Engn, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China,,tangbo2004606@126.com; zhx@seu.edu.cn,,,,,,,5,8,8,0,10,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,2010,2015,,,,,,6,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119901086,0

An abundance of research has been done to understand the time-varying characteristics of freight rate volatility, yet few have discussed the determinants of freight volatility. We therefore examine freight volatility against the changes in fleet size and other shipping market variables over January 1973-October 2010. The study employs a two-step model specification. The first step is the measurement of freight rate volatility through an AR-GARCH model; the second step is the analysis of the relationship between freight rate volatility and fleet size growth through a GMM regression. We confirm similar findings in the literature that freight rate volatility is time varying. Furthermore, the results reveal that the change in fleet size positively affects freight rate volatility, while the spot rate volatility of Capesize dry bulk exhibits a stronger reaction to the change in fleet size.

There have been many real world examples in which a single catastrophic event has simultaneously degraded the capabilities of several suppliers leading to considerable erosion of profits and goodwill for a company. However, the literature on analytical models that account for the dependence nature of disruptions and its impact on supply chain performance is sparse. In this paper, we consider an m-manufacturer, 1-retailer, newsvendor inventory system with stochastically dependent manufacturing capacities, caused by random disruptions that may simultaneously inflict damages to the capacities of the manufacturers. We develop the structural/analytical properties of key performance measures and optimal inventory policies for the multi-source and assembly inventory systems. We show that stochastic dependence in disruptions can have opposite effects on system performance in the multi-source and assembly systems. While risk diversification is preferred in the multi-source system, risk concentration is preferred in the assembly system. Our results also suggest that, if the retailer ignores the effect of dependent disruptions, then in the multi-source structure, it would underestimate the cost, overestimate the fill rate, and order more units than the optimum; however, in the assembly structure, the opposite would happen. We perform a comprehensive numerical study to validate our analytical results and generate useful managerial and operational insights for effective risk management of supply chains in the presence of dependent supply uncertainty.

The framework is theoretically sound, operational, and comprises a large body of models presented so far in the literature. Working within the generic node model class of Tampere et al. (2011), the approach is developed in two steps. First, building on the incremental transfer principle of Daganzo et al. (1997), an incremental node model for general road intersections is developed. A limitation of this model (as of the original incremental transfer principle) is that it does not capture situations where the increase of one flow decreases another flow, e.g., due to conflicts. In a second step, the new model is therefore supplemented with the capability to describe such situations. A fixed-point formulation of the enhanced model is given, solution existence and uniqueness are investigated, and two solution algorithms are developed. The feasibility and realism of the new approach is demonstrated through a synthetic and a real case study. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, regarding the airport industry, no significant attention has been paid in developing an airport-specific estimation methodology rather than adapting the procedures applied to other industries. The lack of comparable airport data is one of the causes which could explain the scarcity of this literature in the past, as well as the use of very limited approaches to explain airport technology. This paper tries to overcome these limitations by developing an airport-specific methodology to estimate a multi-output long-run cost function using an unbalanced pooled database on 161 airports worldwide. The specification of hedonically-adjusted aircraft operations, domestic and international passengers, cargo and commercial revenues in the output vector, as well as the calculation of input prices are discussed. Both technical and allocative inefficiencies are specified in the model using a Stochastic Frontier method that has been estimated through Bayesian Inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.

Congestion pricing under uncertainty has been relatively little studied. In this paper, we review the literature on deterministic congestion pricing and introduce possible sources of uncertainty for a simple bottleneck. We show that, when prices involve exogenous uncertainty that is independent of the central authority and of individual drivers, total social cost may be expressed in closed form as a function of departure time and uncertainty. We also show that there is a class of financial derivatives based on congestion that have the potential to reduce total social cost. In particular, such derivatives are shown to have the potential to alter drivers' departure behavior and reduce drivers' risks of high variance in trip costs, including congestion tolls. Finally, numerical formulations and examples are given to justify the robustness of our results with respect to more general congestion uncertainty. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper categorizes tours into three classes based on their tour efficiency and variable costs structure. Travel time/distance between customers and depot is found to be a crucial factor that exacerbates the negative impacts of congestion. Travel time variability is a significant factor only when travel time between depot and customers is considerable in relation to the maximum tour duration. For each customer, it is possible to define a dimensionless coefficient that provides an indication of the relative impact of congestion on routing constraints. Congestion also affects carriers' cost structure, as congestion worsens the relative weight of wages and overtime escalates and the relative weight of distance related costs decrease.

Flexibility comes from the use of a very large number of parameters without fixed dimension. Priors are placed on the parameters to avoid over-fitting and sensibly guide the search in model space for appropriate data-driven model choice. Modern computational, high dimensional search methods (in particular Markov Chain Monte Carlo) then allow us to search the parameter space. This paper introduces the application of BART, Bayesian Additive Regression Trees, to modelling trip durations. We have survey data on characteristics of trips in the Austin area. We seek to relate the trip duration to features of the household and trip characteristics. BART enables one to make inferences about the relationship with minimal assumptions and user decisions.

When traveling on-board vehicles, these phones can be used to accurately provide position and velocity of the vehicle as probe traffic sensors. This article presents a new technique to incorporate mobile probe measurements into highway traffic flow models, and compares it to a Kalman filtering approach. These two techniques are both used to reconstruct traffic density. The first technique modifies the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards partial differential equation (PDE) to incorporate a correction term which reduces the discrepancy between the measurements (from the probe vehicles) and the estimated state (from the model). This technique, called Newtonian relaxation, nudges the model to the measurements. The second technique is based on Kalman filtering and the framework of hybrid systems, which implements an observer equation into a linearized flow model. Both techniques assume the knowledge of the fundamental diagram and the conditions at both boundaries of the section of interest. The techniques are designed in a way in which does not require the knowledge of on- and off-ramp detector counts, which in practice are rarely available. The differences between both techniques are assessed in the context of the Next Generation Simulation program (NGSIM), which is used as a benchmark data set to compare both methods. They are finally tested with data from the Mobile Century experiment obtained from 100 Nokia N95 mobile phones on I-880 in California on February 8, 2008. The results are promising, showing that the proposed methods successfully incorporate the GPS data in the estimation of traffic. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

These remind us 'Labor Contract Law' may affect employment indirectly by enforcing other regulation measures such as minimum wage regulation.","[Ding Shouhai] Renmin Univ, Sch Agr & Rural Dev, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,,dingshouhai@163.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,6,WORLD ACAD UNION-WORLD ACAD PRESS,LIVERPOOL,"113, ACADEMIC HOUSE, MILL LANE, WAVERTREE TECHNOLOGY PARK, LIVERPOOL, L13 4 AH, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84626-075-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,36,39,,,,,,4,"Business, Finance; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BQC56,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000280694900009,0

Now, total 15 mega-cities in China have submitted construction planning of URT system and another 15 mega-cities are under preparation. By 2010, total 55 lines (1500km) of URT will be put into operation in 15 cities of PRC, with total investment over 600 billion RMB. From 2010 to 2015, another 1700km URT lines will be under construction. In long-future, by 2050, China will own an URT system with rail-length over 4500km(1), which means pretty huge capital investment. Due to intensive investment, capital shortage appears to be the biggest barrier to the Government. With such a background, as a good alternative to public financing, PPP (Public Private Partnership) is testified far more than a pure financing method. So PPP is also helpful to deliver Urban Rail Transit products. This thesis is based upon the principle that public sector in China has heavy financial pressure, while social private investors would like to win as much profit as possible in URT this new field, by means of involvement or/and investment. Therefore, I summarize here several possible PPP contract models which are applicable to URT projects in China.

The dynamic interdependent behaviour of social, economic, material and informational resource systems within eco-industrial settings that support the built environment life cycle supply chains can be studied at the supply chain level. The impact of megaprojects is significant and holds promise to explore the impact of decisions on various systems as it combines project and system boundaries. Megaprojects considered as major events within systems can produce critical revolutionary impacts on the systems within which they are embedded. The decisions that are made on megaprojects are central to risk management. Typically major infrastructure projects are procured through a form of public private partnership (PPP). The core principle of PPP is value for money which refers to the best available outcome attempting to take account of all benefits, costs and risks over the whole life of the procurement. In this paper the focus is on Australia where there has been considerable activity in the use of PPPs. With recent national infrastructure packages proposed to stimulate the economy due to the global financial crisis, decision modelling on risks is a relevant and critical matter not only in practice but also in the research community. PPPs encourage the whole-of-lifecycle approach in the procurement and management of public sector assets by transparently recognising the costs and risks associated with the whole life of the required service or facility, thus integrated whole of life supply chains can be considered. By creating a single point of responsibility for an entire project from inception through operation, a strong incentive is created for thinking about the effects that a design or construction decision will have on the effectiveness and efficiency of managing and maintaining a facility during its operational life. The decision to procure holistic supply chains becomes a much more viable commercial reality in the PPP environment than previously considered in the usual commercial construction spot transactional approach. These types of decisions tend to be imprecise, approximate and complex requiring justification and reasoning logic rather than the classical 'truth' logic. The purpose of this paper is to develop a theoretical decision framework which combines interdependency and multi-valued logic for supply chain procurement modelling..","[London, Kerry; Jin Xiaohua] Deakin Univ, Sch Architecture & Bldg, Fac Sci & Technol, Geelong, Vic 3217, Australia",Deakin University,,kerry.london@deakin.edu.au; xiaohua.jin@dealcin.edu.au,"London, Kerry Anne/ADJ-5722-2022; Jin, Xiao-Hua/N-1483-2018","London, Kerry Anne/0000-0003-4470-1282; Jin, Xiao-Hua/0000-0003-0877-9533",,,,,33,0,0,0,17,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,1691,1700,,,,,,10,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119901035,0

The result is a network structure in which consumers are the nodes, and links are given by local and global interactions. In particular, links between agents belonging to different social groups can only be given by the presence of global interaction whereas local interaction creates a link between agents of the same class.

Some recommendations for improving the performance of legislative framework for construction safety in China are put forward in this paper based on comprehensive literature review and comparison research. All of the studies are based on the current safety legislation situations in construction industry in China, compared with those of developed countries and regions. At first, the current legislative framework relating to construction safety in China is introduced. Then comparatively analyses on it with those of USA, UK and Hong Kong are undertaken. The advanced experiences in these developed countries and regions are summarized and then recommendations relevant to China are put forward.

This method resolves the problem of no-linear of each influencing factor. With applying the function of self-learning and self-adapt based on the additional momentum algorithm, the convergence rate of neural network can be improved.

In this paper, a confidence interval estimation procedure for path flow estimator (PFE) is developed for assessing the quality of O-D trip tables estimated from traffic counts. The confidence interval estimation consists of two parts: (i) a generalized demand scale (GDS) measure for quantifying the intrinsic underspecified nature of the O-D estimation problem at various spatial levels, and (ii) an error bound to quantify the contribution of input errors (traffic counts) to the estimation results. Numerical results using PFE as the O-D estimator show that the proposed confidence interval estimation procedure is able to separate the two sources of uncertainty in constructing the confidence intervals at various spatial levels. Simulation results also confirm that the proposed quality measure indeed contain the true estimates within the defined confidence intervals.

Based on 53 oscillation cases analyzed, we find that oscillations can be originated by either lane-changing maneuvers (LCMs) or car-following (CF) behavior. LCMs were predominantly responsible for oscillation formations in the absence of considerable horizontal or vertical curves, whereas oscillations formed spontaneously near roadside work on an uphill segment. Regardless of the trigger, the features of oscillation propagations were similar in terms of propagation speed, oscillation duration, and amplitude. All observed cases initially exhibited a precursor phase, in which slow-and-go motions were localized. Some of them eventually transitioned into a well-developed phase, in which oscillations propagated upstream in queue. LCMs were primarily responsible for the transition, although some transitions occurred without LCMs. Our findings also suggest that an oscillation has a regressive effect on car-following behavior: a deceleration wave of an oscillation affects a timid driver (characterized by larger response time and/or minimum spacing) to become less timid and an aggressive driver less aggressive, although this change may be short-lived. An extended framework of Newell's CF model is able to describe the regressive effect with two additional parameters with reasonable accuracy, as verified using vehicle trajectory data.

In addition, however, there exist other elements in the system that present a trade-off between the interests of users and operators that have not received attention in the literature, such as the optimal selection of a fare payment system and a designed running speed (i.e., the cruising speed that buses maintain in between two consecutive stops). Alternative fare payment methods (e.g., on-board and off-board, payment by cash, magnetic strip or smart card) have different boarding times and capital costs, with the more efficient systems such as a contactless smart card imposing higher amounts of capital investment. Based on empirical data from several Bus Rapid Transit systems around the world, we also find that there is a positive relationship between infrastructure cost per kilometre and commercial speed (including stops), achieved by the buses, which we further postulate as a linear relationship between infrastructure investment and running speed. Given this context, we develop a microeconomic model for the operation of a bus corridor that minimises total cost (users and operator) and has five decision variables: frequency, capacity of vehicles, station spacing, fare payment system and running speed, thus extending the traditional framework. Congestion, induced by bus frequency, plays an important role in the design of the system, as queues develop behind high demand bus stops when the frequency is high. We show that (i) an off-board fare payment system is the most cost effective in the majority of circumstances: (ii) bus congestion results in decreased frequency while fare and bus capacity increase, and (iii) the optimal running speed grows with the logarithm of demand.

We analyse the value drivers for both airlines and airports by studying the determinants of the Tobin's Q. On average the market valuation of airport operators is higher than that of carriers. On the whole we show that ownership concentration has a positive impact, while size and state ownership are, on average, detrimental for the market valuation. Further, other industry-specific variables are statistically significant. Airport valuation is positively influenced by size, return on assets and the growth in terms of number of passengers. Airlines valuation is statistically higher for low-cost companies, while age and route number have a negative impact on market valuation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The model introduces a fail-to-sit probability at boarding points with travel costs based on the likelihood of travelling seated or standing. Priority rules are considered; in particular it is assumed that standing on-board passengers will occupy any available seats of alighting passengers before newly boarding passengers can fill any remaining seats. At the boarding point passengers are assumed to mingle, meaning that FIFO is not observed. as is the case for many crowded bus and metro stops, particularly in European countries. The route choice considers the common lines problem and an user equilibrium solution is sought through a Markov type network loading process and the method of successive averages. The model is first illustrated with a small example network before being applied to the inner zone of London's underground network. The effect of different values passengers might attach to finding a seat are illustrated. Applications of the model for transit planning as well as for information provision at the journey planner stage are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The planning objective is to minimize the cost of the entire supply chain of biofuel from biowaste feed-stock fields to end users over the entire planning horizon, simultaneously satisfying demand, resource, and technology constraints. This model is used to evaluate the economic potential and infrastructure requirements for bioethanol production from eight waste bio-mass resources in California as a case study. It is found that, through careful supply chain design, biowaste-based ethanol production can be sustained at a compatible cost around $1.1 per gallon. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This is in particular true for the EU initiative promoting the development of the trans-European transport (TEN-T) networks. As projects within this initiative affect regions in different countries, incentive compatible financing schemes cannot be designed without knowing where the benefits accrue. Furthermore, this initiative is also intended to contribute to the cohesion objective on a community scale, and only with regional impact studies one can assess to which extent these objectives are attained. As standard cost-benefit analysis is unable to assign benefits to eventual beneficiaries in the economy, we develop and apply a spatial computable general equilibrium (SCGE) model as a suitable alternative. The model has a household sector and a production sector with two industries, one producing local goods, the other producing tradables. Regions interact through costly trade, with trade costs depending, among others, on the state of the infrastructure. New links reduce trade costs, which changes trade flows, production, goods prices and factor prices and thus eventually the welfare of households in different regions. We present the formal structure of the model, the calibration procedure and the data sources for calibrating the model and estimating the trade cost reductions stemming from new transport links. As the model is only able to quantify effects related to trade in goods we also suggest a simplified approach to add effects stemming from passenger transport. We apply the methods to a policy experiment related to the TEN-T priority list of projects. We quantify project by project the social return, check whether significant benefit spillovers to countries not involved in financing might prevent realization of projects in spite of their respective profitability from European wide point of view, and finally we evaluate the contribution of each project to the spatial cohesion objective. Our results confirm sceptical views on EU involvement in infrastructure policy that have been expressed in the literature. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

These two lane-based planning strategies complement one another by increasing capacity in specific directions through the evacuation network. A bi-level network optimization model is formulated, in which the upper level aims at optimizing the network evacuation performance subject to the lane-reversal and crossing-elimination constraints and the lower level conveys a cell transmission-based dynamic traffic assignment problem. An integrated Lagrangian relaxation and tabu search method is devised for approximating optimal problem solutions through an iterative optimization-evaluation process.

Such reliable paths help travelers better plan their trips to prepare for the risk of running late in the face of stochastic travel times. Optimal solutions to the problem can be obtained from local-reliable paths, which are a set of non-dominated paths under first-order stochastic dominance. We show that Bellman's principle of optimality can be applied to construct local-reliable paths. Acyclicity of local-reliable paths is established and used for proving finite convergence of solution procedures. The connection between the a priori path problem and the corresponding adaptive routing problem is also revealed. A label-correcting algorithm is proposed and its complexity is analyzed. A pseudo-polynomial approximation is proposed based on extreme-dominance. An extension that allows travel time distribution functions to vary over time is also discussed. We show that the time-dependent problem is decomposable with respect to arrival times and therefore can be solved as easily as its static counterpart. Numerical results are provided using typical transportation networks. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It is also referred to as a dial-a-ride problem, and it can be classified as a multi-depot pickup and delivery problem with time windows and side constraints. The column generation approach constitutes one of the effective methodologies to solve this problem. However, in order to cope with the complexity of the problem, it is commonly applied in two consecutive stages: clustering and routing. First, clusters of customers are formed who will receive service together; next, vehicle routing decisions are made subject to the clustering decisions. This paper develops a nested column generation method, which integrates clustering and routing decisions, thus extending the applicability of the column generation approach in the context of the subject problem. The proposed method is implemented and applied to solve a problem faced by the transit authority of a mid size Us city. A detailed account of implementation experience is provided. The computational results, based on actual data, indicate that problem instances with up to 680 requests and 48 vehicles can be solved within 2% of optimality under mild assumptions, and a 12% performance improvement over a well-established manual planning system can be achieved.

A latent class corresponds to a particular group decision-making mechanism. The proposed model can deal with not only the choice situations where multiple household members involved in joint decision are known a priori, but also the situations where the involved members are unknown. As a case study, three types of household utility functions are dealt with: multi-linear. maximum and minimum types, in the context of couples' car ownership behaviors. Due to the limited sample size, paired combinations of the three utilities are examined and compared. Using the data collected in two Japanese cities in 2004, the effectiveness of the proposed household decision model is empirically confirmed. It is found that changes of utility combinations result in very complicated variations in both signs and values of the model parameters and choice probabilities by multi-linear utility show small variations across different combinations.

To survive and succeed in this market, contractors often choose to distribute their resources, capital and efforts over multiple country markets to minimize their exposure to the harsh environment of the global construction market. Hence it is no surprise that geographical diversification strategies have been implemented by leading international construction firms for many years back across the world. However how to diversify geographic presences across multiple country markets to achieve optimal strategic effects is contingent upon many internal and external factors and is not very well understood. Through the analysis of cross-sectional data provided by Engineering News Record (ENR) and sampled top international construction firms, characteristics of their geographical diversification strategies are identified and the relationship between financial performance and geographic coverage is explored. Theoretically, the findings provide a better understanding of the geographical diversification strategies of leading international construction firms; practically, they provide international contractors benchmarking information and management implications to evaluate, formulate, or adjust their geographical diversification strategies.","[Chen Chuan] Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,,chuanc@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,5,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,1677,1682,,,,,,6,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119901033,0

Like other ordinary contracts, Construction Project Contracts are created when owners and contractors mutually agree to a transaction. A contract may outwardly appear to satisfy all the requirements of a valid contract. However, it is difficult to determine the validity of a contract in the Chinese construction industry. There are circumstances which can cause a Construction Project Contract to become void, and those circumstances may not be easy to be determined.

Currently there are wide-ranging debates. Some people considered that information technology is not mature and the conditions of construction enterprises are complex, these make the MIS application failures, people need to wait for. Some also expressed that since some construction enterprise MIS system applications have been successful, it could be said that it is the time to application and the wrong methods make the failures; if people use correct methods, they will success. Some people believe it is too expensive to realize the MIS application, small and medium-sized enterprises could not afford. Some think it is caused by a lack of relative professionals and etc. In this paper, the authors point out that practitioners ought to understand the nature of the problems more thoroughly and find the way to solve. There are too many ideas taken for granted when applying MIS. Generally corporate MIS application strategy can be divided as three kinds, these are input orientated (software application); process orientated (process reengineering); output orientated (performance), and the authors believe the last one is best. That means our application object is to provide the correct information to right person in right place at right time, and finally improve the corporate performance. People should apply knowledge transfer theory when analyzing the problems and this is also a good way for construction enterprises to improve the MIS application and for MIS service companies to improve the quality of products and services. If construction enterprises need some management knowledge that they don't have, they should emphasize tacit knowledge transfer work. They need to build effective mechanism to carry out the knowledge transfer work; they need to develop a variety of tools to improve the communication between the construction enterprises and MIS development companies. If construction enterprises do not need some information management knowledge, they should take effective methods to decrease the relative cost of in every MIS application phase, such as using Internet, outsourcing, renting IT equipments and etc, and finally they can improve the effects of MIS applications.","[Liu, Z.

The real estate sale is a typical misalignment dynamic process, which involves many social, administrative, economic and artificial factors. From the system dynamics view, the paper applies the real estate risks management theory and establishes risk control model for real estate development project which involves the factors of advertisement effect, sales effect, purchasing speed, sales speed, the recruitment of potential customers and so on. After limiting model boundary and defining model parameter value, it utilizes systems dynamics special-purpose software Vensim to carry on the simulation to the model, and makes the analysis to the simulation results of two main factors of the model, the sales speed and the increasing number of the latent purchasing family, thus exploring the internal law of the real estate sales system. Based on the model and simulation results, we recognize and determine the advertisement effect, the sales effect, the supporting service and the quantity of purchasing power as the risk control point of marketing model. Then we apply the software of Vensim to conduct the sensitive test to these four risk control points, and make the thorough analysis to the sensibility of the risk control point based on the system dynamics theory and the internal links of the models' factors. Considering all the above, we proposes the pertinent sales risk control measures.","[Ma Zhiqiang; Guo Hua] Jiangsu Univ China, Sch Business Adm, Dept Business Adm, Zhenjiang City 212013, Jiangsu Prov, Peoples R China",,,mzq@ujs.edu.cn; guohua505@126.com,"Ma, qiang zhi/HZK-3874-2023","Ma, qiang zhi/0000-0003-0302-6604",,,,,8,0,0,0,4,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,797,802,,,,,,6,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900124,0

More specifically, the study is focused around VOCs (BTEX, terpenes, aldehydes and ketones) measurements at three high priority locations (schools) in the city of Kozani, Greece. Weekly indoor and outdoor VOC measurements were conducted using Radiello (R) passive samplers in each tested room and outdoors. Additionally data from the Field and Laboratory Emission Cell (FLEC) instrument were used to evaluate the contribution of building materials in the indoor concentration levels. The VOC concentration data show a considerable diversity due to the different indoor emission sources, ventilation rates and outdoor concentrations. Formaldehyde indoor levels range from 8.2 to 56.9 mu g/m(3) while benzene levels are high reaching: 18 mu g/m(3).

Smaller firms, in particular those who work primarily as subcontractors to the larger ones, are not inclined to any form of forward financial planning, as they perceive such planning as difficult and time-consuming. This paper aims to find out if proactive financial planning could help contractors overcome the barriers by gaining more support from commercial banks. A survey has been conducted with contractors and banks to investigate the extent contractors adopt proactive financial planning in their operations and how they benefit from doing so. Conclusions are drawn based on quantitative and qualitative analyses of the data, as well as comments made by contractors interviewed. It has been found that Hong Kong contractors, particularly the smaller ones, are not proactive enough in financial planning, which can otherwise help them maintain healthy cash flow and gain financial support from banks.","[Simon, Mak Kam Choi] Tai Chong Cheang Steamship Co HK Ltd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",,,kcs_mak@yahoo.com.hk; swpoon@hlcucc.hku.hk,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,0,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,1746,1752,,,,,,7,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119901043,0

The strategy is non-anticipative because it does not rely on demand forecasts, adaptive because it uses real-time traffic information, and decentralized because all the information is available locally. It can be used with a failed communication network. The strategy pertains to networks in which no links backtrack in the direction of increased risk. For these types of networks, no other strategy exists that can evacuate more people in any given time, or finish the evacuation in less time. The strategy is also shown to be socially fair, in the sense that the time needed to evacuate all the people exceeding any risk level is, both, the least possible, and the same as if less-at-risk individuals did not participate in the evacuation. The strategy can be proven optimal even when backflows happen due to driver gaming. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Its inherent network structure is exploited to generate the lower bounds to the branch-and-cut algorithm using the network simplex method and by relaxing the integrality constraints. Results from numerical experiments indicate inherent trade-offs at the higher degrees of collaboration between waiting for more affordable collaborative capacity and incurring higher holding costs.

Study findings indicate significant differences between users and nonusers. Study findings specifically indicate that current online auction users have a greater belief in the auctions as a cost containment tool than past or nonusers.

California recently passed legislation that aggressively promotes sustainability by endorsing and rewarding compact development. Likewise, the California Air Resources Board has set a statewide reduction target of 5MMT of greenhouse gas reductions from land use, based largely on achieving compact development patterns. In this paper, we use a multivariate two-part model with instrumental variables, which corrects for residential location self-selection bias. We use a much larger and more geographically representative travel survey on household travel patterns and socio-economic characteristics than represented in previous California studies: this allows us to robustly consider other influences on travel. Our results indicate that, all else equal, a 10% in residential density would reduce VMT by 1.9%.

This paper explores the incentives for a profit-maximizing toll-road operator to adopt some simple nonlinear pricing schemes when there is congestion and collecting tolls is costly. Users are assumed to differ in their demands to use the road. Regardless of the severity of congestion, an access fee is always profitable to implement either as part of a two-part tariff or as an alternative to paying a toll. Use of access fees for profit maximization can increase or decrease welfare relative to usage-only pricing for profit maximization. Hence a ban on access fees could reduce welfare.

Most models presented so far devote more attention to one of the two issues. This paper aims to achieve consistent integration between the two components, focusing in particular on the order of arrival to nodes. A novel concept of anticipated arrival order (AAO) is proposed to describe the number of vehicles expected to choose a certain downstream link at a diverge road-node as a function of the total number of vehicles that arrived at this road-node. An iterative procedure is proposed. In each iteration. a route flow propagation model is used to determine the AAO for the entire modeling horizon; then, a traffic behavior model uses the AAO to determine cumulative volumes for the entire horizon. Computational results show that this unique non-chronological heuristic approach to DNL can indeed provide consistent solutions so that residual FIFO violation is monitored. The proposed model is an analytic macroscopic model with continuous flows. We chose to examine the AAO concept using a traffic flow behavior that follows the kinematic waves model with a triangular flow-density relationship. The single-link model is converted to an equivalent variations problem and solved on a dense discrete intra-link time-space mesh by a standard least-cost-path algorithm for acyclic graphs.

The DM decides every day how much water to release from the lake. We combine hydrological knowledge and machine learning techniques to property develop the model. As a predictive tool we use lazy learning, namely local linear regression. We setup a daily predictor, which achieves good accuracy, with a mean absolute percentage error around 8.5%. Yet, the behavior of the model is not fully satisfactory during the floods. In fact, from an interview with a domain expert, it appears that the DM can even update the release decision every 6 hours during emergencies. We have therefore developed a refined version of the model, which works with a variable time step: it updates the release decision once a day in normal conditions, and every 6 hours during emergencies. This turns out to be a sensible choice, as the error during emergencies (which represent about 5% of the data set) decreases from 9 to 3 m(3)/sec.","[Corani, G.; Rizzoli, A.

A critical step in PMF is the number of factors determination and the present study aims at discussing this critical issue, by applying PMF on particles size distribution measurements data in a residential environment, in Athens, Greece. A main focal point of the present research is the investigation of the temporal behaviour of the particles size, as recorded in the time series, closely relating the averaging period of the utilised data with the number and type of factors in the PMF.

To develop China's green and energy-saving housing, we have the following tasks to accomplish: (1) Intensifying publicity and education: following the strategy of sustainable development and building harmonious socialist society, and considering the element of full-life cycle investment, we should raise the awareness of the developer and the consumer on green and energy-saving building, make them recognize the immediacy of energy conservation in building and the importance of developing green and energy-saving housing.

These definitely pose a grave threat to the sustainable development of REI. It is suggested to accelerate the marketization of the land use, to improve the efficiency of administrative examination and approval, the government-subsidized houses policy need to be regulated to keep these houses' trade-off in a closed cycle operation, to increase investment on science and technology research and promote its application, to reform local financial policies, to strengthen accurate research on the related field.

The objectives of the study are: (1) to acquire the Bumiputera's perception about the IM development: (2) to discover the challenges and barriers faced by the Bumiputeras caused by the IM development; (3) to identify strategies in ensuring the right and ownership of the bumiputeras under the IM development will be appropriately preserved. The primary data in this research was collected using semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. The research is focused on the Nusajaya development area which covers nearly 1000 hectares. Respondents of the study are divided into three groups of Bumiputera's community i.e. high-income group (professionals involved in the IM development, i.e. planners and engineers, developers, contractors, businessman etc.), medium income group (government's servants, teachers, private sectors workers etc.) and low income group (fishermen, farmers, at traditional village's settlement area etc). The findings show that the majority of the Bumiputeras are actually in favour of the IM development plan; however, they are concerned with some possible threat that the priority interest of the Bumiputera ethnic will gradually disappear due the development of the IM. Therefore, the Iskandar Region Development Authority (IRDA) is supposed to give serious consideration to this issue. Consequently, it is recommended that the development plan of the IM be re-evaluated in order to ensure that the Bumiputera's interests are not mistreated.

In this paper, an analysis framework for the urban residential spatial differentiation and social exclusion was developed, in which economic, institutional, social cultural and external environmental factors interact. The results show that the gaps in both occupations and incomes are the economic foundation of residential spatial differentiation; misappropriate policy arrangements in housing, land use and household registration system are the institutional foundation; the changes of neighborhood relationships are the social-cultural foundation; and rapid urbanization strengthens this process. So as to construct harmonious societies and communities, various measurements involved with politics, economy and social-culture should be made to inhabit residential spatial differentiation and to eliminate residential segregation and social exclusion.","[Zhang Youzhi] Jiangsu Univ Technol & Sci, Sch Civil Engn & Architecture, Dept Engn Management, Changzhou 212003, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",,,cqzhangyouzhi@163.com,,,,,,,16,0,0,2,13,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,767,+,,,,,,3,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900120,0

However, it may not be very effective without multiple sourcing. In this paper, we consider a supply chain with two downward substitutable products. The products can be ordered from an unreliable supplier or a reliable but more expensive supplier. It is found that in an optimal sourcing policy the higher-grade product should be preferred over the lower-grade product. A sufficient condition is given for an optimal policy where only the higher-grade product is dual-sourced. The effect of substitution is contrasted with the non-substitution case. Numerical study shows the impact of demand variability and correlation on the effect of product substitution and the corresponding optimal sourcing policy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In practice, however, when activity scheduling to some extent is flexible, the impact of delay on one trip will depend on the actual and predicted travel time on itself as well as other trips, which is important to consider for long-lasting disturbances and when assessing the value of travel information. In this paper we extend the single trip approach into a two trips chain and activity scheduling model. Preferences are represented as marginal activity utility functions that take scheduling flexibility into account. We analytically derive trip timing optimality conditions, the value of travel time and schedule adjustments in response to travel time increases. We show how the single trip models are special cases of the present model and can be generalized to a setting with trip chains and flexible scheduling. We investigate numerically how the delay cost depends on the delay duration and its distribution on different trips during the day, the accuracy of delay prediction and travel information, and the scheduling flexibility of work hours. The extension of the model framework to more complex schedules is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The conventional wisdom argues that complementary airline alliances reduce airfares for passengers on the flow-through routes as a result of the elimination of double marginalization and efficiency gain. On the other hand, since complementary alliances help improve connecting services through one-stop check-in, better schedule coordination, etc., passengers are willing to pay higher prices for the enhanced services. That is, complementary alliances have both positive and negative effects on airfares for flow-through tickets that counteract each other. The net impact, therefore, is uncertain, a priori. Our theoretical model shows that the overall effects of complementary alliances on airfares depend on the relative strengths of the airfare reducing effects due to cooperative pricing setting and the increased willingness to pay for services improvements. Our empirical analysis based on data from the North trans-Pacific markets in October 2007 finds that member airlines of Star Alliance and Skyteam Alliance appear to charge significantly higher prices for through-tickets than the sum of segment fares on complementary routes, whereas for oneworld Alliance members, the upward and downward effects on airfares seem to counterbalance each other. Moreover, the price markup for through ticket is higher for business passengers than for leisure passengers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The design of these services involves defining their itinerary, frequency and vehicle size, yet despite the importance of these factors for the network's efficiency, no published works appear to provide the tools for designing high-frequency unscheduled services on an urban bus corridor, minimizing social costs. This paper presents an optimization approach that minimizes these costs in terms of wait time, in-vehicle travel time and operator cost. Various optimization models are formulated that can accommodate the operating characteristics of a bus corridor, given an origin-destination trip matrix and a set of services that are a priori attractive. The models then determine which of these services should be offered at what frequencies and with which type of vehicles. A case study in which the model is applied to a real-world case of a bus corridor in the city of Santiago, Chile, is presented and the results are analyzed.

Compared with a single-loop detector, it is able to provide more useful information on traffic flow with a higher precision. In this paper we investigate statistical inference for vehicle speed and vehicle length using dual-loop detector data. A Bayesian analysis is performed to combine current observations on traffic flow with prior knowledge, which results in a set of simple formulas for the online estimation of both vehicle speed and vehicle length. As a by-product, vehicle classification is also investigated on the basis of posterior classification probabilities. The computational overhead of updating the estimates is kept to a minimum when new information on traffic flow becomes available. The method is illustrated using real traffic data.

Although PFE does not require traffic counts to be collected on all network links when inferring unmeasured traffic conditions, it does require all available counts to be reasonably consistent. This requirement is difficult to fulfill in practice due to errors inherited in data collection and processing. The original PFE model handles this issue by relaxing the requirement of perfect replication of traffic counts through the specification of error bounds. This method enhances the flexibility of PFE by allowing the incorporation of local knowledge, regarding the traffic conditions and the nature of traffic data, into the estimation process. However, specifying appropriate error bounds for all observed links in real networks turns out to be a difficult and time-consuming task. In addition, improper specification of the error bounds could lead to a biased estimation of total travel demand in the network. This paper therefore proposes the norm approximation method capable of internally handling inconsistent traffic counts in PFE. Specifically, three norm approximation criteria are adopted to formulate three L-p-PFE models for estimating consistent path flows and O-D flows that simultaneously minimize the deviation between the estimated and observed link volumes. A partial linearization algorithm embedded with an iterative balancing scheme and a column generation procedure is developed to solve the three L-p-PFE models. In addition, the proposed L-p-PFE models are illustrated with numerical examples and the characteristics of solutions obtained by these models are discussed.

These important tasks were traditionally done manually, but there is an increasing move toward automated software based on mathematical models and algorithms. Most published models in the literature either focus on train timetabling only, or are too complicated to solve when facing large instances. In this paper, we present an optimization heuristic that includes both train pathing and train timetabling, and has the ability to solve real-sized instances. This heuristic allows the operation time of trains to depend on the assigned track, and also lets the minimum headway between the trains to depend on the trains' relative status. It generates an initial solution with a simple rule, and then uses a four-step process to derive the solution iteratively. Each iteration starts by altering the order the trains travel between stations, then it assigns the services to the tracks in the stations with a binary integer program, determines the order they pass through the stations with a linear program, and uses another linear program to produce a timetable. After these four steps, the heuristic accepts or rejects the new solution according to a Threshold Accepting rule. By decomposing the original complex problem into four parts, and by attacking each part with simpler neighborhood-search processes or mathematical programs, the heuristic is able to solve realistic instances. When tested with two real-world examples, one from a 159.3 km, 29-station railroad that offers 44 daily services, and another from a 345 km, eight-station high-speed rail with 128 services, the heuristic obtained timetables that are at least as good as real schedules.

This neglects the leg interdependency of revenues, caused by multileg itineraries. We tackle this problem by modifying the objective function using information provided by a passenger flow model devised by two of the authors. It models spill and recapture between itineraries, accounts for the leg interdependency of revenues and does not control passenger flow to the airline company's advantage. We iteratively improve the FAP's objective function by alternately generating fleet assignments and analyzing them with a modified version of the passenger flow model. We have tested this process on a large-scale network made up of Air Canada data with various demand levels and distributions. Most of the profit improvement occurs in the first few iterations, and the objective function adjustment takes on average less than half the FAP resolution time. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The behavior model has a fuzzy multinomial logit structure where the systematic utility component is obtained using aggregate behavioral if-then rules. The weights of these rules are calibrated through a fuzzy on-line calibration model using the unfolding traffic volume measurements, The on-line calibration is done within the deployment framework of the behavior-consistent approach where the drivers' likely response is factored in determining the route guidance strategies. The generalized structure of the calibration component enables it to simultaneously incorporate other sources of state inconsistency Such as traffic flow model parameters. The results indicate that the calibration model can enhance the accuracy of system state estimation, leading to the increased effectiveness of the behavior-consistent route guidance. It provides the ability to more accurately predict drivers' likely route choices by using aggregate if-then rules, and consequently, aggregate level data. This is attractive in a deployment context as it implies reduced data needs at a disaggregate level, a difficult proposition in the real world. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The model is based on the theoretical framework we proposed in earlier work which assumes that utilities of activities are a dynamic function of needs of individuals at person and household levels. In the model, individuals use a utility-of-time threshold parameter to decide when to include an activity in their agenda. The threshold represents a personal perception of time pressure and is continuously adapted based on learning. In an exchange phase, the individuals (re-)allocate household tasks based on a negotiation protocol with the aim of improving the group result. The model takes into account day-varying time-budgets of individuals, influences of perception, selfishness-altruism, joint activity participation and competences of individuals to satisfy particular needs. We illustrate the model by means of simulations and suggest ways for future research. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Arentze, Theo A.; Timmermans, Harry J.

High demand for refurbishment projects mainly contributed by increase the number of building renovation, extension and extensive repair works. However, refurbishment projects are difficult to manage compared to new-built projects. This due to uncertainty factors, which are inherent in the projects. The uncertainty of refurbishment project is reflected in the difficulty of getting design information during the design process. As a result, most of refurbishment project end up with high cost and time variances. Therefore, the main objectives of this paper are to present the factors that contribute to the uncertainty in refurbishment of services system for historical building and show how they affect the overall performance of refurbishment projects. Triangulation technique is used for research methodology, which consists of review of literature, semi-structured interviews with 15 architects and postal questionnaire survey that involved 234 respondents. From 234 questionnaires sent out, 82 questionnaires found to be suitable to form a database for analysis. Descriptive and inferential statistics are used in data analysis. The result concludes that refurbishment of services system for historical buildings is complex and difficult in which variables availability of design information, ease of access to building and client's needs were affect performance of the projects.","[Ali, Azlan Shah] Univ Malaya, Fac Built Environm, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,,asafab@um.edu.my,,,,,,,26,2,2,0,0,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,26,31,,,,,,6,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900005,0

The spatial structure was represented by a one- or two-dimensional lattice. Schelling showed that an integrated society will generally unravel into a rather segregated one even though no individual agent strictly prefers this. We make some steps to generalize the spatial proximity model to a proximity model of segregation. That is, we examine models with individual agents who interact locally in a range of network structures with topological properties that are different from those of regular lattices. Assuming mild preferences about with whom they interact, we study best-response dynamics in random and regular non-directed graphs as wen as in small-world and scale-free networks. Our main result is that the system attains levels of segregation that are in line with those reached in the lattice-based spatial proximity model. That is, Schelling's original results seem to be robust to the structural properties of the network. In other words, mild proximity preferences coupled with adjustment dynamics can explain segregation not just in regular spatial networks but also in more general social networks.","[Fagiolo, Giorgio] St Anna Sch Adv Studies, Lab Econ & Management, Pisa, Italy; [Valente, Marco] Univ Aquila, Fac Econ, I-67100 Laquila, Italy; [Vriend, Nicolaas J.] Univ London, Dept Econ, London, England",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; University of L'Aquila; University of London,"Fagiolo, G (通讯作者)，St Anna Sch Adv Studies, Lab Econ & Management, Pisa, Italy.",giorgio.fagiolo@sssup.it; mv@business.auc.dk; n.vriend@qmul.ac.uk,"Fagiolo, Giorgio/HGB-6892-2022; Valente, Marco/G-8781-2012; Fagiolo, Giorgio/AAI-6807-2021","Valente, Marco/0000-0001-5378-4898; Fagiolo, Giorgio/0000-0001-5355-3352","CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique), France","CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique), France(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS))","We thank Yannis loannides, Giulia lori, Alan Kirman, Akira Namatame, workshop participants of iNeck (Strasbourg), WEHIA 2005 (Colchester), SCE 2005 (Washington DC) and Complexity 2006 (Aix en Provence) as well as the theory reading group at QM (London) for their comments.

For highway infrastructure development with huge capital demand, disturbance to natural environment, and long project durations, providing the optimum balance between sustainability provisions and whole of life financial returns is utmost important. Stakeholders of highway construction, from government agencies, through builders and contractors to users and community groups, tend to place significant foci on the early identification of financial outlook when contemplating these infrastructures. Under the current and imrpving social awareness, they will also need to overcome the traditional imbalance between sustainable measures and project budgets, as it can be idealised by owners wanting to maintain lowest possible development cost, whereas environmental experts and technology innovators may push for ultimately green solutions without due financial considerations. Life Cycle Costing Analysis, or LCCA, has been proven as a valuable tool for decision making in the construction industry. While many models were developed and some were used for transport and infrastructure particularly, they are not capable of handling sustainability related costs such as the expenses incurred by dealing with commuter delays or traffic noise. This research attempts to incorporate key sustainability issues and indicators in highway infrastructure development into considerations for financial obligations and profitability in a life long process of the built facility. Through surveys, it identifies then integrates industry verified cost elements relating to sustainability measures with life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA), to aid the decision making of stakeholders. The research employs questionnaire-surveys, model building, analytical hierarchy process and case study, to focus on sustainability issues for highway construction, then identify, evaluate and process their associated costs. These cost elements are being verified by the stakeholders of highway infrastructure projects before their integration into a LCCA model for adaptation and expansion. The financial decision making process will be modelled in a prototype system as a practical tool for stakeholders to evaluate investment decisions and obtain optimum balance between financial viabilities and sustainability deliverables.","[Jay, Yang; Kai, Chen Goh] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Urban Dev, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),,j.yarig@qut.edu.au; kai.goh@student.qut.edu.au,,,,,,,10,0,0,2,14,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,2460,2465,,,,,,6,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119901159,0

By applying the backward induction of the dynamic game theory, this paper also established a game model between steady estate saving policies and unsteady estate saving policies. It got that the government's saving policy should correspond to the external marker environment, that is different environment should be taken to different saving policies, but when the market environment has not been significantly improved, the government should apply some relative stable saving policy, only this can minimize the loss.

They will take a few years to plan and construct, and will last decades into the future. Moreover, revenue collection (from tolls) and investments in infrastructure improvement accrue over time. it is, therefore, crucial to determine the optimal project initiation time, phasing, scaling, toll collection strategies, and financial arrangements over the planning horizon. This paper considers the time dimension in the continuous network design problem and focuses on analyzing the aspect of cost-recovery. We develop a flexible framework under two principles of cost-recovery as a single-level optimization program, solve it through the generalized reduced gradient algorithm, and illustrate through numerical examples three considerations: namely, (i) time-dependent demands and gradual network improvements, (ii) comparison between the two cost-recovery principles, and (iii) spatial equity issues from the perspective of consumer surplus. Moreover, this study proves that Mohring and Harwitz's self-financing result for a single facility in a static framework can be extended to the time-dependent network design problem under the same set of assumptions.

The application of multi-agent systems (MAS) to EIA helps operating with distributed decentralized information and generating general decisions and solutions. In order to facilitate the workflow of MAS planning and implementation in decision support systems (DSS) applied to EIA, a generalized multi-agent system technology (MAST) is proposed. This workflow is general enough to enable the related MAS to be used in any application area requiring decision making. We demonstrate that by only changing the domain ontology the MAS is easily oriented towards another problem area.

Some achievements have been gained, which has promoted the ability of safety management in metro construction. Nevertheless, accidents of metro project have happened constantly, which indicates that the issues of safety management still harass metro construction. Many investigation reports of metro projects accidents showed that the occurrence of these accidents was not casual without any precursors. Prior to the occurrence of metro project accidents, there appeared many minor incidents without any injuries and loss, and even some safety information unperceived, which is called Near-Miss. At present, the way of safety management based on accidents omits Near-Miss, which is passive and cannot solve the safety problems of metro construction substantially. Moreover, the number of metro project accidents is not enough for researchers to implement quantitative analysis. Hence, research on Near-Miss becomes necessary and important, which would be the key instrument to further safety management level of metro construction. Considering Near-Miss from the angle of knowledge, it belongs to failure knowledge in safety management of metro construction. Therefore, Knowledge Management was applied in the research on Near-Miss. This paper mainly studied Near-Miss from angle of Knowledge Management and founded a Near-Miss Knowledge Management System(NIVIKMS) for safety management of metro construction. Firstly, Near-Miss definition of metro construction was studied. And in the basis of safety pyramid model, comparison between Near-Miss and accidents was implemented. Secondly, conception of Knowledge Management was introduced. And Near-Miss was studied from angle of Knowledge Management. Thirdly, existing Near-Miss Management Systems(NMMS) in the industry of aviation, petrochemical, medical, etc., were analyzed. Based on the process of Knowledge Management, combined with the characteristics of metro construction, Near-Miss Knowledge Management System(NMKMS) for safety management of metro construction was founded from 8 stages: discovery, report, identification, prioritization, cause analysis, solution, dissemination and evaluation. Then, there was an empirical study by implementation the whole course of NMKMS for preventing accidents. Finally, a guarantee system for implementation of NMKMS was proposed from three aspects of implementation body, surveillance body and research body.","[Zhou Zhipeng; Wang Panpan; Li Qimming; Deng Xiaopeng] SE Univ China, Dept Construct Management & Real Estate, Sch Civil Engn, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China,,zhou_zhipeng@yeah.net,"DENG, Xiaopeng/AGE-5078-2022","DENG, Xiaopeng/0000-0002-2987-505X",,,,,33,0,0,0,10,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,1280,1288,,,,,,9,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900200,0

To model the effects of such behavior, travelers are assumed to choose routes to minimize the percentile travel time, i.e. the travel time budget that ensures their preferred probability of on-time arrival: in doing so, they drive the system to a percentile user equilibrium (UE), which can be viewed as an extension of the classic Wardrop equilibrium. The stochasticity in the supply of transportation are incorporated by modeling the service flow rate of each road segment as a random variable. Such stochasticity is flow-dependent in the sense that the probability density functions of these random variables, from which the distribution of link travel time are constructed, are specified endogenously with flow-dependent parameters. The percentile route travel time, obtained by directly convolving the link travel time distributions in this paper, is not available in closed form in general and has to be numerically evaluated. To reveal their structural properties, percentile UE solutions are examined in special cases and verified with numerical results. For the general multi-class percentile UE traffic assignment problem, a variational inequality formulation is given and solved using a route-based algorithm. The algorithm makes use of the diagonal elements in the Jacobian of percentile route travel time, which is approximated through recursive convolution. Preliminary numerical experiments indicate that the algorithm is able to achieve highly precise equilibrium solutions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we investigate some of these using intraday bicycle volumes collected via induction loops located at ten bike paths in the city of Melbourne, Australia, between December 2005 and June 2008. The data are hourly counts at each location, with temporal and spatial disaggregation allowing for the impact of meteorology to be measured accurately for the first time. Moreover, during this period petrol prices varied dramatically and the data also provide a unique opportunity to assess the cross-price elasticity of demand for cycling. Over-dispersed Poisson regression models are used to model volumes at each location and at each hour of the day. Seasonality and the impact of weather conditions are modelled as semiparametric and estimated using recently developed multivariate penalized spline methodology. Unlike previous studies that use aggregate data, the empirical results show a substantial meteorological and seasonal component to usage. They also suggest there was substitution into cycling as a mode of transport in response to increases in petrol prices, particularly during peak commuting periods and by commuters originating in wealthy and inner city neighbourhoods. Last, we extend the approach to a multivariate longitudinal count data model using a Gaussian copula estimated by Bayesian data augmentation. We find first order serial dependence in the hourly volumes and a 'return trip' effect in daily bicycle commutes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

By means of data analysis, simulations, and analytical calculations, we give evidence that this concept is relevant for instabilities of congested traffic flow. We analyze detector data from several hundred traffic jams and propose estimates for the linear growth rate, the wavelength, the propagation velocity, and the severity of the associated bottleneck that can be evaluated semi-automatically. Scatter plots of these quantities reveal systematic dependencies. On the theoretical side, we derive, for a wide class of microscopic and macroscopic traffic models, analytical criteria for convective and absolute linear instabilities. Based on the relative positions of the stability limits in the fundamental diagram, we divide these models into five stability classes which uniquely determine the set of possible elementary spatiotemporal patterns in open systems with a bottleneck. Only two classes, both dominated by convective instabilities, are compatible with observations. By means of approximate solutions of convectively unstable systems with sustained localized noise, we show that the observed spatiotemporal phenomena can also be described analytically. The parameters of the analytical expressions can be inferred from observations, and also (analytically) derived from the model equations.. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

When a facility fails, its customers may be reassigned to other operational facilities in order to avoid the high penalty costs associated with losing service. We propose an integer programming model that minimizes the sum of facility construction costs, expected inventory holding costs and expected customer costs under normal and failure scenarios. We develop a Lagrangian relaxation solution framework for this problem, including a polynomial-time exact algorithm for the relaxed nonlinear subproblems. Numerical experiment results show that this proposed model is capable of providing a near-optimum solution within a short computation time.

The objective is to provide empirical evidence on the financial advantages of expanding capacity against the operation of multi-airport systems (MAS) under the presence of significant returns to scale in airport operations. This is done by comparing the actual operating costs of the MAS with the predicted costs that correspond to the aggregated level of output and input prices. Predictions are obtained from a multi-output specification of the industry's cost function, estimated with a broad database of international airports. The results indicate the presence of non-exhausted scale economies at the current levels of production. Hence, the atomization of air traffic always increases operating costs at a system level. In the last section, the degree of economic inefficiency of five European MAS is calculated. These results also provide revealing conclusions about the size of the industry's minimum efficient scale. Furthermore, the use of data on American MAS allows us to separate the inefficiency costs derived from the atomization of air traffic from those related to the individual airports inefficient behavior.

The results indicate the presence of significant levels of taste heterogeneity, only some of which can be accounted for by conventional commodity-type based segmentations.

In a straightforward simulation of transshipment yard operations, the effect of optimal crane areas vs. equally sized areas is studied, the latter being a common real-world policy.

The newcomer company maximizes its market share which depends on the service time and transportation cost by locating a predefined number of hubs at candidate ports and designing its network. While general-purpose solvers do not solve instances of even small size, an accelerated Lagrangian method combined with a primal heuristic obtains promising bounds. Our computational experiments on real instances of practical size indicate superiority of our approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The long-term Cournot-Nash equilibrium steady state requires that none of the carriers may unilaterally alternate their hub networks or operations plans to increase profits. We study an integral-constrained game theoretic model for time-definite less-than-truckload freight services in an oligopolistic market. The research showed that carriers favor geographic central than outlying hub locations. With price-elastic demand in the freight market, the higher the network density is, the higher the profit is. Thus, the stable Cournot-Nash equilibrium solution states that all carriers respectively possess a similarly dense hub network, which is robust even with uneven changes in carrier cost structures. However, there is a prorogation effect in that an operating cost reduction will increase the individual carrier's and also the competitors' profits. The results also showed that there are cooperative equilibria that can make all carriers better off, but are unstable solutions in the non-cooperative game. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Drivers are assumed to minimize either the experienced or instantaneous travel times. and in doing so, they settle at a Wardrop (day-to-day) equilibrium or a Boston (within-day) traffic equilibrium, respectively. We prove that the path travel time function in our model is not monotone, and show that this property leads to multiple Wardrop equilibria, of which only one is both stable and efficient. The paper shows that periodic traffic oscillations do not arise from Wardrop equilibria. Trivial oscillations exist at Boston equilibria, which are caused by drivers' overreaction to traffic conditions. However, periodic oscillations are likely to emerge when (1) transitions between stable and unstable equilibria take place, and more importantly, (2) drivers make decisions based on out-of-date information of traffic conditions. The latter finding is useful in guiding control practice at freeway bottlenecks and work zones to prevent traffic oscillations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Analytical results suggest that the net effect on airfares is uncertain. Empirical evidence shows that the impact of two of three alliances (Star and SkyTeam) on prices on transatlantic hub-to-hub routes is insignificant after controlling for other factors. Routes between oneworld alliance hubs, however, have significantly lower business class airfares compared to other routes. These results indicate that the impact of alliances on transatlantic hub-to-hub airfares varies depending on the alliance; possibly due to the ability of an alliance to coordinate fares.

The resultant characteristic variables can be used to measure the deviation of the phase state to a desired state and derive physically bounded solutions. Taking the pseudo-density as a conserved variable, the approach is able to describe both equilibrium and non-equilibrium flows in a systematic and unified manner, and thus complex traffic phenomena. The theoretical properties of the model are thoroughly investigated, and numerical examples are used to demonstrate the ability of the model to reproduce some notable traffic phenomena.

Thus we have two different objectives for network optimization, i.e. to minimize system time and to minimize system cost, which naturally gives rise to a bi-objective minimization problem. A Pareto optimum of this bi-objective optimization problem represents a bi-criteria system optimum for network optimization in the sense that, at each Pareto optimum, neither system time nor system cost can be further reduced without increasing the other one. In this paper we prove that any Pareto optimum can he decentralized into multi-class user equilibrium by positive anonymous link tolls. We then bound the system performance gap when optimized by the two different criteria. Specifically, we provide answers to the following questions: When system time is minimized, how far could the corresponding system cost deviate from its minimum value? Conversely, when system cost is minimized, how far could the corresponding system time deviate from its minimum value? More generally, how far can the system time and system cost at a given bi-criteria Pareto optimum deviate from their respective single-criterion based system optimum? (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we address the issue of the competition between full-service and low-cost airlines serving adjacent airports in the Greater London using econometric estimation of demand structure (own- and cross-price elasticities). Our analysis follows the methodology in (Pels, E., Nijkamp, P., Rietveld, P., 2000.

It is based on the nested logit model which we use to capture three key dimensions of passenger choice: air fare, surface-access costs and frequency. We obtained estimates of the own- and cross-price elasticities, which was the focus of our interest. On the basis of our understanding of the industry dynamics we find these estimates, especially of the cross-price elasticities, to be on the low side. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Contrast to the traditional public projects, PFI projects has their own characteristics in terms of the establishment for the risk system's architecture and the risk evaluation method. Exactly the same risk may induce entirely different effect to individual subjects. So, while the government makes the decisions on PFI projects, in order to evaluating the feasibility with an objective and many-sided viewpoints, a great deal of factors should be considered. Among all these factors, risk factor is an essential and absolutely necessary aspect. We present a risk evaluation indicators architecture.

However, if not well controlled, Sludge application may lead to soil contamination. In Europe, threshold values for sewage Sludge amendment have only been derived for heavy metals; and there is not any legal limitation for persistent organic pollutants (POPs) concentration in sewage sludge. In order to evaluate the fate of these contaminants in the soil matrix, a multimedia model was developed and executed for a case-study. The model, which was applied to different POPs, was used to predict the transport between soil phases (air, water, organic matter and mineral matter) based on fugacity values. In general terms, the simulation results showed a tendency of reaching a constant value through the simulation time for all the contaminants. The removal rate was highly correlated with the high-life in soil, which was found to be the most sensitive parameter of the analysis. No significant differences were found in the results for the two types of soil evaluated, characterized by different textures, pH, organic matter and nutrient content. The model here developed is considered to provide reliable results to predict the environmental fate of POPs in sewage sludge-amended soils. In the future, the feasibility to apply the model to other chemical pollutants, such as volatile compounds, will have to be studied.","[Passuello, Ana; Schuhmacher, Marta; Jimennez, Laureano] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Sch Chem & Proc Engn, Tarragona 43007, Spain; [Bojarski, Aaron] Polytechn Univ Catalonia, Dept Chem Engn, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Schuhmacher, Marta; Nadal, Marti] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Sch Med, Lab Toxicol & Environm Hlth, E-43201 Reus, Spain",Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Passuello, A (通讯作者)，Univ Rovira & Virgili, Sch Chem & Proc Engn, Tarragona 43007, Spain.",ana.passuello@urv.cat,"Passuello, Ana Carolina/N-6612-2013; Nadal, Marti/B-8807-2017; Schuhmacher, Marta/F-4902-2017","Passuello, Ana Carolina/0000-0003-2961-7787; Bojarski, Aaron/0000-0002-0615-2297; Nadal, Marti/0000-0002-0217-4827; Schuhmacher, Marta/0000-0003-4381-2490",Ministry of Education and Science Spain [CTM2007-64490]; AGAUR (Generalitat de Catalunya); Fons Social Europeu (EU) through FI,Ministry of Education and Science Spain(Spanish Government); AGAUR (Generalitat de Catalunya)(Agencia de Gestio D'Ajuts Universitaris de Recerca Agaur (AGAUR)Generalitat de Catalunya); Fons Social Europeu (EU) through FI,"Financial support was provided by the Ministry of Education and Science, Spain, through grant No. CTM2007-64490, and the SOSTAQUA project, founded by CDTI in the framework of the Ingenio 2010 Program under the CENIT call.

The corruption and low efficiency which existed in now society in the government investment fields in China has been of concern to the community. Despite the local governments have taken different measures to solve those problems, it has many troubles to interrupt us do it better. The investment efficiency of municipal infrastructure depends on its supervision mechanism. There are four investment supervision models which we summarize in China, those are Project Corporation, capital construction department, specialist agency and project agency models. This paper has studied those models of municipal infrastructure and reveals that the limited investment supervision periods, the single supervision way, the unreasonable supervision systems make many troubles to the investment supervision systems. As those problems exist in the municipal infrastructure investment supervision fields, it is necessary to reform the present investment supervision mechanism. To complete the system of holding the legal person responsible for non-commercial projects and reform the investment supervision mechanism helps the supervision mechanism to run smoothly and efficiently. The implementation of project investment supervision is important and essential in the whole lifecycle.

It tries to explore how to address the migrant workers' housing problems. Migrant workers are the labors who leave their original places of household registration and flock to more economically developed regions without official residential status. Under the Household Registration System (hukou) in China, they are not covered by the Mainstream Housing Distribution System. As a result, many of them can only turn to low-rent houses, which are usually provided by the private sector with inferior quality, inadequate facilities and safety problems. Besides, company quarters and construction sites also comprise a relatively small part of their housing source. Based on a review of literature and relevant policies, as well as interviews with government officials and academics in Shenzhen, this paper begins by introducing the migrant workers and their housing conditions. Second, it examines the availability of housing policies for migrant workers. The third section examines the availability of the public rental housing for migrant workers and the corresponding implementations with a particular reference to Shenzhen. Moreover, a comparison between Shenzhen and Hong Kong concerning the Public Rental Housing is made to find the gaps and conclude further suggestions for public rental housing development in Shenzhen. Lastly, main points arising from the discussions are summarized and some suggestions are put forward.","[Tao, L.; Wong, K. W.; Hui, C.

However, many flaws were exposed during the implementation of the previous general land-use planning, such as the rapid decreasing of cultivated land, the land extensive use, irrational expansion of urban boundary, and so on. The accelarating urbanization, with the increasing demand of construction land, relatively slow integration process of rural and urban areas and increasingly serious food security, has brought up the question of how to achieve the permanently sustainable use of land resources in the recent round of general land-use planning. Based on the practice of land-use planning in Zhenhai and Suichang, which are two counties located Zhejinag province, the paper is to discuss the possible impact of the new quotas, which are the control of the total of urban-rural construction land use scale to the future land management at county level. The Shuang-gua-gou land use policy, which means that to increase urban construction land use scale is restricted by decreasing rural construction land use scale correspondingly, is discussed. This study shows that the implementation of the new quotas play a great role in its social, economic and ecological effect such as promoting the intensive use of land, guiding the urban expanding orderly, innovating the cultivated land protection model, establishing the exit mechanism of rural construction land, vindicating the regional ecological security. Moreover, it is considered to balance fairness and efficiency during land-use quotas allocation base on that the paper analyzes the realization form of the control of the urban and rural construction land general scale in different region with different economic level. Finally, the paper proposes a bunch of relevant land use policy to help carry out the scientific development concept in land management.","[Wu, Y. Z.; Hu, P.

But this kind of housing security is the one at a low level. Because the establishment of low-rent housing system in Baoding is at early stage, there are some institutional problems such as incomprehensive housing security scope, lacking of physical distribution mode in rent subsidies, unreasonable determining mode of rent subsidies, lacking of dynamic adjustment mechanism, unitary source of funds for low-rent housing construction, etc. After the analysis of above problems, this paper advances principles which should be followed in low-rent housing system design-government dominating principle, dynamic adjustment principle, moderate housing security principle, multiform and multilevel housing security principle, priority of rent subsidies mode principle. Then based on the local conditions of Baoding City, this paper proposes detailed countermeasures on the low-rent housing system design which are listed as follow: i) Extending security scope of low-rent housing and raising the standard of rent subsidies; ii) Changing the present person-oriented security mode of rent subsidies into the family-oriented one with multilevel structure, and constituting dynamic adjustment mechanism of rent subsidies; iii) Building or purchasing residential property used as low-rent housing, constructing physical distribution mode, defining the target population and making a clear standard of such mode; iv) Broadening the channel of fund-raising for low-rent housing system construction by introducing social capital and new financial instruments.","[Zhang Pengtao; Wang Meng] Agr Univ Hebei, Coll Rural & Urban Construct, Baoding 071001, Hebei Province, Peoples R China",Hebei Agricultural University,,zhangpt@hebau.edu.cn; wangmeng_smile@163.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,616,621,,,,,,6,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900094,0

A study is presented based on a recent survey. The results identify the most important services offered by 3PLs and the most important aspects of 3PL operational performance. The results also suggest that excellence in operations is more important than wide-ranging service provision. Furthermore, the research suggests that the range of service provision offered by 3PLs does not directly influence the 3PLs' financial performance. However, 3PL providers with service capabilities that correspond to the key priorities of customers will gain superior financial performance through a better operational performance.

We modeled and estimated the simultaneous demand and price (pseudo-supply) equation to derive these four economic impacts of LCCs' entries by using published data of 1998.

Once linearized and augmented with additional constraints to capture cross-cell interactions, the model becomes a linear program that embeds a relaxed cell transmission model (CTM) to propagate traffic. As a result, we show that CTM-type traffic dynamics can be derived from the original M-N model, when the exit-flow function is properly selected and discretized. The proposed cell-based M-N model has a simple constraint structure and cell network representation because all intersections and cells are treated uniformly. Path marginal costs are defined using a recursive formula that involves a subset of multipliers from the linear program. This definition is then employed to interpret the necessary condition, which is a dynamic extension of the Wardrop's second principle. An algorithm is presented to solve the flow holding back problem that is known to exist in many discrete SO-DTA models. A numerical experiment is conducted to verify the proposed model and algorithm.

This model is used to investigate the competitiveness of such an enterprise for student athlete travel in conference sports. The relevant demand subset to be served by a limited charter fleet is identified through a comparison with existing scheduled travel options. Further, the routing and scheduling of the charter aircraft is performed within the same framework. Through this modeling a method for formulating and accommodating continuous time windows and competitive market dynamics in strategic planning for a charter service is developed. Computational improvements to the basic model are also presented and tested. The model is applied to the Big Sky Conference for the 2006-2007 season, quantifying the benefits to the students from such a service and the change in expenditure associated with such a benefit for various assumptions about operations and value of time. The findings indicate the lack of spatial or sport based patterns for maximizing benefit, indicating the absence of simplistic rules of thumb for operating such a service, and validating the need for the model.

A taxi driver searches or waits for a customer by considering both the expected searching or waiting time cost and ride revenue, and a customer seeks a taxi ride to minimize full trip price We suppose that the bilateral taxi-customer searching and meeting occurs anywhere in residential and commercial zones or at prescribed taxi stands, such as an airport or a railway station We propose a meeting function to spell out the search and meeting frictions that arise endogenously as a result of the distinct spatial feature of the area and the taxi-customer moving decisions. With the proposed meeting function and the assumptions underlying taxi-customer search behaviors, the stationary competitive equilibrium achieved at fixed fare prices is determined when the demand of the customers matches the supply of taxis or there is market clearing at the prevailing searching and waiting times in every meeting location We establish the existence of such an equilibrium by virtue of Brouwer's fixed-point theorem and demonstrate its principal operational characteristics with a numerical example.

We present two formulations: a mixed integer quadratic program and a linearization which reduces to a mixed integer linear program. The objective function aims, on the one hand, to maximize the total value of chosen quay crane profiles and, oil the other hand, to minimize the housekeeping costs generated by transshipment flows between ships. To Solve the problem we developed a heuristic algorithm which combines tabu search methods and mathematical programming techniques.

How to compensate is the core issue in the process of the land expropriation. Under current compensation system, the average annual output value of agricultural products and the original purposes of the land are the main bases. The government offers low compensation payment correspondingly to the farmers according to those and then gains the increment income by granting the land use rights. Such a compensation model ignores the role of market mechanism and is interfered too much by the administrative departments. Obviously the land-lost farmers' interests cannot be guaranteed and problems are inevitable in the practice of the land expropriation. For the reform of the current compensation system, the experiences of the developed countries in which land compensation fee is decided by the market are worth referencing. Currently, if we adopt the price of land use rights granting to compensate the farmers that is a better method because it not only reflects the market price of the land in some sense, but also can balance the interests among the governments, the farmers and land users, thereby avoid abuse expropriation by the government for gaining the increment income. Moreover, after several decades of reform on the land use system, a mature land use rights market and the land appraisal system have come into being in China; A batch of independent land appraisal institutions and professional land appraisers have appeared. All these create conditions for evaluating the price of land use rights granting. The price of land use rights granting which is equal to the land grant fee paid by the first land users who will use the land for decades, is not the price of land ownership. After expropriation the farmers have lost land ownership, so the compensation is not complete. The government always could gain the land income again and again by granting land use rights constantly. Nevertheless, because of the limit of the Chinese special land system and other factors, it is impossible to implement the complete compensation as developed countries at present. The government should continue to increase the compensation payment which may come from the state-owned stock land granting fee to the land-lost farmers. When all conditions are appropriate, the complete compensation will be carried out though it is a long way to reach it.","[Chu Jianpeng] Shandong Univ Technol, Sch Resources & Environm Engn, Zibo 255049, Shandong, Peoples R China",Shandong University of Technology,,zuiwochangan@sohu.com,,,,,,,9,1,1,0,5,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,971,975,,,,,,5,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900153,0

At the same time, new communication systems allow a more natural assimilation of information: three-dimensional representations of immersive virtual worlds, also known as metaverses. By putting users in a reality reproduction built from IS, all information can be represented in a consistent virtual environment. But turning IS's data in a coherent metaverse is not a trivial process. Depending the IS's structure and the availability of meta-data, several virtual worlds, representing several level of details, can be generated. Mirror worlds, that try to reproduce reality, are poorly represented without complementary information, not usually stored in Biodiversity Information System (BIS).

As effective risk managements of construction standards is important for the realization of the objectives of government procurement, it is of great significance in both theory and practice to explore the risk management methods of construction standards in order to meet the GPA' requirements. For the complicated functioning mechanism and grey, fuzzy characteristics of the risks, a thought and related method of risk management of construction standards are proposed in this paper based on grey theory. Firstly, under GPA situation the risks facing construction standards in life-span were distinguished with the flow chart method. Then the hierarchy structures of multi-layer risk factors, composed of objective layer, criterion layer and sub-criterion layer, were set up. With interview with specialists and questionnaires, the risk factors of construction standards were evaluated and standard categories of risk grades were set up. The weights of different risk factors were determined by using the subjective weighing method. Definite weighted functions of risk factors in different grey categories are established based on grey theory, and a multi-layer grey evaluation model of risks of construction standards were proposed finally. According to the calculation results from the model, management strategies of risks of construction standards under GPA situation were put forward.","[Xie Linlin] S China Univ Technol, Res Area Project Management, Sch Civil Engn & Transportat, Guangzhou 510641, Guangdong, Peoples R China",South China University of Technology,,llxie@scut.edu.cn; renjunshan@163.com; yswang@scut.edu.cn; yzhang1@scutedu.cn,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,1392,1396,,,,,,5,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900217,0

In dealing with non-excusable delay of the contractors, the alternatives of the employers include to request the contractor to submit revised program and expedite, to terminate the contract and to claim for delay damages. Above all, there is an aged practice of construction industry in Taiwan, China called 'supervised payment mechanism', which is aimed to prevent the crackup that may caused by delay and to expedite the progress of the project. The purpose of the supervised payment mechanism is to prevent the suspension and delay of the outstanding project, as well as to secure the payment of the subcontractors when a contractor of the project is in a financial crisis. In this paper the international practices of dealing construction delay are introduced. This introduction is used for the comparison with the supervised payment mechanism in Taiwan, China. In the following the applications of this mechanism are illustrated. The issues and the difficulties the mechanism has encountered are addressed too.

Today, the new generation of raise floor systems (RFS) offers a suite of innovative and integrated products and solutions, and as such are not only suitable for the changing office space requirements, but also capable of meeting the smart and sustainable challenges, which are becoming the prerequisite in the refurbishment of existing buildings. As there has been a prediction for continued growth in refurbishment projects in major cities around the globe, RFS as an alternative methodology warrants new examination and highlight. This paper introduces research recently completed in Australia that provided a holistic approach to the application of RFS enabled by intelligent building technologies, and examined key issues of project development when refurbishing commercial office buildings. It focuses on the constructability of RFS, and how it will respond to smart feature requirements in buildings while extending service life, meeting new organisational change and workplace health needs for applications in today's office environment. It also introduces key project procurement issues and the integrated decision support when dealing with the refurbishment of office buildings. The paper recommends procurement strategies as well as the justification of adopting the RFS technology in the Australian office building sector. Given the current economic downturn, refitting as opposed to new build projects will come onto the spotlight. This paper will provide valuable information for building owners and developers alike when contemplating the retrofit of office buildings.","[Yang, Jay; Wong, Johnny] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Urban Dev, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),,j.yang@qut.edu.au; kevin.zhang@rmit.edu.au; johnny.wong@qut.edu.au,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,4,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,2057,2065,,,,,,9,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119901092,0

Conservation of heritage buildings is significant. However, aged building services popularly exist in the heritage properties and need urgent upgrades to satisfy the changing organizational, environmental and technological requirements for modern business operations. To encourage the positive use and protection of heritage buildings, extra attention must be paid to the design, construction and management of building service systems inside. It requires creativity to respect the original design and materials while meeting current building codes and occupant needs. Heritage buildings often pose unique problems to the building service design because they do not conform to the generic types of present-day construction. Also, management of heritage buildings and their building systems often has to strike a balance between retaining original building features and accommodating new technologies and equipment. A recent research was carried out to investigate an integrated refurbishment of heritage buildings with modern building services, with focuses on mechanical and electrical services. A postal questionnaire was used to explore industry practitioners' opinion on the constraints imposed on the service upgrade in heritage properties. Preliminary findings were presented in this paper.

Moreover, the Rater Reliability definition, which has been widely used in the field of Education Statistics, has been introduced. Based on it the jury reliability definition has been introduced too. It is well known that, there are many methods to analyze the Rater Reliability, such as Spearman Correlation Coefficient Method, Kappa Coefficient Method, Column Affiliated Coefficient Method, Kendall Coefficient, Krumbach a and Many Series Correlation Analysis and so forth. After comparing the advantages and the disadvantages among these methods, the Kendall Coefficient has been selected to analyze the jury reliability, and the Chi-square test has been used to examine the significance test for Kendall Coefficient Then the data from an Evaluation of Bid Report which is made of three parts marked with part I /part II / part III, has been analyzed to verify the Jury Reliability. Meanwhile, the Kendall Coefficients have been calculated. According to the result of empirical analysis, it could be concluded that the evaluation of bid in the Evaluation of Bid Report is credible. However, the evaluation of part If in the report is inconsistent and incredible, which may show that there are some disputes when evaluating the part II.

It was observed that when the highly scattered plots of flow vs. density from individual fixed detectors were aggregated the scatter nearly disappeared and points grouped along a well defined curve. Despite these and other recent findings for the existence of well-defined MFDs for urban areas, these MFDs should not be universally expected. In this paper we investigate what are the properties that a network should satisfy, so that an MFD with low scatter exists. We show that the spatial distribution of vehicle density in the network is one of the key components that affect the scatter of an MFD and its shape. We also propose an analytical derivation of the spatial distribution of congestion that considers correlation between adjacent links. We investigate the scatter of an MFD in terms of errors in the probability density function of spatial link occupancy and errors of individual links' fundamental diagram (FD). Later, using real data from detectors for an urban arterial and a freeway network we validate the proposed derivations and we show that an MFD is not well defined in freeway networks as hysteresis effects are present. The datasets in this paper consist of flow and occupancy measures from 500 fixed sensors in the Yokohama downtown area in Japan and 600 loop detectors in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area Freeway network in Minnesota, USA.

Specifically, the paper proves the existence of, and derives the general form of, closed-form consumption probability expressions for multiple discrete-continuous choice models with GEV-based error structures. In addition to deriving the general form, the paper derives a compact and readily usable form of consumption probability expressions that can be used to estimate multiple discrete-continuous choice models with general cross-nested error structures. The cross-nested version of the MDCGEV model is applied to analyze household annual expenditure patterns in various transportation-related expenses using data from a Consumer Expenditure Survey in the United States. Model estimation results and predictive log-likelihood based validation tests indicate the superiority of the cross-nested model over the mutually exclusively nested and non-nested model specifications. Further, the cross-nested model was amenable to the accommodation of socio-demographic heterogeneity in inter-alternative covariance across decision-makers through a parameterization of the allocation parameters.

(Following buses are then overwhelmed with passengers and cannot process their work quick enough to catch up.) This critical gap problem can be avoided, however, if buses at the leading end of such gaps are given information to cooperate with the ones behind by slowing down. This paper builds on this idea. It proposes an adaptive control scheme that adjusts a bus cruising speed in real-time based on both, its front and rear spacings much as if successive bus pairs were connected by springs. The scheme is shown to yield regular headways with faster bus travel than existing control methods. Its simple and decentralized logic automatically compensates for traffic disruptions and inaccurate bus driver actions. Its hardware and data requirements are minimal. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We apply both deterministic data envelopment analysis (DEA) and bootstrapping to test the robustness of our estimates and to test the hypothesis of global and individual constant returns to scale. We find that the average technical efficiency of German bus companies is relatively low. We observe that the industry appears to be characterized by increasing returns to scale for smaller companies. These results would imply increasing pressure on bus companies to restructure. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Airport congestion and flight delays at many major airports have become a serious problem. It has been suggested that a secondary slot market is one of the most practical options for addressing airport congestion, which would increase the possibility of competitive entry and efficient use of scarce resources. A secondary slot market would work in the same manner as a congestion toll system or an auction system, provided that carriers' manipulative or strategic behaviors do not have serious effects on slot trading. However, the empirical effects of slot markets have not been investigated systematically. This paper examines empirically whether carriers' manipulative or strategic behaviors have impeded effective functioning of slot markets. Slot transfer data from four US airports between 1994 and 1999 were examined using regression analysis. Results of the analysis are mixed, suggesting that the most effective way of congestion management depends on conditions unique to each airport, and that subsequent interventions should reflect those conditions.

Regulation should then address two market failures: uninternalized congestion, and overpricing due to market power. We find that first-best charges are differentiated over airlines if asymmetric, and completely drive out the least efficient airline from the market. This is not generally the case for an undifferentiated charge, which is found to be a weighted average of first-best charge rules for the two airlines, and is less-than-optimally efficient because of its inability to differentiate between them. Tradable slots may yield the first-best outcome if the congestion externality is relatively important and the market power distortion relatively unimportant, but may be less efficient than non-intervention when the reverse is true.

At last, two conclusions are drawn from this research. Firstly, the extent of land-intensive use in District of Beilin and Xincheng is at the forefront steadily and has a significant increase, while the extent of Lintong District and Lantian county is lower.

While prior research suggests that, on average, distressed airlines sell at lower fares, it is hypothesized that the magnitude of this effect may depend on certain firm and market specific contingencies. A large-scale empirical analysis using panel data from the US airline industry is conducted. The results indicate that firm financial distress and air fares are generally negatively related. It is further shown that the magnitude of the effect of distress on fares decreases with the magnitude of operating costs and firm's market shares and increases with firm size and the level of market concentration.

In this paper, we established a framework for assessment of state-level sustainable construction. The framework consists of five layers, from bottom to top: the indicator; the indicator category; the core cluster; the theme; and the overall performance. We employ the Max-Min Fuzzy Delphi method to identify the proper items of each layer. In addition, we employ the Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process to determine the weight of each theme, the core cluster, as well as the indicator category. The procedure for the development of the framework is outlined. The results and the discussion are reported.","[Huang, R. Y.; Hsu, W.

Housing construction has successfully completed the great transition from the planned economic development mode to the market-oriented development mode, but compared with those of developed countries, China's housing industry still has big gaps. These gaps appear as long construction periods of housing construction, low labor productivity, out-of-date technologies, low contribution ratios of technological advances to the development of China's housing industry, supply chain disorders etc., and housing industrialization is an effective way to solve such problems of China's housing industry. How to facilitate housing industrialization? Firstly, technical systemization and serialization is a key. For many years, China has planned lots of scientific research projects in construction technology, and expended lots of human and material resources, but the contribution ratios of science and technology are still rather low. It is generally recognized that the implementation of general-purpose systems may facilitate the specialized, batch, and standardized production of parts. The implementation of genera-purpose systems is helpful for facilitating assembly line production and group operational mechanisms, cutting down costs considerably, and enhancing labor productivity as an important means to realize housing industrialization. Next, it should develop special-purpose housing systems, comprising the construction technology (development) system, the housing construction system, the housing design technology system, housing parts and complete-set technology system, the housing performance assessment system etc. Housing industrialization cannot be separated from integration and standardization. Integration is a general term of conducting large-scale housing construction by the mode of socialized production, serialized supply, and assembly construction. Different from the old wording of industrialization, integration involves not only an integration of structural parts, but even more an integration of thousands of housing parts in home decoration. The objective of standardization is to realize industrialization. That is, what should to do is organize and develop large-scale socialized production and extensive coordiation, and attain the purpose of integrated housing construction through standardized guidance and cooperation. The implementation of housing industrialization still has a long way to go, and may face a series of urgent problems. The top urgency is to develop and introduce advanced housing construction systems and serial engineering technologies, accelerate the standardization of housing-related materials, parts and equipment, and form into serial development, scale production and production systems supplied in package. Here it is emphasized to follow the principle of modular coordination, and build extensive production groups of the housing industry.","[Li, B.] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100040, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University,,libo@ztjs.cn,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,18,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,1513,1520,,,,,,8,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119901003,0

In the METE model, each traveler not only considers a travel time budget for ensuring on-time arrival at a confidence level alpha, but also accounts for the impact of encountering worse travel times in the (1 - alpha) quantile of the distribution tail. Furthermore, due to the imperfect knowledge of the travel time variability particularly in congested networks without advanced traveler information systems, the travelers' route choice decisions are based on the perceived travel time distribution rather than the actual travel time distribution. In order to compute the perceived mean-excess travel time, an approximation method based on moment analysis is developed. It involves using the conditional moment generation function to derive the perceived link travel time, the Cornish-Fisher Asymptotic Expansion to estimate the perceived travel time budget, and the Acerbi and Tasche Approximation to estimate the perceived mean-excess travel time. The proposed stochastic mean-excess traffic equilibrium (SMETE) model is formulated as a variational inequality (VI) problem, and solved by a route-based solution algorithm with the use of the modified alternating direction method. Numerical examples are also provided to illustrate the application of the proposed SMETE model and solution method.

This type of service must display an equilibrium between conflicting criteria such as efficiency, effectiveness, and equity. To this end, we introduce a multi-objective model in which, among other aspects, equity is considered by time windows on the arrival time of a bus at a stop. Time windows can have other uses such as, for example, guaranteeing synchronization of the service with other transportation modes. This is one of the guiding principles of the proposed model which is based on concepts that simultaneously tackle several issues at once. Along this line, we propose a cluster routing approach to model both bus stop location and routing in urban road networks where turn restrictions exist. The resulting multi-objective location-routing model is solved by a tabu search algorithm. As an application, we analyze a home-to-work bus service for a large research center located in Rome, Italy. This case study provides a benchmark for the algorithmic results, and shows the practical relevance of the proposed methodology. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The method was developed to address urban transportation networks where a non-negligible subset of the network links do not have real-time link volumes, and where that data is needed to populate other real-time traffic analytics. Computation is split between an offline calibration and a real-time estimation phase. The offline phase determines link-to-link splitting probabilities for traffic flow propagation that are subsequently used in real-time estimation. The real-time procedure uses current traffic data and is efficient enough to scale to full city-wide deployments. Simulation results on a medium-sized test network demonstrate the accuracy of the method and its robustness to missing data and variability in the data that is available. For traffic demands with a coefficient of variation as high as 40%, and a real-time feed in which as much as 60% of links lack data, we find the percentage root mean square error of link volume estimates ranges from 3.9% to 18.6%. We observe that the use of real-time data can reduce this error by as much as 20%. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In previous studies, the uniqueness of DUE assignments with the bottleneck model has been shown in limited cases such as single-origin and single-destination networks. Consequently, it is still an important issue whether or not uniqueness is a general property of DUE assignments. The present study describes a network in which multiple patterns of link travel time are found, thus providing a negative answer to this question. The network has a loopy structure with multiple bottlenecks and multiple origin-destination (OD) pairs. Given a certain demand pattern of departure times for vehicles leaving their origins, a non-convex set of equilibria with a non-unique pattern of link travel times is shown to exist.

Vehicular lane-changing (LC) is key to the mechanism, particularly LC induced by speed disturbances (SDs) that periodically arise in the expressway's median and center lanes. Early in the rush, when flow was relatively low in the shoulder lane, drivers readily migrated toward that lane to escape the oncoming SDs. The shoulder lane thus acted as a 'release valve' for the high vehicular accumulations created by the SDs, such that forced vehicular decelerations were short-lived. The release valve failed only later in the rush, when flow increased in the shoulder lane in response to rising demand. LC induced by the SDs thereafter became disruptive: the decelerations they imposed spread laterally, and a persistent queue formed in all lanes. Long-run output flow dropped each day by 4-11% once the queue engulfed the base of the incline, and impeded vehicle ascent. Subtle details of this mechanism became visible by examining thousands of vehicle trajectories that were extracted from a series of eleven roadside video cameras. Though these trajectories were collected from only a single day, we suspect that the findings can be generalized to other days at the present site, and to other sites. This is because: (i) conspicuous features of the mechanism were repeatedly observed in loop detector data that were measured over many days at the site; (ii) these macroscopic features are consistent with observations previously made at other sites; and (iii) the more subtle details unveiled by the trajectories are compatible with a general theory of multi-lane traffic.

The models rely on exogenous inputs of reference points and thus the resulting reference-dependence could be regarded as an ad hoc assumption. This paper proposes a conjecture on travelers' determination of reference points and encapsulates it into the prospect-based user equilibrium conditions. The conditions are formulated as an equivalent variational inequality and a heuristic solution algorithm is proposed to solve it. Both the model and the solution algorithm are demonstrated in two numerical examples. As one application, this paper further develops an optimal pricing model in which the proposed user equilibrium model is adopted to capture travelers' response to pricing signals under risk. The pricing model is formulated as a mathematical program with complementarity constraints, solved by a derivative-free algorithm. Another numerical example is presented to illustrate the pricing model and the solution algorithm. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper aims to develop a theoretically sound simulation-based DUE model and its solution algorithm, with particular emphasis on obtaining solutions that satisfy the DUE conditions. The DUE problem is reformulated, via a gap function, as a nonlinear minimization problem (NMP). The NMP is then solved by a column generation-based optimization procedure which embeds (i) a simulation-based dynamic network loading model to capture traffic dynamics and determine experienced path travel costs for a given path flow pattern and (ii) a path-swapping descent direction method to solve the restricted NMP defined by a subset of feasible paths. The descent direction method circumvents the need to compute the gradient of the objective function in finding search directions, or to determine suitable step sizes, which is especially valuable for large-scale simulation-based DUE applications. Computational results for both small and large real road networks confirm that the proposed formulation and solution algorithm are effective in obtaining near-optimal solutions to the DUE problem.

Most congested networks, however, often contain more than one congestion spot along each route. In such networks, it is usually difficult to derive analytically their system-optimal traffic patterns and the tolls that realize them. In this paper, we study the morning commute problem in such a network with certain special topological features - a freeway with multiple entry/exit ramps and a surface street grid with large capacities. For this type of networks, we investigated the basic characteristics of their optimal dynamic traffic patterns and the corresponding tolling scheme, for which a graphical solution procedure was also developed. In this network, we found that at system-optimum: (1) the aggregate traffic flow on the freeway has a staircase temporal profile, and piecewise linear dynamic tolls can be imposed on a subset of ramps to achieve it; (2) among all the off-ramps in use, the ones closer to the destination are being tolled longer with higher maximum toll charges than the ones farther away from the destination; and (3) among all the on-ramps in use, the ones with larger cumulative volume-to-capacity ratios are being tolled longer with higher maximum toll charges. Some practical implications of these findings to corridor traffic management were also discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Shen, Wei; Zhang, H.

To alleviate the negative impact of unorganized urbanization growth, mass rapid transit has been prioritized as a key transport mode in mega cities. Other public facilities are also in high demand to cope with the increasing urbanization growth. However, inadequate government funding may limit the development of these projects. Public Private Partnership (PPP) financing modalities have been identified as innovative tools for financing major infrastructure projects. Earlier research work indicated that a fair risk allocation amongst the stakeholders is essential for the success of PPP projects; however, actual empirical research on the ground is limited. The contents in this paper is based on the original proposal for the funding application of this study which is funded jointly by the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the National Science Foundation Council Research Grant of China. This study aims to develop an equitable risk allocation mechanism for the delivery of PPP projects in the PRC. A two-round Delphi survey will be conducted to identify the principal risk factors and their preferred party to allocate the risk. Furthermore, face to face interviews will be carried out to evaluate the impact and actual allocation of the principal risk factors. Finally an equitable risk sharing mechanism will be developed and validated by a series of focus group meetings before proposing for implementation in the PRC.","[Cheung, Esther; Chan, Albert P.

During this process, investors began to realize the importance of rational judgment, and paid a lot of attentions on the evaluation of real estate investment environment. Based on such background, this paper tried to establish a scientific index system, and to use official data to evaluate the investment environment of the cities. The objective of this paper is to give some advices to the real estate investors in making investment decisions. By analyzing amount of materials on this field, this paper established an index system of real estate investment environment that includes 30 indexes divided into 6 sorts.

This has resulted in great difficulty in comparing the housing vacancy of Chinese cities with their counterparts in rest of the world. Consequently, uniform and reasonable definition needs to be established for further measurement and monitoring of the Chinese housing vacancy conditions, which will be helpful for governmental intervention in the real estate market, and preventing the market risk. Through a Chinese literature review and comparing with oversea studies, this article first develops a definition for housing vacancy and the housing vacancy rate, and then analyzes the factors that can influence the change of the vacancy rate.

In this study, we examine how relational risk affects the willingness to share knowledge and how this association is affected by the tangible relational value (relational benefits) and intangible relational value (guanxi). Data are collected from 436 green manufacturing firms that are among the top 1000 Taiwanese manufacturing firms of 2008 listed by Business Weekly. Relational risk is found to be negatively associated with willingness to share knowledge. Our results show that relational benefits and guanxi between partners improve the negative effect of relational risk on knowledge sharing.

Such systems are widely prevalent in developing countries where classical traffic models cannot be readily applied. The characteristics of such systems are unique since drivers of smaller vehicles exploit their maneuverability to move ahead through lateral gaps at lower speeds. At higher speeds, larger vehicles press their advantage of greater motive power. The traffic stream at the microscopic level is disordered and defines a porous medium. Each vehicle is considered to move through a series of pores defined by other vehicles. A speed-density relationship that explicitly considers the pore space distribution is presented. This captures the considerable dynamics between vehicle classes that are overlooked when all classes are converted to a reference class (usually Passenger Car Equivalents) as is traditionally done. Using a finite difference approximation scheme, traffic evolution for a two-class traffic stream is shown.

Assuming fixed distributions for container flow-times, the Long-Run Model heuristically solves a mixed integer non-linear program to determine the least-cost supply-chain strategies for importers. The Short-Run Model uses estimates of the flow times as a function of traffic volumes on fixed infrastructure to iteratively develop the best near-term strategies. Minimum volume requirements and capacities for ports and landside channels are considered. The models are applied to predict the effects of container fees at the San Pedro Bay ports.

The problem is formulated as a dynamic user equilibrium problem with side constraints (DUE-SC) in which the side constraints represent the restrictions on the traffic volumes. Travelers choose their departure times and routes to minimize their generalized travel costs, which include early/late arrival penalties. An infinite-dimensional variational inequality (VI) is formulated to model the DUE-SC. Based on this VI formulation, we establish an existence result for the DUE-SC by showing that the VI admits at least one solution. To analyze the necessary condition for the DUE-SC, we restate the VI as an equivalent optimal control problem. The Lagrange multipliers associated with the side constraints as derived from the optimality condition of the DUE-SC provide the traffic volume control scheme. The control scheme can be interpreted as additional travel delays (either tolls or access delays) imposed upon drivers for using the controlled links. This additional delay term derived from the Lagrange multiplier is compared with its counterpart in a static user equilibrium assignment model. If the side constraint is chosen as the storage capacity of a link, the additional delay can be viewed as the effort needed to prevent the link from spillback. Under this circumstance, it is found that the flow is incompressible when the link traffic volume is equal to its storage capacity. An algorithm based on Euler's discretization scheme and nonlinear programming is proposed to solve the DUE-SC. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the mechanism of the proposed traffic volume control scheme. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Zhong, R. X.; Sumalee, A.; Lam, William H.

The results underscore the substantial linkages in the activity episode generation of adults based on activity purpose and accompaniment type.

Such an assumption can be restrictive and inappropriate, since the implication is a linear and symmetrical dependency structure between the error terms. In this paper, we introduce and apply a flexible approach to sample selection in the context of built environment effects on travel behavior. The approach is based on the concept of a copula, which is a multivariate functional form for the joint distribution of random variables derived purely from pre-specified parametric marginal distributions of each random variable. The copula concept has been recognized in the statistics field for several decades now, but it is only recently that it has been explicitly recognized and employed in the econometrics field. The copula-based approach retains a parametric specification for the bivariate dependency, but allows testing of several parametric structures to characterize the dependency. The empirical context in the current paper is a model of residential neighborhood choice and daily household vehicle miles of travel (VIVIT), using the 2000 San Francisco Bay Area Household Travel Survey (BATS). The sample selection hypothesis is that households select their residence locations based on their travel needs, which implies that observed VIVIT differences between households residing in neo-urbanist and conventional neighborhoods cannot be attributed entirely to the built environment variations between the two neighborhoods types. The results indicate that, in the empirical context of the current study, the VMT differences between households in different neighborhood types may be attributed to both built environment effects and residential self-selection effects. As importantly, the study indicates that use of a traditional Gaussian bivariate distribution to characterize the relationship in errors between residential choice and VMT can lead to misleading implications about built environment effects.

The presence of uncertainty in transportation systems presents new challenges in making optimal network investment decisions. In this paper, we develop a multi time period network design problem considering both demand uncertainty and demand elasticity. Such an approach affords the planner the flexibility to delay, change, or even abandon the future network investment. We measure the flexibility of investing over multiple time periods as compared to a single-stage network design decision. Initially, we provide a taxonomy and define many dimensions of transportation network flexibility. This is followed with the development of a flexible network design formulation (FNDP), in which the investment is staged over multiple time periods. The demand is assumed to be separable and the demand elasticity is captured using a negative exponential distribution. We develop the FNDP formulation as bilevel stochastic mathematical programming with complementarity constraints (STOCH-MPEC) in which the bi-level formulation is converted to a single level using non-linear complementarity constraints conditions for user equilibrium (UE) problem. The formulation is implemented on two test networks and the results show the benefits of FNDP over single-stage NDP-measured in terms of increase in present expected system consumer surplus (PESCS)-are in the range of 10-30%. The results clearly demonstrate that under demand uncertainty there are potential benefits of introducing flexibility in investment decisions. Finally, we conduct a sensitivity analysis of FNDP with different budget values and it is observed that certain paradoxical sharp corners are observed at certain budget values. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The approximations are valuable for the strategic and planning analysis of transportation and logistics problems. Using asymptotic properties of vehicle routing problems and the average probability of successfully sequencing a customer with time windows a new expression to estimate VRP distances is developed. The increase in the number of routes when time constraints are added is modeled probabilistically. This paper introduces the concept of the average probability of successfully sequencing a customer with time windows. It is proven that this average probability is a unique characteristic of a vehicle routing problem. The approximation proposed is tested in instances with different customer spatial distributions, depot locations and number of customers. Regression results indicate that the proposed approximation is not only intuitive but also predicts the average length of VRP problems with a high level of accuracy. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Among these determinants, a 'low-cost' strategic position does not confer survival benefits to new entrants. Entering markets with different levels of prior concentrations - which economists traditionally relate to different pricing powers - does not significantly affect the survival odds of new entrants. Entering mid-sized markets adversely affects entrant survival, while entering large, small or new markets at inception does not noticeably impact entrant survival. Network economics that corresponds to low operating costs (aircraft size) is a consistent contributor to entrant survival. In addition, new entrants based in France or Ireland are less likely to survive than others, reflecting the strong negative impact of intermodal competition and a strong, entrenched entrant.

The joint time allocation model is formulated, from which a nonlinear Tobit model is derived. The model parameters are estimated using empirical data collected through household time allocation surveys held in 2003 in Tokyo and Toyama, Japan. Four models - a weekday model and a weekend day model for Tokyo and Toyama each - are estimated. The empirical analysis reveals the common characteristics between the two cities - with respect to the child's gender; the husband's weekly non-working days, allowance, and job; and the wife's age and job - that significantly influence the household's welfare. The empirical analysis also reveals different characteristics between the two cities. First, the greater the number of children in a household, the higher is the significance of the husband and wife's joint out-of-home leisure activity on a weekday for household welfare in Tokyo, and the lower is the same in Toyama. Second. the greater the non-working days of the husbands, the lower is the significance of their individual out-of-home leisure activities on a weekday for household welfare in Tokyo and the higher is the same in Toyama. These characteristics may reflect the local's attitudes in intra-household interaction. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The construction industry has unfortunate reputations in delivering projects that are unpredictable in terms of on time delivery, within budget and to the pre-specified quality, whilst concurrently attempting to ensure a zero accident rate. The Malaysian construction industry had carried out several mega projects in the past two decades but most of these projects were not cost, time and quality effective. There are a lot of non-value adding activities or wastes in construction processes and many among those were left unnoticed or unattended. Waste has been considered a major problem in the construction industry. Waste does not only have an impact on the efficiency of the construction industry but also on the overall state of the economy of the country. Previous studies have shown that tremendous productivity improvements can be achieved by simply targeting at reducing or eliminating those wastes and/or improve the process flow. Waste is defined as any losses produced by activities that generate direct or indirect costs, but do not add any value to the product from the point of view of the client. Accordingly, higher productivity could be achieved by minimizing wastes. In order to achieve that, there are dire needs immediate changes in the industry. One of the major hindrances to waste minimization is the difficulty in establishing a proper methodology which can be used to benchmark future construction projects. Wastes that are mentioned earlier are identified by Taiichi Ohno as the seven wastes that are part of the Toyota Production System (TPS), which is also known as lean manufacturing or lean production. Lean manufacturing is a systemic approach to meeting customer expectations, whatever they value, by reducing waste. Lean production aims to optimize performance of the production system against a standard of perfection to meet unique customer requirements. Lean construction results from the application of this new form of production management to construction. Lean construction is much like the current practice, which has the goal of meeting the customer's needs while using the least of everything. This study is part of an on-going research project aiming to enhance Malaysia construction productivity performance by eliminating non value-adding activities using lean construction techniques. This is meant to have a clearer picture on how lean is local construction performed pertaining to the concepts and principles of lean construction. In this paper, wastes in construction processes will be identified and potential application of value stream mapping tools to identify and eliminate construction process will be discussed.","[Lim, I.

This transit-network design problem is known to be complex and cumbersome. Thus, a heuristic methodology is proposed, taking into account the major concerns of transit authorities such as budget constraints, level-of-service standards and the attractiveness of the transit routes. In addition, this approach considers other important aspects of the problem including categorization of stops, multiclass of transit vehicles, hierarchy planning, system capacity (which has been largely ignored in past studies) and the integration between route-design and frequency-setting analyses. The process developed starts with the construction of a set of potential stops using a clustering concept Then, by the use of Newton gravity theory and a special shortest-path procedure, a set of candidate routes is formed, categorized by hierarchy (mass, feeder, local routes). In the last step of the process a metaheuristic search engine is launched over the candidate routes, incorporating budgetary constraints, until a good solution is found. The algorithm was tested on the actual-size transit network of the city of Winnipeg: the results show that under the same conditions (budget and constraints) the proposed set of routes resulted in a reduction of 14% of total travel time compared to the existing transit network. In addition the methodology developed is compared favorably with other studies using the transit network of Mandl benchmark. The generality of the methodology was tested on the recent real dataset (pertaining to the year 2010) of the larger city of Chicago, in which a more efficient and optimized scheme was proposed for the existing rail system.

Without control, buses on a single line tend to bunch, reducing their punctuality in meeting a schedule. Although conventional schedule-based strategies that hold buses at control points can alleviate this problem these methods require too much slack, which slows buses. This delays on-board passengers and increases operating costs. It is shown that dynamic holding strategies based on headways alone cannot help buses adhere to a schedule. Therefore, a family of dynamic holding strategies that use bus arrival deviations from a virtual schedule at the control points is proposed. The virtual schedule is introduced whether the system is run with a published schedule or not. It is shown that with this approach, buses can both closely adhere to a published schedule and maintain regular headways without too much slack. A one-parameter version of the method can be optimized in closed form. This simple method is shown to be near-optimal. To put it in practice, the only data needed in real time are the arrival times of the current bus and the preceding bus at the control point relative to the virtual schedule. The simple method was found to require about 40% less slack than the conventional schedule-based method. When used only to regulate headways it outperforms headway-based methods.

This paper proposes an analytical model that extends the Newell-Daganzo model by incorporating, endogenously, the capacity drop related to the merging process. Two cases are investigated depending on the traffic states on the on-ramp. The model properties are analyzed and a sensitivity analysis is performed to quantify the relative contribution of the each parameter in the capacity drop. Finally, the extended Newell-Daganzo model is validated with experimental data coming from an active merge bottleneck on the M6 freeway in UK. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The main purpose of the research was to reveal the relation between the runway capacity constraint at the hub airport and airline behavior. We extend the existing bi-level market model by allowing choice of aircraft size and service frequency. We apply the model to the case of runway capacity expansion at Haneda Airport. The results suggest that aircraft a downsizing strategy is not always adopted when the runway capacity is expanded. Furthermore, runway capacity expansion improves the benefit of passengers who travel between urban areas but not the benefit of local passengers. Finally, a runway capacity expansion tends to improve the affected airlines' profitability. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

To ensure reliability, the model plans for more evacuees (i.e. demand inflation) and less road capacity (i.e. supply deflation). A major contribution is that we provide a framework to determine the amount of demand inflation/supply deflation necessary to ensure a user-specified reliability level.

Recently, some research has examined the validity of this assumption by empirically analyzing the impact of the number of attributes on estimated utilities. It suggests that respondents not only build up a mental representation of the decision problem in reality, but also when they provide value judgments in a conjoint experiment. It implies that explicit modeling of this process of mental representation and information processing may improve the validity of conjoint estimates. This paper puts forward such a modeling approach, based on principles of bounded rationality. The approach uses attribute thresholds to construct individuals' preference structures from which heterogeneous decision heuristics can be exactly inferred. Decisions are modeled as a two-layer process with an individual selecting a heuristic first and then applying the chosen heuristic for decision making. The whole process is modeled with a latent class structure and the choice of heuristic is assumed to be influenced by mental effort, risk perception, and expected outcome. An application of the approach is carried out using data about people's choice of a new transit system. The results show the ability of the proposed approach to estimate different decision heuristics and information search patterns in different stages of the decision. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

While the passenger trains have a prescribed timetable that cannot be changed. freight train operators send the infrastructure manager requests to insert new freight trains. For each freight train, the associated train operator specifies a preferred ideal timetable, which can be modified by the infrastructure manager in order to respect safeness operational constraints. in particular, this modification may correspond to routing the train along a path which is different with respect to the one in the ideal timetable. Roughly speaking, the objective is to introduce as many new freight trains as possible by assigning them timetables that are as close as possible to the ideal ones. For this timetabling problem on a generic railway network, we present an integer linear programming formulation. that generalizes some formulations already presented for the case of a single railway line, and a Lagrangian heuristic based oil this formulation Computational results on real-world instances are reported.

Under such behavior, users do not necessarily choose a shortest or cheapest route when doing so does not reduce their travel times by a significant amount. A general path-based definition and a more restrictive link-based representation of boundedly rational user equilibrium (BRUE) are presented. The set of BRUE flow distributions is generally non-convex and non-empty. The problems of finding best- and worst-case BRUE flow distributions are formulated and solved as mathematical programs with complementarity constraints. Because alternative tolled BRUE flow distributions exist, our congestion pricing models seek a toll vector or pattern that minimizes the system travel time of the worst-case tolled BRUE flow distribution. As formulated. the models are generalized semi-infinite min-max problems and we propose a heuristic algorithm based on penalization and a cutting-plane scheme to solve them.

The heuristic provided a complete set of solutions that enable terminal operators to evaluate various berth scheduling policies and select the schedule that improves operations and customer satisfaction. The proposed algorithm outperformed a state of the art metaheuristic and provided improved results when compared to the weighted approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The model is applied for estimating the impact of truck lane restrictions. It is found that system capacity is maximized either (i) when each truck type uses a different lane or (ii) when they share the same lane, depending on the relative proportion of heavy trucks. Moreover, this application sheds some light to the puzzling empirical result in several places around the world, where time and time again it is observed that the operational improvements of truck lane restrictions are small or negligible.

Motivated by the desire of a shipping carrier to reduce its fixed costs, the problem is to construct a set of compact work areas for regional pickup and delivery operations. In general terms, the objective is to find the minimum number of clusters (homogeneous vehicles) that satisfy volume, time and contiguity constraints. The problem is placed in context by formulating it as a mixed-integer goal program. Because practical instances contain anywhere from 6000 to 50,000 data points and can only be described in probabilistic terms, it is not possible to obtain provably optimal solutions to the proposed model. Instead, a novel solution methodology is developed that makes use of metaheuristic and mathematical programming techniques. In the preprocessing phase, a fraction of the data points are aggregated to reduce the problem size. This is shown to substantially decrease the computational burden without compromising solution quality. In the main step, an efficient adaptive search procedure is used to form the clusters. Randomness is introduced at each inner iteration to ensure a full exploration of the feasible region, and an incremental slicing scheme is used to overcome local optimality. In metaheuristic terms, these two refinements are equivalent to diversification and intensification search strategies. To improve the results, a set covering problem is solved in the final phase. The individual clusters obtained from the heuristic provide the structure for this model. To test the methodology, six data sets provided by the sponsoring company were analyzed. All runs for the first two phases took less than 4 min, and in all but one case produced a tangible improvement over the current service area configurations. The set covering solution provided further improvement, which collectively averaged 11.2%. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper proposes a framework that applies sustainability measures to the project level of the construction industry through related indicators. The proposed framework identifies indicators for the three aspects of sustainable construction at the various stages of the construction lifecycle (i.e. feasibility study, design, construction, operation and demolition).

It is finally found that the value of delivery time for a purchased book from an online bookstore to a consumer is approximately $0.53 per day, which means an online bookstore will have to lower a book's price by $0.53 to attract a physical bookstore shopper if the delivery is delayed for one day.

It is the core of the broader problem where the objective is to enhance the performance of a vehicular traffic system through real-time information-based network control strategies. The controller seeks behavior consistency by solving a fixed-point problem that estimates drivers' likely reactions to the controller-proposed information strategies while determining them. Experiments are performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The results suggest the importance of using a behavior-consistent approach to determine the in formation-based network control strategies. That is, the effects of driver response behavior to information provision may require more meaningful strategies than those provided under the traditional dynamic traffic assignment models to reliably estimate or control system performance. Information strategies that are not behavior-consistent can potentially deteriorate system performance. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Experiences from developed countries show that government plays an essential role on BEE promotion. Therefore, there is an appeal for research on China's BEE policy, which has a high potential to be improved. In this paper, Chinese Government's role in promoting BEE is classified into five categories: 1) strategic planner; 2) policy-maker; 3) incentive motivator; 4) financing hub; and 5) Advocator. The current policies for BEE promotion are reviewed and evaluated according to each classification. Afterwards, key research issues, which are the main concerns affecting the effects of BEE promotion, are proposed and analyzed based on the classification.

Since 1990's, cultivated land had been shrinking for being converted to industrial and residential uses for urbanization in China. Of all the new urban land, about 74% was converted from arable land. In urbanization process, land utilization conflicts are inevitable between urban land expansion and cultivated land protection. Based on theory of synergetics, this paper constructs the model of land utilization conflicts to calculate the index of land utilization conflicts by 31 provinces in China. The index is decided by urban land potential and cultivated land capacity. The provinces with greater degree of urban land potential will accommodate with more new people and encroach upon less cultivated land in urbanization process. The provinces with larger capacity of cultivated land will have larger recuperability to external impacts and more land supply to urban expansion. The provinces whose index of land utilization conflicts less than 1.0 are Heilongjiang, Xinjiang, Xizang and Neimenggu. They can cope with unfavorable influence by urbanization by themselves. Furthermore, they can supply surplus grain for other provinces. The provinces whose index of land utilization conflicts more than 1.7 are Guangdong, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Fujian. The province with maximum of index is Guangdong (the index more than 1.86). The reasons for sharpest conflicts between urban land use and cultivated land are huge pressure of economical development, high population density and extremely scarce land resource. It is impossible that resolve the conflicts by themselves. In national perspective, the regional coordination of resources is critical measure to solve this problem in the provinces which have sharpest conflicts.","[Shan, N. N.; Liu, W.

Weight is attained from judgment matrix which is evaluated by expert. So the factor weight is influenced by the subjectivity of expert. Appraisals from different expert are always different because of deficiency and discrepancy of each person's experience and knowledge. Traditional method of processing those weights from different experts is weighting expert's evaluation or geometric mean. They either have the character of subjectivity or accept the evaluations equally. If those evaluations are relatively concentrated, appraisals in concentrated area are more reliability, and if those evaluations are not relatively consistent, all of those evaluations should be considered. Here entropy, a measure of uncertainty in informatics, is introduced to measure the consistency of expert evaluations, combined with fuzzy set. In this way, subjective evaluation becomes more objective. In this paper, AHP and entropy are combined to evaluate hazard identification, and fuzzy set is also introduced. Through iterative algorithm of AHP analysis, the method considers fully sub-factors in construction safety hazard analysis, and it reduces relative subjectivity of expert, and distinguishes the important factors affecting safety on construction sites. It can give a more reliable factor weight as a reference for decision making.","[Zhao Jinxian; Kan Hongsheng] Qingdao Technol Univ, Sch Management, Qingdao, Peoples R China",Qingdao University of Technology,,zhjx@qtech.edu.cn; kanhs752@163.com; 781643255@qq.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,3,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,1403,1407,,,,,,5,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900219,0

Superposition and Divergent effect is closely related to total float and newly created total float time. Under current scheduling practices, total float is considered to be an asset for both the contractor and the owner to use for free. Newly created total float is produced by project delays caused by the contractor or the owner. Based on the consideration of the ownership and utilization of total float and newly created total float, the principle for the allocation of the outcome of Superposition and Divergent effect has been proposed.

The data analysis identifies the most important green practices considered by managers, as well as the performance measures that are most appropriate and most widely used as means to evaluate the influence of green practices on supply chain performance. A conceptual model was derived from the data analysis and it can be used to assess the influence of green practices on supply chain performance. This model provides evidence as to which green practices have positive effects on quality, customer satisfaction and efficiency. It also identifies the practices which have negative effects on supply chain performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This result indicates the variable nature of subnetwork O-D flows. This paper discusses an elastic O-D flow table estimation problem for subnetwork analysis. The underlying assumption is that each cell of the subnetwork O-D flow table contains an elastic demand function rather than a fixed demand rate and the demand function can capture all traffic diversion effect under various network changes. We propose a combined maximum entropy-least squares estimator, by which O-D flows are distributed over the subnetwork in terms of the maximum entropy principle, while demand function parameters are estimated for achieving the least sum of squared estimation errors. While the estimator is powered by the classic convex combination algorithm, computational difficulties emerge within the algorithm implementation until we incorporate partial optimality conditions and a column generation procedure into the algorithmic framework. Numerical results from applying the combined estimator to a couple of subnetwork examples show that an elastic O-D flow table, when used as input for subnetwork flow evaluations, reflects network flow changes significantly better than its fixed counterpart.

We designed an integrated supply-side, manufacturing and demand-side operations network in such that the total expected operating cost is minimized. We modeled it in a deterministic equivalent formulation. An L-shaped decomposition with an additional decomposition step in the master problem is proposed. The computational results showed that parallel sourcing has a cost advantage against single sourcing under supply disruptions. In addition, the build-to-order (BTO) manufacturing mitigation process has its greatest impact with high variations on demands and is integrated with the component downward substitution.

Comparisons with the maximum simulated likelihood (MSL) estimation approach are also undertaken. The results indicate that the MACML approach recovers parameters much more accurately than the MSL approach in all model structures and covariance specifications. The MACML inference approach also estimates the parameters efficiently, with the asymptotic standard errors being, in general, only a small proportion of the true values. As importantly, the MACML inference approach takes only a very small fraction of the time needed for MSL estimation. In particular, the results suggest that, for the case of five random coefficients, the MACML approach is about 50 times faster than the MSL for the cross-sectional random coefficients case, about 15 times faster than the MSL for the panel inter-individual random coefficients case, and about 350 times or more faster than the MSL for the panel intra- and inter-individual random coefficients case. As the number of alternatives in the unordered-response model increases, one can expect even higher computational efficiency factors for the MACML over the MSL approach. Further, as should be evident in the panel intra- and inter-individual random coefficients case, the MSL is all but practically infeasible when the mixing structure leads to an explosion in the dimensionality of integration in the likelihood function, but these situations are handled with ease in the MACML approach. It is hoped that the MACML procedure will spawn empirical research into rich model specifications within the context of unordered multinomial choice modeling, including autoregressive random coefficients, dynamics in coefficients, space-time effects, and spatial/social interactions.

Specifically, we present a method based on the theory of Fourier transforms to numerically approximate the probability density function of the system-wide travel time. Except for noted pathological cases, any common continuous or discrete probability distribution can be used to model capacity uncertainty. Theoretical bounds on the approximation errors are formally derived, both for general distributions as well as for the specific instance of normally distributed capacities. These bounds provide valuable insights into the structure of the approximation errors and suggest ways to reduce them. From a practical point of view, we propose a procedure based on successively refining the computational grid in order to guarantee accurate approximations. The proposed methodology takes advantage of the established computational efficiency of the fast Fourier transform. In a numerical case study, we demonstrate that the results of the methodology are consistent with intuition. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Ng, ManWo; Waller, S.

Based on the observation that, when changing its lane, a vehicle affects traffic on both its current and target lanes, we propose to capture such lateral interactions by introducing a new lane-changing intensity variable With a modified fundamental diagram, we are able to study the impacts of lane-changing traffic on overall traffic flow. In addition, the corresponding traffic dynamics can be described with a simple kinematic wave model. For a location-dependent lane-changing intensity variable, we discuss kinematic wave solutions of the Riemann problem of the new model and introduce a supply-demand method for its numerical solutions With both theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that lane-changes could have significant bottleneck effects on overall traffic flow In the future, we will be interested in studying lane-changing intensities lot different road geometries, locations, on-ramp/off-ramp flows, as well as traffic conditions The new modeling framework could be helpful for developing ramp-metering and other lane management strategies to mitigate the bottleneck effects of lane-changes.

It is found that the degree of revenue sharing will be affected by how airlines' services are related to each other (complements, independent, or substitutes) In particular, when carriers provide strongly substitutable services to each other, the airport has incentive to charge airlines, rather than to pay airlines, a share of concession revenue. In these situations, while revenue sharing improves profit, it reduces social welfare It is further found that airport competition results in a higher degree of revenue sharing than would be had in the case of single airports. The airport-airline chains may nevertheless derive lower profits through the revenue-sharing rivalry, and the situation is similar to a Prisoners' Dilemma As the chains move further away from their joint profit maximum, welfare rises beyond the level achievable by single airports. The (equilibrium) revenue-sharing proportion at an airport is also shown to decrease in the number of its carriers, and to increase in the number of carriers at competing airports. Finally, the effects of a 'pure' sharing contract are compared to those of the two-part sharing contract. It is found that whether an airport is subject to competition is critical to the welfare consequences of alternative revenue sharing arrangements. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Once the contractor goes bankrupt before paying the suppliers, the liquidator or the recipient will often deny the debt with regard to the delivered materials and equipment by Bankruptcy Law, and only pay a small fraction of the bill to the supplier, and sometimes even pay nothing. Thus the suppliers tend to suffer a great loss. In addition, there are no relevant laws and regulations in China, expressed or implied, for the payment of the goods after arrival on the site and their ownership in a construction project, which has become the root cause of disputes. Therefore, a reasonable definition of the ownership transference of the goods on the site is the key to solve this problem. For the balance of risks, the delivery of goods on the site should be defined as goods installed on the entities of the construction project. In this way, the risk not only is shared reasonably by the contractors and owners, but also ensures the basic interests of the suppliers. So the definition is suggested here to fill the gap in a construction contract.","[Li Su-lei] Shandong Univ Technol, Zibo 255049, Peoples R China; [He Bai-zhou] Beijing Univ Civil Engn & Architecture, Beijing 100040, Peoples R China",Shandong University of Technology; Beijing University of Civil Engineering & Architecture,"Li, SL (通讯作者)，Shandong Univ Technol, Zibo 255049, Peoples R China.",lsulei@163.com,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-1-921712-07-4,,,,2010,,,,,,,171,+,,,,,,2,"Economics; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Management; Mining & Mineral Processing",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Mining & Mineral Processing,BVA21,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000290881600033,0

Although transit agencies build slack into their schedules to alleviate this problem - if necessary holding buses at control points to stay on schedule - their attempts often fail because practical amounts of slack cannot prevent large localized disruptions from spreading system-wide. This paper systematically analyzes an adaptive control scheme to mitigate this problem. The proposed scheme dynamically determines bus holding times at a route's control points based on real-time headway information. The method requires less slack than the conventional, schedule-based approach to produce headways within a given tolerance. This allows buses to travel faster than with the conventional approach, reducing in-vehicle passenger delay and increasing bus productivity.

Two characteristic features of such problem are that transportation companies utilise vehicles with intensity decreasing with an age of vehicles and that managers of such companies first of all take into account economical criteria when planning vehicle replacements. The paper presents a single criterion, nonlinear, deterministic and discrete mathematical model of such a problem that minimises a total exploitation and ownership costs calculated per kilometre. The exact solution procedure is proposed here. The problem is solved as a real life case study.

First a conceptual framework is presented which links long run decisions of automobile transactions with short run decisions of activity participation, travel and mode choice. The concept of activity/travel stress is introduced to represent the difference between household activity/travel with the current vehicle fleet and that associated with alternative fleets due to purchase or disposal of a vehicle. The concept of stress is operationalized with a utility-based formulation in which two measures of activity/travel stress are simulated for each household, mode choice utility gained by making a vehicle transaction, and the change in number of conflicts experienced in the household over a limited number of vehicles. These measures are simulated with multiple replications of an activity-based microsimulation model of activity scheduling and mode choice that explicitly represents household interactions of vehicle allocation, ridesharing and drop-off/pick-up of household members. The empirical analysis indicates, for both stress measures, an asymmetry associated with vehicle transactions. Households increase their activity/travel stress far more by disposing of a vehicle, than they alleviate stress by purchasing a vehicle. A nested logit vehicle transaction model shows that both measures of stress are moderately significant influences on vehicle transactions. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In view of the importance of it, many colleges and universities cultivate real estate appraisal talents to meet the demand of society by setting real estate appraisal courses under some majors. Real estate appraisal is also a highly integrated and practical industry; the interrelated knowledge includes economic, legal, finance, accounting, statistics, project management and civil engineering etc. To students, it is difficult to acquire complete knowledge by only learning one or two courses. Also it is difficult to train qualified real estate appraisal talents. The primary issue of building real estate appraisal course system is to specify training goal. Real estate appraisal industry itself is an important social industry and has a positive impact on the employment of university students. So it is very necessary to train talents for the goal of application-oriented talents. The course system building of real estate appraisal should be based on the real estate appraisal knowledge system, since training goal of real estate appraisal course system is to train application-oriented talents, so the knowledge system which is needed for real estate appraisal should be made according to real estate appraisal practical business. The basic quality of real estate appraisal practitioners supplies an important enlightenment for building the knowledge system. As real estate appraisal practitioners, they should have good professional ethics and a wealth of knowledge on construction, project cost, economics theory, real estate professional and technical knowledge, law, etc. In addition, the implementation of the registered real estate appraiser examination provides a useful reference for real estate appraisal course system. In the paper, the knowledge related to real estate appraisal is divided into three types: closely linked to real estate appraisal result and report for the practice knowledge; closely linked to real estate appraisal method for basic theory knowledge; the relative knowledge and law for external knowledge. The corresponding courses require students to master, understand or familiar respectively. At the same time real estate appraisal courses can be divided into three types: basic knowledge course, professional basic course and practice course. Because real estate appraisal is an industry needed more practice, so practical training program should be paid more and more attention to. At current, setting up real estate appraisal direction under some majors to train real estate special talents is still a practice method.","[Chu, Jianpeng] Shandong Univ Technol, Sch Resources & Environm Engn, Zibo 255049, Shandong, Peoples R China",Shandong University of Technology,,zuiwochangan@sohu.com,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,8,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,2376,2380,,,,,,5,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119901148,0

It is generally believed that, as a result of the global financial crisis, market competition has been significantly intensified, and in the face of this increasingly competitive market and resulting challenges, many businesses are struggling to survive while their employees' initiatives are greatly stifled. In such circumstance, the key to an effective management of employees is to stimulate their initiatives through the Incentive Management practices. Undoubtedly, the enhanced employees' initiatives can be a strong tonic to increase businesses' vitality, which in turn will play an important role in strengthening businesses' competitive capabilities in international markets and ensuring businesses' sustained development. Thus, it is concluded that effective Incentive Management practices may help businesses struggling to survive overcome difficulties imposed by the current financial crisis by improving employees' work satisfaction and initiatives and ultimately maintain and enhance businesses' efficiency and productivity.","[Li, Zhao] Huaiyin Inst Technol, Huaian 223001, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Huaiyin Institute of Technology,,jshaz@126.com,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,3,WORLD ACAD UNION-WORLD ACAD PRESS,LIVERPOOL,"113, ACADEMIC HOUSE, MILL LANE, WAVERTREE TECHNOLOGY PARK, LIVERPOOL, L13 4 AH, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84626-075-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,417,420,,,,,,4,"Business, Finance; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BQC56,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000280694900091,0

The both prudent and practical strategy plan at the very beginning of a project lifecycle should become the focus which can decide the survival and development for developers at present. When the economy has entered a regulatory period, in which the prospects of business, finance, and government policy are not lucid, developers may be influenced by complicated factors during the phase of pre-construction plan for real estate projects since more risks may be encountered by the projects. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out investigations and analysis on all kinds of objective factors that could affect developer's plan. It's meaningful that objective factors influencing the pre-construction plan of real estate projects are made clear through the analysis of variables such as government policy, financing, technology, market, location and humanities in this paper. Questionnaire survey including 30 questions was conducted on developers in order to discover which variables are recognized as the most important. Data are collected and reliability analysis is done by SPSS 13.0. The means of each variable are calculated. Nowadays, financial problem is ranked first by developers rather than the factor of market demand. This indicates that Chinese developers have less concern about what their clients really want, which probably could explain the gap between supply and demand in the housing industry. This could cause a vicious circle. Obviously, the subjective factors affecting developers' pre-construction planning of real estate projects, such as the experiences and character of developers themselves are needed to be studied further.","[Lu Xinhong; Zhao Shun] Shanghai Univ, Sch Real Estate, Shanghai 201702, Peoples R China",Shanghai University,,luxinhong@staff.shu.edu.cn; Zhao_zidane@hotmail.com,,,,,,,3,1,1,0,5,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,944,948,,,,,,5,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900149,0

The aim of this paper is to fill in this gap by presenting a fuzzy AHP based methodology t evaluated the cost overrun risks. This paper first identified the key cost-overrun risks through survey questionnaires and then sets up a hierarchy structure of these risks. Following that the paper develops a fuzzy AHP-based comprehensive evaluation model for the appraisal of the risk environment to support the rational decision making. The AHP method is applied for calculating the index weight by forming interval number evaluation matrix. Furthermore, the paper discusses in details how to apply the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method which contains the index weights to analyze project cost-overrun risks. An empirical case study is used to demonstrate the application of the proposed AHP-based fuzzy risk evaluation model. It is concluded that the AHP-based fuzzy risk evaluation model is effective in tackling the cost-overrun risks. The information presented in this paper should be appearing to all parties considering seizing the construction business opportunities in China as the data were obtained in first hand from the Chinese construction industry by means of surveys. In particular, the key cost-overrun risks factors identified through the extensive surveys in the paper would be useful to practitioners in China and those in other countries in order to better manage such risks to achieve the project objective of within budget and value for money. The proposed research approach/methodology should be applicable to the research and analysis of not only cost overrun risks but also other types of risk such as time delay and quality risks associated with any types of construction projects and this in turn should be a useful reference to researchers in the field of construction management.","[Wang Jiayuan; Ma Shichao] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China",Shenzhen University,,,,,,,,,47,0,0,0,12,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,1472,1486,,,,,,15,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900231,0

First, the author reviews the situation of housing security system in Xi' an in recent years. The housing filtering theory and the gradient consumption theory are used to analyze housing policy of Xi'an qualitatively. Then, the author discusses the thinking of reasonable indemnificatory housing supply system, based on the logical layered of housing consumption. With the construction of gradient consumption model, the author describes the operation framework on how the gradient consumption model helps to realize the reasonable indemnificatory housing supply, considering the formation of gradient consumption configuration, the overall development of supply system, operation mechanism and the construction of related system. There are some main conclusions about housing security system, including the unbalance between supply and demand of indemnificatory housing, the need of improving the location and quality of indemnificatory housing, the lack of reasonable mechanism for access and exit, the strong casualness of policy because of low degree of legal system, the poor fairness resulted by imperfect operation mechanism and so on.

The author hopes this research can make sense and provide reference for some related departments.","[Wu Gongjun] Xian Jiaotong Univ China, Sch Publ Policy & Adm, Xian 710049, Shaanxi Prov, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University,,chilong0324@stu.xjtu.edu.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,2,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,873,878,,,,,,6,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900137,0

To substance the growth need, China has hard-pressed major policies such as suppress the 2nd industry and develop the 3rd industry, which consequently weeded out a flood of polluting plants out of the inner-city. Most of the plants built in 1960s have generated in varying degrees poisonous waste seeping into soil; and a large portion of such contaminated land has been and will continuously be converted into commercial or residential uses. This paper uses a large residential project in Guangzhou built on a chemically polluted site in Guangzhou to examine factual evidence of contaminated treatment in the brownfield redevelopment process in Chinese cities. It identifies institutions, processes and practices related to the reclamation of brownfield sites for high-density residential use and assess preliminarily the impact of formerly industrial sites on residential development in inner-city areas. The study found that inner-city industry relocation being part of China's economic transition has triggered a massive process of transformation of inner-city land use from industrial to residential or commercial uses. Although controls of environmental impacts are carefully managed and monitored during the construction period, much less cares were given at pre-construction and post-occupancy period. For inner-city redevelopment on sites with heavy industry heritage, this could impose a significant impact on the sustainable land use in China's major cities.","[Wu, H.; Chen, C.] Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Melbourne Sch Design, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,,haow@unimelb.edu.au,"Wu, Hao/A-4706-2019","Wu, Hao/0000-0002-3221-2118",,,,,18,0,0,5,22,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,1104,1110,,,,,,7,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900172,0

Through the collection of residential transactions of Chongqing and selection of the locations, structures, environmental factors, etc. as the residential features, the paper constructs the residential hedonic price model. After using some software for multiple regressions on the model, the authors have achieved six implicit prices of the main residential features, and then they classify the residential features closely related to the residential prices into three categories. The statistical testing and the analysis of the model results show that the model is effective and reasonable; accordingly it can be used to explain and analyze the housing prices in Chongqing.","[Xiang Weimin] Chongqing Inst Technol, Sch Econ & Trade, Chongqing 400050, Peoples R China",Chongqing University of Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences,,drxwm@cqit.edu.cn; renhong@cqu.edu.cn,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,7,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,821,826,,,,,,6,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900128,0

An optimization model is developed that integrates international and North America inland transport networks. The results indicate optimal ship size, route, port, and interior shipping corridor and are highly reflective of observed shipments. Sensitivity analyzes were performed to evaluate impacts of congestion on capacity constraints as well as the prospective impacts of the alternative routes that are emerging. Results indicate that Prince Rupert is highly competitive for shipments to some markets, but the expansion of the Panama Canal would have lesser impacts on container flows. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The profit-maximizing firms select both the capacities associated with the various supply chain network activities as well as the product quantities. We formulate the governing Nash-Cournot equilibrium conditions as a variational inequality problem and identify several special cases of the model, notably, a generalization of a spatial oligopoly and a classical oligopoly problem to include design capacity variables. The proposed computational approach, which is based on projected dynamical systems, fully exploits the network structure of the problems and yields closed form solutions at each iteration. In order to illustrate the modeling framework and the algorithm, we also provide solutions to a spectrum of numerical supply chain network oligopoly design examples. This paper makes a contribution to game theoretic modeling of competitive supply chain network design problems in an oligopolistic setting. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet there found some discrepancies concerning the use and the manner that SMS was being explained and taught. Therefore, this research aims to develop a quantitative evaluation model, which identifies the key components of airline SMS and considers the interaction between key components. To explore the core value of SMS. an extensive review regarding SMS components are firstly conducted and summarized from major aviation organizations and authorities, and then Grey Relational Analysis is used to group and select key components. After the critical components are derived, Decision Making Trial Evaluation Laboratory and Analytic Network Process are employed to analyze and map out all kinds of interactions among critical components and dimensions systematically. An empirical study is presented to illustrate the application of the proposed methods. From the results of the combined approaches, Organization is the most important dimension in SMS, which begins with Policies that convey to all staff the top managers' vision on safety.

Each of the two building blocks of BA, namely the construction of acyclic sub-networks (bush) and the solution of restricted master problems (RMP), is examined and further developed. Four Newton-type algorithms for solving RMP. which can be broadly categorized as route flow and origin flow based, are presented. of which one is newly developed in this paper. Similarities and differences between these algorithms, as well as the relevant implementation issues are discussed in great details. A comprehensive numerical study is conducted using both real and randomly generated networks, which reveals that the relative performance of the algorithms is consistent with the analysis. In particular, the results suggest that swapping flows between shortest and longest route segments consistently outperforms other RMP solution techniques. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It is assumed that parking charges gradually decrease from the city center to the corridor boundary and commuters are continuously distributed along the corridor. Commuters choose either the railway or highway for traveling from their home to the center in the morning. If choosing the highway, the commuters also consider the use of park-and-ride facilities available anywhere throughout the corridor. Given these assumptions, we propose a deterministic continuum equilibrium model to characterize commuters' modal choices and park-and-ride transfer behaviors. We prove that, at equilibrium, the variable travel cost per unit distance on the highway is not higher than that on the railway along the corridor. As a result, the railway is used only between the city center (the destinations of morning commuters) and some location in the linear city, beyond which all commuters choose the highway. Furthermore, commuters living closer to the city center choose the park-and-ride facilities that are simultaneously chosen by those who live farther away from the city center. The model is solved numerically through its transformation into a discrete version using a supernetwork approach and demonstrated with numerical examples together with a discussion of the effect of park-and-ride services and pricing on travel behaviors.

However, in contrast to extensive studies of traffic dynamics on a road link, little is understood for those on a road network, In this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis of asymptotic traffic dynamics arising in diverge-merge networks with two intermediate links with first-order kinematic wave models. In addition, traffic demand at the origin and traffic demand at the destination are constant and maximum, and the proportion of vehicles choosing an intermediate link is constant. First, we examine all possible asymptotic stationary states and the sufficient and necessary conditions for their existence. With an example, we find that non-stationary states can include damped (DPO) and persistent periodic oscillations (PPO), and present an equivalent dynamical system that can be used to distinguish these two types of oscillations. This study can be a springboard for better understanding of traffic dynamics, especially formation and propagation of traffic congestion, on general road networks. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Our results suggest that the occurrence of two factors is crucial: the presence of leaders as aggregators of knowledge and the presence of agents able to expand and improve their higher profit projects.

Selecting the right general contractor for the right job significantly influences the quality of work in these projects. Therefore, construction owners must be extremely careful while selecting the most appropriate contractor for the project. In the selection process, construction owners have to know all financial, technical and general information about the contractors to determine the most appropriate one for the project. Depending on the lowest bid price alone in the selection process, especially for complex construction projects in which a more detailed evaluation methodology is usually needed may result in serious money losses for construction owners in the long run. Within this context, the owners should consider several criteria that may include the quality of production, adequacy of technical staff and financial stability during the selection process. In this study, a survey was carried out among 52 construction professionals working in a public administration which has been operating in the housing sector in Turkey. The administration is the single responsible public body in this sector in Turkey and provides housing especially for the low and middle-income groups. The administration has been using several evaluation criteria for selecting contractors in construction projects. These criteria can be categorized under the main headings as quality, time, cost, and provisional / final acceptance. The objectives of the survey are to examine these criteria and determine the relative weights of the main and sub-criteria used by the administration. The survey was conducted over a two month period between August and September 2008. The survey questionnaire was administered during face-to-face interviews. Simple Multi Attribute Rating Technique (SMART) is used to determine the weights of the criteria. According to the responses, quality was ranked as the first important criterion with a slight difference.","[Demirci, Gulcan] Housing Dev Adm Turkey, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey",,,gdemirci@toki.gov.tr; patron@gmail.com; serkankivrak@anadolu.edu.tr; gokhana@anadolu.edu.tr,"Kivrak, Serkan/P-1495-2019",,,,,,24,1,1,0,6,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,2672,2677,,,,,,6,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119901193,0

The analysis explores how retailer's limited capability to forecast end-customer demand and their sub-optimal replenishment policies distort service demand signals to carriers. The consequent unnecessary increases in carriers' capacity costs and operational instability are quantified for a context of pronounced seasonality. The paper finds that carriers unable to adjust transportation capacity to seasonal changes can incur costs of nearly five times what is possible with maximum forecasting capabilities and prudent replenishment policies. Another major finding is that replenishment policy is superior to forecasting capability in reducing BWE-related costs. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A real estate market indicator system including three parts as well as three-hierarchy indicators was established, and a comparative analysis on two different market environments was constructed on the basis. Finally, compared with relatively mature real estate market of Hong Kong, remarkable regional market discrepancy, low market entry barriers and extensive property product mode were identified as the most typical characteristics for China real estate market.

Despite the broad range of literature that links performance to both green manufacturing capabilities such as pollution prevention and green supply management (GSM), managers are having difficulties developing a greener supply chain. The objective of this paper is to provide a model for development of GSM capabilities. Using the resource-based view of the firm (RBV) as the theoretical background, we postulate that plant resources are positively related to green manufacturing capabilities, which in turn are positively related to GSM capabilities. The data from a survey of a sample of manufacturing plants indicates that a managerial philosophy that includes external knowledge exchange directly supports both greener process management and environmental collaboration with suppliers. However, this managerial philosophy is only indirectly related to supplier selection and monitoring. The managerial implications of these findings are twofold: managers seeking to implement GSM need to view internal investment in green process management as a step toward environmental management of their external supply chains. They also must realize that green process management requires the support of other resources, such as environmental investments and top management commitment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A social planner is assumed to initially distribute a certain number of travel credits to all eligible travelers, and then there are link-specific charges to travelers using that link. Free trading of credits among travelers is assumed. For a given credit distribution and credit charging scheme, the existence of a unique equilibrium link flow pattern is demonstrated with either fixed or elastic demand. It can be obtained by solving a standard traffic equilibrium model subject to a total credit consumption constraint. The credit price at equilibrium in the trading market is also conditionally unique. The appropriate distribution of credits among travelers and correct selection of link-specific rates is shown to lead to the most desirable network flow patterns in a revenue-neutral manner. Social optimum, Pareto-improving and revenue-neutral, and side-constrained traffic flow patterns are investigated. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The approach is applicable to data sets of any size, provides standard error estimates for all parameters, and does not require any simulation machinery The combined copula-CML approach proposed here should be appealing for general multivariate modeling contexts because it is simple and flexible, and is easy to implement The ability of the CML approach to recover the parameters of a spatially ordered process is evaluated using a simulation study, which clearly points to the effectiveness of the approach In addition, the combined copula-CML approach is applied to study the daily episode frequency of teenagers' physically active and physically inactive recreational activity participation, a subject of considerable interest in the transportation, sociology, and adolescence development fields. The data for the analysis are drawn from the 2000 San Francisco Bay Area Survey. The results highlight the value of the copula approach that separates the univariate marginal distribution form from the multivariate dependence structure, as well as underscore the need to consider spatial effects in recreational activity participation. The variable effects indicate that parents' physical activity participation constitutes the most important factor influencing teenagers' physical activity participation levels Thus, an effective way to increase active recreation among teenagers may be to direct physical activity benefit-related information and education campaigns toward parents. perhaps at special physical education sessions at the schools of teenagers.

Its contribution is twofold. Firstly, we develop a general equilibrium model to explore the impact of a small budgetary-neutral investment in transport infrastructure in a second-best setting, where other markets in the economy are distorted by taxes or external costs. The model incorporates different transport modes that are used both for intermediate inputs (freight) and for final consumption (passenger travel). An intuitive operational expression for the net economic benefit of an investment is derived that depends on the way the investment is financed. This expression generalizes recent findings in the literature. Secondly, we illustrate the results numerically using a small example. Our findings show that both the specific financing instrument used and the labour market consequences may have large implications for the net benefits of transport investments. Significant errors may be made in limiting cost-benefit analysis to transport markets only. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

One way to reduce complexity could be to aggregate suitable sections of a network. In this paper, we present a simulation-based technique to generate delay estimates over track segments as a function of traffic conditions, as well as network topology. We test our technique by comparing the delay estimates obtained for a network in Los Angeles with the delays obtained from the simulation model developed by Lu et al. [Lu, Q., Dessouky, M.M., Leachman, R.C., 2004. Modeling of train movements through complex networks.

In recent years, China has experienced unprecedented growth in the demand for air travel, which has put continuous pressure on the expansion in airport capacity. Still as a developing country, China suffers from insufficient investment in infrastructure. Therefore. given scarce capacity, it may be more efficient for the major air carriers not to adopt the hub-and-spoke network in Chinese domestic markets. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, KPIs have often been subjectively identified and vaguely defined. Therefore, there is a strong need within the construction industry for identifying a set of common KPIs to be used by construction executives and project managers in measuring, monitoring and improving construction performance at the project level. Even though some KPIs, such as time, cost and quality, are always regarded as the three most vital KPIs for measuring the performance of construction projects, different industrial practitioners usually have their own semantic interpretations on each KPI and there is a lack of objective and common basis to evaluate the performance of different construction projects, thus making benchmarking difficult. This paper provides an initial report of a research project in Hong Kong, which aims to develop a comprehensive, objective, reliable and practical performance evaluation model for benchmarking and monitoring purposes for construction projects in Hong Kong, and to identify a list of Critical Success Factors (CSFs) for implementing construction projects. The background, the research approaches, and the likely impact of the research study will be discussed in this paper.","[Chan, P. C.; Chan, W. M.; Chiang, Y. H.; Yeung, F.

This paper contributes to the literature by examining how much the prediction accuracy of real estate prices could be improved by applying hedonic equations at suitably defined disaggregate levels and incorporating directional heterogeneity of distance gradients. We build our empirical analysis on a large self-constructed database of residential housings in Shanghai.

Among the applications of the solar energy, solar hot water system is the most promising one. Previous research has indicated that the solar hot water system is more efficient than other applications of the solar energy. However, most of the research on the solar hot water system mainly focus on the small-scale household type, as the need of the solar hot water system increases, the large-scale hot water system should be considered as one of the solution for providing large amount hot water. Although the large-scale solar hot water system can reduce the use of fossil fuel and decrease the greenhouse gas emission, it would possess high initial investment of the equipment and decrease the economic benefit. Therefore, the overall benefit of the solar hot water system over its life cycle should be included within the analysis of determining the solar water system configuration. In addition, previous studies on the configuration of the solar water heater system, which determines the size of the solar collector and the volume of the storage tank, are based on the single type of the solar collector. However, the type of the solar collector plays a crucial role to the life-cycle benefit of the solar water system. Therefore, there is a need to develop a more generic optimization model that determines the type of the solar collector, the size of the collector and the volume of the storage tank with the consideration of the life cycle cost and benefit. This research first employs TRNSYS computer program and the typical meteorological year data to predict the auxiliary energy generated by different types of collector, size of the collector, and storage tank volume. Then a multiple regression analysis and genetic algorithms are applied to minimize the life-cycle cost of the solar hot water system. Several different models of the life-cycle cost are evaluated.","[Feng, C. W.; Chang, P.

These additional considerations make design work and process more complicated. However, few attempts have been made to provide a proactive solution. As a result, the owners and participants of construction projects are usually blamed for their passive attitude or ignorance. This paper proposes an integration mechanism to help the owners and designers to integrate the humanity issues into design process, communicate with stakeholders and achieve consensus. The case study method was adopted in this research. A prominent controversy case in Taiwan(China), the preservation of Losheng sanatorium against the subway system depot location, was employed to understand deeply the evolvement of the issues. Documents were collected and interviews conducted to analyze major causes of the dispute. Literature and theory concerning engineering design, decision making and integration assessment were reviewed to build theoretical foundation. Key successful factors of other successful integration projects were also referenced. Then an integration mechanism including procedures was established. Finally, a rigor index was proposed to measure integration quality in four dimensions in the integration procedures. The study results show that the integration mechanism can help incorporate different issues and achieve consensus if followed rigorously. The process systematically examines the representativeness of stakeholders and experts, their participation, quality of discussions and supporting data. The rigor index, or level of following the mechanism, can explain the quality in integrating humanity issues into engineering design. The mechanism provides a useful tool to the owners and designers to cope with the decision making difficulties in such kind of disputes.","[Lee, K. P.; Chang, A.

In 2000, a floor space of residential buildings of 20 square metres per capita was provided and the figure increased to 32 square metres by 2007[1]. However, the housing development in Chongqing is not without problems. The main difficulty in Chongqing's housing market has been a mismatch between supply and demand at different market levels, which is due to overwhelming housing need and poor affordability. Currently there is a great demand for housing in Chongqing. The demand for housing in the urban areas in 2007 was 17.69 million square metres [1], which was far in excess of the 6.12 million square metres completed in 2000. This paper aims to investigate the recent housing development in Chongqing, with a particular focus on the feasibility and potential of using affordable housing as a vehicle to satisfy the huge housing need in Chongqing's urban area, at an affordable level to the middle and middle-to-low income group people. Design and construction considerations for affordable housing in Chongqing will also be made in this paper.","[Pan Yuhong] Chongqing Jiaotong Univ, Dept Engn Management, Chongqing 400074, Peoples R China",Chongqing Jiaotong University,,panyuhong3@hotmail.com; xiongjianhua@126.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,4,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,1247,1250,,,,,,4,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900195,0

Since 1999, the Government have issued and taken a number of policies and measures to support low-rent housing construction, however, the gaps between the countrywide current beneficiary of minimum-income families and the actual number of households which should be guaranteed is still very large, and the coverage can not be far to meet the current low-income groups and housing difficulties. Simultaneously, the low-rent housing construction still mainly relies on fiscal budget of the central and local government for investment, and nevertheless the effectual investment from other channels of financing is minimal. Consequently, it results in the singleness of financing of the low-rent housing construction, and then restrains development of the low-rent housing in China. Presently, the low-rent housing projects are facing the financing puzzle dom. Based on objectively reflecting this status quo, this paper introduced the PPP model, analyzed its application prospect as viewed from private capital, innovative financial instruments and experience in other fields, and tried to establish the operation framework and risk management structure in the low-rent housing projects and made some conclusions. By that, we expect the PPP model can solve the financing plight of the low-rent housing, and thereby abate the financial pressure on the Government to push low-rent housing development.","[Qu Yan; Li Jinhe] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ China, Sch Business Adm, Dept Tech Econ & Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang Gongshang University,,cabf1925@163.com; join_east@163.com,,,,,,,9,2,2,0,2,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,591,596,,,,,,6,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900089,0

Good forecasts can provide better understanding for the current situation (e.g. drought severity) and consequently improve decision making. Prediction markets have long proved to successfully forecast events in a wide range of applications. They seem to be a promising tool for aggregating and at the same time publishing information about water availability. With the Australian Knowledge Exchange (AKX) we launched a prediction market, in which people were invited to trade their expectations about future dam levels. Our results show that traders are able to forecast water dam levels quite accurately. Nevertheless, a simple self-developed model based on historic data beats the market forecast in half of the cases. Experts seem reluctant - due to various reasons - to join and participate in (water related) prediction markets. In summary, our first experiment results show that markets are a promising approach to forecast Natural Resource Management related figures.

In a period of hyper-activity of the real estate market and rapid urbanization in China in recent years, commercial development and urban sprawl have constantly been taking up more and more rural land in the urban fringes. Rural land tenure security has been brought to the forefront of national polices. Increasing rural land tenure security will inevitably and indirectly influence future land requisition behaviors of the government, which in turn will affect the availability and cost of land for real estate development for commercial developers. Increasing tenure security also means the direct protection of framers' rights and interests as well as the potential bargaining power that they would have in the future in land acquisition matters. The Rural Land Contracting Law (RLCL) is the single most important piece of law protecting rural land tenure security. Through a survey of two villages in Anhui Province, it shows that farmers' knowledge about important contents of the RLCL is insufficient. The result for the implementation of RLCL is mixed: contract certificates are not sufficiently signed or issued while major land adjustments since the implementation of RLCL have not occurred. The RLCL also does not bring much confidence in tenure security. Land requisitions in one of the village surveyed shows that farmers are compensated and informed but their participation in the decision-making process is lacking.","[Wu Jian] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University,,wujianruc@126.com,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,203,209,,,,,,7,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900033,0

It plays a important role of saving energy, protecting environment, increasing the heating comfort, expanding domestic demand and expanding employment and reemployment. Rapid development of energy efficiency renovation of existing residential buildings needs high finance, but the problem of financing gap hasn't been solved up to the present. Reasons mainly include complex investment subjects' composition, lacking reasonable mechanisms of cost splitting and suitable excitation mechanisms. This paper analyses the present financing model for energy efficiency renovation of existing residential buildings in northern areas of China, listing strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, in use of SWOT analysis. Then current financing models at home and abroad are compared in many ways, using comparative economics. Owing to many project management models and financing models, which are EMC ( Energy Management Contracting ), BOT ( Build-Operate-Transfer ), PFI ( Private Finance Initiative ) and PPP ( Private Public Partnership ), a new financing model for energy efficiency renovation of existing residential buildings in northern areas of China is proposed in this paper. Making use of financial subsidies of central government flexibly, applying new effective excitation mechanisms, mobilizing firms and privates' enthusiasm of investment fully are the greatest feature of the new financing model. The model can let firms and privates, who were involved in the whole financing process, share interests which were brought through the energy efficiency renovation of existing residential buildings.","[Yin, S.; Lai, M.; Zeng, D.] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Dept Construct Management, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University,,yshxbyhl@126.com; yzdi@263.net,,,,,,,4,1,1,0,8,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,270,275,,,,,,6,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900042,0

The interest in project management competency has been growing due to an increased demand for competent project managers brought about by the ever-increasing popularity of project management as a means of undertaking and completing work successfully. Many of project management professional bodies have developed project management assessment and development models and in doing so have also contributed to describing what competency is. However there are still different views on how to assess the competency of project managers. This paper reports the findings of a pilot study where an exploratory interview approach is adopted to develop a greater understanding of what competency is perceived by project managers in the construction industry in South Australia.

Reliable access to airports is important since the cost of missing a flight is likely to be high. First, the determinants of the preferred arrival times at airports are analyzed. Second, the willingness to pay (WTP) for reductions in access travel time, early and late arrival time at the airport, and the probability to miss a flight are estimated, using a stated choice experiment. The results indicate that the WTPs are relatively high. Third, a model is developed to calculate the cost of variable travel times for representative air travelers going by car, taking into account travel time cost, scheduling cost and the cost of missing a flight using empirical travel time data. In this model, the value of reliability for air travelers is derived taking anticipating departure time choice into account, meaning that travelers determine their departure time from home optimally. Results of the numerical exercise show that the cost of access travel time variability for business travelers are between 0% and 30% of total access travel cost, and for non-business travelers between 0% and 25%. These numbers depend strongly on the time of the day. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, little is known about the ability of these models to capture the heterogeneity in finite samples (as opposed to asymptotically). Also, due to the computational intensity of the standard estimation procedures, several alternative, less demanding methods have been proposed, and yet the relative accuracy of these methods has not been investigated. This is especially true in the context of work looking at joint inter-respondent and intra-respondent variation. This paper presents an overview of the various different estimators, gives insights into some of the theoretical properties, and analyses their performance in a large scale study on simulated data. In particular, we specify 31 different forms of heterogeneity, with multiple versions of each dataset, and with results from over 16,000 mixed logit estimation runs. The findings suggest that variation in tastes over consumers is captured by all the methods, including the simpler versions, at least when sample size is sufficiently large. When tastes vary over choice situations for each consumer, as well as over consumers, the ability of the methods to capture and differentiate the two sources of heterogeneity becomes more tenuous. Only the most computationally intensive approach is able to capture adequately the two sources of variation, but at the cost of very high run times. Our results highlight the difficulty of retrieving taste heterogeneity with only cross-sectional data, providing further evidence of the benefits of repeated choice data. Our findings also suggest that the data requirements of random coefficients models may be more substantial than is commonly assumed, further reinforcing concerns about small sample issues.

We find that in the absence of passenger-type-based price discrimination by airlines, it can be useful to increase the airport charge so as to protect passengers with a great relative time value from excessive congestion caused by passengers with a low relative time value. As a result, the socially efficient airport charge can be substantially higher than what we learned from the recent literature on congestion pricing with non-atomistic airlines.

We extend the known models by considering users oblivious to congestion in the following sense: While in the typical user equilibrium setting the users follow a strategy that minimizes their individual cost by taking into account the (dynamic) congestion due to the current routing pattern, an oblivious user ignores congestion altogether; instead, he or she decides his routing on the basis of cheapest routes on a network without any flow whatsoever. These cheapest routes can be, for example, the shortest paths in the network without any flow. This model tries to capture the fact that a certain percentage of travelers base their route simply on the distances they observe on a map, without thinking (or knowing, or caring) about the delays experienced on this route due to their fellow travelers. In this work we study the effect of such users using as the measure of network performance its price of anarchy, i.e., the ratio of the total latency experienced by the users (oblivious or not) at equilibrium over the social optimum.

Nevertheless, in dynamic network loading (DNL) models for congested road networks, node models are as important as the extensively studied link models. This paper provides an overview of macroscopic node models found in the literature, explaining both their contributions and shortcomings. A formulation defining a generic class of first order macroscopic node models is presented, satisfying a list of requirements necessary to produce node models with realistic, consistent results. Defining a specific node model instance of this class requires the specification of a supply constraint interaction rule and (optionally) node supply constraints. Following this theoretical discussion, specific macroscopic node model instances for unsignalized and signalized intersections are proposed. These models apply an oriented capacity proportional distribution of the available supply over the incoming links of a node. A computationally efficient algorithm to solve the node models exactly is included. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Tampere, Chris M.
