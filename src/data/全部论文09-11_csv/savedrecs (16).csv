In addition, to take into account zero RD expenditure, this article employed a two-equation model unlike models used in other studies. This method incorporates a two-level decision structure: the participation decision and the decision on the amount to spend once the issue of participation has been decided. According to the estimation results, while the proposition that larger firms are more active in RD is true, the proposition that firms that possess market power are more active in RD is not true for Korea. Technical cooperation among Korean firms seems to be less active than in other countries. In addition, the results indicate that foreign investment stimulates the firms' RD expenditure. Furthermore, a number of factors were found to play a role in promoting firms' RD activities: the external conditions of the firms' RD activities, including the location, other firms' RD activities in the same industry, support from the government and technical support from research institutes.","[Yoo, Seung-Hoon] Hoseo Univ, Dept Int Area Studies, Cheonan 330713, South Korea; [Lee, Joo-Suk; Kwak, Seung-Jun] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Hoseo University; Korea University,"Yoo, SH (通讯作者)，Hoseo Univ, Dept Int Area Studies, 268 Anseo Dong, Cheonan 330713, South Korea.",shyoo@hoseo.edu,"Yoo, Seung-Hoon/F-1048-2010","Yoo, Seung-Hoon/0000-0001-5048-219X",,,,,44,5,5,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This study compares a range of forecasting models in the context of predicting annual tourist flows into Hong Kong from the major long-haul markets of the US, the UK, Germany and major short-haul markets of China, Japan and Taiwan. Econometric forecasting models considered included Error Correction Models (ECMs) based on Permanent Income-Life Cycle (PI-LC) hypothesis (PI-LC ECM) and alternative cointegration approaches: Engle and Granger (1987), Johansen (1988), and Ordinary Least Square (OLS) approaches. Both Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and no change model (hereafter NAIVE) models are used as a benchmark time series model for accuracy comparisons. It was hypothesized that PI-LC ECM is a better forecasting model particularly for long-haul tourism demand. The objective of this article is to investigate whether the application of PI-LC ECM could improve the forecasting performance of econometric models relative to time series models. The forecasting results indicate that the PI-LC ECM based on the Engle-Granger (1987) approach produces more accurate forecasts than other alternative forecasting models for all long-haul markets based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) criteria. Overall, PI-LC ECMs produce better forecasts of tourism demand than the OLS, ARIMA and NAIVE models for all origin markets and all time horizons.","City Univ Hong Kong, Div Commerce, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong,"Lee, KN (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Div Commerce, Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",cmhenry@cityu.edu.hk,,,,,,,66,18,19,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Behavioural research has paid only marginal attention to the goal-basis of the consumer behaviour. Research of consumers as goal-oriented individuals could contribute to understand the question about the impact of personal goals on the process of buying behaviour. The research suggests that external goals such as financial success or attractive appearance are positively correlated with compulsive buying. On the other hand, internal goals, based on self-acceptance or links to community have a negative impact on compulsive buying. The findings indicate the need of further research in compulsive buying and could contribute to revealing the motives in compulsive buying.","Ekon Univ Bratislave, Obchodna Fak, Katedra Mkt, Bratislava 85235 5, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Lesáková, D (通讯作者)，Ekon Univ Bratislave, Obchodna Fak, Katedra Mkt, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235 5, Slovakia.",lesakova@euba.sk,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,10,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

Although lots of studies have been done on economic growth in the world, it has less been regarded in Iran. In this article, by estimating growth regression, we attempt to investigate the supply side of economic growth in Iran. Then we compare the predictive results of Fuzzy-logic, Neural-Fuzzy and Solow models. The results show that there was negative significant relationship (i.e.-0.035) between unstable policy and economic growth rate in Iran during investigation period (1959-2001). In this model, the effect of expenses used by government is positive (i.e. 0.01). Furthermore, the estimated results of long term relationship show that the variable coefficients of capital, labor power, exportation, and inflation are 0.319, 0.016, 0.001, and-0.001, respectively. And also by comparing the predictive results of models for the average percent of annual growth, it is predicted that the average percent of Solow, Neural-Fuzzy, and Fuzzy-logic models are 7.17%, 5.92%, and 6.46% for 2002-2006, respectively. Evaluation of results from the models on the basis of criteria shows that model Neural-Fuzzy predicts better than Fuzzy-logic and Solow models.

Because of multilateral increase of domestic price on energy and oil-based products, wide changes in all the sectors of Iran's economy will happen. Although global changes in oil and oil-based products prices do not have any effect on supply prices inside the country, but they interfere to some extent with the price for consumer products and services, including import and export.

S.) This analysis focuses on damage estimates produced by an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) for emissions of five local air pollutants: sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), nitrogen oxides (NO(x)), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), ammonia (NH(3)), and fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)). For each power plant and pollutant, the Monte Carlo procedure yields an empirical distribution for the damage per ton, or marginal damage. The paper links uncertainty in marginal damages to air pollution policy in two ways. First, the paper characterizes uncertainty in the magnitude of the marginal damages which is relevant to policymakers in determining the stringency of pollution controls. Second, the paper explores uncertainty in the relative damages across power plants. Relative damages are important if policymakers elect to design efficient regulations that vary in stringency according to where emissions are released. The empirical section of the paper finds that the marginal damage distributions are positively skewed and they are more variable for sources in urban areas than rural locations. The paper finds that uncertainty in three input parameters has the greatest impact on uncertainty in the magnitude of damages: the adult mortality dose-response parameter, the mortality valuation parameter, and air quality modeling. The analysis also finds that for each pollutant except for NO(x) only uncertainty in air quality modeling impacts efficient trading ratios calibrated to each firm's marginal damages.","Middlebury Coll, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA",,"Muller, NZ (通讯作者)，Middlebury Coll, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA.",nmuller@middlebury.edu,,,,,,,26,40,49,0,22,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Since countries are assumed to produce the same set of varieties, trade openness makes markets more competitive, reducing prices and increasing quantities. Since firms undertake cost reducing innovations, the increase in production pushes firms to innovate more. Compared to other oligopolistic competition models, we find a larger pro-competitive effect of trade on innovation under this framework, and this effect is increasing the larger the elasticity of substitution between products.","[Navas, Antonio] Univ Alicante, Alicante, Spain; [Navas, Antonio] Univ Autonoma Madrid, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Licandro, Omar] CSIC, IAE, Madrid, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant; Autonomous University of Madrid; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE),"Navas, A (通讯作者)，Univ Alicante, Alicante, Spain.",antonio.navas@uam.es; omar.licandro@iae.csic.es,,,,,,,35,14,14,0,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

J,"Pekarskiene, I; Susniene, R",,,,"Pekarskiene, Irena; Susniene, Rozita",,,An Assessment of the Level of Globalization in the Baltic States,INZINERINE EKONOMIKA-ENGINEERING ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,globalization; economic globalization; sociocultural globlization; political globalization; globalization indeces; globalization level of the state,,"The globalization phenomenon has become a subject of research in scholastic literature. The impact of globalization is the subject of ongoing debate, which is based more on personal provisions than on objective evidence. A need arises to evaluate the process of globalization based not on a subjective view, but rather on empirical studies grounded in scientific reasoning. Scholars, attempting to add rationality to the discussion, use empirical data, namely indicators of globalization. Such empirical evidence would allow for a more objective assessment of the essence of the globalization process, its scope and impact on various social sectors. Quantitative assessment of globalization is a complex matter, since there is no generally accepted valuation methodology. Different quantitative indicators are used in the separate spheres of globalization: economic, cultural, social, and political. A need to measure the phenomenon of globalization as a whole, to establish an integrated set of indicators, presents itself. Attempts to assess the extent of globalization with one complex set of indicators are a new phenomenon, which has not been studied sufficiently. Attempting to measure and assess a country's level of globalization, researchers use different sets of indicators and different methodologies. The extent of globalization in a state very often depends on the assessment methodology. The two most widely known and most frequently analyzed globalization indices, which bring together indicator groups of different areas of globalization - economic, political, social and cultural, are the Kearney globalization index and the Dreher (KOF) globalization index. Kearney was the first to attempt to combine aspects such as personal contacts, technological and political integration together with measurements of economic globalization. The compilers of the index look for correlations between the globalization level of a state and economic, social, political and other characteristics of the country, but do not address the question of positive or negative effects of globalization. Dreher improved Kearney's index-creation methodology, expanding the number of indicators. Despite the fact that Kearney and KOF globalization indices are calculated by assessing the same - economic, political and social - aspects, the selection of different number of indicators, the different relative weight of the indicators, and different calculation methods lead to different results. The advantage of the KOF index is the ability to assess the impact of globalization on a country's development. In the Baltic countries, the globalization processes are intense, but their volume and tendencies, the influence of globalization on the economic, social and cultural development of the countries, and which quantitative assessment methods can be applied to measure the level of globalization are not known. The analysis, evaluation, and application of research and methodologies developed by foreign scholars would allow for an assessment of the volume and perspectives of globalization in the Baltic countries. The aim of the article: to assess the level of globalization and the tendencies of its changes in the Baltic countries using the methodology of the KOF globalization index. The creation methodology and collected data of the KOF index enable one to investigate and compare the overall level of globalization and the dynamics of the globalization level in individual sectors of the Baltic countries and to assess the level of globalization in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, in the context of all the countries in the world. The collection and processing of data needed to calculate the index takes a long time, so the globalization indices of separate countries of the world published by the compilers of the KOF index reflect three-year-old globalization levels. To assess the level of globalization in the Baltic countries in recent years, it is appropriate to examine the correlation between the globalization processes in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia and the socio-economic indicators of the countries. Using data from previous periods of the KOF globalization index, having determined the correlations between the processes of globalization and different economic-social indicators, and with the help of regression techniques, the future trends in the globalization level of Baltic countries can be foreseen.","[Pekarskiene, Irena; Susniene, Rozita] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Pekarskiene, I (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",irena.pekarskiene@ktu.lt; rozita.susniene@gmail.com,,,,,,,55,10,11,1,17,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

However, BOT contracts have received little attention from economists. The apparent agency problem in BOT projects has never been analyzed. In this paper, we develop a model to examine the incentives, efficiency and regulation in ROT contracts. We show that a BOT contract with a price regulation during the concession period and a license extension after the concession period is capable of achieving full efficiency. Both license extension and price control are observed in many real-world BOT projects. We also investigate the efficiency in such contracts by considering other factors, including time consistency, price ceiling, foreign ownership, and the lack of price regulation.

The cross-section SUR (seemingly unrelated regressions) estimation indicates that wage in origin regions had a significant influence on internal migration flows, but unemployment rates in origin and destination regions have apparently played no part. When time is accounted for, results show that wages in destination regions become very significant and migration is explained by pull rather than push effects.","[Silaghi, Monica Ioana Pop] Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Ghatak, Subrata] Kingston Univ, London, England",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; Kingston University,"Silaghi, MIP (通讯作者)，Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania.",monica.pop@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"Silaghi, Monica/ABA-2513-2020; Silaghi, Monica/F-9320-2016","Silaghi, Monica/0000-0001-8287-9829",,,,,33,5,5,2,14,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

We correct a key result of DeMarzo, Vayanos and Zwiebel (QJE, 2003) who claim that after some time, an agent's position on a set of different issues will always be either left on all of those issues or right on all of those issues. We provide counterexamples to this claim and show that in the long-run an agent's position can flip-flop between left on all issues and right on all issues indefinitely. However, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a stable left-right characterization of opinions to be possible in the long run. Roughly, a flip-flop will occur when agents give relatively little weight to the opinions of agents with similar political positions (including themselves). Following this intuition, we show that a simple sufficient condition is that agents become stubborn over time and give little weight to the opinions of others. Finally, we characterize classes of networks in which it is possible for agents to flip-flop between left and right indefinitely. We argue that qualitatively, these results are robust to alternative models of opinion formation.","Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Taubinsky, D (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",taubinsk@fas.harvard.edu,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6124,1935-1704,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

J,"Teal, F",,,,"Teal, Francis",,,Higher Education and Economic Development in Africa: A Review of Channels and Interactions,JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES,,,English,Review,,,,,,,SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; RETURN; RATES; INVESTMENT,"While the numbers with completed tertiary level education are low in Africa, both relative to other countries and in absolute terms, they have been growing very rapidly. Three questions are addressed in this paper. The first is how higher education links to other forms of capital accumulation in a process that leads to economic growth. The second is how higher education links to job outcomes, in particular the role of the public sector and self-employment as outcomes for graduates. The third is whether and how an expansion of skilled jobs can create its own demand. The paper draws on both macro and micro evidence to answer those questions which are placed in a long-run historical context. It is argued that growth has been more closely linked to investment in physical capital than in education and this may well reflect the fact that education is most valuable when it is linked to technology which requires higher skills. Data from thirty-two African countries are used to show that the returns to education, measured both by macro production functions and by micro earning functions, are highest for those with higher levels of education. A contrast is drawn between the role of higher education in providing access to public sector employment and the increasing importance of self-employment in Africa. The paper concludes by asking whether Africa can use its investment in higher skilled labour to effect a service-based growth revolution.","Univ Oxford, Ctr Study African Econ, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Teal, F (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Ctr Study African Econ, Oxford, England.",francis.teal@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,38,13,13,1,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The results show that data in the pre-Volcker periods strongly prefer an AMPF regime, even with a prior centered in the PMAF region. The estimation, however, is not very informative about whether the Federal Reserve's reaction to inflation is greater than one in the pre-Volcker period, because much lower values can still preserve determinacy under passive fiscal policy. In addition, whether a PMAF regime can generate consumption growth following a government spending increase depends on the degree of price stickiness. An income tax cut can yield an unusual negative labor response if monetary policy aggressively stabilizes output growth. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Empirical results suggest a significant structural change in inflation persistence. Employing a counterfactual simulation method, we show that the structural change is primarily attributed to better conduct of monetary policy and the resultant better anchored inflation expectations. This finding implies that the quiescence of inflation in China over the past decade could well be followed by a return to a high inflation era in the absence of a determined effort by the monetary authorities in managing inflation expectations. Therefore, the use of a preemptive monetary policy to anchor inflationary expectations and to keep inflation moderate is warranted in China. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This usually involves transferring resources to the poor. There exists a widespread view that European countries are much more generous to the poor than the United States. We study whether this is really the case. First, we argue that using data on aggregate spending does not allow us to conclude who the final recipients of social expenditure are. We then analyze microeconomic evidence from the Current Population Survey and the European Community Household Panel and find mixed results. In particular, when the concept of relative poverty is used, we find that every individual below the poverty line receives an average transfer in the United States that is 45% higher than in the European Union.

J,"Eriksen, MD; Rosenthal, SS",,,,"Eriksen, Michael D.; Rosenthal, Stuart S.",,,Crowd out effects of place-based subsidized rental housing: New evidence from the LIHTC program,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Crowd out; Subsidized housing; LIHTC,UNITED-STATES; TAX; FUTURE; MARKET; INCREASE,"Since its inception in 1987, the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program has ballooned into the largest ever source of subsidized construction of low-income housing in the United States, accounting for one-third of all recent multi-family rental construction. This paper examines the crowd out effects of this increasingly important source of low-moderate income housing. To do so, we analyze the impact of LIHTC construction at three different levels of geography, MSA, county, and 10-mile radius circles. This allows us to employ increasingly extensive geographic fixed effects that help to difference away unobserved factors. Political variables are also used as instruments to further facilitate identification. In all of our models, IV estimates yield substantially greater crowd out than OLS, confirming the endogenous attraction of LIHTC development to areas ripe for new construction. Our most robust IV estimates indicate that nearly 100% of LIHTC development is offset by a reduction in the number of newly built unsubsidized rental units, although the confidence band around this point estimate allows for less dramatic assessments. Additional estimates suggest that LIHTC development has a much more moderate impact on construction of owner-occupied housing, but these estimates are imprecise. Overall, while LIHTC development may well affect the location of low-moderate income rental housing opportunities, our estimates suggest that the impact of the program on the number of newly developed rental housing units appears to be small.

This paper makes the case for macroeconomic logistics measurement, presents the results of the country's national logistics cost model and proposes the first key macroeconomic logistics indicators for South Africa. The research shows that South Africa's logistics costs are higher than the global average. The majority of these costs are attributable to road transport, of which the biggest cost driver is fuel, which in turn is determined by volatile oil prices. This poses a significant exogenous risk to logistics cost management in South Africa. The risk can be mitigated through a structural adjustment in long-distance freight transport (from road dominated to rail dominated). The paper concludes by proposing two key macroeconomic logistics indicators to facilitate this process.","Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Logist, Ctr Supply Chain Management, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Havenga, J (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Logist, Ctr Supply Chain Management, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa.",janh@sun.ac.za,,"Havenga, Jan/0000-0003-2844-719X",,,,,48,34,41,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

A three-variable structural vector autoregression model is used to identify three types of shocks: global, regional and domestic shocks. The empirical results show that in the post-crisis period the importance of asymmetric domestic shocks has declined sharply, whereas that of symmetric global and regional shocks has increased. Furthermore, although a 'prevalent shock' cannot be uniquely defined, most East Asian economies respond to global and regional shocks in a symmetric way. Although the findings do not provide strong support for forming a common currency area in this region at the current stage, they suggest that most East Asian economies have become relatively symmetric in terms of economic shocks and adjustments, implying that a common currency area might become viable through deepening regional integration.","Osaka Univ, Osaka Sch Int Publ Policy, Osaka 5600043, Japan",Osaka University,"Hsu, HF (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Osaka Sch Int Publ Policy, 1-31 Machikaneyama, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",h-hsu@osipp.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,16,7,9,0,7,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1351-3958,,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

An asset is considered liquid if it can be traded quickly, in large quantities at low cost with little impact on market price. Trade-off between asking price and sale intensity, is one of the most common characteristics of assets. The new measure, liquidity delta, empirically captures this trade-off We estimate liquidity delta for sixty major stocks listed on the Korea Stock Exchange. We demonstrate that liquidity delta is a useful measure of liquidity, with liquidity level and its variability showing negative and positive relation, respectively, with the asset's rate of return. The negative relationship shows premium for lack of liquidity whereas the positive one shows premium for liquidity risk.","[Ryu, Keunkwan] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 151, South Korea; [Shin, Hyun-Yeol] Bank Korea, Res Dept, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Bank of Korea,"Ryu, K (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 151, South Korea.",ryu@snu.ac.kr; hyshin68@bok.or.kr,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,7,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

Kruskall-Wallis tests indicate that mean efficiency scores are statistically different among the three types of banks, providing empirical support to the theoretical prediction that different organizations represent different incentive structures. Moreover, co-operatives banks appear more efficient than stock banks. These results are robust also after controlling for the size of banks and the quality of their credit policies in a second-stage analysis.

In addition, the benefits of political connections are largely confined to firms associated with local or top level governments, and they are more pronounced in capital-intensive industries.

J,"Pouliakas, K",,,,"Pouliakas, Konstantinos",,,"Pay Enough, Don't Pay Too Much or Don't Pay at All? The Impact of Bonus Intensity on Job Satisfaction",KYKLOS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PERFORMANCE-PAY; INTRINSIC MOTIVATION; INCENTIVE CONTRACTS; EARNINGS; INCOME; TIME,"This paper attempts to examine the effect of the intensity of financial incentives (i.e. the proportion of workers' salary that is tied to bonuses) on job satisfaction. Understanding the influence of monetary incentives on job satisfaction is important given that the composition of an employee's remuneration package is an integral element of his/her overall working conditions. According to the standard microeconomic paradigm, in long-run equilibrium one would not expect to observe any differences in the marginal utilities of comparable workers under fixed or variable payment schemes. This should hold since the expected value of the higher wages paid under performance-related pay (PRP) should be just sufficient to compensate for the additional earnings risk and the disutility of extra effort. However, once the standard assumptions of the agency model are relaxed, and psychological arguments such as those of motivation crowding out theory (Frey and Jegen, 2001) are taken into account, it is expected that PRP is likely to have a non-negligible impact on job satisfaction. To the extent that incentive schemes allow for optimization of effort, facilitate worker autonomy and enhance self-determination they should increase job satisfaction, other things equal. Yet increasing earnings risk, crowding out of the inherent pleasantness in performing one's job and lower morale can lead to disgruntled employees. Based on the above reasoning, a number of previous studies have focussed on the impact of the incidence of PRP on job satisfaction (Drago et al., 1992; McCausland et al., 2005; Heywood and Wei, 2006; Green and Heywood, 2008; Artz, 2008; Pouliakas and Theodossiou, 2009). This masks the possibility that the utility of workers may vary according to the magnitude and intensity of incentives, as suggested by the experiments of Gneezy and Rustichini (2000[a][b]) and Pokorny (2008). An important common element of the above experiments is that small incentives are likely to exert a negative effect on behaviour (with discontinuity close to zero), while for high powered rewards (or punishments) the standard price effect is expected to prevail. This paper attempts to test these contrasting hypotheses by looking beyond the mere incidence of incentive pay and examining the impact of the intensity of incentives on job satisfaction instead. Specifically, 10 waves (1998-2007) of the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) are used to investigate the ceteris paribus association between the intensity of bonus/profit-sharing payments, the dynamic change in bonus status and the utility derived from work. After controlling for individual heterogeneity biases, it is shown that job utility rises only in response to 'generous' bonus payments, primarily in skilled, non-unionized, private sector jobs. Evidence is also presented that revoking a bonus from one year to the next is likely to have a detrimental impact on employee utility, and that over time job satisfaction tends to diminish as employees potentially adapt to the payment of bonuses (Georgellis and Tabvuma, 2010). The findings of the paper are therefore consistent with previous experimental evidence, suggesting that employers wishing to motivate their staff should indeed pay enough or don't pay at all.","Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, CELMR, Edward Wright Bldg,Dunbar St, Old Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland",University of Aberdeen,"Pouliakas, K (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, CELMR, Edward Wright Bldg,Dunbar St, Old Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland.",k.pouliakas@abdn.ac.uk,"Bonilla Rivera, Jonathan/E-8087-2011",,,,,,65,19,31,12,165,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,NOV 10,2010,63.0,4,,,,,597,626,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2010.00490.x,0.0,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,665XS,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000283071600010,0

Lovell, and Schmidt (1977). We develop modifications in the endogenous growth model to allow for learning as well as spatial spillovers by relating productivity growth to cumulative productive experience (the 'learning curve') and to worker experience as it is transferred and utilized across different geographical regions. We also consider the relative impact of both proximal and distant simultaneous production on productivity growth. We then utilize a framework in which the efficiency component of productivity growth is explicitly considered using a stochastic frontier model wherein contributions to productivity growth introduced in the endogenous growth model are formally modeled as determinants of efficiency change. The statistical treatments can either be considered as special cases of or as motivated by the random coefficients models introduced by Swamy (1970. 1971, 1974). We thus offer a linkage between the neoclassical growth literature and the literature that explicitly recognizes that technical innovations as well as efficiency are the major drivers of productivity growth.

A Guatemalan microfinance lender gradually started using a credit bureau across its branches without letting borrowers know about it. One year later, we ran a large randomized credit information course that described the existence and workings of the bureau to the clients of this lender. This pairing of natural and randomized experiments allows us to separately identify how new information enters on the supply and the demand sides of the market. Our results indicate that the credit bureau generated large efficiency gains for the lender, and that these gains were augmented when borrowers understood the rules of the game. The credit bureau rewarded good borrowers but penalized weaker ones, increasing economic differentiation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

First, it extends investor herding studies to an emerging yet relatively sophisticated Taiwanese stock market at the sector level by using firm level data. Second. it employs different methodologies designed to test the existence of investor herds to better understand the sources of herd behavior. Third, it discusses the implications of different herding measures for investors exposed to systematic and unsystematic risks. We find that the linear model based on the cross-sectional standard deviation (CSSD) testing methodology yields no significant evidence of herding. However, the non-linear model proposed by Changed al. (2000) and the state space based models of Hwang and Salmon (2004) lead to consistent results indicating strong evidence of herd formation in all sectors. We also find that the herding effect is more prominent during periods of market losses. Our results suggest limited diversification opportunities for investors in this market, especially during periods of market losses when diversification is most needed. Further research is necessary to see whether similar findings hold for other emerging markets.

Parties are office-motivated. They care about winning and about the share of seats obtained. I examine two different scenarios of how parties in government share the spoils of office: equally or proportionally to their share of seats. If the government is formed by a single party and parties expect that each party will obtain the same share of votes in the next election, the electoral rule will never be changed. Therefore, for a change to occur, the government should be formed by a coalition. I find that a change is more likely to occur when there is a larger number of parties and also when the spoils of office are shared equally among the members in the governing coalition.

Recent literature on this is reviewed. It is argued in the paper that the key to long-term development is the shift from inward (import substitution) to outward (export-oriented) growth. This shift involves both tariff reduction and significant investment in infrastructure and human capital accumulation. Given that much of Latin America (historically) and Sub-Saharan Africa (currently) has depended or depends on trade taxes for revenue, an outward orientation poses a significant fiscal problem, which makes it extremely difficult to switch to an export-oriented growth path. East Asian experience points to the importance of broad-based agricultural growth in making the fiscal transition.","So Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University,"Grabowski, R (通讯作者)，So Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.",,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0818-9935,,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

Empirical studies do not generate conclusive results either. This paper investigates empirically the impacts of foreign patent reforms on innovation in the US, using data on successful patent applications in the US over 33 years and major IPR reforms in 21 countries, in addition to the patent reforms in the US and the TRIPS Agreement of the WTO. We find that the TRIPS Agreement has had significant impacts on innovation in the US, which highlights the importance of international cooperation in patent protection. However, the effects of strengthening patent protection by individual countries are not statistically significant. This result seems to imply that the US market is already sufficiently large/profitable to provide innovation incentives in the US and therefore further strengthening foreign patent protection simply increases the US innovators' rent, but not their innovation.","[Qiu, Larry D.] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Econ & Finance, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yu, Huayang] Tsinghua Univ, Ctr China World Econ, SEM, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong; Tsinghua University,"Qiu, LD (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Sch Econ & Finance, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",larryqiu@hku.hk,,,,,,,26,13,15,1,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We analyse how the chances of success of 150,000 female and male candidates for positions in the four main Corps of the Spanish Judiciary from 1987 to 2007 were affected by the gender composition of their evaluation committee. We find that a female (male) candidate is significantly less likely to be hired whenever she (he) is randomly assigned to a committee where the share of female (male) evaluators is relatively greater.

However, these methods either only work for specific models of wage determination, or else require that we know the initial distribution of productivity for workers in our sample. In this paper we show it is possible to estimate mobility rates without having to restrict attention to models in which wages are constant over the course of a job or to assume that the initial distribution of productivity is known. More generally, the approach we propose allows us to freely estimate one degree of unobserved heterogeneity, be it in initial conditions or mobility rates. Applying our results to data from the NLSY suggests that the theoretical restrictions on the initial distribution of productivity implied by the standard model can overstate the extent of frictions to upward mobility.

Alternative measures of the male employment rate are considered before settling on two complementary measures: the full-time employment rate and the full-time equivalent employment rate. The latter measure weights part-time jobs according to the fraction of a full-time job they represent. Models of the determinants of these two employment rates are estimated using data from the Censuses conducted between 1971 and 2001. We construct a pseudo panel by 'stacking' the seven Census data sets (Deaton, 1997; Kapteyn, et al., 2005). This facilitates the tracing of birth cohorts over time, in turn making it possible to control for cohort unobserved heterogeneity that may bias cross-sectional estimates of effects of other characteristics, in particular age and year/time period. We produce evidence that a number of factors have contributed to the decline in male employment, including the decline in couple households with dependent children, growth in income taxes and welfare replacement rates and changes in the structure of labour demand away from traditionally male-dominated industries. We also find that, all else (observable) constant, more recent birth cohorts have no lower - and possibly higher - employment rates than earlier birth cohorts.","[Wilkins, Roger] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Wilkins, R (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",r.wilkins@unimelb.edu.au,"; Tseng, Yi-Ping/D-7062-2016","Wilkins, Roger/0000-0002-8548-757X; Tseng, Yi-Ping/0000-0001-6917-893X",,,,,21,2,2,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0004-900X,,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

In order to take into account these two important issues, this study utilizes the generalized Markov switching GARCH model to explore house price dynamics and conditional distribution for US market over 1975Q1-2007Q4. The housing return follows two distinct dynamics: the bust regime and the boom regime. The volatility pattern is different in the bust and boom regimes. In addition, the conditional densities derived by the regime-switching model change dramatically over time and are significantly different from normal distribution. More importantly, the regime-switching model can detect in advance a weak US housing market such as the one that occurred in the middle of 2007. The in-sample fitting ability of regime-switching model, which incorporates higher-order moments, has significant improvements compared to the single-regime AR and AR-GARCH models. For the out-of-sample Value-at-Risk forecasting performance, the ability of regime-switching AR-GARCH model to forecast one-step-ahead density is better compared to the single-regime AR-GARCH model.

It describes the role of the AEA in the market and focuses in particular on two mechanisms adopted in recent years at the suggestion of our Committee. First, job market applicants now have a signaling service to send an expression of special interest to up to two employers prior to interviews at the January Allied Social Science Associations (ASSA) meetings. Second, the AEA now invites candidates who are still on the market, and employers whose positions are still vacant, to participate in a web-based scramble to reduce search costs and thicken the late part of the job market. We present statistics on the activity in these market mechanisms and present survey evidence that both mechanisms have facilitated matches.

Moreover, within a given firm, those sites located in concentrated insurance markets experience the greatest premium increases.

We distinguish between economies with rational and hyperbolic consumers and compare the consequences of voluntary and mandatory retirement plans. Three major findings are derived in our study: first, we quantify the commitment effect of social security for myopic individuals by roughly 1% of aggregate resources. It is possible to recapture this commitment technology in IRAs, if those are annuitized. Second, despite the fact that our consumers have an operative bequest motive, the welfare gain from the (implicit) longevity insurance of the pension system is significant and amounts to roughly 0.5% of aggregate resources. However, mandatory annuitization reduces unintended bequests so that future generations are significantly hurt. Finally, our results highlight the importance of liquidity effects for social security analysis. These efficiency gains are only attainable if accounts are voluntary and not mandatory.

The analysis shows that biochemical (BC) technological changes account for a significant part of China's agricultural production growth. This result is consistent with the fact that China's factor endowments are characterized by abundant farm labor relative to scarce arable land. Besides, in accordance with the standard theory of market failure, the benefits accruing to BC technological development are not privately appropriable. Thus, it can be hypothesized that the inter-regional difference in BC. technological attainment must be closely associated with public spending in agricultural R&E activities at a local level. The random effects model reveals that the BC technological level is high in provinces where the public sectors are seriously committed to R&E activities. In addition, the analysis lends strong support to the validity of the induced innovation hypothesis with respect to M technological progress. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The results show that only 31.6 percent of the 279 respondents giving estimable answers decided in harmony with the preference order expressed at an earlier phase of the study when they faced the tempting decision situation mentioned above.","Univ Szeged, Inst Appl Hlth Sci & Hlth Promot, H-6725 Szeged, Hungary",Szeged University,"Lippai, L (通讯作者)，Univ Szeged, Inst Appl Hlth Sci & Hlth Promot, Boldogasszony Sgt 6, H-6725 Szeged, Hungary.",lippail@jgypk.u-szeged.hu,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,11,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

This approach is a tool for constructing supermodular mechanisms, i.e., mechanisms that induce games with strategic complementarities. In quasilinear environments, I prove that if a social choice function can be implemented by a mechanism that generates bounded strategic substitutes-as opposed to strategic complementarities-then this mechanism can be converted into a supermodular mechanism that implements the social choice function. If the social choice function also satisfies some efficiency criterion, then it admits a supermodular mechanism that balances the budget. Building on these results, I address the multiple equilibrium problem. I provide sufficient conditions for a social choice function to be implementable with a supermodular mechanism whose equilibria are contained in the smallest interval among all supermodular mechanisms. This is followed by conditions for supermodular implementability in unique equilibrium.

For this model a generalization of pairwise stability, chain stability, can always be satisfied as long as agents' preferences satisfy same side substitutability and cross side complementarity. Given this preference domain I analyze the interplay between properties of the network structure and (cooperative) solution concepts. The main structural condition is an acyclicity notion that rules out the implementation of trading cycles. It is shown that this condition and the restriction that no pair of agents can sign more than one contract with each other are jointly necessary and sufficient for (i) the equivalence of group and chain stability, (ii) the core stability of chain stable networks, (iii) the efficiency of chain stable networks, (iv) the existence of a group stable network, and (v) the existence of an efficient and individually stable network. These equivalences also provide a rationale for chain stability in the unrestricted model. The (more restrictive) conditions under which chain stability coincides with the core are also characterized. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The logic of the theorems supports the conclusion that in competitive economies prices, the allocation of commodities, and the distribution of income and material welfare are determined by the preferences, technology, and endowments of the agents. In real-world markets, however, agents can discover equilibrium prices only by making mutually advantageous transactions at disequilibrium prices. Any sequence of such transactions leads stably to an exchange equilibrium at which the offer prices oral! agents are close to each other, and which exhausts all private opportunities to realize economic surpluses. The exchange equilibrium set, however, is in general a continuum, and the exact equilibrium reached depends on the path of transactions. In general, exchange equilibria do not treat agents with the same preferences and endowments equally, and the exchange equilibrium allocation of commodities does not conserve the values of individual agent endowments. Existence and stability of exchange equilibrium are transparent consequences of the logic of voluntary exchange, but because of transaction path dependence, equilibrium prices, allocations of commodities, and the distribution of wealth and economic welfare are not determined by agents' preferences and endowments.

The proposed hypothesis states that tourist price sensitivity is moderated, at the moment of choosing a destination, by cultural interest. For this purpose, we measure and identify tourists' price sensitivities-individual by individual-from real choices, i.e., tourist price sensitivity is estimated for each individual by observing the destination she actually selects. The empirical application is carried out on a sample of 2,127 individuals, and the operative formalization used to estimate individual price sensitivities follows a Random-Coefficient Logit Model; and to detect the way these sensitivities relate to the search for culture, an ANOVA procedure is employed. The results show an incremental effect of cultural interest on tourist price insensitivity; i.e., people looking for culture find their price sensitivity moderated by this interest in such a way that the negative effect of price diminishes. Also, we further explore these culture-interested tourists by a segmentation analysis, identifying five segments with different price sensitivities-one of them even showing certain high-price proneness.","Univ Alicante, Fac Econ, Dept Financial Econ Accounting & Mkt, E-03080 Alicante, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant,"Nicolau, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Alicante, Fac Econ, Dept Financial Econ Accounting & Mkt, Ap 99, E-03080 Alicante, Spain.",JL.Nicolau@ua.es,"Nicolau, Juan Luis/AAZ-6589-2021; Nicolau, Juan Luis/I-4982-2016","Nicolau, Juan Luis/0000-0003-0048-2823",,,,,47,11,12,1,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,,,J CULT ECON,J.

This allows us to characterize speculation by institutional investors who receive private long-lived information on a recurring basis, and trade strategically. When the underlying asset value process has a stationary autoregressive structure, we develop a contraction mapping argument to solve for the stationary linear equilibrium. We derive analytically and numerically how the characteristics of private information-its quantity, persistence and correlation, and division among speculators-affect trading profits, pricing and trading strategies. Our central finding is that what matters for equilibrium outcomes are the most recent signals that speculators receive. Speculators trade so much more aggressively on new information than old that the bulk of their profits come from their two or three most recent private signals. Trading on past prices drops off faster yet; effectively only the most recent price matters.","[Bernhardt, Dan; Taub, B.] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Seiler, P.] Honeywell Corp, Morristown, NJ USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Honeywell,"Bernhardt, D (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",danber@illinois.edu,"Taub, Bart/A-9626-2014","Taub, Bart/0000-0003-1223-1386; Seiler, Peter/0000-0003-3423-1109",,,,,34,13,15,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

In this paper, we revisit this issue within the context of a pure-exchange, overlapping generations model in which spatial separation and random relocation create an endogenous demand for money. We study AR(1) shocks to both real output and the real interest rate. Irrespective of the nature of the shocks, the optimal inflation target is always positive. Under monetary targeting, shocks to output necessitate negative money growth rates; for shocks to real interest rates, money growth rates may be either positive or negative depending on the elasticity of consumption substitution. Also, for output shocks, monetary targeting welfare-dominates inflation targeting but the gap between the two vanishes as the shock process approaches a random walk. In sharp contrast, for shocks to the real interest rate, we prove that monetary targeting and inflation targeting are welfare-equivalent only in the limit as the shocks become i.i.d. The upshot is that persistence of the underlying fundamental uncertainty matters: depending on the nature of the shock, policy responses need to be either more or less aggressive as persistence increases.

Perceived entitlements are sensitive to how hard an agent has worked relative to her rival, and agents are loss averse around their meritocratically determined endogenous reference points. In a fair tournament sufficiently large desert concerns drive identical agents to push their effort levels apart in order to end up closer to their reference points on average. In an unfair tournament, where one agent is advantaged, the equilibrium is symmetric in the absence of desert, but asymmetric in the presence of desert. We find that desert concerns can undermine the standard conclusion that competition for a fixed supply of status is socially wasteful and explain why, when the distribution of output noise is fat-tailed, an employer might use a rank-order incentive scheme.

Consistent with the conventional wisdom, countercyclical taxes generally reduce aggregate volatility, unless the fiscal response to debt accumulation is weak. The presence of monopoly power enhances these effects. Even when automatic stabilizers successfully stabilize business cycle fluctuations, countercyclical taxes are welfare inferior, due to reduced precautionary saving motives. While, if the fiscal response to debt is weak and countercyclical tax policy destabilizing, the increased precautionary saving motive is not welfare enhancing as the asset accumulated is government debt rather than capital. These results are generally robust. Nominal inertia may, however, dominate the precautionary saving mechanism. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The paper shows that price index numbers from commonly used methods like the Ikle, the Rao-weighted, and an additive multilateral system are all estimators of the parameters of the country-product-dummy (CPD) model. The advantage of the stochastic approach is that we can derive standard errors for the estimates of the purchasing power parities (PPPs). The PPPs and the parameters of the stochastic model are estimated using a weighted maximum likelihood procedure under different stochastic specifications for the disturbance term. Estimates of PPPs and their standard errors for OECD countries using the proposed methods are presented. The paper also outlines a method of moments approach to the estimation of PPPs under the stochastic approach. The paper shows how the Geary-Khamis system of multilateral index numbers is a method of moments estimator of the parameters of the CPD model. The paper therefore provides a coherent stochastic framework for the Geary-Khamis system and derives standard errors of the Geary-Khamis PPPs.","[Rao, D. S.

J,"Lipsey, RE",,,,"Lipsey, Robert E.",,,"MEASURING THE LOCATION OF PRODUCTION IN A WORLD OF INTANGIBLE PRODUCTIVE ASSETS, FDI, AND INTRAFIRM TRADE",REVIEW OF INCOME AND WEALTH,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"As production comes to depend more on intangible productive assets, the location of production by multinational firms becomes increasingly ambiguous. The reason is that, within the firm, these assets have no clear geographical location, but only a nominal location determined by the firm's tax or legal strategies. The effects of these location ambiguities, and the resulting distortions for tax reasons of the location of production, are described. It is estimated that for U.S. firms' affiliates in a few tax havens alone, the exaggeration of value added in those locations amounted, in 2005, to about 4 percent of worldwide affiliate sales, and the exaggeration of sales to about 10 percent of worldwide affiliate sales. Some possibilities for estimating the location of production that could supersede the present dependence on accounting measures distorted by tax-saving policies are described.","[Lipsey, Robert E.] CUNY, Natl Bur Econ Res, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Lipsey, Robert E.] CUNY, Queens Coll, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Lipsey, Robert E.] CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA",National Bureau of Economic Research; City University of New York (CUNY) System; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Queens College NY (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Lipsey, RE (通讯作者)，CUNY, Natl Bur Econ Res, 365 5th Ave,5th Floor,Suite 5318, New York, NY 10016 USA.",rlipsey@gc.cuny.edu,,,,,,,21,27,29,0,11,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

First, it considers a framework in which large shareholders can choose not only when to monitor, but also how intensively they want to monitor the firm. Second, it considers the impact of laws and regulations by introducing a governance quality parameter that makes monitoring more cost effective. The model yields a new and rich characterization of activism. We find that share wealth (ownership concentration) induces monitoring for higher firm value through more frequent monitoring with unchanged intensity. Cash wealth motivates activism for trading gains, not higher firm value, through less frequent monitoring coupled with higher intensity. We also find that better governance leads to higher firm value through more frequent but less intense activism. When asymmetries within the group of large shareholders exist, the model predicts that the larger/wealthier/more efficient shareholders are more active. These results are broadly consistent with the empirical evidence.","[Oded, Jacob] Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Management, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Oded, Jacob] Boston Univ, Sch Management, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Wang, Yu] Freddie Mac, Financial Res & Engn, Investment & Capital Markets, Mclean, VA USA",Tel Aviv University; Boston University; Freddie Mac,"Oded, J (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Management, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",oded@post.tau.ac.il; yu_wang@freddiemac.com,"Shingade, Sudam Shrikrushna/D-5452-2019",,,,,,27,5,6,0,13,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

The components or building blocks are organized into diversity, innovation, selection, bounded rationality, diffusion, path dependency and lock-in, coevolution, multilevel and group selection, and mechanisms of growth. The number of alternatives that has been proposed for each category is vast, making it difficult to comprehend the variety of assumptions and formalizations underlying existing evolutionary-economic models. Our survey aims to clarify for each model component the choice range, formal expressions, associated assumptions, and possible techniques for formalization. Our study is unique in that it provides more information about the formal details of specific model components and is considerably more inclusive than earlier reviews.","[Safarzynska, Karolina; van den Bergh, Jeroen C.

Here we show that any significant time variation in the mean renders the sample correlogram (and related spectral estimates) inconsistent. In particular, smooth time variation in the mean-i.e., even a weak trend, either stochastic or deterministic-induces apparent long memory. This apparent long memory can be eliminated by either high-pass filtering or by detrending. Here we demonstrate the effectiveness in this regard of nonlinear detrending via penalized-spline nonparametric regression. A time-varying mean can be of economic interest in its own right. This suggests that isolating out and separately examining both a local mean (i.e., a nonlinear trend or the realization of a stochastic trend) and deviations from it is preferable as a modeling strategy to simply estimating a fractionally integrated model. We illustrate the superiority of This strategy using stock return volatility data.","[Ashley, Richard A.] Virginia Tech, Econ Dept 0316, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Ashley, RA (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Econ Dept 0316, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",ashleyr@vt.edu,,"Patterson, Douglas/0000-0001-5829-082X",,,,,30,10,11,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We find that the incentives to use acquisition rather than greenfield investment change significantly if the multinational is allowed to have already an ownership interest in the target local firm before the market is fully liberalized. Interestingly, when investment costs are sufficiently high, the multinational prefers not entering the market at all with partial ownership in place, whereas a cross-border takeover would be the optimal entry mode otherwise. For intermediate levels of entry costs, holding a stake in the local producer reverses positively the profitability of a full acquisition compared to greenfield investment.","[Fatica, Serena] Univ Leuven, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium; [Fatica, Serena] Commiss European Communities, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Fatica, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leuven, SPA3 6-018, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium.",sfatica@gmail.com,,"fatica, serena/0000-0002-9990-4354",,,,,16,13,15,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

The results are ambiguous in general and sensitive to the type of transfer motive involved. We find that in the purely intended bequest case, an estate tax increases the steady-state inequality of net lifetime income in the case where people's elasticity of intertemporal substitution is greater than one. However, in the purely unintended bequest case, the effect of an estate tax on inequality is dependent on the probability of survival. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper assesses total energy demand, which is composed of traditional energy (wood fuel) and commercial energy (electricity and petroleum), in the Central, East, South, and West regions of Sub-Saharan Africa. Cross-sectional time series data for 20 countries in 25 years are analyzed, and the results of the study show that wood fuel accounts for 70% of energy consumption, followed by petroleum, with most industrial activities utilizing some form of wood fuel. Regression results suggest that energy demand is inversely related to the price of petroleum and industrial development, but positively related to GDP, population growth rate, and agricultural expansion, and that price elasticity is less than one. The model results also show that there are regional differences in energy demand. In addition, the interaction of population growth rates by regions generates mixed results, and there are regional differences in the use of commercial energy consumption, and GDP growth. The findings of this study suggest that countries must diversify their energy sources and introduce energy-efficient devices and equipment at all levels of the economy to improve GDP growth rate and GDP per capita.

This is due to the high dependence of cultural institutions on public funding on the one hand and the increasing cost-pressure on public budgets on the other hand. In order to achieve an efficient, cost-minimizing resource allocation public authorities who decide on the distribution of public budgets need reliable performance indicators. Against this background, this paper analyzes the efficiency of German public theaters for the seasons 1991/1992-2005/2006. Using a stochastic frontier analysis approach, we test whether the assumption of cost-minimizing behavior is reliable in this sector. Moreover, several panel data models that differ in their ability to account for unobserved heterogeneity are applied to evaluate the impact of unobserved heterogeneity on the efficiency estimates. The results indicate that the cost-minimizing assumption cannot be maintained. Consequently, an efficiency analysis based on a cost function approach seems inappropriate in the case of German public theaters. Further, we find a considerable unobserved heterogeneity across the theaters, which causes a significant variation in the models' efficiency estimates. This implies that failing to account for unobserved heterogeneity leads to biased efficiency values. Overall, our results suggest that there is still space for improvement in the employment of resources in the sector.","[Last, Anne-Kathrin] Leuphana Univ Lueneburg, Inst Econ, D-21314 Luneburg, Germany; [Wetzel, Heike] Univ Cologne, Inst Energy Econ, D-50923 Cologne, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg; University of Cologne,"Last, AK (通讯作者)，Leuphana Univ Lueneburg, Inst Econ, POB 2440, D-21314 Luneburg, Germany.",last@uni.leuphana.de; heike.wetzel@uni-koeln.de,,"Wetzel, Heike/0000-0002-3945-6318",,,,,34,26,27,1,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,,,J CULT ECON,J.

Evidence from European labour markets,EMPIRICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,Risk perceptions; Health and safety hazards; Worker heterogeneity,COMPENSATING WAGE DIFFERENTIALS; ACCIDENT RISK; GENDER; BEHAVIOR,"Worker perceptions of job-related health risk are a little-studied dimension of heterogeneity in the labour market. According to information from the European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS), one out of three European workers considers that her health and safety is at risk because of work. Not surprisingly, risk perceptions are influenced by objective risk factors such as hazardous working conditions, onerous job characteristics and by the probability to be affected by occupational accidents and illnesses. This paper explores also the role played by personal characteristics and household structure for the explanation of risk perceptions. After controlling for job characteristics, workplace hazards, job satisfaction and health outcomes, I find that risk perceptions are strongly correlated with gender, age, and household structure. Lone parents as well as older and more experienced workers have a higher propensity than other categories to consider their health at risk because of work. The same seems to hold true for better educated workers, especially for those who have completed tertiary education. Further results suggest that the relationship between household structure and risk perception is stable across gender.","WIFO, Austrian Inst Econ Res, A-1103 Vienna, Austria",,"Leoni, T (通讯作者)，WIFO, Austrian Inst Econ Res, POB 91, A-1103 Vienna, Austria.",Thomas.Leoni@wifo.ac.at,"Leoni, Thomas/ABG-8725-2020","Leoni, Thomas/0000-0001-6300-5536",,,,,41,18,22,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2010,37.0,2,,,SI,,165,195,,10.1007/s10663-010-9129-0,0.0,,,31,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,V25OF,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000208486600004,0

The ground lost by girls relative to boys is roughly half as large as the black-white test score gap that appears over these same ages. We document the presence of this gender math gap across every strata of society. We explore a wide range of possible explanations in the data, including less investment by girls in math, low parental expectations, and biased tests, but find little support for these theories. Moving to cross-country comparisons, we find earlier results linking the gender gap in math to measures of gender equality are sensitive to the inclusion of Muslim countries, where, in spite of women's low status, there is little or no gender gap in math.

In particular, we examine the accuracy of the subjective probabilities of bettors concerning 16,344 horses in 1671 races. We find that bettors are skilled in adopting effective heuristics to simplify their dynamic information environment and, even in the face of restricted information, develop well-calibrated judgments using outcome feedback. A number of factors that help bettors to achieve good calibration are identified and the implications for market regulation are discussed.","[Johnson, Johnnie E.

Instrumental variables estimation shows outsourcing contributes to higher quasirents and industry productivity. We find the union wage premium increases with the extent of outsourcing-both for workers that are substitutable by outsourcing services and workers in jobs that are not substitutes of the tasks being outsourced.

To tackle these issues, the current paper modifies the spatial framework by allowing firms to exchange the cost-efficient production technology via royalties.

The best assets to acquire information about are ones the investor expects to hold. But the assets the investor holds depend on the information he observes. We build a framework to solve jointly for investment and information choices, with general preferences and information cost functions. Although the optimal research strategies depend on preferences and costs, the main result is that the investor who can first collect information systematically deviates from holding a diversified portfolio. Information acquisition can rationalize investing in a diversified fund and a concentrated set of assets, an allocation often observed, but usually deemed anomalous.","[Van Nieuwerburgh, Stijn; Veldkamp, Laura] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Van Nieuwerburgh, Stijn; Veldkamp, Laura] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",New York University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Van Nieuwerburgh, S (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,,,,,,,40,264,324,0,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Changes in inequality/poverty indices are decomposed into three contributions: changes in the tax-benefit structure, changes in nominal levels of market incomes and tax-benefit money parameters, and all other changes, including shifts in market income inequality and demographic composition. The policy effect can be evaluated conditionally on base-period data or end-period data; it is also possible to average the two measures, which corresponds to an application of the Shapley value method as reinterpreted by Shorrocks (Decomposition Procedures for Distributional Analysis: A Unified Framework Based on the Shapley Value, University of Essex and Institute for Fiscal Studies, Wivenhoe Park, 1999). The decomposition is used to quantify the relative role of policy changes on inequality/poverty trends in France and Ireland in the 1990s. When end-period data are not available, e.g., for forward looking analysis of possible reforms, the base weighted decomposition helps to extract an absolute measure of the impact of tax-benefit changes on income distribution as evaluated against a distributionally neutral benchmark; in our application, it is not significantly different from the policy effect stemming from the Shorrocks-Shapley decomposition. Estimates of this type are derived to assess recent policy changes in twelve European countries.","[Bargain, Olivier] UCD, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Callan, Tim] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin 2, Ireland",University College Dublin; Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"Bargain, O (通讯作者)，UCD, Newman Bldg, Dublin 4, Ireland.",olivier.bargain@ucd.ie; tim.callan@esri.ie,"Bargain, Olivier/A-5972-2019","Callan, Tim/0000-0002-3403-4191",,,,,39,53,53,2,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

Perplexingly, an apparent tragedy of the commons exists alongside extensive official management powers. In this paper, I argue that the complexity of governance structures may be inadvertently worsening the situation. Looking to recent work on contested property and the anticommons concept, I suggest that an anticommons amongst those officially controlling the lands is casting a long and unexpected shadow by encouraging the emergence of open-access de facto resource exploitation and discouraging de facto management. This extension of the anticommons concept implies that the effects of anticommons are not necessarily limited to under exploitation, as most commonly used in the developing anticommons literature. It points to a wider examination of the harmful effects of anticommons situations.","Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph,"Brinkhurst, M (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",,,,,,,,28,3,3,0,11,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Policy focused on addressing these growing disparities has had to face the possibility that spreading growth more evenly around the country will require a sacrifice of the national growth rate. Yet there is almost no empirical evidence that this is so and, if it is, how big the required sacrifice is. This paper contributes to filling this gap by analyzing the relationship between aggregate growth and the inequality of regional output distribution. We use a VAR model to simulate the effects over time on growth of a reduction in inequality and also the effects on inequality of an increase in growth. We find, first, that in the long run a more equal distribution can be obtained without a growth sacrifice. Second, in the short run a reduction in inequality reduces growth. Third, in the short and long runs an increase in growth actually reduces inequality. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

When the thermal plant and the hydro plant are managed by the same operator, the two plants are used in an efficient way to substitute low cost fuel for high cost fuel. The paper first analyzes the efficient use of the technology when the outputs at each period are given. We determine the frontier between the storage and no-storage solutions and its sensibility to cost variations. We then determine the optimal dispatch given the intertemporal preferences of electricity consumers.

It argues that the book navigates artfully between being a manifesto for diversity and rigorous science writing while at the same time marketing economic science in new ways. The review welcomes the book's popularization of richer aspects of everyday decision making, individual and collective, and its making an excellent case for the social significance of abstract economic theorizing, especially about problem solving. It praises the book's lively interpretations of statistical tools of decision making by means of enticing narratives. The book's rhetoric urges us to move beyond accepting diversity as a matter of taste, or even because of its beneficial effects on the production function,and ultimately adopts its powerful logic. It speculates that the book's true impact will likely come after thorough empirical research. In empirical endeavors, issues of definition, especially of identity and of measurement, and evaluation of policies that would enhance diversity would be decisive. In democratic societies, policies may pose new dilemmas as they benefit from public interest in. overcoming the accumulation of past disadvantages.

Barriers to trade and factor mobility are high in the region as a whole, though considerable liberalisation has been achieved through various bilateral agreements involving India and some of its neighbours. The conventional economic conditions for a common currency are also currently absent as patterns of shocks are non-synchronised, trade links are weak and factor mobility much constrained. Deeper intraregional economic integration requires much more comprehensive trade and investment liberalisation among member nations. While the political conditions for a single currency are unlikely to emerge in the foreseeable future, steps towards closer monetary cooperation through a South Asian Monetary System - building on the existing SAARCFINANCE network - may provide an institutional framework for enhancing regional integration. However, such cooperation will have to be conceived as a component of a sustainable transitional strategy which commits to a serious programme of deeper trade liberalisation to facilitate greater integration with the rest of the world, and most importantly, with East Asia.","[Jayasuriya, Sisira] La Trobe Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",La Trobe University,"Jayasuriya, S (通讯作者)，La Trobe Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",S.Jayasuriya@Latrobe.edu.au,,,,,,,52,0,0,0,15,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Overall, our analysis suggests that corporate governance in Ukraine operates with a certain degree of efficiency, despite the well-known lacunas in the country's institutional environment.","[Muravyev, Alexander] Inst Study Labor IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Muravyev, Alexander] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Muravyev, Alexander] St Petersburg State Univ, Grad Sch Management, St Petersburg, Russia; [Talavera, Oleksandr] Univ E Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Bilyk, Olga] Kyiv Sch Econ, Kiev, Ukraine",IZA Institute Labor Economics; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Saint Petersburg State University; University of East Anglia; Kyiv School of Economics,"Muravyev, A (通讯作者)，Inst Study Labor IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany.",,"Muravyev, Alexander/D-7846-2013; Talavera, Oleksandr/ABE-1913-2021","Muravyev, Alexander/0000-0001-8936-2582; Talavera, Oleksandr/0000-0002-4799-778X",,,,,43,4,4,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

J,"Oduor, J",,,,"Oduor, Jacob",,,Are prior restrictions on factor shares appropriate in growth accounting estimations?,ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Factor shares; Growth accounting; Structural vector autoregressions,ECONOMIC-GROWTH; LATIN-AMERICA,"Several studies make different prior assumptions on the magnitude of factor shares and scale of production when accounting for economic growth. The initial Solow estimations for instance assumed a capital share of 0.3 and constant returns to scale. Most authors have subsequently used the same restrictions just because they were used in previous studies even when production in the countries under study may not necessarily be taking place under constant returns to scale and capital share may be a value not any close to 0.3. This is likely to distort growth accounting estimation results. This study investigates whether these prior restrictions on factor shares and scale of production as commonly used in the literature are appropriate and whether the Solow assumptions are likely biased even in developed countries. Using Kenyan data and structural vector autoregressions, the main findings are: first, in all cases of the unrestricted estimations, the share of physical capital is less than 0.16. An estimation which imposes 0.3 as the share of physical capital in this case would therefore not be in line with the data generating process leading to biased results. Secondly, in all cases, the explanatory power of the model decreases when the restrictions are imposed implying that the restrictions are not appropriate in growth accounting exercises. The paper further disputes the styled fact in growth studies that the Solow assumptions may be relevant for developed countries but not developing countries and concludes that the Solow assumptions may be biased even in developed countries.

Using the data since early 1970s from the National Sample Survey, linear trend regressions on rates of employment, unemployment, labour force participation and employment status (i.e., being self-employed, in regular wage and salary employment and in casual employment) are estimated. They show no sustained trend in the growth and structure of employment. Nearly 60% of the usually employed persons in rural areas and little over 40% in urban areas were self-employed even as recently as 2005-2006. The pursuit of a strategy of capital intensive industrialization founded on insulating the economy from domestic and import competition underlies the poor employment performance. Reforms of strategy began hesitantly in the mid-80s and became more systemic and extensive 1990-1991. Reforms accelerated aggregate growth considerably but had little effect on employment. Only further and deeper reforms can generate sustained and rapid growth of productive employment. Journal of Comparative Economics 38 (1) (2010) 82-106.

Such fixed-to-mobile substitution (FMS) is at the center of this literature survey. Theoretical models explaining FMS are scarce and are inconclusive regarding the balance between substitution and complementarity of the fixed and mobile sectors. Empirical explanations hinge on the interaction of positive cross-elasticities of demand and reductions in mobile relative to fixed communications prices. FMS is also supported by relative declines in mobile network costs, network effects in demand and quality improvements of mobile services. The policy consequences of FMS stem from the potential reductions in market power of operators in fixed-line markets and from the ability of mobile operators to enable universal service. The survey reveals ample opportunity for further empirical and theoretical research in the area of FMS. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We also show that under Stackelberg competition, when the domestic government protects its domestic sector, it will levy higher optimum-welfare tariffs versus maximum-revenue tariffs; however, when it decides to open its doors more for foreign competitors, it will need to levy higher maximum-revenue tariffs versus optimum-welfare tariffs.

J,"Kaplow, L",,,,"Kaplow, Louis",,,"Concavity of utility, concavity of welfare, and redistribution of income",INTERNATIONAL TAX AND PUBLIC FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Concavity; Redistribution; Social welfare function; Optimal income taxation; Inequality,RISK,"The marginal social value of income redistribution is understood to depend on both the concavity of individuals' utility functions and the concavity of the social welfare function. In the pertinent literatures, notably on optimal income taxation and on normative inequality measurement, it seems to be accepted that the role of these two sources of concavity is symmetric with regard to the social concern about inequality in the distribution of income. Direct examination of the question, however, reveals that this is not the case. Concavity of utility has a simple, direct effect on the marginal social value of redistribution, as might be expected, whereas concavity of the social welfare function has a more subtle influence, one that in some cases may not be very significant. The implications of this difference are examined for some standard forms of utility and welfare functions, including particular versions that appear in the optimal income taxation literature.","Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Kaplow, L (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Hauser Hall 322, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",moverholt@law.harvard.edu,,,,,,,26,18,18,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Because of labor market frictions, the wage structure is compressed and workers do not capture the entire return from their skills. As a result, both firms and workers have incentives to support part of the costs of training investments. The analysis shows that when decisions to invest in training are made by firms and workers acting cooperatively, a wage tax increases the level of investment in skills whereas a corporate income tax decreases it. In this case, the introduction of a small wage tax unambiguously increases efficiency. The effects of both types of taxes on training are reversed when investment decisions are taken by firms alone. In any case, a corporate income tax is not neutral with respect to decisions to invest in skills even if the full cost of investment is deducted from taxable income in the period when it is incurred and the tax system provides full loss offset.","Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Tremblay, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, 55 Laurier E, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",Jean-Francois.Tremblay@uottawa.ca,,,,,,,28,7,8,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

When governments and cities host major sports events like the Olympics it is partly because such events are perceived as a means to promote the image of the host. The cost of an event like the Olympics is considerable, and in most cases the local and/or the national government has to pick up the lion's share of the bill. The Norwegian government sponsored the 1994 Lillehammer Winter Olympics by more than one billion euro. The Summer Olympics are even more expensive, and as an example the South Korean government spent more than three billion US dollar on the 1988 Summer Olympics according to Nebenzahl and Jaffe (1991). A report released in 2002 stipulates that the NSW government in Australia spent more than one billion dollars on the 2000 Olympic Games in Sidney. Therefore, it is very important to know if these investments of money and effort change the image of the hosting country. This study presents the effects of the Torino (Turin) 2006 Winter Olympics on the image of Italy in Lithuania. Two random samples of students at major Lithuanian universities were selected Students were interviewed because they are part of society, which are very interested in sports events like Olympics. The first sample consisted of 297 respondents and was collected before the Winter Olympics in Torino. The second sample consisted of 346 respondents and was collected after the event. There is no consensus among scholars regarding the country image concept. The understanding of the nature of this phenomenon varies in terms of target group (investors, students, visitors, etc.). By synthesizing various approaches Laroche, Papadopulos, Helsop, & Mourali (2005) define three main country image dimensions: cognitive, affective and conative. However, little research has been conducted to test it. This research tested the following country image dimensions: image of the people in the country, image of the societal system and the level of animosity towards the country. The following three general hypotheses have been formulated: H1: Animosity dimension of country image is influenced by a major sport event such as Winter Olympics. H2: Societal dimension of country image is influenced by a major sport event such as Winter Olympics. H3: People dimension of country. image is influenced by a major sport event such as Winter Olympics. The research results indicate that the Animosity dimension of Italy after the Olympics changed negatively which means that Lithuanian students got less favourable impression of Italy. The other two hypotheses were not supported Several factors contribute to the explanation of the research results: there was a lot of negative press concerning the logistics of the games, the Torino Olympics chose the slogan 'Passion lives here' and then failed to show any according to their polls: there were few inspired spectators at some of the events.","[Auruskeviciene, Vilte; Pundziene, Asta; Skudiene, Vida] ISM Univ Management & Econ, LT-01304 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Gripsrud, Geir; Nes, Erik B.; Olsson, Ulf H.] BI Norwegian Sch Management, N-0442 Oslo, Norway",ISM University of Management & Economics; BI Norwegian Business School,"Auruskeviciene, V (通讯作者)，ISM Univ Management & Econ, Ausros Vartu Str 7A, LT-01304 Vilnius, Lithuania.",vilte.auruskeviciene@ism.lt; asta.pundziene@ism.lt; vida.skudiene@ism.lt; geirgripsrud@bi.no; erik.nes@bi.no; ulf.h.olsson@bi.no,,"Auruskeviciene, Vilte/0000-0002-1563-4052",,,,,35,13,14,2,56,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

This new method is based on the nonparametric resampling procedure, so-called Residual-Based Block Bootstrap (RBB), which is developed by Paparoditis and Politis (2003) in the context of unit root testing. Through Monte Carlo experiments we show that, in small samples, the RBB cointegration test has good power properties in relation to the other two well-known tests for cointegration, such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF), applied to the residual of a cointegrating regression, and the Johansen's maximum eigenvalue tests. Likewise, this article looks at the influence played by the correlation of the 'X' variables with the errors of the cointegrating regression on the size and power properties of the above cointegration tests. In particular, we show that, when this correlation decreases, the RBB test for cointegration is the most powerful one.","[Badillo, Rosa] Tech Univ Cartagena, Dept Econ, Cartagena 30203, Spain; [Belaire-Franch, Jorge] Univ Valencia, Dept Econ Anal, Valencia 46071, Spain; [Reverte, Carmelo] Tech Univ Cartagena, Dept Accounting & Finance, Cartagena 30203, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena; University of Valencia; Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena,"Badillo, R (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Cartagena, Dept Econ, Paseo Alfonso XIII 50, Cartagena 30203, Spain.",rosa.badillo@upct.es,"Badillo-Amador, Rosa/JNR-5610-2023","Badillo-Amador, Rosa/0000-0002-8580-0271; REVERTE, CARMELO/0000-0002-5947-664X",,,,,16,3,3,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We find sound evidence in favour of a cointegrating relation, in which both wealth components display the expected, positive effect on households' consumption. In particular, our results point to a lower marginal propensity to consume out of housing than out of non housing net worth, with a respective size laying in the range of 1.5-2 and 4-6 cents. Following the estimate of a vector error correction model, we discuss the role played by transitory and permanent shocks in driving changes in the variables we consider. We have found that both consumption and wealth respond almost exclusively to permanent shocks, which are the sole determinants of the common stochastic trend in our theoretical set-up. As a result, we are confident that our estimates of wealth coefficients in the cointegrating vector match very closely the true long run marginal propensity to consume for Italian households.","[Bassanetti, Antonio; Zollino, Francesco] Bank Italy, Serv Congiuntura & Polit Monetaria, I-00184 Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,,antonio.bassanetti@bancaditalia.it; francesco.zollino@bancaditalia.it,,"Bassanetti, Antonio/0000-0003-3709-3282",,,,,34,6,6,0,1,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-642-15339-6,,,,2010,,,,,,,307,336,,10.1007/978-3-642-15340-2_14,0.0,,,30,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYS93,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300025200014,0

This article provides a brief assessment of costs and benefits of vehicle buyback programmes. There are environmental benefits from the early retirement of automobiles and light trucks; however, some pollutants are not closely related to vehicle age. Moreover, vehicle buyback programmes are unlikely to reduce consumption of gasoline by a substantial amount and may even increase gasoline consumption in the short run because vehicle age is associated with an increase in miles travelled. Vehicle buyback programmes are not unambiguously progressive because they will increase the price of older vehicles, the only source of transportation for lower income groups. This analysis does not justify the creation of a national large-scale vehicle buyback programme. However, vehicle buyback programme targeting the highest emission vehicles and vehicles likely to fail emission inspections creates support for more stringent vehicle emission standards and systems, a proven method to reduce mobile source air pollution. It may be useful to expand subsidies for existing local vehicle buyback programmes and create incentives for the creation of these programmes by additional municipalities.","US Treasury, Off Econ Policy, Lorton, VA USA",United States Department of the Treasury,"Bernstein, D (通讯作者)，US Treasury, Off Econ Policy, Lorton, VA USA.",spstat@yahoo.com,,,,,,,3,0,1,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

With rapid globalization and the increasing importance of the knowledge-based economy (KBE), governments are competing with each other to attract the best and brightest talents. The competition for talented human capital is occurring not only in developed economies but also in the newly industrializing economies of Southeast Asia. Singapore is experiencing very low fertility levels and is unable to produce a critical mass of talented individuals to propel further growth of its KBE despite massive investments in its education sector. Malaysia has a higher level of fertility and larger pool of graduates, but because of inherent constraints, most of its graduates have not achieved the level of competence required to sustain growth in Malaysia's KBE. The aim of this paper would be to compare the state strategies of both Malaysia and Singapore in their quest to attract foreign talent that would enable both economies to develop into KBEs. The paper will compare and contrast the strategy of recruiting foreign talent in Malaysia and Singapore as well as its economic, political and social impact on local talent. Specifically, the paper will examine the recruitment of foreign talent from India, which is one of the largest global sources of talent outflow.","[Bin Yahya, Faizal] Natl Univ Singapore, S Asian Studies Programme, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Singapore 117548, Singapore; [Kaur, Arunajeet] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Pacific & Asian Studies, Canberra, ACT, Australia",National University of Singapore; Australian National University,"Bin Yahya, F (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, S Asian Studies Programme, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Singapore 117548, Singapore.",sasfy@nus.edu.sg,,,,,,,68,8,10,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Our key assumption is that the probability of formation of a new tie is greater between two employed individuals than between an employed and an unemployed individual. We show that this assumption generally generates negative duration dependence of exit rates from unemployment. Our model has a number of novel testable implications.

The reason is that the three-step process employed by the clearinghouse is a complicated mechanism in which many students fail to grasp the strategic aspects involved. The mechanism is based on quotas and consists of three procedures that are administered sequentially, one for each quota.

Our most striking and robust finding is that foreigners exhibit poor timing when reallocating between bonds and equities within their U.S. portfolios. The poor timing of foreign investors-caused primarily by deliberate trading, not a lack of portfolio rebalancing-contributes positively to the U.S. external returns differential. We find no evidence that the poor timing is driven by mechanical reserve accumulation by emerging market countries; rather, it is driven almost entirely by the poor timing of rich, developed (mainly European) countries. Finally, while poor foreign timing appears to be persistent across subsamples, other terms in our decomposition (the composition and return effects and U.S. timing abroad), as well as the overall differential, are sometimes negative, sometimes positive, and usually indistinguishable from zero.

Although the importance of CSR is rather widely discussed in scientific literature there is lack of empirical research on basic CSR disclosure situation, especially in developing countries. Thus, the main goal of this article is to investigate the level of social information disclosure in the annual reports of Lithuanian companies after the execution of analysis of the factors of social responsibility disclosure distinguished in scientific literature. Profit pursuit has been one of the most important company goals for a long time, first and foremost because revenue earning is an essential condition for activity succession. However, spreading CSR conception impels to ensure the implementation of needs and goals of all groups concerned. Thus, responsible company has to solve many important problems such as: how to maintain natural resources and produce goods, how to keep environment unpolluted and preserve human health, how to ensure safe, acceptable and healthy work environment. Implementation of responsible business practice may help company in creating competitive advantage, may have positive influence on its reputation, employee loyalty and employment, activity efficiency and sales volumes. Based on the analysis of scientific literature, there are four main activities distinguished that raise interest of various groups concerned: human resources' activity, product design and development activities, community activity and environmental activity. According to the annual activity report of the Lithuanian National Responsible Business Network for the year 2008, this Network had united 57 Lithuanian companies and organizations on 31(st) of December, 2008. However, only 11 Lithuanian companies have presented social progress reports for 2008. This shows that major part of Lithuanian companies is oriented towards compulsory presentation of financial reports and financial information disclosure on requisition. Thus, while investigating the level of social information disclosure, compulsory reports - annual reports have been used where companies may voluntary disclose more social information on their activity. Content analysis as one of the most common methods for social information analysis was used for research. Full sentences on company social responsibility and page ratio to full volume of annual report in percents were used as a measurement unit for content analysis. There were annual reports for the years 2007 - 2008 of four companies from diary industry that had been quoted in the stock exchange used, aiming to ensure data comparability and logical conclusions. The results of research have revealed that the content of disclosure in Lithuanian companies is not comprehensive and is highly various, even in the same branch of industry. Investigated companies use written narrative but not quantifiable methods to disclose CSR in their reports. None of companies have disclosed information on community activity. Only one of surveyed companies has presented information on environment protection. Information on human resources has been presented mainly in digital form and in tables.

We assume that the investor is interested in an almost optimal strategy for small transaction taxes. This leads us to a certain partial differential equation, which can be solved explicitly in the case where the stock prices are independent. Thus we are able to propose a strategy that should be almost optimal for small values of transaction taxes in case of independent stocks.

Like Bayesian learners, non-Bayesian updaters who underreact to observations eventually forecast accurately. Hence, underreaction may be a transient phenomenon.

The same absolute value of a change of investor's property that is related to the result of an investment is viewed equally as an absolute value of utility change, regardless of profit or loss realization (mirror symmetry of detriment and utility). The result of a project investment is a change of the present value of the investor's property just for the expected project's net present value. The expected E[NPV] > 0 makes him invest, E[NPV] < 0 puts him off the investment and E [NPV] = 0 (a decision breaking point) does not say anything. The reality proves investors have a personal relation to risk and uncertainty: the risk aversion makes them react more sensitively to a detriment than to a utility benefit developed by the same absolute change of property; the tendency to risk shows the opposite effect of an investor's behavior. The consequence of it is the decision breaking point according to the rule of E[NPV] pushes to the right for the first group of investors and to the left for the second group. The contribution sets simple mathematic models describing and explaining the way of behavior of various types of investors (the private and institutionalized ones). The models come from the cardinal utility theory which is used for explaining the connection between the subjective relationship towards risk and some pathologic phenomenon of finance theory (for example the moral hazard question of institutionalized investors) and takes into account the decision making of both ordinary people and professional investors.","[Haskova, Simona; Kolar, Pavel] VSE Praha Fak Managementu JH, Katedra Managementu Podnikatelske Sfery, Jindrichuv Hradec 37701, Czech Republic",,,haskovas@post.cz; kolar@fm.vse.cz,"Hašková, Simona/N-3667-2019",,,,,,6,2,2,0,1,"UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,CESKE BUDEJOVICE, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZ-370 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-218-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,214,219,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS47,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287979900037,0

The data covers OECD countries from 1950 to 2003. Our results clearly point out the difficulty that applied econometricians would face when they want to get a simple and clear-cut diagnosis with panel unit root tests. We confirm the fact that panel methods must be very carefully used for testing unit roots in macroeconomic or financial panels. More precisely, we find mitigated results under the cross-sectional independence assumption, since the unit root hypothesis is rejected for many macroeconomic variables. When international cross-correlations are taken into account, conclusions depend on the specification of these cross-sectional dependencies. Two groups of tests can be distinguished. The first group tests are based on a dynamic factor structure or an error component model. In this case, the nonstationarity of common factors (international business cycles or growth trends) is not rejected, but the results are less clear with respect to idiosyncratic components. The second group tests are based on more general specifications. Their results are globally more favourable to the unit root assumption.","Univ Orleans, LEO, F-45067 Orleans 2, France",Universite de Orleans,"Hurlin, C (通讯作者)，Univ Orleans, LEO, Rue Blois BP 6739, F-45067 Orleans 2, France.",christophe.hurlin@univ-orleans.fr,"Hurlin, Christophe/J-1474-2019","Hurlin, Christophe/0000-0002-6082-8251",,,,,33,24,24,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The Fed controls currency and reserves - imperfectly - but the money supply is determined by the numerous decisions of borrowers and lenders to expand credit. Thus, the Fed can try to pump reserves into the financial system, but it will not result in an expansion of any monetary aggregates. Monetary policy can also lead to price bubbles. When people think of money and inflation, they usually think about inflation in goods prices. This stems from the quantity theory of money that treated the number of transactions taking place as being proportional to goods and services produced. That may have been appropriate for a society in which most transactions were indeed for goods and services, but today, the transactions for real estate and securities dwarf the transactions for goods and services. This means that the quantity theory of money needs to be rethought, and this rethinking illuminates how excess money supply growth can cause price bubbles in securities, real estate and commodities as well as traditional inflation.","Wisconsin Lutheran Coll, Dept Business Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA",,"Jacobsen, B (通讯作者)，Wisconsin Lutheran Coll, Dept Business Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA.",brian_jacobsen@wlc.edu,,,,,,,2,1,1,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

This deterministic problem can usually depend on an underlying probability measure corresponding to the random element. The investigation of such types problems often belong to the stochastic programming field. The great attention has been focus on the problems in which objective functions depend linearly on the probability measure.

We study the employment effects - differentiated by educational attainment levels - of changes in the patterns of trade integration and outsourcing in the Austrian economy over the periods 1995-2000 and 2000-2005 using hierarchical decomposition analysis based on deflated input-output tables. Outsourcing is modeled as changes in the shares of domestically produced intermediates in total intermediates. A similar decomposition of the final demand vector allows us to draw conclusions on the overall employment effects of trade integration. The results suggest that the expected negative employment effects of outsourcing and rising import penetration have been overcompensated by increasing exports. Thus, the overall employment effects of Austrian trade integration have been positive for all educational attainment groups. However, whereas the total effects have been strongest for medium and high educated workers over the period 1995-2000, employment of low educated workers have been strongest and positively affected over the period 2000-2005. This pattern can be explained by a more sluggish export performance together with stronger negative effects of outsourcing and import penetration in medium and high-skill intensive products.","[Stehrer, Robert] Vienna Inst Int Econ Studies wiiw, Vienna, Austria; [Koller, Wolfgang] Inst Ind Res IWI, Vienna, Austria",Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies,"Stehrer, R (通讯作者)，Vienna Inst Int Econ Studies wiiw, Vienna, Austria.",Robert.Stehrer@wiiw.ac.at,,,,,,,29,14,16,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Data on economic activity, petroleum consumption by type (gasoline, diesel, aviation fuel, residual, propane), and emissions factors are compiled and analyzed. In the baseline year 1997, emissions are estimated to total approximately 23.2 million metric tons of carbon, 181 thousand metric tons of nitrous oxide, and 31 thousand metric tons of methane in terms of carbon-equivalent global warming potential over a 100-year horizon. Air transportation, electricity, and other transportation are the key economic activity responsible for GHG emissions associated with fossil fuel use. More than 22% of total emissions are attributed to visitor expenditures. On a per person per annum basis, emission rates generated by visitor demand are estimated to be higher than that of residents by a factor of 4.3 for carbon, 3.2 for methane, and 4.8 for nitrous oxide.

Due to higher store traffic, tasks, such as restocking shelves, handling customers' questions and inquiries, running cash registers, cleaning and bagging, become more urgent during holidays. As a result, the holiday-period opportunity cost of price adjustment may increase dramatically for retail stores, which should lead to greater price rigidity during holidays. We test this prediction using weekly retail scanner price data from a major Midwestern supermarket chain. We find that, indeed, prices are more rigid during holiday periods than non-holiday periods. For example, the econometric model we estimate suggests that the probability of a price change is lower during holiday periods, even after accounting for cost changes. Moreover, we find that the probability of a price change increases with the size of the cost change, during both the holiday as well as non-holiday periods. We argue that these findings are best explained by higher price adjustment costs (menu cost) the retailers face during the holiday periods. Our data provides a natural experiment for studying variation in price rigidity because most aspects of market environment such as market structure, industry concentration, the nature of long-term relationships, contractual arrangements, etc. do not vary between holiday and non-holiday periods. We, therefore, are able to rule out these commonly used alternative explanations for the price rigidity, and conclude that the menu cost theory offers the best explanation for the holiday period price rigidity.","[Levy, Daniel] Bar Ilan Univ, IL-52100 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Chen, Haipeng (Allan)] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Dutta, Shantanu] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Bergen, Mark] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",Bar Ilan University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Southern California; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Levy, D (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, IL-52100 Ramat Gan, Israel.",,"DUTTA, Shantanu/C-6457-2014; Levy, Daniel/B-3987-2008","Levy, Daniel/0000-0001-5740-3378",,,,,72,19,22,1,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0427,,,ECONOMICA,Economica,JAN,2010,77.0,305,,,,,172,198,,10.1111/j.1468-0335.2008.00738.x,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,536BU,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273018000010,0

The advantage of the proposed Bounded Influence Estimator (BIE) is that it limits the influence of a small subset of data and is asymptotically normal. The BIE provides more consistent and robust estimates than Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) and semi-parametric estimator, both of which tend to underestimate volatility persistence due to outliers. It is thus robust to outliers and model misspecification.

Political liberalization can relax this constraint, increasing the government's revenue, but also increasing the ruler's political risks. We analyze the ruler's optimal liberalization, where our measure of political liberalization is the probability of the ruler being replaced if he tried to expropriate private investments. Poorer endowments can support reputational equilibria with more investment, even without liberalization, so we find a resources curse, where larger resource endowments can decrease investment and reduce the ruler's revenue. The ruler's incentive to liberalize can be greatest with intermediate resource endowments. Strong liberalization becomes optimal in cases where capital investment yields approximately constant returns to scale. Adding independent revenue decreases optimal liberalization and investment. Mobility of productive factors that complement capital can increase incentives to liberalize, but equilibrium prices may adjust so that liberal and authoritarian regimes coexist.","Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Myerson, RB (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",myerson@uchicago.edu,,,,,,,11,5,6,0,14,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

Inflation is statistically significant, positive and persistent. I show that the effects of inflation are robust to the inclusion of additional explanatory variables and various trend specifications.

We find consistently that a greater presence of foreign banks does not harm banking system stability and, under some definitions, is associated with a statistically significant fall in the probability of a banking crisis.

The model is formulated under those assumption on which the Balassa-Samuelson theorem rests. The hypothesis is tested using cointegration technique and vector error correction model. Usually testing the Balassa-Samuelson effect gives mixed results, sometimes finding the opposite reaction of the real exchange rate to the one predicted by the Balassa-Samuelson theorem, pointing to the restrictive nature of the assumptions on which it is based. The analysis shows a little supportive evidence for the Balassa-Samuelson effect. However, according to the analysis the effect of labor productivity on the real exchange rate can hardly be considered as clear-cut as predicted by the Balassa-Samuelson theorem.","Univ Econ, Fak Business Adm, Dept Microecon, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Posta, V (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fak Business Adm, Dept Microecon, Ul W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",postav@vse.cz,,"Posta, Vit/0000-0001-9919-4519",,,,,17,2,2,0,8,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

The endogeneity of turnover with compensation variables is accounted for in the estimation using instrumental variables. Turnover is determined by resident characteristics, frontline-worker compensation, and establishment characteristics. The share of higher-need residents and agency size predict higher turnover, while compensation and non-profit status are associated with lower turnover. Our findings indicate that public policies to reduce turnover through compensation subsidization can be effective. Our preferred estimates suggest an approximate one-quarter increase in total compensation would cut turnover by one-third.","[Powers, Elizabeth T.] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Powers, ET (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",epowers@illinois.edu; njpowers@yahoo.com,"Powers, Elizabeth/AAO-1720-2020","Powers, Elizabeth/0000-0003-1785-9471",,,,,32,9,11,0,18,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The dataset used in this article is obtained from Ball et al. (2001). The WMI is constructed by combining Data Envelopment Analysis, window analysis with the Malmquist index approach. Furthermore, the 'Kruskal and Wallis rank test' is used for testing frontier shifts among observed periods. The article also explores the question of convergence in TFP across the countries under consideration, by testing for - and sigma-convergence, as well as for stochastic or long-run convergence. The results show wide variation in the rate of TFP growth across countries with an average trend growth rate of 1.62%. The results indicate the presence of -convergence but the absence of sigma-convergence for the full period under consideration but the presence of both - and sigma-convergence for the sub-period 1983 to 1993. Finally, a wide spectrum of panel unit root test results support the presence of long-run convergence among the sample countries.","Univ Ioannina, Dept Business Adm Food & Agr Enterprises, Agrinion 30100, Greece",University of Ioannina,"Rezitis, AN (通讯作者)，Univ Ioannina, Dept Business Adm Food & Agr Enterprises, Agrinion 30100, Greece.",arezitis@cc.uoi.gr,"Rezitis, Anthony N./AAO-4276-2021","Rezitis, Anthony N./0000-0002-2226-2269",,,,,45,28,32,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In contradiction with classical presumptions about human behavior, it has been found that the assignment of responsibilities influences people's perceptions about the (un)kindness of others. Kindness perceptions, in turn, influence behavior. Dufwenberg and Kirchsteiger [Dufwenberg, M., Kirchsteiger, G., 2004. A theory of sequential reciprocity. Games Econ.

More precisely, an extended framework is presented which allows for the analysis of strategic interactions of reciprocal agents in situations in which material outcomes also depend on chance. Moves of chance influence the attribution of responsibilities, people's perceptions about the (un)kindness of others and, hence, their reciprocal behavior. Furthermore, with the help of two applications it is demonstrated how this framework can be used to explain experimental findings showing that people react very differently in outcomewise-identical situations depending on the moves of chance involved.

When implemented, such model will significantly facilitate maintenance of national geo-reference database and in five years from full implementation will have a significant economic effect.","[Stankevicius, Zilvinas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Geodesy & Cadastre, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Beconyte, Giedre] Vilnius State Univ, Ctr Cartog, LT-03101 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Kalantaite, Ausra] Minist Agr, Natl Land Serv, LT-01103 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Vilnius University,"Stankevicius, Z (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Geodesy & Cadastre, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",zilvinas.stankevicius@vplanas.lt; giedre.beconyte@gf.vu.lt; ausrak@zum.lt,"Beconyte, Giedre/AEQ-4037-2022",,,,,,22,6,6,0,4,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The poverty in Slovakia has its regional aspects as it is the case elsewhere in the world. In the analysis, there were applied statistical methods, such as descriptive methods, frequency and contingency tables, ANOVA and logistic regression. All of them have proved statistically important regional poverty differences in Slovakia based on three regional variables which are stated in EU SILC 2008 data. They are - the country district, the NUTS2 region and the urbanisation level. Bratislava district records the lowest monetary poverty rate. The reason for this is that in this part of the country, there is firstly, a high level of urbanisation rate, secondly, the biggest work opportunities along with job offers; and consequently, there is the lowest unemployment rate in Bratislava territory. There is evidence that in this part of Slovakia, there is the biggest difference between the rich and the poor. This means the highest poverty depth is recorded in this part of Slovakia. On the other hand, it is Nitra district which records the highest levels of risk-of-poverty rate. Its levels depend on some factors as has been proved in the logistic regression model. These factors are - the type of household, education level and economic activity as well as the number of provided children, district or urbanization level. There were no proofs that dependence on sex of the head of the family would lead to any differences in poverty levels.","[Stankovicova, Iveta] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Dept Informat Syst, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,,iveta.stankovicova@fm.uniba.sk,"Stankovičová, Iveta/ABC-1763-2020",,,,,,10,12,12,0,4,TECH UNIV KOSICE,KOSICE,"FAC ECONOMICS, INST REGIONAL & COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, KOSICE, 00000, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-0573-8,,,,2010,,,,,,,67,75,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTY88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288467200006,0

The determination of the ECTS credits are based on the Saaty matrix of workload factors and the weights derived from this matrix. The authors selected randomly a certain number of Ph.D. students and asked them to evaluate the factors determining student's workload, they eventually suggested further factors. The intention was to improve the Saaty matrix to describe students' opinion better. Then, new relative difficulties of each course were calculated by this Saaty matrix, and the total number of credits was adjusted to comply with the ECTS rules.","[Valentova, Vladimira Hovorkova; Rozkovec, Jiri] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Stat, Liberec, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,,vladimira.valentova@tul.cz; jiri.rozkovec@tul.cz,"Rozkovec, Jiri/AFP-2672-2022; Hovorkova Valentova, Vladimira/M-1370-2018","Rozkovec, Jiri/0000-0001-8870-5467; Hovorkova Valentova, Vladimira/0000-0001-5718-315X",,,,,5,0,0,0,1,"UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,CESKE BUDEJOVICE, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZ-370 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-218-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,268,272,,,,,,5,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS47,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287979900046,0

Our estimations suggest that there are two channels in which taxes affect investment: on the one hand, higher taxes increase the cost of capital (cost of capital channel); and on the other, they reduce internal funds available for investment (liquidity constraint channel).","Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Vergara, R (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Econ, Casilla 76 Correo 17, Santiago, Chile.",rvergara@faceapuc.cl,,,,,,,25,23,26,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Risk management is an essential part of project's life cycle. Management of investments risk means presence of all procedures control in any phase of the project. The estimation of risk must be carried out at various project stages. The investor work conditions changes continuously due to economic situation changes. Investment projects' quality estimation can be based only on the management's ingenuity of the investor and depend on its intuition and experience. The risk management attributes can have both qualitative and quantitative values. The biggest problem when making decisions is the estimation influence of different attributes. Given attributes significance values are based on experts' knowledge or new ways of its application. The article summarises the results of theoretical and empirical studies in the sphere of the multi-attribute decision making by focusing on the peculiarities of attributes weight determined by applying an expert method The proposed method includes five stages: attributes significance measuring, values analysis, weights estimation, measures improving and improved weights estimation. According to the article, the authors' opinion is considered appropriate to limit experts given values to the attributes importance. The offered method of the attributes weights estimation is applied when there is a limited number of experts and it cannot be increased The offered method was tested in the solution of the actual problem.","[Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras; Turskis, Zenonas; Ustinovichius, Leonas; Shevchenko, Galina] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Zavadskas, EK (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Av 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",edmundas.zavadskas@adm.vgtu.lt; zenonas.turskis@st.vgtu.lt; leonasu@st.vgtu.lt; galina.sevcenko@vgtu.lt,"Ustinovičius, Leonas/AAH-8369-2020; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018; Turskis, Zenonas/AAA-9159-2021; Turskis, Zenonas/H-3035-2018","Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X; Turskis, Zenonas/0000-0002-5835-9388;",,,,,58,69,73,0,27,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In this paper, an evaluation system for measuring innovation capability for science parks has been developed, including Innovation Organization Sub-System (IOSS, mainly for high-tech firms), Innovation Support Sub-System (ISSS, e. g., technology intermediaries) and Innovation Environmental Sub-Systems (IESS). Based on the empirical study on Qingdao Science Park (1994-2008), this paper has demonstrated the use of the system for evaluation and measurement of innovation capabilities for a science park. The findings reveal that the evolution law explained by the evaluation system fitted with three components is consistent with the actual evolution process of the Qingdao Science Park. It confirms that this evaluation system bears a good explanatory power for the development of Science Park. In addition, recommendations to improve the capabilities of continuous innovation for science parks are also given.","[Zeng, Saixing] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Sch Management, Shanghai 200052, Peoples R China; [Xie, Xuemei] Shanghai Univ, Sch Management, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China; [Tam, Chiming] City Univ Hong Kong, Coll Sci & Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai University; City University of Hong Kong,"Zeng, SX (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Sch Management, Shanghai 200052, Peoples R China.",zengsaixing@sjtu.edu.cn; xxm1030@126.com; bctam@cityu.edu.hk,"Xie, Xuemei/S-6888-2019; Xie, X.M./ABQ-6831-2022","TAM, Chi Ming/0000-0002-2402-7449",,,,,28,28,30,7,82,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

For an average trip in the corridor analysed, we obtain that users' valuation of a minute under congestion is 140% above that without traffic jams. We have designed an experiment based on a stated preference approach for one of the main access roadways to Madrid, the Levante corridor. On this route, car users can choose, for the last 33 km entering Madrid, between a very fast toll roadway where there is no congestion and a free but slower roadway with significant congestion problems at peak hours. The potential benefits in the transportation system associated with different reductions in toll levels have been evaluated. These benefits would come from the decrease in total travelling time, the decrease in congestion on the toll roadway and from the savings in fuel consumption.","[Cantos Sanchez, Pedro; Alvarez San-Jaime, Oscar] Univ Valencia, E-46003 Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia,"Sánchez, PC (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, E-46003 Valencia, Spain.",,"Cantos-Sánchez, Pedro/E-6396-2016",,,,,,32,0,0,0,1,UNIV ZARAGOZA,ZARAGOZA,"DEPT ESTRUCTURA ECONOMICA ECONOMIA PUBLICA, GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

Price caps are known to provide superior incentives for the regulated monopoly to pursue cost reduction and, in a multiservice/product context, undertake welfare enhancing price discrimination. It is well known that capping a Laspeyres index of the firm's prices induces the monopoly to charge socially optimal Ramsey prices in the long run. This paper examines the suitability of the Laspeyres form of regulation when the regulated firm faces competition in the market for one of its services (outputs). We present the appropriately modified Ramsey pricing rule for the regulated dominant firm and demonstrate that capping a Laspeyres index of the dominant firm's prices leads to prices that satisfy this pricing rule in the long run.","Oklahoma State Univ, Spears Sch Business, Dept Econ & Legal Studies Business, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Currier, KM (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Spears Sch Business, Dept Econ & Legal Studies Business, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",kevin.currier@okstate.edu,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,7,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

Using microsimulation, we decompose this difference into four sources, with particular attention to path-dependence and statistical distribution of the estimated effects: (I) different allocation to sectors that pay different wages (sectoral effect); (2) hourly wage disparities across the two populations within sectors (wage effect); (3) different working times within sectors (working time effect); and (4) different population structures (population effect). Although sector allocation is extremely contrasted, with very few migrants in the public sector and very few urban residents working as self-employed, this has no clear impact on earnings differentials, because the sectoral effect is not robust to the path followed for the decomposition. The second main finding is that the population effect is robust and significantly more important than wage or working time effects. This implies that the main source of disparity between the two populations is pre-market (education opportunities) rather than on-market. Journal of Comparative Economics 37 (4) (2009) 610-628.

This paper develops a simple overlapping-generations framework with endogerrous occupational choice and productivity-enhancing entrepreneurial innovation. It shows that introducing these basic features into R&D-based growth theory has important implications. First, an equilibrium with price-taking firms can be supported despite a constant returns to scale production technology, once entrepreneurial human capital is accounted for. Second, in the proposed model, a larger size of the workforce capable to conduct R&D neither affects the long-run rate of economic growth (strong scale effect) nor per capita income or welfare (weak scale effect). Economic growth is sustained in the long-run and may be policy-dependent. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This subset contains all of the products, and only those products, that are responsible for the cross-subsidies left by a stipulated set of prices. In addition, the subset can often be identified with a simple and efficient Myopic Algorithm. The algorithm should be particularly useful as a method for detecting cross-subsidies in regulated enterprises and networks because the cost functions for these industries are typically sub-modular.","US Postal Regulatory Commiss, Alexandria, VA 22309 USA",,"Pearsall, ES (通讯作者)，US Postal Regulatory Commiss, 4804 Tarpon Lane, Alexandria, VA 22309 USA.",pearsall@cox.net,,,,,,,11,3,3,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

The results show that firms in Indonesia, which has a liberalized trade regime, enjoyed higher human resource, process technology, and research and development (R&D) capabilities than firms in Malaysia, which has protected trading policies. Statistical relationships largely support theoretical arguments about R&D and the explanatory variable of foreign ownership in Indonesia where the relationship between the two is significant and negative. Foreign ownership was negatively correlated with human resource and positively correlated with process technology in Malaysia.

One key result is that incentive pay arises as a robust instrument of innovation management both with and without delegation, although in the present model its primary purpose is not to elicit more effort for the creation of new ideas, but to ensure that new ideas are implemented if and only if this is efficient. While without delegation, the fit-in may underinvest in innovation, with delegation the opposite bias may arise as new ideas may be implemented too often (overinvestment). The optimal Organizational choice trades off these two biases.

The sharp increase in mortgage defaults in 2007 is significantly amplified in subprime ZIP codes, or ZIP codes with a disproportionately large share of subprime borrowers as of 1996. Prior to the default crisis, these subprime ZIP codes experience an unprecedented relative growth in mortgage credit. The expansion in mortgage credit from 2002 to 2005 to subprime ZIP codes occurs despite sharply declining relative (and in some cases absolute) income growth in these neighborhoods. In fact, 2002 to 2005 is the only period in the past eighteen years in which income and mortgage credit growth are negatively correlated. We show that the expansion in mortgage credit to subprime ZIP codes and its dissociation from income growth is closely correlated with the increase in securitization of subprime mortgages.","[Mian, Atif] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Mian, A (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",atif@chicagogsb.edu; amir.sufi@chicagogsb.edu,"Mian, Atif/JGM-2094-2023",,,,,,16,814,1040,6,206,M I T PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"238 MAIN STREET, STE 500, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1046 USA",0033-5533,,,Q J ECON,Q.

Our sectoral analysis illustrates two points. First, Turkey's large drop in hours is due to the fact that the substantial decline in agricultural hours has not been accompanied by a corresponding increase in nonagricultural market hours. Second, the sectoral composition of output is important for understanding Turkey's relatively weak rise in output per hour. We develop a simple model of structural transformation and home production to provide an account of Turkey's performance relative to the U. S. and Southern Europe. We find that the evolution of exogenous differences in sectoral productivity and taxes, between Turkey and the U.

In response, the production department tries to resist change by improving the existing technology. Resistance to change triggers competition between departments, which, in turn, spurs effort. We show that firms balancing the strengths of the two departments perform better. As a negative effect, resistance to change might distort the R&D department's effort away from radical innovations. The firm can solve this problem by implementing the so-called skunk works model of innovation where the R&D department is isolated from the rest of the organization.

Normative analyses of this type use the assumption of steady state, largely motivated by analytical convenience. This paper questions this steady-state approach by introducing endogenous cycles as long-run equilibria. We show that the government fails to maximize welfare if policy which is optimal in steady state is myopically applied in cyclical equilibria. More specifically, we demonstrate that (i) cycles arise in the (very) standard R&D-based model of Grossman and Helpman [1991. Innovation and Growth in the Global Economy. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA (Chapter 3)] once the model is framed in discrete time, (ii) these cycles are inefficient in the sense that they prevent welfare maximization, (iii) optimal steady-state R&D policy fails to eliminate cycles, and can even create inefficient cycles, (iv) the application of R&D subsidies leads to a trade-off between growth and macroeconomic stability, and (v) optimal R&D policy in a fluctuating economy is state-dependent, which generalizes optimal steady-state R&D policy.

It appears that, without any (micro-)economic theory being required, a conditional relationship between TFP indices can be derived, in which the Domar factor plays an important role. At the same time it turns Out that gross output-and Value added-based TFP indicators (difference-type measures) always coincide. In the Divisia index framework and maintaining the classical assumptions (profit maximization and a production technology that exhibits globally constant returns to scale), it appears that both TFP indices measure technological change, albeit in a dual way. In establishing this result, no separability assumptions are involved. Both indices are in general path-dependent.

Such a phenomenon occurs if a new technology is distinct from the existing one so production uncertainty becomes technology-specific. Then the monopoly can reduce the entrant's post-entry profit to the point of deterrence by using the existing technology with which the entrant would enter. We show that the monopoly develops a new technology when the entrant faces a sufficiently high or low entry cost but forgoes invention when the entry cost is intermediate.

A representative sample of Danish individual incomes from 1984 to 2002 is utilised. Results show that polarization has increased over time, regardless of the applied measure, when the last part of the period is compared to the first part of the period; primary causes being increased inequality (alienation) and faster income growth among high incomes relative to those in the middle of the distribution. Increasing the accounting period confirms the reduction in inequality found for shorter periods, but polarization is virtually unchanged, because income group identification increases. Applying different equivalence scales does not change polarization ranking for different years, but identification ranks are affected. The welfare state considerably reduces income polarization and inequality, but at the expense of some more identification.","Danish Natl Ctr Social Res, DK-1052 Copenhagen K, Denmark",,"Hussain, MA (通讯作者)，Danish Natl Ctr Social Res, Herluf Trolles Gade 11, DK-1052 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",mh@sfi.dk,"Hussain, M.

This taste bias has empirical support. An increase in the endowment of a factor of production can lead to an absolute curtailment in the production of the commodity using that factor intensively, and an absolute expansion of the commodity using relatively little of the same factor. This outcome - which we call Reverse Rybczynski - implies immiserizing factor growth. We present a simple analytical example that delivers this result with unique pre- and post-growth equilibria. In this example, production occurs within the cone of diversification, such that factor price equalization holds.

In particular, union dissolution is becoming more frequent and, when separation occurs, child custody is most often granted to the mother.

The analyses reveal a certain number of similarities between countries (such as lower frequency of father-child relations, for example), but also divergences (the child's sex influences relations in Russia and France but not in Lithuania).","[Regnier-Loilier, Arnaud; Valetas, Marie-France] Inst Natl Etud Demog, F-75675 Paris, France; [Korchaguina, Irina; Prokofieva, Lidia] Acad Sci Russie, Inst Problemes Socioecon Populat ISEPN, Moscow, Russia; [Baublyte, Mare] Ctr Rech Demog, Inst Rech Sociale, Vilnius, Lithuania",Russian Academy of Sciences,"Régnier-Loilier, A (通讯作者)，Inst Natl Etud Demog, F-75675 Paris, France.",arnaud.regnier-loilier@ined.fr; valetas@ined.fr; i.korchagina@mail.ru; larkad@rinet.ru; mareb@ktl.mii.lt; vladast@ktl.mii.lt,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,4,PRESSES UNIV FRANCE,PARIS CEDEX 14,"6 AVENUE REILLE, 75685 PARIS CEDEX 14, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

Activity contracted around the world, with the advanced economies of the North experiencing declines in spending more typical of the developing economies of the South for the first time since the 1930s. This paper examines the role of policy in fostering recovery in that earlier decade. With nominal short-term interest rates already near zero, monetary policy in most countries took the unconventional step of delinking currencies from the gold standard. However, analysis of a sample that includes developing countries shows that this was not as universally effective as often claimed, perhaps because the exit from gold was uncoordinated in time, scale, and scope and, in many countries, failed to bring about a substantial depreciation against the dollar. Fiscal policy was also active most countries sharply increased government spending but was prone to reversals that may have undermined confidence. Countries that more consistently kept spending high tended to recover more quickly.","[Reinhart, Carmen M.] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Reinhart, Vincent R.] Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, Washington, DC 20036 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research,"Reinhart, CM (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,,,,,,,34,5,5,0,7,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

Within transport, changes to vehicle and aircraft technology are likely to be the key drivers of this change, underpinned by a more consistent and comprehensive approach to carbon pricing. Infrastructure investment is likely to be needed to cater for travel growth, but this should be on the basis that improvements in carbon efficiency outweigh the upward pressure of growth on emissions. A radical shift in the power supply for road transport to support electric vehicles could also have significant infrastructure requirements, and there will be potentially significant 'soft' investment requirements associated with improved traffic management, travel information systems, and road pricing.

By reallocating quantities between agreements, the buyer can increase its share of the surplus. With two symmetric sellers producing substitutes, the quantity in the first agreement will be higher than the efficient quantity, and the quantity in the last lower, thus implying that sellers are strategically discriminated. When asymmetries are not too large and sellers produce substitutes, the buyer first agrees with the seller with the lowest marginal cost and only the most efficient order of agreement is an equilibrium outcome. When goods are complements, both equilibrium quantities are lower than the efficient levels.","[Westermark, Andreas] Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Bjornerstedt, Jonas] Swedish Competit Author, S-10385 Stockholm, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Westermark, A (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, POB 513, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden.",jonas.bjornerstedt@kkv.se; andreas.westermark@nek.uu.se,"Westermark, Andreas/GYQ-8306-2022",,,,,,17,4,4,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Financial stability could be affected by households' behavior under stressful macroeconomic conditions. Households' financial vulnerability depends on their indebtedness levels and on the fragility of their income sources to be able to fulfill their obligations. The main source of households' uncertainty comes from labor income generation, which is critically determined by unemployment. Heterogeneity of indebtedness levels and of income uncertainty calls for microeconomic analysis. This paper uses panel data survival analysis to estimate the probability of job loss at the individual level. Using semi-parametric methods, a significant heterogeneity is found for the impact of aggregate unemployment among individuals. Monte Carlo simulations are run to assess households financial stress and then to estimate aggregate debt at risk under high unemployment rate scenarios. Since the majority of debt is held by those with lower levels of income vulnerability, it is found that financial stability is not significantly affected by high unemployment levels.","[Fuenzalida C, Marcelo] Banco Cent Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Fuenzalida C, Marcelo] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Ruiz-Tagle, Jaime, V] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Ctr Microdatos, Santiago, Chile",Columbia University; Universidad de Chile,"Fuenzalida, M (通讯作者)，Banco Cent Chile, Santiago, Chile.",mef2159@columbia.edu; jaimert@econ.uchile.cl,,,,,,,11,4,5,1,19,BANCO CENTRAL CHILE,SANTIAGO,"MORANDE 115 2ND PISO, AUGUSTINAS 1180, SANTIAGO, 6500-590, CHILE",0717-3830,,,ECON CHIL,Econ.

Using data from one such study we conduct an experiment where our experienced subjects observe early rounds of strategy choices from that study and are given monetary incentives to report forecasts of choices in later rounds. We elicit beliefs using three different scoring rules: linear, logarithmic, and quadratic. We compare forecasts across the scoring rules and compare the forecasts of our trained observers to forecasts of the actual players in the original experiment. We find significant differences across scoring rules. The improper linear scoring rule produces forecasts closer to 0 and I than the proper rules, and these forecasts are poorly calibrated. The two proper scoring rules induce significantly different distributions of forecasts. We find that forecasts by observers under both proper scoring rules are significantly different from the forecasts of the actual players. in terms of accuracy, calibration, and the distribution of forecasts.

In this paper we develop an endogenous growth model of entrepreneurship that is able to account for the difference in long-run performance between centrally planned economies and market-oriented ones. Long-run growth rates of output and productivity are determined by the growth of the stock of managerial knowledge, which in turn depends on the share of the population involved in entrepreneurial activities and on the time that spent on those activities. We analyze the effect of two characteristics of centrally planned economies on their growth performance. First, in centrally planned economies factors of production are distributed by the central planner to the firms' managers through a contest that uses up some of the managers' productive effort. Second, the leadership is egalitarian, in the sense that it treats individuals with different abilities equally. We show that these two features reduce the fraction of people becoming entrepreneurs/managers, as well as their managerial effort, which in turn reduces long-run output and TFP growth. Furthermore, we find that centrally planned economies have lower income inequality and slightly higher capital-output ratios, which is consistent with these countries' experiences.

Workers in the economy are heterogeneous in their intrinsic motivation to work in the sector. In line with empirical findings, our model implies that firms in the competitive market reach higher productivity and employ less workers than the public firm. Allocative efficiency therefore increases. Nevertheless, prices of the sectors output rise as competition between private firms for the best motivated workers leads to higher wage cost than under the public monopsony. Political support for liberalization may therefore be limited.","[Delfgaauw, Josse; Dur, Robert] Erasmus Univ, Dept Econ, Tinbergen Inst, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Tinbergen Institute,"Delfgaauw, J (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Dept Econ, Tinbergen Inst, POB 1738, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",delfgaauw@few.eur.nl; dur@few.eur.nl,"Dur, Robert/J-4142-2012","Dur, Robert/0000-0001-9081-4179; Delfgaauw, Josse/0000-0002-8450-7989",,,,,46,14,14,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The standard view-that sovereign default entails exclusion from markets-was often contradicted by reality: in some cases lending ceased, but in others it continued. This paper claims that lenders' responses to default stem from the additional knowledge about borrowers that is acquired during default episodes. Lending is modelled in a costly-state-verification environment where sovereigns have private information about their investment projects (good or bad). After default, lenders audit projects and interrupt lending only if the project is believed to be a 'bad' one.","Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Solé, J (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",,,,,,,,13,1,2,0,6,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0427,,,ECONOMICA,Economica,JUL,2009,76.0,303,,,,,557,573,,10.1111/j.1468-0335.2008.00690.x,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,457IV,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000266922600007,0

We distinguish between average and differential status effects, and point out the difference in the effects on growth and equality between these two classes. Within the differential effects class, any rise in gains from and decrease in pains from the lack of status from either consumption and/or job quality would decrease mean hours in education, growth, and increase inequality.","[Tournemaine, Frederic] Univ Thai Chamber Commerce, Univ Chicago UTCC Res Ctr, Sch Econ, Bangkok 10400, Thailand; [Tsoukis, Christopher] London Metropolitan Univ, London Metropolitan Business Sch, Econ Sect, London EC2M 6SQ, England",University Thai Chamber Commerce; London Metropolitan University,"Tournemaine, F (通讯作者)，Univ Thai Chamber Commerce, Univ Chicago UTCC Res Ctr, Sch Econ, 126-1 Vibhavadee Rangsit Rd, Bangkok 10400, Thailand.",frederic.tournemaine@uc-utcc.org; c.tsoukis@londonmet.ac.uk,"Tournemaine, Frederic/D-4728-2009",,,,,,41,5,5,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

For this purpose, we estimate the growth and inequality elasticities of poverty using 1,132 income distributions, and 15 rival assumptions on the shape of the income distributions. Our results confirm that the lognormal distribution is not appropriate in most cases for the analysis of poverty: the magnitude of the elasticities is generally overestimated and the estimation of the relative impact of growth and redistribution on poverty alleviation is biased in favor of the growth objective.","Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, CEMAFI, Fac Droit, Sc Pol Eco & Gest, F-06050 Nice 1, France",Universite Cote d'Azur,"Bresson, F (通讯作者)，Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, CEMAFI, Fac Droit, Sc Pol Eco & Gest, Av Doyen Trotabas, F-06050 Nice 1, France.",florent.bresson@unice.fr,,,,,,,72,15,16,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Investors derive direct utility from both consumption and financial wealth and, consistent with the happiness maintenance feature documented by Isen (1999) and others, become more cautious toward their wealth in good times. Mild pro-cyclical changes in risk aversion over wealth cause large pro-cyclical fluctuations in the current price-dividend ratio which, due to general equilibrium restrictions, translate into counter-cyclical variation in the current consumption-wealth ratio and. in turn, in expected future returns. With a realistic consumption growth process and reasonable preference parameters, the model generates a sizable equity premium, a low and stable risk-free rate, volatile and predictable stock returns, and price-dividend and Sharpe ratios in line with the data.

We examine how changes in more than 22 minimum wages over 1990-2004 affect employment, unemployment and average wages of workers in different sectors, defined by coverage under the legislation. The evidence suggests that minimum wages are effectively enforced only in medium and large-scale firms, where a 1% increase in the minimum wage leads to an increase of 0.29% in the average wage and a relatively large reduction in employment of -0.46%. We find that public sector wages emulate minimum wage trends but the higher cost of labor does not reduce employment there. There are no discernable effects of minimum wages on the wages of workers in small-firms or the self-employed; yet, higher minimum wages may create more unemployment. We conclude that (even under our upper bound estimate of the effect on the wages of workers) the total earnings of workers in the large-firm covered sector fall with higher minimum wages in Honduras, which warrants a policy dialogue on the structure and level of minimum wages.

Firms' internationalization mode depends on cost and strategic considerations.

In our sample price convergence is 40 percent faster in the European Union than in an appropriately defined control group. 30 percent of this effect can be attributed to the fact that a higher share of firms with a low propensity to price discriminate serve European markets.

At the center of this work is an effort to develop perennial poly-culture as an alternative to industrial agriculture. The latter dominant model of food and fiber production is shown to involve severe problems in terms of short-run ecological costs and long-run sustainability. It is also argued that the perennial poly-culture model has much to recommend it to radical economists as a corrective to capitalist inefficiency. Finally, notwithstanding Jackson's facile criticism of Marx, it is argued that Marx's own writing actually anticipates Jackson's agro-ecological critique of capitalism.","Indiana State Univ, Dept Econ, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA",Indiana State University,"Richards, DG (通讯作者)，Indiana State Univ, Dept Econ, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA.",drichards@isugw.indstate.edu,,,,,,,17,2,2,0,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

S. output growth from a production perspective. At the aggregate level, increased output stability reflects decreased volatility in both labor productivity growth and hours growth, as well as a significant decline in the covariance. The decline in output volatility can also be traced to less volatile labor input and total factor productivity growth and the smaller covariance between them. At the industry level, the decline in volatility appears widespread, with about 80% of component industries showing smaller contributions to aggregate output volatility after 1984, although most of the aggregate decline reflects smaller covariances between industries. There is also strong evidence of a decline in the correlation between hours and labor productivity growth across industries. The paper concludes with a discussion of potential explanations.

We find that the income share of the rural population at the low end of the income scale has been shrinking, income inequality in rural China has increased over time and that income inequality has impeded attempts to reduce poverty.

Two alternative policy instruments (emission taxes and command-and-control regulations) are considered. A tougher emission policy in the home country enhances the foreign firm's competitiveness because of the static rent-shifting effect. The foreign country also enjoys a future improvement of the global environmental quality by free riding on the home country's emission reduction effort. Because of these strategic effects, the levels of environmental policy determined in the noncooperative policy game are distorted away from the socially optimal level. Moreover, the emission tax game produces a more distortionary outcome than that in the command-and-control game; it generates more pollution and lower welfare.","Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Int Cultural Studies, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808576, Japan",Tohoku University,"Yanase, A (通讯作者)，Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Int Cultural Studies, Aoba Ku, 41 Kawauchi, Sendai, Miyagi 9808576, Japan.",yanase@intcul.tohoku.ac.jp,,,,,,,28,22,27,1,25,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,,,J ECON,J.

This paper reconsiders this basic proposition in an expanding variety endogenous growth model with competitive markets for old innovative products and for a traditional good. We shed light on some implications of monopolistic distortions which tend to be ignored by standard models. First, no growth may be better than some growth, since modest positive growth potentially requires sizeable static welfare losses. Second, the economy may converge to a steady state with zero growth, even though a locally saddle-point stable steady state with positive growth exists if the initial share of cheap competitive markets is sufficiently high, as this implies a relatively low demand for expensive innovative goods. Third, such a no-growth trap may happen in a world economy made up of several countries engaged in free trade with each other. The policy implications are that growth-enhancing policies may be misguided and that quick deregulation as well as quick trade liberalization can lead to stagnation in the long term.","[Arnold, Lutz G.; Bauer, Christian] Univ Regensburg, Dept Econ, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany; [Bauer, Christian] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Econ, D-80539 Munich, Germany",University of Regensburg; University of Munich,"Arnold, LG (通讯作者)，Univ Regensburg, Dept Econ, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany.",lutz.arnold@wiwi.uni-r.de; christian.bauer@lrz.uni-muenchen.de,,,,,,,38,3,3,0,12,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

In this paper, we introduce efficient descending auctions for two environments: multiple nonidentical items and buyers with unit-demand valuations; and multiple identical items and buyers with non-increasing marginal values. Our auctions are designed using the notion of universal competitive equilibrium (UCE) prices and they terminate with UCE prices, from which the Vickrey payments can be determined. For the unit-demand setting, our auction maintains linear and anonymous prices. For the homogeneous items setting, our auction maintains a single price and adopts Ausubel's notion of clinching to compute the final payments dynamically. The auctions support truthful bidding in an ex post Nash equilibrium and terminate with an efficient allocation. In simulation, we illustrate the speed and elicitation advantages of these auctions over their ascending price counterparts. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

It finds that education is important for economic growth but it is not a sufficient condition. The complementarity between education and other factors in enhancing productivity and efficiency is commonly seen as the driving force of economic growth. However, the empirical evidence is ambiguous due to econometric problems. Statistical analysis suggests that education and economic growth in East Asia have two-way causality. Nevertheless, valuing education has been a widely-accepted part of Asian values. As a result, education consistently presents as a significant income determinant and consequentially a growth factor, regardless of whether education can increase productivity. East Asian education systems are also formed and extended in close relation to the stages of their economic development: the higher the level of economic development, the greater the demand for better and higher education systems.","Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Permani, R (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",Risti.Permani@adelaide.edu.au,,"Permani, Risti/0000-0003-4762-3224",,,,,94,13,17,1,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

It is posited that the consumption of the performing arts is a time-intensive activity for which both a theatre ticket and leisure time are necessary. Thus, the impacts of 'full-income' ('leisure time income' added to disposable income) and the price of leisure time on theatre attendance are examined. The findings indicate that the demand for the performing arts is own-price inelastic. The disposable income elasticity is significant, positive and equals approximately one. In contrast, the full-income elasticity is well above one and greater than usual income elasticity indicating that the performing arts are a luxury good when leisure time income is included in the consumer's budget. The positive full-income effect is, however, offset by the negative price of leisure effect indicating that leisure time is a complement for the performing arts. Additionally, three objective quality characteristics of theatrical productions which can positively influence theatre demand are examined.","Trinity Coll Dublin, Coll Green, Dept Econ, Dublin 2, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Zieba, M (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Coll Green, Dept Econ, Dublin 2, Ireland.",ziebam@tcd.ie,"Zieba, Marta/JAZ-0878-2023; Escarabajal, Juan Antonio/C-5644-2012; Zieba, Marta/A-8283-2018","Zieba, Marta/0000-0002-9116-2413",,,,,33,51,56,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

This endogeneity has often been neglected in studies on child care choice, even though the decision to use child care outside the home is strongly connected to mothers decision to work after childbirth and vice versa. Based on the German Socio-economic Panel (SOEP) from 1989 to 2006 we show that children living in West Germany have a higher probability to attend institutional care if their mothers increase their actual weekly working time.

Since part-time work features most prominently when women are in their 30s, the peak childcare years and a crucial period for career building, its impact on subsequent earnings trajectories is important from a social as well as individual perspective. We find that part-time work experience gives a very low return in future earnings, particularly when acquired in lower-skill jobs. In addition, one-quarter of women in high-skill jobs downgrade occupationally on switching to part-time work, rising to 43% among those who also change employer. In combination these effects give an immediate earnings drop of 32%, followed by a permanently lower trajectory. It is these accompanying changes, rather than part-time status itself, which damage earnings. Return to full-time work, even with reversal of the occupational downgrading, brings only a partial recovery; without it the earnings losses continue to grow.","[Connolly, Sara] Univ E Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Gregory, Mary] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",University of East Anglia; University of Oxford,"Connolly, S (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",mary.gregory@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,22,46,48,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Although indexed bonds provide a hedge to income fluctuations and can thereby mitigate the effects of financial frictions, they introduce interest rate fluctuations. Because of this tradeoff, there exists a nonmonotonic relation between the degree of indexation (i.e., the percentage of the shock reflected in the return) and the benefits that these bonds introduce. When the nonindexed bond market is shut down and only indexed bonds are available, indexation strengthens the precautionary savings motive, increases consumption volatility and deepens the impact of Sudden Stops for degrees of indexation higher than a certain threshold. When the nonindexed bond market is retained, nonmonotonic relationship between the degree of indexation and the benefits of indexed bonds still remain. Degrees of indexation higher than a certain threshold lead to more volatile consumption than lower degrees of indexation. The threshold degree of indexation depends on the volatility and persistence of income shocks as well as oil the relative openness of the economy.

The paper shows how such a trend can be easily rationalized by a model that extends a standard signalling game in two directions. First, a temporal structure is induced by having two different cohorts of individuals playing the game. Second, to standard rational agents, the model postulates the existence of two classes of agents that care about their relative position in the distribution of educational choices. Conformist individuals wish to be close to the average level; status seeking individuals seek to be above it. Results show that the presence of these two classes of individuals generates an average level of education that changes and increases over time for a wide range of choice of parameters. Consequences of this increasing level of education on the behaviour of the firms are also explored.","[Gallice, Andrea] Coll Carlo Alberto, BRICK, I-10024 Moncalieri, Italy; [Gallice, Andrea] Univ Siena, I-53100 Siena, Italy",Collegio Carlo Alberto; University of Siena,"Gallice, A (通讯作者)，Coll Carlo Alberto, BRICK, Via Real Collegio 30, I-10024 Moncalieri, Italy.",andrea.gallice@brick.carloalberto.org,"Gallice, Andrea/AAF-6465-2020","Gallice, Andrea/0000-0003-0250-9508",,,,,30,5,5,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

We find no effect of either paper on political knowledge, stated opinions, or turnout in post-election survey and voter data. However, receiving either paper led to more support for the Democratic candidate, suggesting that media slant mattered less in this case than media exposure.

The reform considered shows that it is possible to improve the efficiency of employment protection policies without affecting the extent of worker protection on the labor market.

This suggests that countries may impose tariffs on imported goods and seek to remove the import tariffs in other countries (unilateral protectionism) in order to foster industrial activity.

The average treatment effect of the exemption is found to decrease sickness absence by more than 13% at those establishments that were treated relative to those that were not and this was due to a behavioral, rather than a compositional, effect.

With access to public use and restricted-access internal CPS data, and by applying bounding methods, we show that using P90/P10 does not completely obviate time-inconsistency problems, especially in capturing household income inequality trends. Using internal data, we create consistent cell mean values for all top-coded public use values that, when used with public use data, closely track inequality trends in earnings and household income using internal data. But estimates of longer-term inequality trends with these corrected data based on P90/P10 differ from those based on the Gini coefficient.

To what extent can models estimated on modern data be used to account for growth patterns in the past? Can information on historical patterns help to improve long-term forecasting of economic growth? We consider a reduced-form statistical model based on the demographic dividend literature. Assuming that there is a common DGP guiding growth through the demographic transition, we use an estimate from post-war global data to backcast the Swedish historical GDP growth. The results indicate that the assumption of a common DGP can be warranted, at least back to 1870. Given the stability of the relationship between population and growth, we use the model to forecast income for the next 50 years. We compare our approach to a previous attempt to simulate the long-term Swedish growth path with an endogenous growth model. Encompassing tests show that each of the models contains independent information on the Swedish growth path, suggesting that there is a benefit from combining them for long-term forecasting.

The author casts some doubts concerning the exceptionality of the 20th century as experiencing 'growth in the era of knowledge based progress', using new quantitative evidence on the TFP growth on the period 18552005, stressing the importance of a proper periodization as well as correcting for biases in earlier assessments by various authors. He shows that the actual TFP growth was rather strong from the 1970s to the first decade of the 20th century, while it was quite low during long periods of the 20th century ( 1906 1919, 1941 - 1948; 1973 1989). Field tried to explain this stylized fact using more conventional historical evidence (impact of technological innovation; rise of the Modern Business Enterprise - the latter being favoured by the development of communication technologies). We put forward some methodological discussion concerning the proper meaning of TFP (productivity growth is not the same as technological change) as well as putting the results in a more theoretical perspective (determinants of the periods of high TFP growth). We also stress some elements of a more historical nature not stressed by the author as the role of the State (protectionism, migration policy. R&D...), and more particularly the emergence of the Modern American University during the last three decades of the 19th century. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

These were characterized both by a huge disruption of economic activity and an extreme speed of diffusion within countries. The financial turmoil happened in a period of very high degree of international financial integration. As a result financial liberalization was associated with greater incidence of crises and this brought an intense debate in both academic and policy circles about the consequences of free capital movements. In this paper we aim to check the existence and the strength of credit channel and balance sheet effects in countries characterized by an intermediate level of financial development. A huge literature exists about the topic concerning the role that credit market and financial development play on the real activity. The paper empirically examines the dynamic relationship between financial development and economic growth. A time-series approach using the VAR Model has been used to provide an assessment of empirical evidence on the effects of financial development on macroeconomic volatility. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The case of Austria illustrates the related issues. This case it not representative for the EU at large, a similar result can he expected for a few other EU countries, e.g. Germany.

It departs from the literature by removing restrictions on asset holdings, and finds that optimal positions depend significantly and naturally on liquidity: When expected future liquidity is high, agents take more extreme positions, given that they do not have to hold those positions for long when they become undesirable. Consequently, larger trades should be observed in markets with more frequent trading. Liquidity need not affect the price significantly, however, because liquidity has offsetting impacts on different agents' demands. This result highlights the importance of unrestricted portfolio choice. The paper draws parallels with the transaction-cost literature and clarifies the relationship between the price level and the realized trading frequency in this literature.

We show that pervasive imperfect agency means that they are also inefficient. Imperfect agency (due to unobservable medical effort) is a recognized market failure in health care, but its impact is difficult to measure. We take an indirect approach to estimation and infer the cost of unobservable effort from the behavior of utility-maximizing patients, specifically their willingness to incur measurable costs to avoid practitioners who shirk. We use a unique data set from rural Cameroun where patients choose between the government health system, church-operated (mission) health facilities and, importantly, traditional healers. Traditional healers provide health services on an outcome-contingent basis where patients pay only if they are cured. Both government and mission facilities, in contrast, are paid on a fee-for-service basis. Patients' choices of practitioners, combined with quantitative information about patients' illnesses, permit a structural estimation of the value of unobservable medical effort. The results allow investigation into the nature of agency, its costs, and the manner in which contracts reduce and patient behavior mitigates those costs. We estimate that in the absence of imperfect agency, utility from health care would increase by at least 160%. Even in the face of imperfect agency, the sophistication of patients in choosing between existing contracts for different illnesses increases utility by up to 20%. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Only 14 estimates of the total damage cost of climate change have been published, a research effort that is in sharp contrast to the urgency of the public debate and the proposed expenditure on greenhouse gas emission reduction. These estimates show that climate change initially improves economic welfare. However, these benefits are sunk. Impacts would be predominantly negative later in the century. Global average impacts would be comparable to the welfare loss of a few percent of income, but substantially higher in poor countries. Still, the impact of climate change over a century is comparable to economic growth over a few years. There are over 200 estimates of the marginal damage cost of carbon dioxide emissions. The uncertainty about the social cost of carbon is large and right-skewed. For a standard discount rate, the expected value is $50/tC, which is much lower than the price of carbon in the European Union but much higher than the price of carbon elsewhere. Current estimates of the damage costs of climate change are incomplete, with positive and negative biases. Most important among the missing impacts are the indirect effects of climate change on economic development; large-scale biodiversity loss; low-probability, high-impact scenarios; the impact of climate change on violent conflict; and the impacts of climate change beyond 2100. From a welfare perspective, the impact of climate change is problematic because population is endogenous, and because policy analyses should separate impatience, risk aversion, and inequity aversion between and within countries.","[Tol, Richard S.

Simulating the volume and direction of hazardous waste trade in the absence of distance costs, leads to a 153% increase in waste traded, and a larger increase in shipments from non-OECD countries to OECD members than from the OECD to nonmembers.","Univ Victoria, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada",University of Victoria,"Baggs, J (通讯作者)，Univ Victoria, POB 1700 STN CSC, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada.",jenbaggs@uvic.ca,,,,,,,28,49,58,0,34,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

It is clear that during this period, the repeated nature of the daily auction, between a small number of generators, with a substantial amount of information in common, gave rise to a continuous evolution of learning and gaming in practice with no evidence of convergence to a stationary Nash Solution. In terms of representing reality, a computational approach inspired by evolutionary economics, can succeed in reflecting well the type of behaviour observed, to an extent that cannot be matched by alternative analytical models. Cycles of pricing appear in the model, apparently as they seem to do in practice, yet average behaviour has been validated against the theoretical supply function results for the more stylised circumstances where analytical results are possible. The paper therefore makes a methodological contribution in the development of a model of competitive electricity markets inspired by computational learning and gaming. It also makes an applied contribution by providing a more realistic basis for identifying whether high market prices can be ascribed to problems of market structure or market conduct.

A monopolist sells an information good at a non-linear price in two versions designed for two types of consumers with different willingness to pay. Consumers with low willingness to pay consumers can copy the good at some cost and with some quality loss. High valuation customers cannot engage in full-fledged piracy. However, they can consume the version designed for the other customer type. We show that copying or piracy may be welfare enhancing because it enables a good to be provided to individuals with a low willingness to pay without undermining the producing firm's ability to finance the development cost via the pricing scheme applied to high valuation consumers. There are then three levels of piracy control. The highest is that chosen by the private monopoly. The next level is the one chosen by a welfare-maximizing monopoly. The lowest level, which can be zero, is the level of control chosen by the public authority when the good is sold (and priced) by a profit-maximizing monopoly. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

(2003), is employed to investigate the changing pattern of US textile trade. We use US Bilateral Manufacturing Imports and Exports data for 1989 2001 to assess the impact of labor wages, tariffs, and exchange rates on the composition of US textile imports before and after the creation of NAFTA. The analysis is performed at the SIC two-digit industry level and the more disaggregated four-digit sector level. We find little evidence of trade diversion in textiles frequently attributed to NAFTA, while trade creation is clearly present. Furthermore, lower wages in some textile-exporting countries (e.g. countries in Asia) do not appear to significantly increase these countries' shares of US textile imports at the expense of other trading partners.

This bidding behavior makes them more susceptible to losses affecting their prospect of survival. In April of 2000, the Oklahoma Department of Transportation started releasing the internal cost estimates to complete highway construction projects. Using newly developed quantile regression approaches, this paper examines the impact of the policy change on aggressive entrants. First, we find that the information release eliminates the bidding differential between entrants and incumbents attributed to informational asymmetries. Second, we argue that the policy change affects the prospects of survival of entrants in the market. We find that those who used to exit the market relatively soon are now staying 37% longer, while at the median level bidding duration increased by roughly 68%. The policy has the potential to encourage entry in government procurement auctions and thus increase competition. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Our analysis is based on a model that captures human capital formation, credit market constraints and tax avoidance activities. We characterize how decreasing migration costs for skilled workers shape the time-consistent policies of a government that wants to shift resources from skilled to unskilled workers. Starting from a closed economy, declining migration costs first increase net incomes of both skilled and unskilled workers, and then decrease net incomes of all households. There is a conflict of interest only for very low migration costs. In this case, skilled workers start to benefit from a further rise in their mobility, but now at the expense of the unskilled labor force.","[Janeba, Eckhard] Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; [Haupt, Alexander] Univ Plymouth, Plymouth Business Sch, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",University of Mannheim; University of Plymouth,"Janeba, E (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, L7,3-5, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",alexander.haupt@plymouth.ac.uk; janeba@uni-mannheim.de,,,,,,,27,14,19,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

We study three aspects of globalization: reductions in the resource-requirement in outsourcing-targeted R&D, increased subsidies to outsourced production, and reduced Southern imitation due to TRIPs. Each event boosts outsourcing-targeted R&D and increases the frequency of iPod cycles.

Officers commit errors in policing and, since reducing the error rate is costly, they cut down policing to avoid complaints. This paper tests the hypothesis that oversight reduces policing by exploiting a quasi-experiment: In April 2001, a riot erupted in Cincinnati after a white officer shot dead an unarmed African-American adolescent; the sharply increased media attention, a Justice Department investigation, together with a racial profiling lawsuit, exogenously raised the expected penalty of an officer's errors. Compared with the period from January 1999 to March 2001, arrests during the remaining months of 2001 fell substantially. The decline was more significant for offenses where the error rate was higher. Communities with a greater percentage of African-Americans experienced greater arrest reductions.

The paper demonstrates that there are information gains to this approach. The well-known conflict database of the International Peace Research Institute is compared with the database of the Center for Systemic Peace, which includes data on the number of deaths in addition to length of conflict. The number and distribution of conflicts vary; however, duration analysis based on the conventional measure of duration yields results that are robust over the above-mentioned datasets. We also show that the number of deaths, as a measure of duration, challenges some of the results based on the number of years as a measure of duration. In the 1990s, the duration of conflicts is significantly different from before when the duration measure is the number of years - we do not find a statistically significant distinction when the number of deaths is used. Ethnic conflicts have a longer survival time in terms of time but not in terms of number of fatalities.","[Akdede, Sacit Hadi] Adnan Menderes Univ, Nazilli IIBF, Nazilli, Aydin, Turkey; [Ogus, Ayla] Izmir Univ Econ, Dept Econ, Izmir, Turkey",Adnan Menderes University; Izmir Ekonomi Universitesi,"Akdede, SH (通讯作者)，Adnan Menderes Univ, Nazilli IIBF, Sumer Kampusu, Nazilli, Aydin, Turkey.",shakdede@adu.edu.tr,"binatli, ayla ogus/AAD-1794-2019; akdede, sacit hadi/AAX-3024-2021","binatli, ayla ogus/0000-0002-8291-0010;",,,,,22,0,0,0,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

When the second derivative of the flow payoff function is bounded, the value function is proportional to a linear function plus geometric term. A specific formula for the exponent of this geometric term is provided. This exponent continuously falls in the rate of patience. If the state variable is a martingale, the second derivative of the value function is unbounded. If the state variable is instead a strict local submartingale, then the same holds for the first derivative of the value function. Thus, the proposed approximation is more accurate than Taylor series approximation. The approximation result is used to characterize locally optimal policies in several fundamental economic problems.","Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University,"Anderson, A (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",aza@georgetown.edu,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,2,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

My computation results and analysis show that even in a finite sample case the nonparametric version is very robust to the variable bandwidth, which is relatively smaller than the optimal bandwidth policy. This statistic characteristics enables the proposed nonparametric estimator to be put widely and conveniently into practical use, without applied researcher's necessity to pay too much attention to the precise value of optimal bandwidth.","SUNY Buffalo, Dept Econ, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"Aoki, T (通讯作者)，SUNY Buffalo, Dept Econ, 415 Fronczak Hall,North Campus, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",taoki@acsu.buffalo.edu,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Thus, we provide a new equilibrium existence result for asymmetrical double auctions and a small number of bidders. The generality of our setting requires the use of special tie-breaking rules. We present an example of a double auction with interdependent values where all equilibria are trivial, that is, they have zero probability of trade.

These actions, however, will not be sufficient to control global warming, unless developing countries also get involved in the cooperative effort to reduce GHG emissions. The paper investigates the best short-term strategies that emerging economies can adopt in reacting to OECD countries' mitigation effort, given the common long-term goal to prevent excessive warming without hampering economic growth. Results indicate that developing countries would incur substantial economic losses by following a myopic strategy that disregards climate in the short-run, and that their optimal investment behaviour is to anticipate the implementation of a climate policy by roughly 10 years. investing in innovation ahead of time is also found to be advantageous. The degree of policy anticipation is shown to be important in determining the financial transfers of an international carbon market meant to provide incentives for the participation of developing countries. This is especially relevant for China, whose recent and foreseeable trends of investments in innovation are consistent with the adoption of domestic emission reduction obligations in 2030.

We adopt a two-stage approach, the Super-SBM and logistic regression, to investigate a bank efficiency index and the bank bankruptcy effect from incorporating capital adequacy regulations and a supervisory review process. This study uses data on 36 Taiwanese commercial banks for the 3-year period from 2002 to 2004. This article's empirical results from the Super-SBM and logistic regression approach are summarized as follows: (1) The efficiency factor is proven to be influential in evaluating bank bankruptcy. (2) If certain prerequisites on capital adequacy are imposed on each bank, then it results in a lower risk to the bank and this reduces bank bankruptcy.

As the objectives, for this the concept Of sustainability indicators and indices is analyzed. Then the analysis of the concept of sustainable development is given. After this the analysis of the methodological principles of sustainability indicators and indices development is provided. The methods of systematic scientific literature analysis, general and logical analysis, comparison and generalization were used in the article. Sustainability assessment currently arises as comprehensive, integrated, and provident decision-making approach. Ignorance of sustainability turns our future into more risky one. Thus sustainability indicators and indices, which have to measure features and processes of human and environmental systems that should guarantee continuality and functionality, might be discussed. In order to manage sustainability, society has to formulate clear and measurable goals of sustainability that should be continuously revised and corrected The level, at which these goals are implemented, might be measured using sustainable development indicators, i.e. definable and measurable parameters, which show values and trends of development of ecologic, economic, and social stability of a particular region. Speaking about sustainability indicators, we should take into consideration the fact that any separate aggregated indicator does not foresee interchange among three main dimensions analysed in environmental economics: effectiveness, justice and sustainability. Perfect indicators are uncommon; therefore, their development in a general case involves methodological compromise among technical feasibility, public availability to use, and systemic consistency. The effectiveness of sustainability indicators can be characterised by three attributes: credibility, legitimacy, and salience. Sustainable development is a multi-dimensional issue involving huge amounts of complex information. There is some need to systematically reduce this information to a more concentrated form while constructing the pyramid of information aggregation, at the base of which are raw data and at the top there are indexes. The new primary classification suggested by Bell and Morse (2001) is based on who has set the indicators and how they have been set, with an additional dimension related to whether the sustainability indicator is quantitative or qualitative. When choosing particular sustainability indicators, following principles of sustainable development should be taken into account: a) social justice; b) local government, public participation, democracy; c) sustainable balance between local and imported resources consumption; d) use of local economic potential; e) environmental protection; f) protection of cultural heritage, protection and regeneration of a new environmental quality, increase in functionality and attraction of area and buildings maintained Economic effectiveness itself does not guarantee ecologic and social sustainability because economic indicators used do not reflect it.

If, instead, we adopt Lindbeck and Weibull's (1987) probabilistic voting model, the equilibrium tax schedule will be progressive as long as the political power of the rich voter is sufficiently low.

The application of this methodology to the data of the European Community Household Panel shows a significant discrepancy between these approaches, hence advocating for a complementary, rather than substitutable, use of these approaches and for further research oil the methods of measurement of multidimensional poverty.","[Fusco, Alessio] CEPS, INSTEAD, L-4501 Differdange, Luxembourg; [Fusco, Alessio] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, CEMAFI, Nice, France",Universite Cote d'Azur,"Fusco, A (通讯作者)，CEPS, INSTEAD, BP 48, L-4501 Differdange, Luxembourg.",alessio.fusco@ceps.lu,"Fusco, Alessio/A-5292-2019","Fusco, Alessio/0000-0002-4726-5108",,,,,59,0,0,0,224,DE BOECK UNIV,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

In an integrated market, the price of a tradable good at any location is determined by the national market, not local demand. Based on this, the strength of dependence of local prices on local demand is used to detect and measure market segmentation. The costs of a staples basket across almost all Russian regions with a monthly frequency are used as the empirical material. The pattern found suggests that over the time span under consideration the degree of Russia's goods market integration was relatively stable, fluctuating around some level; no significant improvements or deteriorations were detected.","[Gluschenko, Konstantin] Novosibirsk State Univ, Dept Econ, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia; [Gluschenko, Konstantin] Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, Inst Econ & Ind Engn, Novosibirsk, Russia",Novosibirsk State University; Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Economics & Industrial Engineering of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences,"Gluschenko, K (通讯作者)，Novosibirsk State Univ, Dept Econ, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia.",glu@nsu.ru,"Gluschenko, Konstantin/H-1138-2013","Gluschenko, Konstantin/0000-0003-1209-3809",,,,,17,4,5,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2009,21.0,2,,,,,125,142,PII 911728005,10.1080/14631370902778443,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,494DQ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000269790300001,0

The main objective is to analyse the causes of its backwardness and slow development. Low remuneration of farm work and the resultant low profitability are the largest problems of many farms. Several causes of the low profitability are evaluated. We show that all relevant causes are closely interrelated and that the extraordinarily high labour intensity has the largest impact. Subsequently, we analyse several causes of the extremely large share of agricultural employment in the Polish economy. Low skills of farm workers, the poor performance of the land market and the high level of subsidisation of the social security system for farmers (KRUS) are identified as the most important causes.

A common policy involves scaling the bids of preferred firms by a discount factor for the purposes of evaluation only. Introducing such an asymmetry has three effects: first, preferred firms may inflate their bids, yet still win the auction; second, nonpreferred firms may bid more aggressively than in the absence of preferences; third, the preference policy can affect participation. For different cost distributions, we solve numerically for the equilibrium bid functions under different discounts and then simulate behaviour, Our approach allows us to quantify the relative importance of the three effects. We find that the participation effect is relatively unimportant and, in most cases, a positive cost-minimizing preference rate exists. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Trade flows of livestock and beef products were nonexistent between Canada and the United States for many months in 2003 and 2004 suggesting market segmentation. This lack of trade in beef and livestock was due to livestock/beef import bans by both countries due to bovine spongiform encephalopathy. It was also determined that Canada's trade dependence in livestock and beef is cointegrated with Canadian and US livestock prices. However, as the trade dependence variable is shocked, the effects on Canadian and US prices are opposite although one would expect that in an integrated market the price responses to an exogenous shock would be similar or statistically identical. This result reinforces the case against the use of price cointegration analysis in determining presence (or absence) of market integration. Empirical results in this article raise some very difficult questions. Gains from trade are well documented. Yet, once a country becomes very trade dependent, the prices in it become much more vulnerable to exogenous shocks that reduce the trade flows.","N Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, Fargo, ND 58105 USA",North Dakota State University Fargo,"Miljkovic, D (通讯作者)，N Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, 221G Morrill Hall, Fargo, ND 58105 USA.",Dragan.Miljkovic@ndsu.edu,,,,,,,48,7,12,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We provide an empirical nonparametric analysis of farmers' profits under price changes over 12 years using an unbalanced panel of dairy farmers. Each year that a farm participated, we have quantities of milk and other outputs and usage of 30 different inputs. If that farmer participated in the survey the following year, the profit that farmer would have earned that following year using the netput vector of the previous year and the price vector of the following year was calculated. This passive profit was compared to the actual profit the farmer produced the following year. Of the 2371 observations, 56% show netput vector changes which enhanced net profit implying that as a group, these farmers were not generally able to correctly adjust inputs in response to price changes consistently.

By using a rich employeremployee panel data set for two manufacturing industries and one service industry, we focus on simultaneous variations in output, capital, materials, man hours, labour productivity, and the skill composition and hourly cost of labour. Investment spikes are followed by roughly proportional changes in sales, labour, and materials, and significant increases in capital intensity. The changes in labour productivity that are associated with the investment spikes are small, which indicates that productivity improvements are not related to instantaneous technological change through investment spikes. Focusing on sectoral differences, capital adjustments are found to be smoother in the service industry than in the two manufacturing industries which may be related to differences in labour intensities between the industries.","[Nilsen, Oivind A.] Norwegian Sch Econ & Business Adm, N-5045 Bergen, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Nilsen, OA (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ & Business Adm, Hellevn 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.",oivind.nilsen@nhh.no,,"Nilsen, Oivind A/0000-0001-8252-8586",,,,,31,22,23,1,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

A string of public health measures in Croatia is increasingly gaining in importance, particularly the ecological surveillance of various sectors of the environment, of which food is inevitably an element. The main objective of the various industries is to produce, process and distribute food which will meet the requirements of health and safety, through the joint efforts of all parties in the food chain. ISO and HACCP enable the continual, documented surveillance of food safety management. The most efficient systems of food safety are introduced, implemented and modernized within a structured management system, becoming incorporated into the overall management of the manufacturing organisation. This paper describes verification procedures for the HACCP system.

The lack of longitudinal data has forced the use of cross-section or pooled datasets in order to draw conclusions about that relationship. In the present note we highlight the lack of international comparability of surveys where the measures of inequality are based, and we show two main findings: (1) data comparability goes on constituting a problem, particularly in what respects to the different welfare indicators used in national surveys, and (2) the procedure usually used to minimize the problem of noncomparability is likely to enforce the bias rather than to solve it.","Univ Porto, Fac Econ, Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto,"Pessoa, A (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Fac Econ, Oporto, Portugal.",apessoa@fep.up.pt,"Pessoa, Argentino/B-6166-2009","Pessoa, Argentino/0000-0002-4859-1407",,,,,32,0,0,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

It is often argued that stock prices are determined by some fundamental macroeconomic variables. This implies that macroeconomic variables can influence investors' investment decisions and motivates many researchers to investigate the relationships between stock market prices and macroeconomic variables. Different authors select different macroeconomic variables seeking to detect their relationship with stock market prices in various countries. Simultaneously, a number of econometric techniques such as the arbitrage pricing theory, the impulse response function, the error variance decomposition analysis, the vector error correction model, the cointegration analysis, the Granger causality tests and others may be applied for checking. the existence of relationship between stock market prices and macroeconomic variables. The current paper attempts to present several classifications of macroeconomic variables, then to select macroeconomic variables for seeking their relationship with stock market prices, and, finally, to define what macroeconomic variables have positive and what macroeconomic variables have negative effects on stock market prices in Lithuania in the short run. Augmented Dickey Fuller test has been employed to check the stationarity of the selected time series since a spurious regression may occur if a time series is not stationary. The Impulse response function has been chosen to test the existence of the short-run relationship between stock market prices and macroeconomic variables. As the results of the Impulse response function are reliable only with a stationary time series the data has been turned into stationary after the second difference. The study embraces six macroeconomic variables (seasonally adjusted gross domestic product at previous year prices, harmonised consumer price index as compared to 2005, the narrow money supply, unemployment rate, short-term interest rates, and exchange rate of the Litas against the US dollar) and the main Lithuanian stock market index - the OMX Vilnius index. The data are monthly and extend from the January of 2000 to the June of 2009. In general, the results of the paper clearly indicate that macroeconomic variables are significant determinants for stock market prices in Lithuania. Gross domestic product and money supply have a positive effect on stock market prices while most of the time unemployment rate, exchange rate, and short-term interest rates negatively influence stock market prices. The findings of the paper are similar to the results of some other empirical studies. If harmonised consumer price index is considered, then it is the best example of an unstable relationship between a macroeconomic variable and stock market prices in Lithuania.","[Pilinkus, Donatas] Kaunas Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Accounting, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Pilinkus, D (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Accounting, Laisves Av 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",pilinkus@pitinkus.com; vytautas.boguslauskas@ktu.lt,,,,,,,65,18,22,1,20,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The analysis can be thought of as two-fold. First, we test the empirical validity of AK models following the logic by Jones (1995). For that purpose, we determine the degree of persistence of physical investment rates and growth by employing recently developed panel unit-root tests that enable us to make more reliable inferences about the existence of stochastic trends in the series. Second, we estimate the long-run effect of physical investment on growth by using panel data techniques rather than cross-section regressions.

This observation indicates the possible presence of adverse selection (death spiral), and provides an ideal situation for assessing informational asymmetry. Using bodily injury liability (BIL) insurance data from 46 Japanese prefectures over the period 1966 to 1975, this article tests two hypotheses of adverse selection: (i) high-risk drivers were more likely to join the BIL insurance market and (ii) sharp premium increases drove low-risk policyholders away. Various empirical analyses show that there is little evidence for either type of adverse selection. We also test whether a risk-misperception hypothesis can explain our results, and find some evidence that the population density have a significantly positive impact on the demand for BIL insurance.","Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Social Engn, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1528552, Japan",Tokyo Institute of Technology,"Saito, K (通讯作者)，Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Social Engn, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1528552, Japan.",ksaito@soc.titech.ac.jp,"Saito, Kuniyoshi/AAM-7800-2020","Saito, Kuniyoshi/0000-0002-2787-9540",,,,,30,2,2,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

New requirements are set to the employees as well. The understanding of the necessity to improve constantly, to raise the professional level becomes a very important trait of the employee along with the perfect professional knowledge. The professional must not only have new ideas, but also it is necessary to know and be able to use the experience of the organization, that is able to improve the work quality and productivity. The spreading of the telecommunication means such as internet allow creating a homogeneous global information storage system, that significantly raises the possibility of the information search and mastering. The penetration of informational and innovational technologies into all spheres of our lives, the usage of e-learning created preconditions to establish management systems. The recognition of the importance of intellectual resources in modern world proves the appearance of new management branches, concentrating attention to one subject-knowledge. The management of knowledge unites into one different part of any organization-processes, people, and technology. Knowledge is that basement on which the competitive advantages of the company are being built. According to B. Gates (2000), the knowledge management-is a very clever term to describe a very simple subject. You manage data, documents and the attempts of the employees. Your goal is to enrich the common work possibilities, including the exchange of thoughts, the usage of successful ideas and the coordination of actions towards the common goal. The management of knowledge must guarantee that the required knowledge will reach certain people at certain time, so that people can take certain actions. Informational society, now already knowledge society tries to learn how to use knowledge in order to achieve interests and manage the streams of information. High schools during the period of industrial society performed the role of preparation centers of the specialists for the economy. Informational society has changed the status of higher education schools. Knowledge society influenced the creation of new type schools -innovation schools. Nowadays a high school -is a center of science and innovations development, where nonstop learning, or life -long learning is taking place. In high schools the system of professional studies, professional change of qualification and qualification improvement system, orientated to the requirements of all the users is created: it can be an orientation to the country, region, business, and student. A modern high school must solve the tasks of their region and the country's economy tasks. That is why today it is necessary to speak about a new role of high schools in informational society, which requires a new attitude towards the management of knowledge and the system of knowledge management in higher educational institutions. Knowledge management becomes a part of higher education philosophy. Today this is one of the most promising and quickly developing tendencies, which raise the competitiveness of higher education in this specific market.","[Sedziuviene, Natalija; Vveinhardt, Jolita] Siauliai Coll, Fac Business & Technol, LT-76241 Shiauliai, Lithuania; [Vveinhardt, Jolita] Siauliai Coll, Dept Tourism Adm, LT-76241 Shiauliai, Lithuania; [Vveinhardt, Jolita] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Kaunas, Lithuania",Siauliai State College; Siauliai State College; Vytautas Magnus University,"Sedziuviene, N (通讯作者)，Siauliai Coll, Fac Business & Technol, LT-76241 Shiauliai, Lithuania.",jolitaw@gmail.com,"Vveinhardt, Jolita/AAB-6754-2020; Wang, Charles/B-5565-2011","Vveinhardt, Jolita/0000-0001-6231-9402; Wang, Charles/0000-0001-9331-8437",,,,,64,27,35,0,28,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In the model, adults decide whether to foster in or Out a child in conjunction with other household choices, e.g. own time allocation between market and non-market activities, children's amount of work, and schooling. By allowing for positive externalities from fostering, and thus asymmetric motives for fostering in (labor) and out (human capital), the proposed framework predicts that school-age children are sent to better-off households and that some families may foster in and Out simultaneously. The model identifies the conditions under which all actors involved, children included, may benefit from fostering arrangements, but also points to situations where fostering may become an opportunity to marginalize a Subset of children. The paper aims to provide a sound theoretical foundation that sheds light on why there exists mixed empirical evidence on the effects of fostering on children's well being, and cautions against demonizing non-parent residence as unequivocally detrimental to children.

In particular, we investigate a setting in which goods possess some hidden quality with known distribution, and the consumer chooses a bundle of goods that maximizes the probability that he receives some threshold level of this quality. We show that if the threshold is small relative to consumption levels, preferences will tend to be convex; whereas the opposite holds if the threshold is large. Our theory helps explain a broad spectrum of economic behavior (including, in particular, certain common commercial advertising strategies), suggesting that sensitivity to information about thresholds is deeply rooted in human psychology.","[Smith, Trenton G.] Washington State Univ, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Tasnadi, Attila] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Budapest, Hungary",Washington State University; Corvinus University Budapest,"Smith, TG (通讯作者)，Washington State Univ, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",trentsmith@wsu.edu; attila.tasnadi@uni-corvinus.hu,"Tasnadi, Attila/D-2373-2010; Smith, Trenton/B-5449-2008","Tasnadi, Attila/0000-0003-3252-4223; Smith, Trenton/0000-0001-6272-8871",,,,,29,2,2,0,7,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

Sociological and psychological knowledge allows to identify the family as a source of human bonds, man's happiness and life quality. It can be presumed that happy persons fulfill better their social roles and, for example, they work better and more effectively. Therefore, we have formulated a hypothesis: the family social capital family bonds - have an influence on economic growth. To put it more precisely: the bigger the number of divorces in relation to contracted marriages, the slower is the economic growth. This hypothesis has been confirmed for the Polish economy in the years 1967-2006. Due to disintegration of marriage and family bonds the average annual slow-down of economic growth reached 0.6 percentage point. It implied a slow-down of economic growth by about one-fifth. The estimation is based on the econometric model of GDP growth, in which alongside the family disintegration there are: growth of employment, investment rate and crime rate.","Uniwersytet Lodzki, Katedra Ekonometrii, Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Sztaudynger, JJ (通讯作者)，Uniwersytet Lodzki, Katedra Ekonometrii, Lodz, Poland.",sztaud@uni.lodz.pl,,,,,,,43,3,3,0,5,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2009,,2,,,,,189,210,,,,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,476TQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268469100002,0

This article explores the innovative reforms adopted by Zhejiang Province through land development rights (LDR) transfer within a locality and LDR trading across localities. We argue that there is a Zhejiang model of LDR transferring and trading, which, we believe, has significant implications not only for fostering an efficiency-enhancing market for land development rights and agricultural land preservation, but also for optimal use of land and a more balanced regional development. One important policy issue relating to China's rural land system is that under China's land requisition system, farmers are usually under compensated for urban land-taking.","[Wang, Hui; Tong, Juer] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Publ Adm, Dept Land Management, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Tao, Ran] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Chinese Academy of Sciences,"Tong, JE (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Coll Publ Adm, Dept Land Management, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",wanghuidn@zju.edu.cn; tao.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn; jertong@zju.edu.cn,"Tao, Ran/H-8122-2012; Wang, Hui/GVS-5250-2022",,,,,,7,46,49,5,59,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2009,17.0,1,,,,,66,82,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2009.01131.x,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,400PH,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000262880100004,0

The study focuses on 254 Korean IT SMEs that were either recipients of government R&D grants or their indirect beneficiaries during the two-year period between 2005 and 2007. The major findings of this study are as follows: First, unlike what has been suggested by previous studies, R&D intensity was not the only factor influencing the innovation performance of firms; learning and external networking also had a significant influence on innovation. The research implication of this finding is that the measurement of firms' performance should not be solely based on the intensity of R&D expenditures, but a broader set of factors including learning and external networking capabilities. Second, the technology commercialization capabilities of firms played the role of a mediator in the relationship between R&D and innovation performance. Within the innovation cycle of input (R&D capabilities), process (technology commercialization capabilities) and output (innovation performance), we found that R&D seldom influenced performance in a direct fashion, but its influence was most often mediated by technology commercialization capabilities. The practical implication of this finding for companies is that in order to improve performance, they must avoid narrowly focusing on R&D, but must invest also in capabilities to commercialize technologies resulting from R&D. Third, when direct and indirect beneficiaries of public R&D funding are compared together, the explanatory power of the relationship between R&D capabilities, technology commercialization capabilities and innovation performance was stronger among the latter than the former.","[Kim, Seo Kyun; Park, Beom Soo; Oh, Kyoung Seok] ETRI, Taejon 305700, South Korea; [Lee, Bong Gyou] Yonsei Univ, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Electronics & Telecommunications Research Institute - Korea (ETRI); Yonsei University,"Park, BS (通讯作者)，ETRI, 138 Gajeongno, Taejon 305700, South Korea.",sk-kim@etri.re.kr; bglee@yonsei.ac.kr; bspark@etri.re.kr; verdi@etri.re.kr,,,,,,,28,49,52,5,84,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

But price differences only emerge for sellers who have low eBay feedback scores in less competitive markets. Because the price differences dissipate as sellers accumulate credible reputations, the patterns in the data are indicative of statistical discrimination.

Rating changes and policy implications,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Rating stickiness; Migration policy; Friction model,MODEL; FRICTION; AGENCIES,The recent financial crisis manifested the criticism to rating agencies of being slow in adjusting their rating to current conditions. This paper examines the timeliness of rating changes and identifies factors which result in 'stickiness' of rating actions. Knowledge of the stickiness of rating agencies is a first step in designing a more appropriate rating system. Stickiness is characterized by not adjusting the rating even when a market-based estimate of default probability changes. Extending an econometric model of friction the migration policy is modelled in terms of thresholds which have to be crossed by default probability estimates before an up- or downgrade occurs. Default probability estimates have to change by two notches before the rating agency reacts. The timeliness differs across the rating spectrum and over the years. During periods with high defaults and for low credit quality firms agencies tend to rate more timely. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, simple economic intuition suggests that skilled majorities should welcome unskilled immigrants and protect skilled natives. This paper studies the voting over a selective policy in a two-country, three-factor model with skilled and unskilled labor, endogenous migration decisions, costly border enforcement and aversion to immigration. Results show that heterogeneity in capital distribution forces skilled voters to form a coalition with unskilled voters, who become pivotal. The voting outcome is therefore biased towards the preferences of the latter, and consists in a selective protectionism. Finally, immigration aversion helps to explain why skilled majorities do not bring down entry barriers against unskilled workers.","Univ Salerno, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Stat, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy",University of Salerno,"Russo, G (通讯作者)，Univ Salerno, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Stat, Via Ponte Don Melillo, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy.",grusso@unisa.it,,"RUSSO, Giuseppe/0000-0003-1646-9607",,,,,55,6,6,0,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

To smooth cyclical variations, 15-year overlapping periods are considered in the computation of Thirlwall's law, assuming that income elasticity of imports is either constant or variable over time. It is shown that actual growth can accurately be predicted by the ratio of export growth to the income elasticity of the demand for imports. Evidence also reveals that Portugal grew slightly faster than the rate consistent with the balance-of-payments equilibrium accumulating external deficits over time. Considering the pre- and postaccession periods to the European Union, it is found that Portugal grew at a slower rate in the latter period, explained by a higher income elasticity of imports and lower export growth.","[Soukiazis, Elias] Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, Coimbra, Portugal; [Soukiazis, Elias] GEMF, Coimbra, Portugal; [Antunes, Micaela] Univ Aveiro, Dept Econ Business & Ind Engn, P-3800 Aveiro, Portugal; [Antunes, Micaela] GEMF, Aveiro, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Aveiro,"Soukiazis, E (通讯作者)，Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, Coimbra, Portugal.",,"Antunes, Micaela/GQZ-8240-2022; Antunes, Micaela/A-8228-2013; Antunes, Micaela/AAD-8220-2020","Antunes, Micaela/0000-0002-2113-2139; Antunes, Micaela/0000-0002-2113-2139; Soukiazis, Elias/0000-0001-9265-0438",,,,,29,11,13,0,13,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0160-3477,,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

We address this issue by simulating the effects of additional education spending using an overlapping-generations model applied to Canada. In the context of population ageing, the results indicate that how the policy is funded has powerful impacts on the targeted outcomes. Higher education incentives may increase the rate of human capital accumulation and mitigate the negative effects of slowing labour force growth.

Even before submitting bids, competition among contractors may already have started. Given the nature of public work and expected strategies of rivals, some firms decide to enter the market, but others do not. Procurers can also enhance or limit the bidder participation through various ex ante qualification procedures for quality assurance purposes. Some applicants are qualified, but others are not. Thus, the selection process has two dimensions: bidders self-select, and an auctioneer may (dis) qualify some applicants. The paper explores this selection dynamics, using procurement data from road projects in developing countries. It shows that bidders are selecting themselves; low-cost firms are more prone to enter the market. But they are more likely to be rejected for technical reasons. Procurement design, such as contract size, and public governance are also found important determinants of the entry strategy of firms.","[Iimi, Atsushi] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Estache, Antonio] Univ Libre Bruxelles, European Ctr Adv Res Econ & Stat, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",The World Bank; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Iimi, A (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",aestache@ulb.ac.be; aiimi@worldbank.org,,,,,,,48,11,13,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

Using endogenously-determined break tests that allow for changes in both level and trend, we divide the price fluctuations in the international oil market after 2000 into three stages: Relatively calm market period (January 07, 2000, to March 12, 2004); the Bubble accumulation period (March 19, 2004, to June 06, 2008,); and the Global economic crisis period (June 13, 2008, to September 11, 2009). The results show the existence of structural breaks refutes the utility of investigation of the full sample period as a whole. And in different structural periods the main drivers of oil price changes and their way of influence and degree are significantly distinct. Then we demonstrate the evolving process of market mechanism since 2000. Through establishing comparative models, we also quantitatively measure the roles of speculation and episodic events in oil price fluctuations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Since the value of such inputs for the innovation performance of firms has been found to be considerable, it is not surprising that firms increasingly seek direct access to university knowledge. In particular, industry funding for university research has been increasing in most OECD countries. This development, however, spurred concerns regarding possible long-run effects on scientific output. While some policy makers argue that the potential of universities to foster and accelerate industrial innovations is not yet fully exploited, others are concerned with the distraction of academics from their actual research mission. Our results show for a sample of professors in science and engineering in Germany that a higher budget share from industry reduces publication output of professors both in terms of quantity and quality in subsequent years. This finding supports the skewing problem hypothesis for science and engineering faculty in Germany. If information sharing among scientists via publications is the basis for cumulative knowledge production and thus for scientific progress, industry funding that reduces publications may have detrimental effects on the development of science. On the other hand, we find that industry funding has a positive impact on the quality of applied research if measured by patent citations. Industry funding may thus have beneficial effects by improving impact and quality of more applied research. If industry funded research results in successfully patentable and industrially relevant technologies it may create economic as well as social value.","[Hottenrott, Hanna] Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Hottenrott, Hanna; Thorwarth, Susanne] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, D-68168 Mannheim, Germany; [Thorwarth, Susanne] Ctr R&D Monitoring, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Hottenrott, H (通讯作者)，Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",hanna.hottenrott@econ.kuleuven.be; susanne.thorwarth@econ.kuleuven.be,"Hottenrott, Hanna/H-4014-2018; Hottenrott, Hanna/AAE-7037-2021","Hottenrott, Hanna/0000-0002-1584-8106;",,,,,62,53,65,0,66,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0023-5962,,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,NOV,2011,64.0,4,,,,,534,555,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2011.00519.x,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,840RG,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000296457900004,0

We also evaluate the sensitivity of the results to the preferences assigned to each objective. We find that there is no unique optimal solution that fits the Federal Reserve behavior over the entire period.

J,"You, KF; Sarantis, N",,,,"You, Kefei; Sarantis, Nicholas",,,Structural Breaks and the Equilibrium Chinese Yuan/US Dollar Real Exchange Rate: A FEER Approach,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TESTS,"This paper examines the equilibrium Chinese yuan/US dollar (CNY/USD) real exchange rate within the framework of the fundamental equilibrium exchange rate (FEER) model. Endogenous structural breaks are allowed for in all cointegration relationships. Macroeconomic fundamentals that affect medium-term savings and investment and hence, the sustainable current account, are also highlighted. A unique set of quarterly data for the post-reform period (1982-2009) is constructed. This paper finds structural breaks in all trade and the sustainable current account equations. The misalignment rates show that the real exchange rate was overvalued in most years until 2003, followed by undervaluation during 2004-09. However, the average misalignment rates and revaluation required to correct this undervaluation are not as large as suggested by previous studies, with the undervaluation rate declining sharply in 2009. Further, misalignment rates are computed using a sustainable current account of 3%. The findings suggest such exogenous input leads to results biased towards larger undervaluation.","[You, Kefei] London Metropolitan Univ, London EC2M 6SQ, England; [Sarantis, Nicholas] City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, London EC1Y 8TZ, England",London Metropolitan University; City University London,"You, KF (通讯作者)，London Metropolitan Univ, 84 Moorgate, London EC2M 6SQ, England.",k.you@londonmet.ac.uk; n.sarantis@btinternet.com,"You, Kefei/GWQ-4728-2022",,,,,,28,10,11,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Methodologically, we consider investor expectations and compare risk-adjusted returns of stock portfolios comprising corporations that differ in this indicator for environmental performance. In this respect, we apply the flexible Carhart four-factor model in addition to the restricted one-factor model based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The main result of our portfolio analysis is that a trading strategy which consists of buying stocks of corporations disclosing responses to climate change and selling stocks of corporations with no disclosures has become more worthwhile over time in Europe. Furthermore, it can be shown that the relationship between disclosed corporate responses to climate change and stock performance has been positive for energy firms in the USA. One reason for these results could be the underlying stringency of institutional pressure with respect to global warming. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Although in a Bewley's model, ambiguity aversion always leads to less trade; in other models, this is not always true. However, we show that if the endowments are unambiguous, then more ambiguity aversion implies less trade for a very general class of preferences. The reduction in trade caused by ambiguity aversion can be as severe as to lead to no trade. In an economy with MEU decision makers, we show that if the aggregate endowment is unanimously unambiguous, then every Pareto optima allocation is also unambiguous. We also characterize the situation in which every unanimously unambiguous allocation is Pareto optimal. Finally, we show how our results can be used to explain the home-bias effect. As a useful result for our methods, we also obtain an additivity theorem for CEU and MEU decision makers that does not require comonotonicity.","[de Castro, Luciano I.] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Chateauneuf, Alain] Univ Paris 01, PSE CES, F-75231 Paris 05, France",Northwestern University; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"de Castro, LI (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",decastro.luciano@gmail.com; chateaun@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,50,29,30,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

For this purpose, we rule out re-election concerns and analyze whether the presence of a vote by itself matters for the exercise of power. We compare two kinds of electoral campaigns: self-descriptions of personality and promises regarding prospective in-office behavior. We find that social approval as conveyed by a vote does not suffice to induce pro-social choices by elected candidates. On the other hand, when campaigns are promise-based, elected candidates transfer more to their recipients than candidates selected by a random draw even though promises do not differ. This refutes explanations based on a taste for consistency or costs of lying. In contrast, the fact that the correlation between dictators' promises and their beliefs on voter expectations is considerably strengthened in the presence of a vote offers support to a guilt-aversion hypothesis. However, this support is qualified by the correlation between dictators' second-order beliefs and their choices, which is weaker than predicted. Overall, our results suggest the power of voting to limit the self-oriented exertion of power is limited and context specific.","[Geng, Hong] Univ Bonn, Lab Expt Econ, D-5300 Bonn, Germany; [Weiss, Arne Robert] Univ Erfurt, Ctr Empir Res Econ & Behav Sci, Erfurt, Germany; [Wolff, Irenaeus] Univ Konstanz, D-7750 Constance, Germany; [Wolff, Irenaeus] Thurgauer Wirtschaftsinst TWI, Kreuzlingen, Switzerland",University of Bonn; University of Erfurt; University of Konstanz,"Geng, H (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Lab Expt Econ, D-5300 Bonn, Germany.",honggeng@gmx.de; arne.weiss@wiso.uni-koeln.de; wolff@twi-kreuzlingen.ch,,"Weiss, Arne/0000-0003-1350-3638; BERTINI, Cesarino/0000-0001-8051-3022",,,,,36,6,6,1,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

It does not require reference to objective probabilities, personalistic consequences, or counterfactual acts, and it allows for state dependence of utility and unobservable background risk. The decision maker's local revealed beliefs are encoded in her risk-neutral probabilities (her relative marginal rates of substitution between states) and her local risk preferences are encoded in the matrix of derivatives of the risk-neutral probabilities. This matrix plays a central but generally unappreciated role in the modeling of risk attitudes in the state-preference framework. It can be computed by inverting a bordered Slutsky matrix and vice versa, it generalizes the Arrow-Pratt measure for approximating local risk premia, and its structure reveals whether the decision maker's risk preferences are ambiguity averse as well as risk-averse. Two versions of the smooth ambiguity model are analyzed-the source-dependent risk aversion model and the second-order uncertainty (KMM) model-and it is shown that in both cases, the overall premium for local uncertainty can be decomposed as the sum of a risk premium and an ambiguity premium.","Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Nau, R (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",robert.nau@duke.edu,,,,,,,56,12,12,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Existing studies suggest that the presence of multiple political parties within ruling coalitions generate common pool resource problems or bargaining inefficiencies which, in turn, leads to more government spending when coalition governments are in office. We demonstrate that coalition governments have shorter time horizons than single party governments and use that finding to motivate a simple formal model. The model shows that coalition governments have greater incentives to increase government spending because of a lower discount factor in office. Results from empirical models estimated on a global sample of 111 democracies between 1975 and 2007 provide strong statistical support for the aforementioned theoretical prediction.

We find that 9.4% of the shocks to gross provincial product are smoothed by the interprovincial fiscal transfer system. This system also cushions a relatively large fraction of the province-specific shocks in the coastal provinces of China. Using a variety of indicators, we explore non-fiscal channels of consumption risk sharing. We find that the migration of rural labor to urban areas and the remittance of migrant wages play important roles in promoting interprovincial consumption risk sharing in the inland provinces of China. In contrast, the extent of risk sharing through financial intermediaries and the capital markets is very limited. These factors have resulted in a low degree of risk sharing among Chinese provinces, especially over the last decade. Journal of Comparative Economics 39 (3) (2011) 383-405.

Such problems are a product of economic growth, which is widely accepted to be the outcome of the acquisition and application of knowledge. Drawing upon disparate literatures within and outside economics, it is argued that economic growth should be more properly viewed as the outcome of a co-evolutionary process that involves the autocatalytic interaction of new knowledge and access of increasing amounts of free energy to do increasingly specialized forms of work. Specifically, the relevance of the 'energy hypothesis,' associated with Erwin Schrodinger and, more recently, revived by Eric Schneider and his collaborators, is assessed. This hypothesis states that all dissipative structures have, as their primary objective, the reduction of accessible free energy gradients. It is concluded that such a hypothesis cannot be rejected in the context of economic behaviour and that this opens up an important research agenda for economists. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, the external validity gained through larger interventions typically risks deviation from the randomization protocol. This paper investigates the impact of the Nutrition Enhancement Program, which aims to improve child nutrition in Senegal. The analysis deals with deviation from the planned treatment and suggests approaches for combining ex-post adjustments such as propensity score matching with the randomized treatment plan. The authors do not detect a strong overall program impact on the outcome measure of weight-for-age based on planned treatment status, but do find an impact on the youngest children. Moreover, the project impact is clearer when the analysis considers treatment crossover using alternative estimators of two-stage least-squares and propensity score matching. The findings underscore the importance of addressing the shortcomings of large-scale randomization interventions in a systematic manner to guide further implementation of such projects, as well as to expose the true causal effect of such programs.

J,"Rose, AK",,,,"Rose, Andrew K.",,,"Exchange Rate Regimes in the Modern Era: Fixed, Floating, and Flaky",JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper provides a selective survey of the incidence, causes, and consequences of a country's choice of its exchange rate regime. I begin with a critical review of Michael Klein and Jay C. Shambaugh's (2010) book Exchange Rate Regimes in the Modern Era, and then proceed to provide an alternative overview of what the economics profession knows and needs to know about exchange rate regimes. While a fixed exchange rate with capital mobility is a well-defined monetary regime, floating is not; thus, it is unclear whether it is theoretically sensible to compare countries across exchange rate regimes. This comparison is quite difficult to make empirically. It is often hard to figure out what the exchange rate regime of a country is in practice, since there are multiple conflicting regime classifications. More importantly, similar countries choose radically different exchange rate regimes without substantive consequences for macroeconomic outcomes like output growth and inflation. That is, the profession knows surprisingly little about either the causes or consequences of national choices of exchange rate regimes. But since the consequences of these choices are small, understanding their causes is of only academic interest.","[Rose, Andrew K.] Univ Calif Berkeley, NBER, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Rose, AK (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, NBER, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,"Rose, Andrew/I-1578-2014","Rose, Andrew/0000-0003-1100-1212",,,,,22,63,71,0,22,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

Using the data envelopment analysis method, we compute the efficiency of the Chinese banking sector during 2000-2007. The empirical findings suggest that the inefficiency of the Chinese banking sector stems largely from scale rather than pure technical inefficiencies. Examining different components of economic globalization, we find that greater economic integration through higher trade flows, cultural proximity and political globalization have significant and positive influence on bank efficiency levels. The empirical findings suggest that liberalization (restrictions) of the capital account exerts a negative (positive) influence on bank efficiency levels in China.","[Sufian, Fadzlan] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Habibullah, Muzafar Shah] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Serdang, Malaysia",International Islamic University Malaysia; Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Sufian, F (通讯作者)，Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",fadzlan.sufian@khazanah.com.my; muzafar@econ.upm.edu.my,"Sufian, Fadzlan/AAY-6856-2020","Habibullah, Muzafar Shah/0000-0002-2853-8019; Sufian, Fadzlan/0000-0001-7092-2324",,,,,50,11,12,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,SEP-OCT,2011,19.0,5,,,,,85,101,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2011.01260.x,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,829YZ,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000295624500006,0

The main advantage of using sports data is that both manager characteristics and decisions and firm outcomes are directly observable. Both difference-in-difference and 2SLS estimates suggest no statistically significant improvements in performance after manager turnover, whereas previous research based on publicly traded firm data has found positive but very small effects of manager turnover on performance. The estimates confirm previous research using soccer data. In addition, estimates suggest that manager quality does not seem to matter in predicting turnover.

Incentive theories typically imply that wages exceed productivity at the end of a worker's career. Bargaining power of unions may also lead to 'overpayment' of older workers.

The asymmetry means that exchange rate risk affects exports differently as the exchange rate appreciates or depreciates. The estimation results obtained from the unrestricted error correction model using data on bilateral exports from Korea to the U.S. and to Japan from 1980 to 2009 indicate that the statistical significance of both short and long-run effects of exchange rate volatility varies according to trading partners. The results of Japan provide evidence for short-run adverse effects of exchange rate volatility on exports, whereas those for the U.S. indicate long-run negative effects. Furthermore, the asymmetric effect varies according not only to trading partners, but also to volatility specification. The results of Japan provide evidence for short run asymmetric effects, while those for the U.S. do not provide strong evidence for such effects. Not only supporting previous findings,, but also providing more insight, these results suggest that policy makers should consider the stability of the exchange rate, trading partners, and dynamics of the exchange rate during appreciations and depreciations when managing export movements.","Dongguk Univ Seoul, Dept Int Trade, Seoul 100715, South Korea",Dongguk University,"Lee, J (通讯作者)，Dongguk Univ Seoul, Dept Int Trade, Seoul 100715, South Korea.",jaehwa@dongguk.edu,,,,,,,44,0,0,0,12,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

The option to sue the incumbent can provide a subsidy for entry which can maintain competition even when the incumbent takes this action. Liability for the entrant's lost profits, however, can soften post-entry competition. If the incumbent's action is potentially efficient, taking market structure as given, e.g. it reduces her costs, then competitor suits can generate some post-entry competition without deterring this efficient cost-reduction. If the incumbent's action is inefficient, e.g. it increases the rival's costs (but does not reduce the incumbent's costs), then competitor suits (even with maximal antitrust liability) cannot deter the incumbent from increasing the rival's costs by at least a small amount. Thus, the paper suggests that while competitor suits have advantages for efficient actions that deter efficient entry, they do not work well for inefficient actions that deter entry.

Second, the survival analysis on actual retirement age shows that those who are more educated are more likely to retire earlier and those who experienced mandatory retirement are less likely.

Nonetheless, a number of theoretical problems are avoided, such as the effect of scale, aggregation and the heterogeneity of the factors considered in the model.

Arguably, the most appealing combination of properties for a symmetric, continuous, normalized, transfer-preferring and replication-invariant (S-C-N-T-R) inequality measure to satisfy is that of subgroup decomposability, centrism, unit-consistency and level-sensitivity.

Understanding the interactions between these technologies and their impact on the costs of stabilization can help inform energy policy decisions. Many previous studies have addressed this challenge by exploring a small number of representative scenarios that represent particular combinations of future technology developments. This paper uses a combinatorial approach in which scenarios are created for all combinations of the technology development assumptions that underlie a smaller, representative set of scenarios. We estimate stabilization costs for 768 runs of the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), based on 384 different combinations of assumptions about the future performance of technologies and two stabilization goals. Graphical depiction of the distribution of stabilization costs provides first-order insights about the full data set and individual technologies. We apply a formal scenario discovery method to obtain more nuanced insights about the combinations of technology assumptions most strongly associated with high-cost outcomes. Many of the fundamental insights from traditional representative scenario analysis still hold under this comprehensive combinatorial analysis. For example, the importance of carbon capture and storage (CCS) and the substitution effect among supply technologies are consistently demonstrated. The results also provide more clarity regarding insights not easily demonstrated through representative scenario analysis. For example, they show more clearly how certain supply technologies can provide a hedge against high stabilization costs, and that aggregate end-use efficiency improvements deliver relatively consistent stabilization cost reductions. Furthermore, the results indicate that a lack of CCS options combined with lower technological advances in the buildings sector or the transportation sector is the most powerful predictor of high-cost scenarios.

Employing static panel data methods that control for traditional growth determinants, trade openness and financial globalization, the paper finds that the adoption of a fully fledged IT regime results in higher output income per capita for industrial and emerging economies. However, under dynamic model specifications, the estimated long-run output impact of inflation targeting for emerging market economies is found to be lower than in the case of static models. We argue that this might be due to the long lags until the full effects of greater credibility are felt in the real economy and the fact that emerging market economies adopted the regime much later than industrial economies.

This paper discusses two analytical approaches to this challenge used to inform funding decisions related to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) applied energy R&D portfolio. The two approaches are distinguished by the constraints under which they were conducted: the need to provide an end-to-end portfolio analysis as input to internal DOE budgeting processes, but with limited time and subject to institutional constraints regarding important issues such as expert judgment. Because of these constraints, neither approach should be viewed as an attempt to push forward the state of the art in portfolio analysis in the abstract. Instead, they are an attempt to use more stylized, heuristic methods that can provide first-order insights in the DOE institutional context. Both approaches make use of advanced technology scenarios implemented in an integrated assessment modeling framework and then apply expert judgment regarding the likelihood of achieving associated R&D and commercialization goals. The approaches differ in the granularity of the scenarios used and in the definition of the benefits of technological advance: in one approach the benefits are defined as the cumulative emission reduction attributable to a particular technology; in the other approach benefits are defined as the cumulative cost reduction. In both approaches a return on investment (ROI) criterion is established based on benefits divided by federal R&D investment. The ROI is then used to build a first-order approximation of an optimal applied energy R&D investment portfolio. Although these methodologies have been used to inform an actual budget request, the results reflect only one input among many used in budget formulation. The results are therefore not representative of an official U.S. government or DOE funding recommendation but should instead be considered illustrative of the way in which methodologies such as these could be applied.

Foreign equity options (quanto options) are contingent claims where the payoff is determined by an equity in one currency but the actual payoff is done in another currency. Huang and Hung (2005) priced foreign equity options under the Levy processes. In Huang and Hung's paper, they considered jumps in the foreign asset prices and exchange rates and assumed the volatility as constant. However, many studies showed that constant volatility and jumps in returns are incapable of fully capturing the empirical features of equity returns or option prices. In this paper, the stochastic volatility with simultaneous jumps in prices and volatility is proposed to model foreign asset prices and exchange rates. The foreign equity option pricing formula is given by using the Fourier inverse transformation. The numerical results show that the use of stochastic volatility with simultaneous jumps in prices and volatility proposed to model foreign asset prices and exchange rates is necessary and this approach can help us to capture more accurately the foreign equity option prices.

The results consistently show that while financial development facilitates the accumulation of new ideas, the implementation of financial reform policies is negatively associated with it. The undesirable effects of financial liberalization are found to operate through the triggering of crises and volatility in the financial system. There is also evidence supporting the hypothesis that financial liberalization reallocates talent from the innovative sector to the financial system, thus retarding technological deepening.

However, the classic Grameen bank used state non-contingent repayment, which is puzzling since it forces poor borrowers to make their payments even under hard circumstances. This paper provides an explanation to this puzzle. We consider two modes of lending, group and individual lending, and for each mode we characterize the optimal lending and supervisory contracts when a staff member (a supervisor) can embezzle borrowers' repayments by misrepresenting realized returns.

First, the paper gives some operational content to the notion of must-take card through the avoided-cost test or tourist test: would the merchant want to refuse a card payment when a non-repeat customer with enough cash in her pocket is about to pay at the cash register? It analyzes its relevance as an indicator of excessive interchange fees. Second, it identifies four key sources of potential social biases in the payment card systems' determination of interchange fees and compares the industry and social optima both in the short term (fixed number of issuers) and the long term (in which issuer offerings and entry respond to profitability).","[Rochet, Jean-Charles] Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Rochet, Jean-Charles; Tirole, Jean] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",University of Zurich; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Rochet, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",rochet@isb.uzh.ch; jean.tirole@tse-fr.eu,,,,,,,21,47,50,0,39,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1542-4766,,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

Our contribution is to show that this friction provides a simple explanation for the emergence of global imbalances, a resolution to the empirical puzzle that capital often fails to flow from the rich or slow-growing countries to the poor or fast-growing ones, and a set of policy lessons regarding the intertemporal costs and benefits of capital-account liberalization.

The model presents a novel mechanism driving the self-fulfilling prophecies, which is characterized by well behaved (downward sloping) labor demand schedules. This mechanism differs from the customary one, and it is complementary to it. Compared to traditional labor market income, the income derived from underground labor activity is subject to a lower expected tax rate when considering both the probability of detection and the evasion penalty. During a belief-driven expansion, the household allocates more time to both traditional and underground labor supply. In equilibrium, this action serves to lower the effective labor tax rate faced by the household, thus providing stimulus to aggregate labor supply so as to make the initial expansion self-fulfilling. The mechanism here is akin to a regressive tax; the household's effective tax rate depends negatively on the level of total labor income. We argue that an underground sector, and the associated tax evasion, offer a good economic rationale for a regressive tax rate. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Privately optimal levels necessarily deviate from socially optimal ones under strict liability, whereas private decisions are first-best under negligence unless compensation is much smaller than harm. It is established that the way in which privately optimal R&D deviates from the first-best level depends on the kind of technical change in pollution abatement.

In a general-equilibrium framework, it is shown that as long as migration can reduce humiliation sufficiently, migration will occur even between two identical economies. Migration increases the number of individuals who choose to perform degrading jobs and consequently, migration lowers the price of the good produced in the sector that is associated with low social status. Moreover, the greater an individual's aversion to performing degrading jobs, the more likely it is that he will experience a welfare gain when the economy opens up.","[Stark, Oded] Univ Bonn, ZEF, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; Lingnan Univ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; Univ Klagenfurt, Klagenfurt, Austria; Univ Vienna, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; Univ Warsaw, PL-00325 Warsaw, Poland; Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland",University of Bonn; Lingnan University; University of Klagenfurt; University of Vienna; University of Warsaw; Warsaw School of Economics,"Stark, O (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, ZEF, Walter Flex Str 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",ostark@uni-bonn.de,,"Fan, Simon/0000-0003-0955-5523",,,,,29,23,24,2,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0020-6598,,,INT ECON REV,Int.

The empirical results reveal that there is a positive long-run relationship between Malaysia's OFDI and its key determinants, viz, foreign market size, real effective exchange rate, international reserves and trade openness. The main findings suggest that apart from the market-seeking incentive and the adoption of outward-oriented policies, the Malaysian government could also encourage OFDI by implementing liberal policy on capital outflows. On the basis of these findings, we draw some policy implications for the country's economic development and the internationalization of Malaysian firms in the era of globalization.

It is shown that in the former case, which we call a disruptive good, history dependent long run equilibria can occur, which are in line with recent real life economic examples.

We argue that such absence of documentation is due to the focus of the empirical literature on the U.S., where the allocation of campaign spending and advertising is decentralized. We explore a quasi-natural experiment that enables us to mitigate the omitted variables and reverse causality problems caused by decentralized allocation. In Brazil, gubernatorial elections work in a two-round system. In the first round, candidates' TV time shares are determined by their coalitions' share of seats in the National Parliament. In the second round, TV time is split equally between the first-round winner and runner-up. Using differences between rounds as a source of variation, we find a large causal effect of TV advertising on election outcomes.","[Da Silveira, Bernardo S.] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA; [De Mello, Joao M.

We illustrate this point using labor force data from two countries having experienced important macroeconomic turbulence; a large economy with rigid labor markets, Poland, and a small open economy with increased flexibility, Estonia. We find that holding a vocational degree is associated with much longer unemployment duration spells and higher likelihood of leaving activity for older workers. We then build a theoretical framework in which young agents' careers are heavily determined by the type of initial education, and analyze the transition to a new steady-state after a sectoral demand shift. Quantitative exercises suggest that the over-specialization of the labor force in Poland led to much higher and persistent unemployment compared to Estonia during the period of EU enlargement. Traditional labor market institutions (wage rigidity and employment protection) lead to an increase of the unemployment gap, but to a lesser extent. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

To account for these phenomena, a matching model is considered in which highly educated and poorly educated workers compete for skilled jobs. An exogenous increase in the proportion of highly skilled workers increases the proportion of these workers in low-level jobs (downgrading). Another of the paper's findings is that changes in the composition of the workforce affect workers' opportunities to accumulate experience.

Using a new data set on literacy in colonial India, we find that Muslim literacy is negatively correlated with the proportion of Muslims in the district, although we find no similar result for Hindu literacy. We employ a theoretical model which suggests that districts which experienced a more recent collapse of Muslim political authority had more powerful and better funded religious authorities, who established religious schools which were less effective at promoting literacy on the margin than state schools. We test this hypothesis econometrically, finding that the period of Muslim political collapse has a statistically significant effect on Muslim literacy while controlling for it eliminates the significance of the proportion of Muslims on Muslim literacy. This suggests that the long hand of history has played some role in subsequent differences in human capital formation through the persistence of institutions discouraging literacy.

To facilitate the analysis of applications such as online auctions (e.g. eBay), online shopping search engines (e.g. BizRate.com) and consumer reports, we assume that a central mechanism observes all past signals, and makes public announcements every period. The set of announcements and the mapping from observed signals to the set of announcements is called a rating system. We show that, absent reputation effects, information censoring cannot improve attainable payoffs. However, if there is an initial probability that the seller is a commitment type that plays a particular strategy every period, then there exists a finite rating system and an equilibrium of the resulting game such that, the expected present discounted payoff of the seller is almost his Stackelberg payoff after every history. This is in contrast to Cripps, Mailath and Samuelson (2004) [5], where it is shown that reputation effects do not last forever in such games if buyers can observe all past signals. We also construct finite rating systems that increase payoffs of almost all buyers, while decreasing the seller's payoff. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This paper uses New Immigrant Survey (2003) data to examine how proposed changes to U.S. immigration policy might alter the composition of legal permanent residents (LPRs) admitted. Specifically, we consider the 2007 federal proposal that would have placed greater emphasis on employment and skills by instituting a merit-based point system while eliminating some types of family sponsorship. We also simulate point scores for the 2003 LPR cohort according to the point systems used in Canada and Australia. We find that, despite significant variation in point allocations, the three systems would admit similar numbers and types of immigrants. In the 2007 U.S. proposal, work experience in the United States is extremely important for earning high point scores. Thus, the proposal would place even more stress on temporary visa programs.","[Hill, Laura E.; Hayes, Joseph M.] Publ Policy Inst Calif, San Francisco, CA 94111 USA",,"Hayes, JM (通讯作者)，Publ Policy Inst Calif, 500 Washington St,Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94111 USA.",hayes@ppic.org,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

We explore how the measurement of productivity and value added in manufacturing has been affected by the dramatic rise in imports of manufactured goods, which more than doubled from 1997 to 2007. We argue that, analogous to the widely discussed problem of outlet substitution bias in the literature on the Consumer Price Index, the price declines associated with the shift to low-cost foreign suppliers are generally not captured in existing price indexes. Just as the CPI fails to capture fully the lower prices for consumers due to the entry and expansion of big-box retailers like Wal-Mart, import price indexes and the intermediate input price indexes based on them do not capture the price drops associated with a shift to new low-cost suppliers in China and other developing countries. As a result, the real growth of imported inputs has been understated. And if input growth is understated, it follows that the growth in multifactor productivity and real value added in the manufacturing sector have been overstated. We estimate that average annual multifactor productivity growth in manufacturing was overstated by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage point and real value added growth by 0.2 to 0.5 percentage point from 1997 to 2007. Moreover, this bias may have accounted for a fifth to a half of the growth in real value added in manufacturing output excluding the computer and electronics industry.","[Houseman, Susan] Upjohn Inst Employment Res, Kalamazoo, MI USA; [Kurz, Christopher; Lengermann, Paul] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Div Res & Stat, Washington, DC 20551 USA; [Mandel, Benjamin] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Div Int Finance, Washington, DC 20551 USA",W.E.

In this study, quarterly data from 1978 Q1 through 2007 Q4 are analyzed. The empirical results indicate that the deviations in the exchange rate of all four countries reject the null of linearity. The rate deviations in the Japanese and Korean cases exhibit a dynamic and smoothly symmetric ESTAR type process, while those in the Taiwanese and Singaporean cases match the smoothly asymmetric LSTAR type with respect to depreciating and appreciating regimes. These nonlinear characteristics can be explained by the existence of heterogeneous behavior and asymmetric information among economic agents. Furthermore, the estimation results of a nonlinear least squares (NLS) regression indicate that most of the parameter estimates are significant at the 10 percent level. The forecasted Japanese and Korean rate deviations in the ESTAR model are not superior to those from the AR model, possibly because these two countries experienced a serious fluctuation during the Asian financial crisis that occurred in 1997. However, based on the criterion of the RMSE, the forecasted Taiwanese and Singaporean rate deviations in the LSTAR model outperform those in the AR model. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The approach reaches beyond the old dichotomies about whether healthcare providers are reimbursed on a fee-for-service or a capitated or per-person payment. Instead, these reforms seek to create direct linkages between payments to healthcare providers and measures of the quality and efficiency of care. After an overview of payment reforms for healthcare providers and their welfare implications, this paper discusses a range of empirical studies. These often small-scale studies suggest that provider payment reforms in conjunction with greater attention to improving measurements of care quality and outcomes can have a significant impact on quality of care and, in some cases, resource use and costs of care.","Brookings Inst, Engelberg Ctr Hlth Care Reform, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Brookings Institution,"McClellan, M (通讯作者)，Brookings Inst, Engelberg Ctr Hlth Care Reform, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",,,,,,,,86,55,81,0,29,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

The results show that the hypothesis of inflation persistence does not hold empirically for most of the countries. In addition, the estimated models (logistic smooth transition autoregressions) are stable in the sense that the variable tends to remain in the regime (low inflation or high inflation) once reached, and changes between regimes are only achieved after a shock. The results also indicate that the effects of the shocks on inflation tend to die out; exogenous factors, i.e. supply shocks and inertia may be causing this outcome, as they play a substantial role in the determination of the inflation rates for our selected African countries.","[Mourelle, Estefania] Univ A Coruna, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Appl Econ 2, La Coruna 15071, Spain; [Cuestas, Juan Carlos] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Alberiko Gil-Alana, Luis] Univ Navarra, Fac Econ, E-31080 Pamplona, Navarra, Spain",Universidade da Coruna; University of Sheffield; University of Navarra,"Mourelle, E (通讯作者)，Univ A Coruna, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Appl Econ 2, La Coruna 15071, Spain.",emourelle@udc.es; j.cuestas@sheffield.ac.uk; alana@unav.es,"Mourelle, Estefanía/K-9458-2013; Cuestas, Juan Carlos/K-4270-2014","Mourelle, Estefania/0000-0002-7420-9830; Cuestas, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-7313-2157",,,,,65,7,7,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

However, this strategy is not optimal for capital-scarce developing economies. Incremental consumption should be skewed towards present generations. Savings should be directed to accumulation of domestic private and public capital rather than foreign assets.

The first type consists of characteristics of the individual himself, such as age, health, income, etc. The second type of variables consists of the characteristics of the individuals belonging to his reference group. The vast literature about happiness, quality of life, and well-being informs us extensively about the effects of objective variables. How the second type affects well-being is much less investigated. It is argued that the concept of well-being inequality cannot be properly defined without taking the referencing process into account. The reference effect depends on how frequently individuals compare with others and on the degree of social transparency in society. We attempt to give a structural embedding of the idea of reference groups in SWB-models. In this paper we employ the reference-extended model for incorporating in happiness studies the concept of inequality in happiness or SWB. Finally, we plead for an extension of the present happiness paradigm by setting up a new additional agenda for empirical research in order to get quantified knowledge about the referencing process.

In the next two sections, I debate whether Lucas adheres to two methodological principles that I dub the 'non-interference' precept (the proposition that ideological viewpoints should not influence theory), and the 'non-exploitation' precept (that the models' conclusions should not be transposed into policy recommendations, in so far as these conclusions are built into the models' premises). The last part of the paper contains my assessment of Lucas's ideas. First, I bring out the extent to which Lucas departs from the view held by most specialized methodologists. Second, I wonder whether the new classical revolution resulted from a political agenda. Third and finally, I claim that the tensions characterizing Lucas's conception of theory follow from his having one foot in the neo-Walrasian and the other in the Marshallian-Friedmanian universe.","Univ Louvain, IRES, B-3458 Louvain, Belgium",,"De Vroey, M (通讯作者)，Univ Louvain, IRES, Pl Montesquieu 3, B-3458 Louvain, Belgium.",michel.devroey@uclouvain.be,,,,,,,54,3,3,0,3,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,FEB 23,2011,5.0,,,,,,,,20114,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2011-4,0.0,,,40,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,865BM,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298285700001,0

We consider several actual and hypothetical sustainable PAYGO pension structures, including: (1) versions of the US Social Security system with annual adjustments of taxes or benefits to maintain fiscal balance; (2) Sweden's Notional Defined Contribution system and several variants developed to improve fiscal stability; and (3) the German system, which also includes annual adjustments to maintain fiscal balance. For each system, we present descriptive measures of uncertainty in representative outcomes for a typical generation and across generations. We then estimate expected utility for generations based on simplifying assumptions and incorporate these expected utility calculations in an overall social welfare measure. Using a horizontal equity index, we also compare the different systems' performance in terms of how neighboring generations are treated. While the actual Swedish system smoothes stochastic fluctuations more than any other and produces the highest degree of horizontal equity, it does so by accumulating a buffer stock of assets that alleviates the need for frequent adjustments. In terms of social welfare, this accumulation of assets leads to a lower average rate of return that more than offsets the benefits of risk reduction, leaving systems with more frequent adjustments that spread risks broadly among generations as those most preferred.

The local capacity to commercialize spillovers is experience based and hence more narrow than the range of innovations. The cloud will therefore be incompletely explored. While the value of the cloud to society may be greater than the development investment, the value captured by the producer is often not sufficient to make the product development privately profitable. The producer faces the property rights problem of how to charge for the dual product it develops, the product itself and as much as possible for the technology cloud. The public and private customers, however, appreciate the situation differently. While the former appears in the double customer role of being interested in both the product procured and the spillover benefits to society, the latter is not interested in paying for spillovers that only benefit society. Marketing the product, therefore, involves the ability to present a credible case for the economic value to society of the spillovers. To do that, a theory is needed that demonstrates both the user value to the customer, and the entrepreneurial capacity of the economy to commercialize the spillovers. The theoretical argument is illustrated with the case of downstream industrial business formation around Swedish military aircraft industry.","[Eliasson, Gunnar] KTH, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Eliasson, Gunnar] Ratio Inst, Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology,"Eliasson, G (通讯作者)，KTH, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",gunnar.elias@telia.com,,,,,,,68,6,6,1,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Strategic investments to deter entry, however, may result in nonmonotonic investment because they are unnecessary in small markets, and impossible in large ones.

The article commences with a broad review of the main ideas in the history of thought concerning the determinants of economic growth and an introduction to the evolutionary perspective. This is followed by a selective review of recent evolutionary approaches to macroeconomics. These approaches are found to be somewhat disconnected. It is argued that the 'micro-meso-macro' approach to economic evolution is capable of resolving this problem by offering an analytical framework in which macroeconomics can be built upon 'meso-foundations', not micro-foundations, as asserted in the mainstream. It is also stressed that the economic system and its components are complex adaptive systems and that this complexity must not be assumed away through the imposition of simplistic assumptions made for analytical convenience. It is explained that complex economic systems are, at base, energetic in character but differ from biological complex systems in the way that they collect, store and apply knowledge. It is argued that a focus upon stocks and flows of energy and knowledge in complex economic systems can yield an appropriate analytical framework for macroeconomics. It is explained how such a framework can be connected with key insights of both Schumpeter and Keynes that have been eliminated in modern macroeconomics. A macroeconomic framework that cannot be operationalized empirically is of limited usefulness so, in the last part of the article, an appropriate methodology for evolutionary macroeconomics is discussed.","Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland,"Foster, J (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",j.foster@uq.edu.au,,"Foster, John/0000-0002-2601-1539",,,,,74,17,20,6,39,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

J,"Weede, E",,,,"Weede, Erich",,,Long-Run Economic Performance in the European Periphery: Russia and Turkey,KYKLOS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,GROWTH; INTELLIGENCE; IMPACT,"P>This paper first analyzes the question why did Czarist Russia and Ottoman Turkey fall behind the West? It is argued that interstate rivalry forced West European rulers to respect the private property rights of producers and subjects earlier and to a greater degree than czars or sultans ruling over huge contiguous territories ever had to. Incentives to work were better in Europe than elsewhere. The mobilization of available knowledge for productive purposes was easier than elsewhere. Limited government implied less political obstacles to innovation. Comparatively secure private property ownership in the means of production made the establishment of scarcity prices and the rational allocation of resources easier than elsewhere. Whereas the Western past was feudal, the Russian or Turkish past was patrimonial or even sultanistic. Feudalism is a much better starting point for establishing the rule of law and safe property rights than patrimonialism. The second issue has been the question why Czarist Russia could outperform Ottoman Turkey. Here the political consequences of the Muslim tolerance of slavery and polygyny matter. Being slaves, many members of Ottoman ruling elites were at the mercy of their owner, the sultan. Therefore, they became tools of arbitrary rule. Moreover, the practice of polygyny generated downward social mobility and political instability and thereby added another obstacle to the establishment of safe property rights for producers or merchants. The final issue is the economic prospects of Russia or Turkey. Economic freedom is better in Turkey than in Russia. Moreover, Russia is graying, whereas Turkey may look forward to a growing labor force. Although a rich endowment in natural resources seems to favor Russia, the resource curse has prevented other resource rich countries from developing. Therefore, the Turkish prospect looks much brighter than the Russian one.","Univ Bonn, Inst Polit Sci & Sociol, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Weede, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Inst Polit Sci & Sociol, Lennestr 25-27, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",e.weede@uni-bonn.de,,,,,,,63,2,2,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,FEB,2011,64.0,1,,,,,138,156,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2010.00499.x,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,705ES,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000286112300008,0

This article views premature death as a tragic 'natural experiment', outlining a methodology identifying the 'citation death tax' - the impact of the death of productive economists on the patterns of their citations. We rely on a sample of 428 papers written by 16 well-known economists who died well before retirement, during the period 1975 to 1997. The news is mixed: for half of the sample, we identify a large and significant 'citation death tax' for the average paper written by these scholars. For these authors, the estimated average missing citations per paper attributed to premature death ranges from 40% to 140% (the overall average is about 90%), and the annual costs of lost citations per paper are in the range 3-14%. Hence, a paper written 10 years before the author's death avoids a citation cost that varies between 30% and 140%. For the other half of the sample, there is no citation death tax; and for two Nobel Prize-calibre scholars in this second group, Black and Tversky, citations took off over time, reflecting the growing recognitions of their seminal works.","[Aizenman, Joshua] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Econ, UCSC, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Aizenman, Joshua] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Natl Bur Econ Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Aizenman, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Econ, UCSC, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",jaizen@ucsc.edu,,,,,,,21,11,12,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

J,"Ajakaiye, O; Kimenyi, MS",,,,"Ajakaiye, Olu; Kimenyi, Mwangi S.",,,Higher Education and Economic Development in Africa: Introduction and Overview,JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,,,"There is little disagreement amongst development economists that investments in human capital-specifically education and health-are crucial for social and economic development of nations. It is widely accepted that nations cannot raise the quality of life of their citizens without substantial and consistent investments in human capital. Many earlier studies that investigated the returns to education found that the returns to primary education were much higher than to other levels of education. Recent studies have, however, shown that higher levels of education associate with much higher private and social returns as compared to primary education. Meanwhile, available data suggest that Africa is lagging behind other developing regions in the areas of higher education, with abysmally low tertiary enrolment rate; and low access to information and knowledge as evidenced by very low personal computer coverage, internet usage, scientific and technical journals published, royalties and licences received and patent applications by residents. The neglect of tertiary education in Africa has impacted on other dimensions of human development. For example, to provide quality primary and secondary education, it is necessary that institutions of higher learning produce well-trained teachers and in sufficient quantities. Likewise, qualified nurses and medical personnel are required to provide even basic health care. But these professionals are in short supply in Africa such that it is not possible to provide quality of education and basic health care to most of the population. For Africa to achieve and sustain high rates of growth, it is necessary for major transformations in the structure of production as well as a reduced technological gap to take place and these require a large pool of labour force with tertiary education. In order to support evidence-based policies to redress the situation, the May 2010 Plenary Session hosted by the African Economic Research Consortium (AERC) analysed the interactions between higher education and economic development in Africa and elsewhere, reviewed models and methods normally used in estimating returns to higher education and examined options for financing higher education in contemporary Africa.","[Ajakaiye, Olu] African Econ Res Consortium, Nairobi 00200, Kenya; [Kimenyi, Mwangi S.] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",African Economic Research Consortium (AERC); Brookings Institution,"Ajakaiye, O (通讯作者)，African Econ Res Consortium, 3rd Floor,Middle E Bank Towers,Milimani Rd,POB 62, Nairobi 00200, Kenya.",olusanya.ajakaiye@aercafrica.org,,,,,,,2,3,3,0,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

Some striking differences are nonetheless easily missed, amid the many parallels between central banking reforms in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and those in the industrial and emerging-market economies. The abandonment of soft pegs in low-income SSA, for example, had less to do with capital mobility than with the failures of exchange control systems under pressure from fiscal imbalances and external shocks. Fiscal and quasi-fiscal demands, in turn, have almost certainly been more important than conventional stabilisation objectives as potential sources of inflation bias in SSA. Money-based disinflation programmes, to take a final example-often supported by tight fiscal rules under IMF conditionality-do not appear to have involved costly sacrifices of output, outside of South Africa. These observations, and more in the papers collected here, suggest that the distinctive structural and institutional features of low-income countries may have distinctive implications for the design and conduct of monetary policy. Collectively, the papers in this volume issue a compelling call for monetary policy research that focuses squarely on the economic environment of low-income Africa.","[Ajakaiye, Olu] African Econ Res Consortium, Nairobi, Kenya; [O'Connell, Stephen A.] Swarthmore Coll, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA; [O'Connell, Stephen A.] Univ Oxford, Ctr Study African Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",African Economic Research Consortium (AERC); Swarthmore College; University of Oxford,"Ajakaiye, O (通讯作者)，African Econ Res Consortium, Nairobi, Kenya.",olusanya.ajakaiye@aercafrica.org; steve_oconnell@swarthmore.edu,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Despite the importance of employer-provided benefits in the US health insurance system the impact of prior job instability on one's future ability to obtain insurance coverage is not well understood. This article finds a negative relationship between the volatility of a worker's employment and her likelihood of receiving firm-provided health insurance. Previous employment volatility reduces each of the four factors necessary to receive such insurance: a worker's subsequent chances of getting a job, her chances of getting a job in a firm that offers coverage, her chances of staying with the firm long enough to become eligible for coverage and her ability to take up insurance if offered. The most important impact is on the last: her ability to take up insurance if offered. Lack of employment is not the only, and not even the largest, barrier to individual coverage under this system. This finding has important policy implications, particularly given the recent tendency of employers to shift the cost of insurance premiums onto their employees.","[Lane, Julia] Natl Sci Fdn, Washington, DC 20550 USA; [Andersson, Fredrik] Off Comptroller Currency, Dept Treasury, Washington, DC USA; [Bolvig, Iben] Univ Aarhus, Ctr Res Social Integrat & Marginalizat, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark; [Freedman, Matthew] Cornell Univ, ILR Sch, Ithaca, NY USA",National Science Foundation (NSF); United States Department of the Treasury; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; Aarhus University; Cornell University,"Lane, J (通讯作者)，Natl Sci Fdn, Washington, DC 20550 USA.",jlane@nsf.gov,,"Lane, Julia/0000-0002-8139-2960",,,,,40,0,3,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Becker, 1962; Ariely et al., 2003) have noted anomalies concerning the relationship between observed demand and the preferences presumed to motivate it. We re-examine these findings using experimental choice data. After separating our subjects' choices into rational and irrational subsets based on consistency with the axioms of revealed preference, we estimate and compare demand coefficients. Mirroring Ariely et al.'s 'coherently arbitrary' choice, both rational and irrational demand estimates exhibit negative price and positive endowment coefficients. However, a comparison of the full set of demand coefficients indicates significant differences between the two, yielding an observable artefact of the preference hypothesis. Relaxing the goodness-of-fit of the revealed preference test (Afriat, 1987; Varian, 1994) does not alter our findings.","[Murphy, James H.] Univ W Georgia, Dept Econ, Richards Coll Business, Carrollton, GA 30118 USA; [Banerjee, Samiran] Emory Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",University System of Georgia; University of West Georgia; Emory University,"Murphy, JH (通讯作者)，Univ W Georgia, Dept Econ, Richards Coll Business, Carrollton, GA 30118 USA.",jmurphy@westga.edu,"Murphy, James/S-1261-2019",,,,,,32,10,12,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The motivation for this paper is the use of clustering techniques to group firms in a totally endogenous form. In order to classify the firms we used a hybrid clustering method, that is, hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering techniques jointly. To estimate the parameters a Bayesian approach was considered. Prior distributions were assumed for the parameters, classifying the model in random or fixed effects. Ordinate predictive density criterion was used to select the model providing a better prediction. We tested thirty models and the better prediction considers the presence of 2 groups in the sample, assuming the fixed effect model with a Student t distribution with 20 degrees of freedom for the error. The results indicate robustness in the identification of financial constraint when the firms are classified by the clustering techniques. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The estimated wage differentials between sectors from the fixed-effects (FE) model demonstrate a substantial drop in the size of wage gaps, reflecting systematic sorting between formal and informal sectors by unobserved workers' abilities. While estimated wage differentials from cross-sectional analysis between formal and informal sector among male workers disappear in the FE estimations, the wage gap between the formal and the informal sector among female workers still exists in the FE estimations, thus suggesting a differing dual labor market severity between gender groups. Based on these empirical results, we discuss a policy direction involving simultaneous consideration of the dual structure of the labor market and gender discrimination.","[Cho, Donghun] Hallym Univ, Dept Econ, Econ Res Inst, Chunchon, South Korea; [Cho, Joonmo] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Human Resources Dev Ctr, Seoul, South Korea",Hallym University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Cho, D (通讯作者)，Hallym Univ, Dept Econ, Econ Res Inst, Chunchon, South Korea.",hooncho@hallym.ac.kr,"Cho, Joonmo/B-7368-2012",,,,,,26,10,10,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are socially and economically important for their national economies, since they represent about 99 per cent of all active enterprises in the European Union. The importance of SMEs to the EU economy indicates the need to assess their performance in order to find appropriate performance measurement and management tools. These issues become very topical during the period of global economic recession. Making profit is most often mentioned as an integral goal of any enterprise. However, it should be emphasized that profit is the result of a comprehensive process of the creation of added value. This process can be managed by using a system approach. It means that the value maximization opportunities depend on harmonious and purposeful interactions between enterprise separate processes or functional units. Development of any enterprise is related to the future opportunities, risks and uncertainty. Therefore, profit making ability of an enterprise depends on managers' skills to apply modern business management methods and tools. The more mature are the business activities, the higher is the probability of an enterprise to face failure. Long-term existence of an enterprise depends on its ability to utilize resources efficiently and to create profit, taking into consideration the influence of business environment and its related factors. While measuring the performance of an enterprise, the company's life cycle concept should be considered as well. The problems within an enterprise arise from improper activities, incompetence or even negligence. Performance measurement system can significantly influence and support SMEs' organizational development. Effectiveness and efficiency shall be manifested in all business processes of an enterprise. Performance evaluation should be based on the criteria associated to the field of activities of a particular enterprise and particular manufacturing technology. The system should be comprised of measures, related not only to operations, but also to organization and management of the enterprise. The goal of the research is, studying the performance of SMEs and the factors affecting performance achieving, to propose performance measurement concept encouraging the sustainable development of SMEs and to suggest performance evaluation approach.","[Ciemleja, Guna; Lace, Natalja] Riga Tech Univ, LV-1007 Riga, Latvia",Riga Technical University,"Ciemleja, G (通讯作者)，Riga Tech Univ, 1-7 Meza St, LV-1007 Riga, Latvia.",guna.ciemleja@rtu.lv; natalja.lace@rtu.lv,"Gerhards, Guntis/D-5197-2009","Ciemleja, Guna/0000-0001-7212-6946",,,,,30,22,27,2,70,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The model combines Nelson and Phelps (1966) type technology dynamics with a growth model in which intermediate goods are used to produce a final good. The intermediate good producers hire skilled labor to increase their productivity by adopting techniques from an exogenously evolving stock of world knowledge. I solve for the stationary equilibrium and derive analytic expressions for steady state income level and wage premium. In a quantitative exercise, I calibrate the model and compare its predictions with data. The model successfully accounts for cross-country income differences and within-country wage premia on skilled labor. These results strengthen the idea that different types of human capital perform separate tasks and should not be aggregated into a single stock of human capital in development accounting exercises. The availability of skilled labor is potentially much more important for development than such aggregative exercises have so far suggested.","Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Cosar, AK (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",kerem.cosar@chicagobooth.edu,,,,,,,36,13,13,0,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

We find that the complexity of the model that is required to fit the data well depends upon the way in which the data is pooled across sexes and over time, and upon the characteristics of the usage measure. Pooling across time and sexes is almost always favoured, but when more heterogeneous data is pooled it is often the case that a more complex statistical model is required.","[Creel, Michael; Farell, Montserrat] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Creel, M (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",michael.creel@uab.es,"Creel, Michael/ABC-7429-2021; Creel, Michael/P-2743-2019","Creel, Michael/0000-0002-0944-8405;",,,,,21,0,2,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Not much attention has been paid to this group of countries, in particular, to the existence of nonlinearities in the long-run path of such a variable. Controlling for two sources of nonlinearities, i.e. asymmetric adjustment to equilibrium and nonlinear deterministic trends allows us to gain some insight about the behaviour of the African REER.

The positive effect of IT is not explained away by plausible pre-crisis determinants of post-crisis performance, such as growth in private credit, ratios of short-term debt to GDP, reserves to short-term debt and reserves to GDP, capital account restrictions, total capital inflows, trade openness, current account balance and exchange rate flexibility, or post-crisis drivers such as the growth performance of trading partners and changes in terms of trade. We find that inflation targeting countries lowered nominal and real interest rates more sharply than other countries; were less likely to face deflation scares; and had sharp real depreciations without a relative deterioration in their risk assessment by markets. While the task of establishing causal relationships from cross-sectional macroeconomics series is daunting, our reading of this evidence is consistent with the resilience of IT countries being related to their ability to loosen their monetary policy when most needed, thereby avoiding deflation scares and the zero lower bound on interest rates.","Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"de Carvalho, IE (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",Idecarvalhofilho@imf.org,,"de Carvalho Filho, Irineu/0000-0002-5118-1433",,,,,36,11,11,0,3,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

We show that firms that delay investment without government intervention have an incentive to invest early under policy activism, strategically underinvesting or overinvesting to obtain larger subsidies. The policy scheme thus creates a new, potentially more harmful, distortion. Under oligopoly, a firm has a weaker incentive to manipulate policy than under monopoly, which makes policy intervention less harmful.

Put differently, the paper tests the hypothesis that there is a partial substitution between public insurance through government spending and a private insurance through remittances in more open countries. The insurance role of remittances is evaluated by computing annual panel data coefficients of remittance cyclicality with respect to the real GDP cycle. It appears that remittances have become more countercyclical during the end 1990s. Moreover, the trade openness, natural disasters, inflation and the shallowness nature of the financial system are among the main determinants of the countercyclicality of remittance inflows. From a simple theoretical model close to Rodrik (1998) and on the basis of econometric estimations using a large sample of developing countries (66), it appears that the positive impact of trade openness on government spending decreases with the level of remittances received. Moreover, it is when remittances are effectively countercyclical that the mechanism described here works.","[Ebeke, Christian Hubert] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Ebeke, CH (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",Cebeke@imf.org,,,,,,,41,6,7,1,7,DE BOECK UNIVERSITE,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

The export of Rice, leather and cotton-made garments may be conducted by two scenarios, i.e. when normal trading relations between Pakistan and India will be restored and when there will be a free trade between Pakistan and India in the presence of South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA). Results based on this research reveal that on SAFTA, grounds, there will be net export benefits in Pakistan's economy.","[Faiz, M.

In the first part, in the context of concepts and findings of new institutional economics and new political economy, the author describes the reasons why political competition has become subject of interest for economists. The next part presents the most significant economic theories that explain the links between economic decisions taken by the government and various aspects of political competion. The discussion includes i.a. the model of median voter, questions related to political rent-seeking, and social control over political elites.

While water footprints are sometimes understood as a measure that includes environmental impact assessment, the water footprint as used in this paper refers to volumes of water consumed, without including weighting procedures to allow for the assessment of impacts. Two types of approaches have been applied to calculate the water footprint in the literature: bottom-up and top-down approaches. This study compares and discusses advantages and limitations of the water footprint of nations based on two input-output top-down approaches (Water Embodied in Bilateral Trade (WEBT) and Multi-regional Input-Output Analysis (MRIO)) and of the existing national water footprint accounts from the literature based on the bottom-up approach. The differences in the bottom-up and WEBT approaches are caused by inter-sectoral cut-off, because bottom-up approaches do not consider the entire industrial supply chains, while the WEBT method covers the water footprint by tracing the whole domestic supply chain of each country. The differences in the WEBT and MRIO approaches are due to an inter-regional cut-off effect, as the WEBT approach only traces domestic supply chains whereas the MRIO approach traces entire global supply chains. We found that both bottom-up and top-down approaches are heavily dependent on the quality of existing datasets, and differ substantially. The total water footprints of nations based on different approaches vary by up to 48%, and this variation is even larger at the sector level.","[Feng, Kuishuang; Hubacek, Klaus] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Chapagain, Ashok] WWF UK, Godalming, Surrey, England; [Suh, Sangwon; Pfister, Stephan] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; World Wildlife Fund; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Feng, KS (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Geog, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",kfeng@umd.edu,"Chapagain, Ashok/AAE-7998-2019; Feng, Kuishuang/Y-2541-2019; Pfister, Stephan/AAE-8615-2019; Suh, Sangwon/E-2019-2011; Hubacek, Klaus/K-3500-2019; Hubacek, Klaus/GVS-6444-2022","Pfister, Stephan/0000-0001-8984-2041; Suh, Sangwon/0000-0001-8290-6276; Hubacek, Klaus/0000-0003-2561-6090",,,,,73,261,273,12,159,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

It produces raw material for other sectors such as industry, agriculture, etc. So, determining and prioritizing the mining strategies are critical to development plans in countries. Miscellaneous types of tools are presented for determining and evaluating of operational strategies. Analyzing the internal and external environments using strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) helps to determine the current situation and to identify major prospects and challenges that could significantly impact strategy implementation in mining sector. On the other hand, Balanced Scorecard (BSC) is a management system that helps organizations at dealing with today's pace of business and enables business managers to make better decisions. Fuzzy multi criteria decision making (FMCDM) techniques are appropriate tools to prioritize under sophisticated environmental. Fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) and Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (FTOPSIS) are two hands of FMCDM methods that are used in different researches. In this paper, an integrated model for prioritizing the strategies of Iranian mining sector is proposed. The SWOT analysis employed to assign enforceable strategies; then, the BSC parameters were used as criteria in order to rank the strategies. The weight of criteria (the BSC parameters) and the priority of alternatives (generated strategies by SWOT) were earned by FAHP and FTOPSIS respectively. The results show that improving the ability of exploitation and production outperforms other strategies.","[Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Fouladgar, Mohammad Majid; Yazdani-Chamzini, Abdolreza] Fateh Res Grp, Dept Strateg Management, Tehran, Iran",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Zavadskas, EK (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",manager@fatehidea.com; a.yazdani@fatehidea.com; Edmundas.Zavadskas@vgtu.lt,"Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018; Yazdani-Chamzini, Abdolreza/ABH-5851-2020","Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X; Yazdani-Chamzini, Abdolreza/0000-0001-5594-7726",,,,,80,53,54,1,52,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

To do so we compare the effects of three decision-making rules for the firm (decisions by CEOs, majority rule and consensus) to each other and to decisions in a benchmark consisting of single-individual firms. It has been argued elsewhere that groups behave more competitively than individuals. In this setting this predicts that for all three decision-making rules we should observe fewer cartels and lower prices. This is not what we find. For the formation of cartels, there are no differences across treatments. For prices asked, we find that first, cartels lead to higher prices in all treatments, despite the fact that they are non-binding. Second, the decision-making rules strongly affect the prices asked. One thing that stands out is that firms run by CEOs ask higher prices (i.e., defect less often from the cartel) than observed in the other treatments. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The empirical results show relatively modest impact of the dynamics of large enterprises on the dynamics of micro and small enterprises in the wood industry. The rate of value-added per employee and the rate of capital profitability are significantly associated with investments, particularly investments into new technological equipment. Easier access to financial means for micro and small enterprises at acceptable guarantees and reduction in costs of financing of capital are among possible measures to improve wood industry enterprise performance and entry into foreign markets as well as to efficiently reduce imports of wood raw materials and low value-added wood semi-products and to increase exports of higher value-added products and services.","[Kocjancic, Joze; Bojnec, Stefan] Univ Primorska, Fac Management Koper, Koper 6000, Slovenia",University of Primorska,"Kocjancic, J (通讯作者)，Univ Primorska, Fac Management Koper, Cankarjeva 5, Koper 6000, Slovenia.",joze.kocjancic@siol.net; stefan.bojnec@fm-kp.si,"Bojnec, Stefan/AFG-8313-2022","Bojnec, Stefan/0000-0002-1270-6372",,,,,37,1,1,0,6,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIVERSITY PULA,PULA,"PRERADOVICEVA 1-1, PULA, 52 100, CROATIA",1331-677X,,,EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We find that a restrictive monetary shock has a significant negative effect on the inflation rate in all the countries considered. In response to a one-percentage-point shock in the nominal interest rate, inflation falls by half to one percentage point and returns to steady state after four to six months. Therefore, inflation targeting is likely to be an effective strategy on these countries' way to join the European Monetary Union.

For an empirically plausible parametrization of these frictions, the optimal monetary policy should focus on stabilizing the inflation rate.

This practice imposes the assumption that there is no within-household inequality. In this paper, we show that ignoring consumption inequality within households produces misleading estimates of inequality along two dimensions. To illustrate this point, we use a collective model of household behaviour to estimate consumption inequality in the U.K. from 1968 to 2001. First, the use of adult equivalence scales underestimates the initial level of cross-sectional consumption inequality by 50%, as large differences in the earnings of husbands and wives translate into large differences in consumption allocations within households. Second, we estimate the rise in between-household inequality has been accompanied by an offsetting reduction in within-household inequality. Our findings also indicate that increases in marital sorting on wages and hours worked can simultaneously explain two-thirds of the decline in withinhousehold inequality and between a quarter and one-half of the rise in between-household inequality for one and two adult households.","[Lise, Jeremy] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Lise, Jeremy] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [Seitz, Shannon] Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA; [Seitz, Shannon] Queens Univ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",University of London; University College London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Boston College; Queens University - Canada,"Lise, J (通讯作者)，UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England.",,,,"ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1, RES-544-28-5001] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,47,99,114,4,53,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

In particular, I test (1) whether it is better to lose early or late in the season, (2) whether teams benefit from playing stronger opponents and (3) whether teams are rewarded for winning by large margins.

Conversely, TAC system harms biodiversity leading to increased capital effort and reduced catch levels. Another interesting finding is the existence of an Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC)-type relationship between per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and fish catch.

The business cycle indicators are obtained from seasonally-adjusted monthly manufacturing production. Our results confirm that the Mexican aggregate cycle is highly synchronized with the US business cycle. However, although specific Mexican state cycles are pro-cyclical with respect to the US business cycle, their synchronization is very heterogeneous. In particular, it is strong and robust only for the states of Baja California, Jalisco, Nuevo Leon and the Federal District, and at least moderate for the state of Mexico and Queretaro. The results are robust with respect to three different detrending methods. Synchronization may be explained by the high volumes of international trade carried out by foreign firms in the case of the central and traditionally industrialized states, and by the maquila production in the Northern bordering states. This synchronization may be explained by the vertical integration of the productive processes resulting from the internationalization of production of multinational firms.","[Mejia-Reyes, Pablo; Campos-Chavez, Jeanett] Univ Autonoma Estado Mexico UAEMEX, Fac Econ, Toluca, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Mexico,"Mejía-Reyes, P (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Estado Mexico UAEMEX, Fac Econ, Toluca, Mexico.",pmejiare@uaemex.mx; jeanet-tcach7@hotmail.com,"Mejía-Reyes, Pablo/AAC-8575-2020","Mejia-Reyes, Pablo/0000-0002-9222-1526",,,,,54,17,21,0,5,CENTRO DE INVESTIGACION Y DOCENCIA ECONOMICAS,LOMAS DE SANTA FE,"CARRETERA MEXICO-TOLUCA 3655, LOMAS DE SANTA FE 01210 D F, MEXICO",1665-2045,,,ECON MEX,Econ.

Nominal interest rates are modeled as censored variables with Tobit-type non-linearity and are incorporated into the TVP-VAR framework. For estimation, an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is constructed in the context of Bayesian inference. The model is applied to Japanese macroeconomic data, including the periods of the zero interest rates policy and the quantitative easing policy. The empirical results show that a dynamic relationship between monetary policy and macroeconomic variables operates through changes in medium-term interest rates rather than policy interest rates under the ZLB. However, the explicit consideration of the ZLB does not otherwise affect macroeconomic dynamics.","[Nakajima, Jouchi] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Duke University,"Nakajima, J (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",jouchi.nakajima@stat.duke.edu,,,,,,,33,6,6,1,37,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6116,1935-1690,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

The purpose of this study is to investigate some of the theories as to why co-authorship has been increasing in the economics profession. Using data on the publication records of faculty at 129 US colleges and universities that offer doctoral degrees in Economics, Poisson and logit regression models are estimated to explain co-authorship. Results indicate that the likelihood of co-authorship is greater for papers that combine quantitative analysis with another field and for papers published in higher quality journals. Further, co-authorship appears to differ in the many subfields of economics, with the field of Economic History and History of Thought (Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) categories N and B) to be the least likely to co-author and the fields of Financial Economics (JEL category G) and Agricultural and Natural Resource Economics (JEL category Q) to be the most prone to co-authorship.","[Nowell, Cliff; Grijalva, Therese] Weber State Univ, Dept Econ, Ogden, UT 84408 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Weber State University,"Grijalva, T (通讯作者)，Weber State Univ, Dept Econ, Ogden, UT 84408 USA.",tgrijalva@weber.edu,,"Grijalva, Therese/0000-0003-0618-3496",,,,,14,16,16,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The findings of these studies vary sporadically in terms of the degree of tax shifting. The competitiveness of housing markets may significantly influence the degree of tax shifting. In this article, we allow a nonzero price-cost markup in the hedonic price equation and examine the impact of market power on property tax shifting. In our case study, we examine the property-specific characteristics, occupancy record and local property tax associated with hundreds of managed rental properties in central New Hampshire. The results show that, depending on the degree of market power exercised by a property management firm, the anti-competitive structure of the market may significantly contribute to property tax shifting from property owners to property renters.","[Oektem, Mustafa] JP Morgan Chase & Co, Columbus, OH USA; [Huang, Ju-Chin] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Econ, Durham, NC USA",JP Morgan Chase & Company; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire,"Öktem, M (通讯作者)，JP Morgan Chase & Co, 1111 Polaris Pkwy, Columbus, OH USA.",mustafa_oktem@hotmail.com,,,,,,,36,2,2,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The main result of the paper is that single and multiple lottery mechanisms are equivalent for the problem of allocating students to schools in which students have strict preferences and the schools are indifferent. In proving this result, a new approach is introduced that simplifies and unifies all the known equivalence results in the house allocation literature. Along the way, two new mechanisms-Partitioned Random Priority and Partitioned Random Endowment-are introduced for the house allocation problem. These mechanisms generalize widely studied mechanisms for the house allocation problem and may be appropriate for the many-to-one setting such as the school choice problem.","[Pathak, Parag A.] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Sethuraman, Jay] Columbia Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Operat Res, New York, NY 10027 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Columbia University,"Pathak, PA (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",ppathak@mit.edu; jay@ieor.columbia.edu,,,,,,,25,41,50,1,12,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

The seemingly simple notion of combining two or more choice tasks for the same people offers considerable potential to develop and test theory, as illustrated with the new framework.","[Rungie, Campbell M.] Univ South Australia, Sch Mkt, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia; [Coote, Leonard V.] Univ Queensland, UQ Business Sch, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Louviere, Jordan J.] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Study Choice, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia",University of South Australia; University of Queensland; University of Technology Sydney,"Rungie, CM (通讯作者)，Univ South Australia, Sch Mkt, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.",cam.rungie@unisa.edu.au; l.coote@business.uq.edu.au; Jordan.louviere@uts.edu.au,,,Australian Research Council [DP0880074]; Australian Research Council [DP0880074] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"A grant from the Australian Research Council supported this study (DP0880074).

Survey data for Croatia, Slovenia and Slovakia are employed to provide an answer. The results confirm the role of network effects and of remittances. Furthermore, the extent of currency substitution is found to be positively associated with the level of income and education. An important aspect of euroization seems to be age (older people are more likely to hold foreign currencies). In contrast, neither expectations about inflation rates, nor about exchange rates, do seem to affect the degree of euroization in a systematic and predictable way. Trust in the banking system is found to affect the choice between foreign currency cash and foreign currency deposits. Overall, the results support the view that the persistence in the use of foreign currencies is driven to a large extent by factors that are related to the past.","Oesterreich Nationalbank, Econ Studies Div, A-1011 Vienna, Austria",Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB),"Stix, H (通讯作者)，Oesterreich Nationalbank, Econ Studies Div, POB 61, A-1011 Vienna, Austria.",helmut.stix@oenb.at,,,,,,,20,3,3,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

There are different approaches how to evaluate the customer portfolio, starting from Customer Life Time models, Retention and Migration models, RFM models and Capital Asset Pricing model to models based on activity and costs to serve. Although the idea that marketing should be concerned with the profitability of individual customers is not new, insufficient situation occurs both in theoretical and practical approaches. Marketing is entering a stage where investment and returns can be credibly measured and indeed marketing functions can be related to market capitalization and shareholder value creation. Also managers' ability (based on proper assessment) to construct an efficient customer portfolio can create a substantial competition advantage. This contribution treats with four research objectives: to provide overview (with commentary) on current methods of customer base assessment; to advocate the theoretical framework of considering customer portfolio as one of company's asset; to outline the basic issues which are usually abstracted from (but due to current trend they have been no more just a marginal issue); to formulate an alternative methodological approach in order to precise the outcomes of customer profitability evaluation. This article also mentions the evolution from product or brand-centred marketing to customer-centred marketing. Although the objective of this article is to review the arguments for the customer equity management paradigm in marketing, it also aims to develop implications for research and practice.","[Tislerova, Kamila] Univ JE Purkyne, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Dept Business Adm, Usti Nad Labem 40096, Czech Republic",University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,,kamila.tislerova@ujep.cz,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,4,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-755-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,497,506,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT98,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300261200054,0

The key findings through a dynamic panel model controlling for unobserved prefecture-specific fixed effects are as follows: (1) influence from others is stronger when people live more closely and cohesively. A tightly knit society results in a reduction of smoking through smoking-related interaction. (2) Smoking and drinking have a complementary relationship: greater initial consumption of alcohol results in larger consumption of cigarettes. (3) The complementary relationship between smoking and drinking is attenuated if the cost of committing the annoying conduct (i.e., smoking) is high. Overall, this empirical study provides evidence that the psychological effect of the presence of surrounding people has a direct significant effect upon smoking behavior and, furthermore, that it attenuates the complementary relationship between smoking and drinking, thereby reducing cigarette consumption. These results indicate that not only formal rules but also tacitly formed informal norms are effective deterrents to smoking. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

By breaking our data period into two subperiods around the financial crisis, we find that Chinese banks were even more exposed in the post-crisis period, despite the fact that the renminbi reverted to a de facto peg against the dollar in September 2008. This cannot be explained by direct foreign exchange exposure, and we argue that China's banks are subject to substantial indirect exposure as a result of concerns about their loan books in the face of anticipated further appreciation of the RMB.

Since the late 1990s, VDC growth has been driven primarily by an increase in claims from Vietnam veterans, raising concerns about costs as well as health. We use the draft lottery to study the long-term effects of Vietnam-era military service on health and work in the 2000 Census. We find no evidence that military service affected overall employment rates or overall work-limiting disability rates (that is, health conditions that make work difficult). At the same time, military service sharply increased federal transfer income, especially for lower skilled white men, among whom there was also a large negative impact on employment and a marked increase in disability rates. The differential impact of Vietnam-era service on low-skilled men cannot be explained by more combat or war-theatre exposure for the least educated, because high school graduates were at least as likely to be exposed to combat or war theatre as the less-educated. This leaves the relative attractiveness of VDC for less-skilled men and the work disincentives embedded in the VDC system as a likely explanation for our findings. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We derive a generalisation of the New Keynesian Phillips curve in which inflation is a non-linear function of the output gap and show that the optimal response of the policy rule to inflation depends on the slope of the Phillips curve; if this is flat, manipulation of aggregate demand through monetary policy does not affect inflation and so policymakers cannot affect inflation. We estimate the monetary policy rules implied by a variety of alternative Phillips curves; our preferred model is based on a Phillips curve that is flat when output is close to equilibrium. We find that policy rates do not respond to inflation when the output gap is small, a situation that characterised most of the Great Moderation period. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Current account surpluses in several emerging market economies are said to have put significant downward pressure on world interest rates, thereby fueling a credit boom and risk taking in major advanced economies with current account deficits (the excess saving view). We argue that this perspective on global imbalances bears reconsideration. We highlight two conceptual problems: (i) explaining market interest rates through the saving-investment framework; and (ii) drawing inferences about a country's cross-border financing activity based on observations of net capital flows. We trace the shortcomings of this perspective to a failure to consider the distinguishing characteristics of a monetary (credit) economy.

Individuals differ in working ability and schooling cost, the search market is segmented by education, and there is free entry of new firms in each sector. Self-selection in education causes composition effects in the distribution of skills across sectors. This in turn modifies the intensity of job creation, implying the private and social returns to schooling always differ. Provided that ability and schooling cost are not too positively correlated, agents with large schooling costs - the 'poor' - underinvest in education, while there is overinvestment among the low schooling cost individuals the 'rich'.

This interconnected economic evolution-what economists call general equilibrium growth-holds important implications for inequality across and within generations. This paper presents such a general equilibrium model. It features six goods, five regions, three skill groups, and 91 overlapping generations, each making life-cycle consumption and labour-supply decisions. The model pays special attention to the evolution of the Chinese and Indian economies. Thanks to their rapid technological advance and vast populations, these nations will play an ever more dominant role in determining the world's supplies of capital and labour, particularly unskilled labour. The good news for the developed world is that China and India will supply it with major amounts of capital over time, thanks to their high saving rates. The bad news is that these economies are also likely to bring much more unskilled relative to skilled labour into the market, which will, over time, dramatically reduce the relative wages of unskilled workers in the US, Europe, and Japan. This relative increase in the world supply of unskilled workers reflects, in large part, the simple fact that China and India are gradually bringing each of their skill groups up to Western standards, but have relatively more unskilled labour in their work forces.","[Fehr, Hans] Univ Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany; [Jokisch, Sabine] Univ Ulm, D-89069 Ulm, Germany; [Kotlikoff, Laurence J.] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Kotlikoff, Laurence J.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Wurzburg; Ulm University; Boston University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Fehr, H (通讯作者)，Univ Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.",hans.fehr@uni-wuerzburg.de; sabine.jokisch@uni-ulm.de; kotlikoff@bu.edu,,,,,,,41,4,4,0,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Perceptions-based indicators are sometimes used to measure the quality of the business environment. For instance, firms are asked about the major constraints on business operations and expansion. Little is known, however, about what shapes their responses. In this paper, using perceptions-based indicators from 38 countries (84 country-year pairs) from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys, we argue that firm responses are critically influenced by macroeconomic conditions. Paradoxically, we find that perceptions worsen during periods of high GDP growth. We also examine other indicators from the Enterprise Surveys that are objective measures of constraints, and find mixed evidence on how business constraints vary with the business cycle. Finally, we find that firms that introduce new product lines, which are likely those with the most interactions with regulatory agencies, have particularly bad perceptions of the business environment. We conclude that changes in firms' perceptions over time may not reflect changes in the business environment. Journal of Comparative Economics 38 (4) (2010) 419-431.

While these simple economic theories of exchange rate and interest rate determination are theoretically attractive, the empirical support for these equilibrium conditions is at best mixed. Many potential reasons have been cited in the literature for the failure of such studies, ranging from market imperfections to inappropriate modelling strategies. The current state-of-the-art procedure involves testing for two cointegrating vectors in a multivariate error correction model which may be economically identified as the PPP and UIP relations. However, such a procedure does not account for policy regime shifts which distort the underlying PPP and UIP relations. In this paper, a Markov-switching vector error correction model (VECM) is considered for time series data in which monetary and exchange rate regime shifts are known to be present. Weak evidence in favour of PPP and UIP is established in a standard linear VECM, although the residuals of this model indicate that it is inappropriate in terms of functional form. The Markov-switching VECM, however, provides convincing evidence in favour of both the PPP and UIP relations and a marked improvement in the residual distributions.","[Lacerda, Miguel; Haines, Linda M.] Univ Cape Town, Dept Stat Sci, ZA-7700 Cape Town, South Africa; [Fedderke, Johannes W.] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Fedderke, Johannes W.] Univ Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Cape Town; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; University of Witwatersrand,"Lacerda, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Dept Stat Sci, ZA-7700 Cape Town, South Africa.",miguel.lacerda@uct.ac.za,"Fedderke, Johannes/N-1411-2019","Fedderke, Johannes/0000-0003-4482-5939",,,,,25,7,7,0,6,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0038-2280,,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Many critics have argued that fair-value accounting, often also called mark-to-market accounting, has significantly contributed to the financial crisis or, at least, exacerbated its severity. In this paper, we assess these arguments and examine the role of fair-value accounting in the financial crisis using descriptive data and empirical evidence. Based on our analysis, it is unlikely that fair-value accounting added to the severity of the 2008 financial crisis in a major way. While there may have been downward spirals or asset-fire sales in certain markets, we find little evidence that these effects are the result of fair-value accounting. We also find little support for claims that fair-value accounting leads to excessive write-downs of banks' assets. If anything, empirical evidence to date points in the opposite direction, that is, toward the overvaluation of bank assets during the crisis.","[Laux, Christian] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria; [Leuz, Christian] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Leuz, Christian] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Vienna University of Economics & Business; University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Laux, C (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria.",,"Leuz, Christian/U-3336-2019; Leuz, Christian/E-5055-2011","Leuz, Christian/0000-0003-4370-6209; Leuz, Christian/0000-0003-4370-6209; Laux, Christian/0000-0003-2580-7313",,,,,70,244,277,4,82,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We find that the magnitude of price dispersion is a function of the characteristics of both the type of good and set of locations under examination. Higher share of non-traded inputs and lower tradability of goods are both found to contribute to geographic price dispersion, with the former typically dominating in explanatory power. The role of tradability of good in accounting for the price dispersion is more significant as we move beyond an economic geography, while non-traded input level matters relatively more if we move to the interior of this geography. Our evidence suggests that the models of real exchange rates should incorporate the classical distinction between traded inputs and local inputs as well as a role for relative markups and traditional trade costs.

Using Survey of Income and Program Participation data on U.S. households, we test the importance of both stable and transitory income components in determining food insufficiency. In a logistic regression model, we find that both the level of income and negative income shocks affect the predicted probability of food insufficiency, while positive income shocks do not. Although we do not have a definitive measure of a household's liquidity constraint status, our work suggests that negative shocks may matter more for households that face liquidity constraints. Understanding the role of income shocks in determining food insufficiency is especially important in light of recent policy changes. It is likely that welfare reform in the U.S. increased the volatility of income in the low-income population. Our findings here suggest that this increase in volatility may not be without consequence.","[Leete, Laura; Bania, Neil] Univ Oregon, Dept Planning Publ Policy & Management, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",University of Oregon,"Leete, L (通讯作者)，Univ Oregon, Dept Planning Publ Policy & Management, 1209 Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",leete@uoregon.edu; bania@uoregon.edu,,,,,,,40,111,142,1,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Our model theoretically supports what empirical evidence has shown and holds; that databases are not yet developed enough to understand the whole exit process. We demonstrate that the possibility of recovering some share of investment costs makes entry more than just a production decision. Within a defined time horizon, a firm can enter the market despite making a loss from production output since the firm's return consists of both sales and investment cost recovery.

The analysis is also done for the three sub-periods determined by considering the structural changes such as the Great Moderation in the series of the UK. Two findings are obtained. First, the evidence obtained from the full period supports a number of important conclusions, one of which is mixed evidence regarding the effect of inflation on inflation uncertainty, another one being strong evidence regarding the positive effect of inflation uncertainty on inflation and output growth. Taking this into account, it is possible to put forward that an essential determinant of economic growth is uncertainty about the inflation rate. The last finding for this period is that output growth uncertainty is a positive determinant of the inflation and output growth rate. Second, the evidence found from the sub-periods is that there are no linkages between inflation, output growth and their volatility.","Gazi Univ, Ankara, Turkey",Gazi University,"Ozdemir, ZA (通讯作者)，Gazi Univ, Ankara, Turkey.",,,"ozdemir, zeynel abidin/0000-0001-8600-0463",,,,,66,12,15,1,14,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1463-6786,,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

By capturing the redistribution objective and the urban food security objective in a political preference function, we provide some rigorous explanations of three important aspects of China's grain policies: the choice of the dual-track procurement system over the lump-sum tax scheme as a means of extracting economic surpluses from the grain sector; the suppression of the procurement price to its minimum until the mid-1990s; and the switch from taxing to subsidizing grain production at end-1996. Our findings underscore the paramount importance of the urban food security objective behind the evolution of China's grain procurement policy, including the liberalization of the system in the 2000s.

In this paper, we use data from the 1986,1991,1996 and 2001 New Zealand census to examine the long-run impact that these reforms had on local communities. We analyse the adjustment process in 140 local labour market areas by creating three measures of the impact of structural reform on local communities and examining the persistence of these shocks over time. We find that communities which experienced smaller employment shocks have higher employment rates and a more skilled workforce in the medium and long-term. Population shocks also have positive, sizeable and persistent effect on future population size. Overall, the initial impacts of the reforms undertaken in New Zealand on local communities appear to still endure more than a decade later. Journal of Comparative Economics 38 (4)(2010) 432-448.

Experimental results show that RAD and VCG are both more efficient than Knapsack, while Knapsack achieves a more equal distribution of resources than RAD or VCG.

More specifically, I use three subsamples of older respondents (those who live in urban areas, those who live in rural areas, and the pooled sample of both) to analyze the impact of bequest motives and other factors on the probability of parent-child co-residence. The results are as follows: bequest motives are strong in China, with more than 60% of respondents having a bequest motive, and the parent-child co-residence rate is also high (about 60%). Turning to the determinants of parent-child co-residence, children of urban parents are more likely to live with their older parents if their parents have a bequest motive, own their own homes, and live in an area where housing prices are high, a result which is consistent with both the selfish life-cycle and altruism models. Children are more likely to live with their older parents if their parents have a bequest motive in both the rural and combined samples, which implies that children are selfishly motivated and that the selfish life-cycle model applies in China.

We focus on many features of behavior within the street gang, also noting the existence of other gang-like groups, and show how apparently irrational behavior can signal the possession of valuable human capital. We contend that gangs are formed around particular traits of direct value to the group, and therefore of indirect value to the gang member, and construct a model with a separating equilibrium consistent with the existence of a large gap between the characteristics of gang members and the rest of society. Policy implications include a deduction that increasing the opportunities for gang members outside of life in the gang, perhaps through offering an amnesty, might reduce gangs but will unambiguously make remaining gangs even nastier.","[Dnes, Antony W.] Univ Hull, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England; [Garoupa, Nuno] Univ Illinois, Coll Law, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",University of Hull; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Dnes, AW (通讯作者)，Univ Hull, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England.",a.dnes@hull.ac.uk; ngaroupa@law.uiuc.edu,,,,,,,48,13,13,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,NOV 10,2010,63.0,4,,,,,517,529,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2010.00485.x,0.0,,,13,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,665XS,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000283071600005,0

We identify that one reason for differences is that models may represent clubs as hiring from the pool of talent either simultaneously or in a leader-follower fashion (such that strong clubs have first pick of players). With the latter assumption, we suggest that there is an effect, the sign depending on how many extra talented players are admitted to the pool. Whether balance is modified favourably or unfavourably when, for example, foreign players are introduced is therefore an empirical matter. In our statistical analysis, we test for effects from the liberalisation of football player labour markets associated with the Bosman Ruling. We show that, across seventeen European football leagues, results derived from indicators based on tables of aggregated seasonal performance (for example, concentration ratios) point to an improvement in within-season (but not cross-season) competitive balance following Bosman.","[Flores, Ramon; Tena, J.

The analysis suggests that the markup on one of the goods might be negative and that the existence of consumers who buy both goods can either increase or decrease markups. Surprisingly, the addition of the consumers who buy both goods (unchanging the number of the other consumers) might decrease profits, and increasing the number of consumers who buy one good might also reduce profits. This suggests that firms should consider carefully how additional customers might affect the competitive environment and the equilibrium before attempting to attract them to the market.

Our natural experiment for competition is mergers of brokerage houses, which result in the firing of analysts because of redundancy (e.g., one of the two oil stock analysts is let go) and other reasons such as culture clash. We use this decrease in analyst coverage for stocks covered by both merging houses before the merger (the treatment sample) to measure the causal effect of competition on bias. We find that the treatment sample simultaneously experiences a decrease in analyst coverage and an increase in optimism bias the year after the merger relative to a control group of stocks, consistent with competition reducing bias. The implied economic effect from our natural experiment is significantly larger than estimates from OLS regressions that do not correct for the endogeneity of coverage. This effect is much more significant for stocks with little initial analyst coverage or competition.","[Hong, Harrison] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Hong, Harrison; Kacperczyk, Marcin] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kacperczyk, Marcin] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",Princeton University; National Bureau of Economic Research; New York University,"Hong, H (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,"Kacperczyk, Marcin/AGG-9764-2022",,,,,,25,209,267,8,57,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Growth depends on imports of capital goods which are paid with exports (there are no capital flows) and hence is constrained by equilibrium in current account. The role of the elasticity of labour supply is to prevent the real exchange rate from appreciating as the economy grows, thereby sustaining international competitiveness.

In the market firms interact with several workers but do not have information about workers' behavior in the past. In the bilateral negotiations firms negotiate bilaterally with prospective workers and learn about workers' performance in previous jobs. We show that the interaction between social preferences, the incompleteness of contracts and the existence of information about a worker's past performance provides an explanation for firms forgoing market opportunities and bilaterally negotiating with a worker. We observe that approximately 30% of all job contracts were bilaterally negotiated when these contracts are incomplete as opposed to only 10% when contracts were complete. The surplus from trade is higher when incomplete contracts can be bilaterally negotiated, which can be attributed to the presence of information. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We show that such standard securities are poor inflation hedges. Expanding the menu of assets to Treasury bills, foreign bonds, real estate and gold improves matters but inflation risk remains difficult to hedge. We then describe how state-of-the-art term structure research has tried to uncover estimates of the inflation risk premium, the compensation for bearing inflation risk. Most studies, including very recent ones that actually use inflation-linked bonds and information in surveys to gauge inflation expectations, find the inflation risk premium to be sizeable and to substantially vary through time. This implies that governments should normally lower their financing costs through the issuance of index-linked bonds, at least in an ex ante sense. Our findings thus indicate a potentially important role for inflation index linked bonds. We briefly discuss the pros and cons of such bonds, focusing the discussion mostly on the situation in the United States, which started to issue Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) in 1997. We argue that it is hard to negate the benefits of such securities for all relevant parties, unless the market in which they trade is highly deficient, which was actually the case in its early years in the United States. - Geert Bekaert and Xiaozheng Wang.","[Bekaert, Geert] Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY USA",Columbia University,"Bekaert, G (通讯作者)，Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY USA.",,"Zhang, Yanyan/JFA-9161-2023",,,,,,60,77,89,1,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

With 20% probability, responders were restricted to keep any money passed. Only responders knew whether they were restricted or not. We find that the behavior of responders is different in this modified trust game. The fact that responders can hide selfish acts generates more selfish behavior. This in turn makes proposers less likely to pass money to responders, thereby destroying trust. We find important session effects in the standard trust game but less so in the modified game.

Interestingly, the results are at odds with empirical evidence. In particular, recent studies point to an asymmetric relationship between inflation and the real economy across countries. Specifically, inflation and output are negatively correlated in poor countries. In contrast, inflation is associated with higher levels of economic activity in advanced economies. I present a monetary growth model with public debt, where the exposure to risk is inversely related to the level of income. In this setting, I demonstrate that the effects of monetary policy depend on the level of capital of the economy. In poor countries, banks' portfolios consist primarily of government liabilities. Therefore, a higher rate of money creation inhibits capital formation in these economies. In contrast, banks devote more resources toward productive uses in advanced countries. Consequently, monetary policy generates a Tobin effect.","Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Ghossoub, EA (通讯作者)，Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, 1 UTSA Circle, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.",Edgar.Ghossoub@UTSA.edu,,,,,,,18,0,1,0,9,UNIV NORTH CAROLINA,CHAPEL HILL,"SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL, CHAPEL HILL, NC 27514 USA",0038-4038,,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

There are two disparate approaches to transmission investment: one employs the theory based on long-run financial rights (LTFTR) to transmission (merchant approach), while the other is based on the incentive-regulation hypothesis (regulatory approach). In this paper we consider the elements that could combine the merchant and regulatory approaches in a setting with price-taking electricity generators and loads. The monopoly transmission firm (Transco) is regulated through benchmark or price regulation to provide long-term investment incentives. The two-part tariff approach used can be analyzed analytically only for well-behaved cost and demand functions. We explore a series of simplified transmission grids to argue that in a variety of circumstances those functions could have reasonable economic properties. The results suggest directions for further research to explore the properties of the cost functions and implications for design of practical incentive mechanisms and the integration with merchant investment in organized markets with LTFTRs.","[Vogelsang, Ingo] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Rosellon, Juan] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Rosellon, Juan] CIDE, Mexico City 01210, DF, Mexico; [Hogan, William] Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Boston University; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

This study presents the results of an experimental investigation modeling the choice to disinvest as a dynamic problem of optimal stopping in which the patterns of decisions are analyzed with entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs. Our experimental results reject the standard net present value approach as an account of observed behavior. Instead, most individuals seem to understand the value of waiting. Their choices are weakly related to the disinvestment triggers derived from a formal optimal stopping benchmark consistent with real-options reasoning. We also observe a pronounced 'psychological inertia', i.e., most individuals hold on to a losing project for even longer than real-options reasoning would predict. The study provides evidence for entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs being quite similar in their behavior. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Cyclicality in infant mortality in India,JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Infant mortality; Business cycles; India; Health care; Maternal labor supply; Public expenditure; Gender,HEALTH; INSURANCE; SHOCKS; CRISIS; WORK; RISK,"This paper investigates the impact of aggregate income shocks on infant mortality in India and investigates likely mechanisms. A recent OECD-dominated literature reports the provocative finding that mortality at most ages is pro-cyclical. Similar analyses for poorer countries are scarce, and both income risk and mortality risk are greater in poor countries. This paper uses data and methods designed to avoid some of the specification problems in previous studies and it explores mechanisms and extensions that have not been previously considered. It uses individual data on infant mortality for about 150,000 children born in 19701997, merged by cohort and state of birth with a state panel containing information on aggregate income. Identification rests upon comparing the effects of annual deviations in income from trend on the mortality risks of children born at different times to the same mother, conditional upon a number of state-time varying covariates including rainshocks and state social expenditure. Rural infant mortality is counter-cyclical, the elasticity being about -0.33. This is despite the finding that relatively high-risk women avert birth or suffer fetal loss in recessions. It seems in part related to recessions stimulating distress labor amongst mothers, in contrast to the case in richer countries, where they discourage labor market participation. Health-care seeking declines in recessions, and this appears to be related to the opportunity cost of maternal time. Disaggregation reveals that the average results are driven by rural households in which the mother is uneducated or had her first birth in teenage, and that it is only girls that are at risk: boys are protected from income shocks. Exposure to poor conditions in the fetal and neonatal period appears to have a larger effect on infant mortality than similar exposure in the postneonatal period. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We focus especially on the effects of tightening financial constraints on macroeconomic performance, entrepreneurial risk-taking, and social mobility. Contrary to many models in the literature, our comparative static results cover a broad range for financial constraints, from an unrestrained to a perfectly constrained economy. We find substantial gains in output, welfare, and wealth equality associated with credit market improvements. The marginal gains from relaxing constraints are largest for empirically relevant debt-equity ratios. Interestingly, the entrepreneurship rate and social mobility respond non-monotonically to a change in the tightness of financial constraints. The results crucially depend on feedback effects in general equilibrium, where optimal firm sizes and the demand for credit are endogenously determined. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, in order to implement their method, they assumed that the firm maximized revenue in each period, conditional on the observed input vector in each period, taking output prices as fixed. This assumption is not warranted when there are increasing returns to scale. Thus in the present paper, it is assumed that the firm solves a monopolistic profit maximization problem when there are increasing returns to scale and the results of Caves, Christensen and Diewert are modified in accordance with this assumption.","[Diewert, W.

The main hypothesis is that social pressure creates incentives to vote for the purpose of being seen at the voting act. This incentive is particularly high in small and close-knit communities. Empirically, I analyze the effect of postal voting on voter participation in Switzerland. Optional postal voting decreased the voting costs, but simultaneously removed the social pressure to vote. In spite of the large reduction in voting costs, the effect on aggregate turnout was small. However, voter participation was more negatively affected in the smaller communities. This lends support to the view that social incentives played a role for certain people's voting decisions.

The evidence of nonlinear adjustment in real exchange rates suggests the estimation of a nonlinear SETAR model. While linear half-life estimates are biased upward (five years on average), SETAR half-life estimates imply a faster reverting process (1.5 years on average). Moreover, we found that TPI-based real exchange rates are more appropriate than CPI-based real exchange rates in testing for PPP hypothesis. For the cluster of EMU countries and for the pre-EMU period, our nonlinear model confirms stationarity for the majority of the TPI-based real exchange rates with half-life estimates less than a year.","[Giannellis, Nikolaos] Univ Ioannina, Dept Econ, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece; [Papadopoulos, Athanasios P.] Univ Crete, Dept Econ, GR-74100 Rethimnon, Greece",University of Ioannina; University of Crete,"Giannellis, N (通讯作者)，Univ Ioannina, Dept Econ, Univ Campus,POB 1186, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece.",ngianel@cc.uoi.gr; appapa@econ.soc.uoc.gr,"Giannellis, Nikolaos/AAE-5084-2021; Papadopoulos, Athanasios/M-3412-2014","Papadopoulos, Athanasios/0000-0002-2226-3077",,,,,20,5,5,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

These transit lags are trade barriers for firms facing volatile demand, who must place orders before knowing the resolution of demand uncertainty. We provide a model in which airplanes bring producers and consumers together in time. Fast transport allows firms to respond quickly to favorable demand realizations and to limit the risk of unprofitably large quantities during low demand periods. The model predicts that the likelihood and extent to which firms employ air shipments is increasing in the volatility of demand they face, decreasing in the air premium they must pay, and increasing in the contemporaneous realization of demand. We confirm all three conjectures using detailed US import data. Fast transport thus provides firms with a real option to smooth demand volatility on international markets, and we provide simple calculations of that option value. This enables us to identify how the option value relates to goods characteristics, and to changes in air transport premia associated with technological and policy change including the introduction of jet engines, and liberalization of trade in air services.

We utilise the Vector Stochastic Process with Dummy Variables (VSPD) method in our empirical work. This approach is a suitable tool to study event-based episodes. Fiscal policy shocks do have an effect on the economic activity of Finland when the time period 1990-2007 is investigated. A positive tax shock (or a policy that increases public sector revenues) seems to have a positive effect on Investment and GDP but the response of private consumption is mixed. Results clearly indicate that increase in Government spending crowds out private sector activity, and the effect takes place sooner than with the Revenue variable in question. This is a clear evidence for the crowding out effect. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, we assess the impact of international trade openness on cities' size. Two main general predictions arise from such a departure. First, the breakpoint with taste heterogeneity is higher than the breakpoint associated without it. Second, for low levels of trade openness urban agglomeration is attenuated with taste heterogeneity. Finally, based upon particular values of the parameters of the model, market outcomes converge to the optimal social welfare outcomes as taste heterogeneity increases.","[Ramirez Grajeda, Mauricio; Cortez Yactayo, Willy Walter] Univ Guadalajara, Ctr Univ Ciencias Econ Adm, Dept Metodos Cuantitativos, Zapopan 45100, Jalisco, Mexico",Universidad de Guadalajara,"Grajeda, MR (通讯作者)，Univ Guadalajara, Ctr Univ Ciencias Econ Adm, Dept Metodos Cuantitativos, Perifer Norte 799, Zapopan 45100, Jalisco, Mexico.",maurmez@yahoo.com.mx; ww2000_mx@yahoo.com,,"Cortez, Willy/0000-0001-8839-4064",,,,,35,2,2,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1742-1772,,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

It therefore covers periods before and after the changes during the mid-1980s in the maximum entitlement periods for unemployment benefits for older unemployed. The analysis is based on the IAB employment subsample containing administrative data for about 500,000 individuals. Since these data only partly reveal the unemployment duration in an economic sense, we use a narrow and a wide proxy for unemployment. Our empirical analysis finds significant changes in the distribution of non-employment durations for older unemployed. At the same time, the distribution of unemployment durations between jobs remained unchanged after the reforms. Our findings clearly show that many firms and workers used the more beneficial laws as a part of early retirement packages. Surprisingly, for those workers who found and accepted a new job, we do not observe a prolongation of their search periods to a sizeable extent.","[Wilke, Ralf A.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Fitzenberger, Bernd] Univ Freiburg, D-7800 Freiburg, Germany",University of Nottingham; University of Freiburg,"Wilke, RA (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",ralf.wilke@nottingham.ac.uk,,,,,,,27,31,33,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

Allowing zero population growth in three different growth models (the Jones R&D-based model, a learning-by-doing model, and an embodied technical change model) serves as illustration that a continuum of regular growth processes fill the whole range between exponential growth and complete stagnation.","[Groth, Christian] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1455 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Groth, Christian] EPRU, DK-1455 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Koch, Karl-Josef] Univ Siegen, Sch Econ Disciplines, D-57068 Siegen, Germany; [Steger, Thomas M.] Univ Leipzig, Inst Theoret Econ, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany; [Steger, Thomas M.] CESifo, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany",University of Copenhagen; Universitat Siegen; Leipzig University; Ifo Institut,"Groth, C (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1455 Copenhagen, Denmark.",chr.groth@econ.ku.dk,,"Steger, Thomas/0000-0002-2489-6716",,,,,31,14,16,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

We suggest that destination countries with limited resources may prefer to improve the apprehension of smugglers and their clients at the border rather than inland, although either one of these anti-smuggling measures would reduce migrant exploitation. The reason is twofold. First, even if the resulting improvement in border apprehension alone cannot eliminate smuggling, it can do so when combined with a severe penalty for smuggling. Second, even if it is impracticable to set the penalty for smuggling sufficiently high, improved border apprehension reduces smuggling by discouraging existing exploitative smugglers from smuggling, whereas improved inland apprehension either maintains or even increases it by inducing them and those who are not currently smuggling to take up nonexploitative smuggling.

Here, we find sizable welfare gains from liberalization (cost to repression), although the gain in economic growth is ambiguous. We take the view that financial liberalization is a government policy that alters the path of financial deepening, whereas financial deepening is endogenously chosen by agents given a policy and occurs in transition toward a distant steady state. This history-dependent view necessitates the use of simulation analysis based on a growth model.

The competitive pressure of fiscal federalism reduces public sector size, as compared to unitary states. This study uses panel data of Swiss cantons from 1980 to 1998 to empirically analyze the effect of different instruments on government revenue and its structure. Because of the considerable tax autonomy of sub-national Swiss governments, it is possible to investigate different mechanisms by 'which fiscal federalism may influence government size. The results indicate that tax exporting has a revenue-expanding effect; whereas, tax competition favors a smaller size of government. Fragmentation has no robust effect on the size of government revenue for Swiss cantons. The overall effect of revenue decentralization leads to fewer tax revenues but higher user charges. Thus, revenue decentralization favors a smaller size of government revenue and shifts government revenue from taxes to user charges.","[Feld, Lars P.] Heidelberg Univ, Alfred Weber Inst, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany; [Kirchgaessner, Gebhard] Univ St Gallen, SIAW, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland; [Schaltegger, Christoph A.] Univ Lucerne, Oekon Seminar, CH-6000 Luzern, Switzerland",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; University of St Gallen; University of Lucerne,"Feld, LP (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Alfred Weber Inst, Bergheimer Str 58, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany.",feld@uni-hd.de; Gebhard.Kirchgaessner@unisg.ch; Christoph.Schaltegger@economiesuisse.ch,,,,,,,50,34,38,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

We also evaluate the impact of market reforms, especially the reforms that followed Deng Xiaoping's South Trip in 1992 those that resulted from serious hardening of budget constraints of state enterprises around 1997. We find that FDI had a much larger effect on TIP growth before 1994 than after, and we attribute this to the encouragement of and increasing success of private and quasi-private enterprises. We find that human capital positively affects output and productivity growth in our cross-provincial study. Moreover, we find both direct and indirect effects of human capital on TFP growth. These impacts of education are more consistent than those found in cross-national studies. The direct effect is hypothesized to come from domestic innovation activities, while the indirect impact is a spillover effect of human capital on TIP growth. We conduct cost-benefit analysis of hypothetical investments in human capital and infrastructure. We find that, while investment in infrastructure generates higher returns in the developed, eastern regions than in the interior, investing in human capital generates slightly higher or comparable returns in the interior regions. We conclude that human capital investment in less-developed areas is justified on efficiency grounds and because it contributes to a reduction in regional inequality. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We develop a method to compute upper and lower bounds on plant values and investment threshold levels. Our case study uses representative power plant investment and operations data, and historical forward prices from well-functioning energy markets. We find that when the decision to build is considered, the abandonment option does not have significant value, whereas the operating flexibility and time-to-build option have significant effect on the building threshold. Furthermore, the joint value of the operating flexibility and the abandonment option is much smaller than the sum of their separate values, because both are options to shut down.

It proposes a game theoretic model in which durations are determined by strategic agents. In the absence of strategic motives, the model delivers a version of the generalized accelerated failure time model. In its most general form, the system resembles a classical simultaneous equation model in which endogenous variables interact with observable and unobservable exogenous components to characterize an economic environment. In this paper, the endogenous variables are the individually chosen equilibrium durations. Even though a unique solution to the game is not always attainable in this context, the structural elements of the economic system are shown to be semi-parametrically identified.

Splitting up Russian gas monopolist Gazprom into several producing companies was a considered option. In this paper, I examine theoretically and numerically how a split-up of Gazprom would affect Russian national welfare. Results show that under the current gas market structures in Europe and Russia, the split-up of Gazprom's monopoly might not be beneficial for Russia. However, analysis in the paper indicates that the market shares that Gazprom has in both Russian domestic and European gas markets are important in determining whether Gazprom's dominance is supported under the national welfare criteria. When Gazprom has small market share in Europe and large market share in Russia, a break-up of Gazprom might plausibly result in increase of Russian national welfare. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Our game of incomplete information always has an equilibrium in cutoff entry/exit strategies. In contrast, the existence of an equilibrium in the Ericson and Pakes' model of industry dynamics requires admissibility of mixed entry/exit strategies, contrary to the assertion in their article, that existing algorithms cannot cope with. In addition, we provide a condition on the model's primitives that ensures that the equilibrium is in pure investment strategies. Building on this basic existence result, we first show that a symmetric equilibrium exists under appropriate assumptions on the model's primitives. Second, we show that, as the distribution of the random scrap values/setup costs becomes degenerate, equilibria in cutoff entry/exit strategies converge to equilibria in mixed entry/exit strategies of the game of complete information.","[Doraszelski, Ulrich] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Satterthwaite, Mark] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Harvard University; Northwestern University,"Doraszelski, U (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",doraszelski@harvard.edu; m-satterthwaite@kellogg.northwestern.edu,,,,,,,50,102,139,1,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

On the other hand, the wage gap between regular and non-regular workers within a subgroup of similar contract lengths can be quite significant. Among workers with longer contracts, regular workers receive significantly higher wage rates than non-regular workers.

Characteristics of this market are estimated for France and a competitive model is simulated in order to assess to what extent such a model can reproduce the observed chief executive officer (CEO) compensations. The size elasticity of CEOs' compensations in France is equal to 0.5 and justifies a large magnitude in compensations. To moderate these compensations, a wage cap is often called for not only by opinion and the European Left but also, more surprisingly, by representatives of shareholders. The cost of this policy is evaluated in this job assignement model and the lobbying of shareholders is investigated and explained above some thresholds.

The implicit theoretical notion is further enriched and elucidated by the ethnographic narration of a plurality of contested issues and struggles at multiple sites of power. The study addresses how a water-based subaltern movement gradually grew into transverse solidarity within the space between civil society and the state/governing institutions, politicizing them and consequently making allies of them, and how the discursive and material practices of structure-authorities and macro-power relations were contested.","[Raman, K.

The differences between these two indexes come from the export and import components of GDP, and are measured by the trading gains index. Fisher indexes are a natural way to estimate the conceptual economic indexes of trading gains and real GDI because they are averages of the theoretical upper and lower bounds of the economic indexes. They can be decomposed in a way that permits analyses of the factors driving changes in trading gains, such as changes in the terms of trade and in the relative price of tradables, or changes in the prices of particular commodities. Applying these methods to the United States, we find that trading gains have a median absolute effect on U.S. real GDI of 0.2 percentage points in annual data. The petroleum price shocks that occurred in late 1973 and in 1980 subtracted more than a full percentage point from the annual growth of real GDI, and in the first half of 2008 price increases in petroleum and other imported commodities subtracted 2 percentage points from the annual rate of growth of real GDI, making it negative despite the steady growth of real GDP. On the other hand, with petroleum prices excluded, U.S. terms of trade begin to improve steadily starting in 1995 and the relative price of tradables falls. These effects increase the growth rate of U.S. real GDI by 0.15 percent per year on average.","Bur Econ Anal, US Dept Commerce, Washington, DC 20230 USA",,"Reinsdorf, MB (通讯作者)，Bur Econ Anal, US Dept Commerce, 1441 L St,NW,Mail Stop BE-40, Washington, DC 20230 USA.",Marshall.Reinsdorf@BEA.gov,,"Reinsdorf, Marshall/0000-0002-3866-6591",,,,,35,16,19,0,19,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

However, recent experience is not entirely consistent with this conventional wisdom. We suggest an explanation based on variation across countries in firms' reliance on ambient institutions. Large, well-established firms depend less on an economy's institutions than do small and incipient firms. Multinational firms likewise can use their global organizations to sidestep weak local institutions, Firm heterogeneity of this sort can thus contribute to markedly different institutional responses to liberalization-institutional development is better in locations where firms and potential entrants benefit more from such development. Our framework also suggests that institutional development might occur in stages. In an economy whose basic institutions are sound, individuals rationally invest in entrepreneurial capability and firms rationally invest less in institution substitutes. Economies with firms that rely more on ambient institutions or with more potential entrants who would rely on those institutions are more likely to experience further institutional improvement following accession to the global economy Economies with fewer firms or potential entrants dependent on sound institutions, in acceding to the global economy, may exhibit scant institutional improvement, and perhaps even institutional deterioration. Political rent-seeking is not necessary for the latter outcome, but expands the range of conditions under which it ensues.","[Zhao, Minyuan] Univ Michigan, Stephen M Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Fogel, Kathy] Univ Arkansas, Walton Coll Business, WCOB 302, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Morck, Randall] Univ Alberta, Sch Business, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R6, Canada; [Morck, Randall] NBER, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R6, Canada; [Yeung, Bernard] Natl Univ Singapore, NUS Business Sch, Singapore 117592, Singapore; [Yeung, Bernard] NYU, Stern Sch Business, Singapore 117592, Singapore",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; University of Alberta; National University of Singapore,"Zhao, MY (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Stephen M Ross Sch Business, 701 Tappan St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",myzhao@umich.edu; kfogel@uark.edu; randall.morck@ualberta.ca; bizdean@nus.edu.sg,"Zhao, Minyuan/GZL-3641-2022; Morck, Randall/AAD-9048-2019; Yeung, Bernard/B-5759-2016; Yeung, Bernard/AAV-7146-2020","Yeung, Bernard/0000-0003-0949-6965; Yeung, Bernard/0000-0002-6902-863X; Morck, Randall/0000-0001-7412-0222",,,,,9,1,1,0,10,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"238 MAIN ST, STE 500, CAMBRIDGE, 02142-1046 USA",1535-3516,,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.
