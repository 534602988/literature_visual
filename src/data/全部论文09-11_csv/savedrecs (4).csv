This question is important because a social security program that reduces overall inequality by redistributing from high-income individuals to middle-income individuals may do nothing to help the poor; conversely, a program that redistributes to the poor may nonetheless be regressive according to broader measures if it also redistributes from middle- to upper-income households. We have four major findings. First, as we expand the definition of income to use more comprehensive measures of well-being, we find that Social Security becomes less progressive. Indeed, when we use an endowment defined by potential labor earnings at the household level rather than actual earnings at the individual level, we find that Social Security has virtually no effect on overall inequality. Second, we find that this result is driven largely by the lack of redistribution across the middle and upper parts of the income distribution, so it masks some small positive net transfers to those at the bottom of the lifetime income distribution. Third, in cases in which redistribution does occur, we find that it is not efficiently targeted: many high-income households receive positive net transfers, whereas many low-income households pay net taxes. Finally, the redistributive effects of Social Security change over time, and these changes depend on the income concept used to classify someone as poor.","[Brown, Jeffrey R.; Fullerton, Don] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,,,,,,,,,40,4,5,0,9,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60 ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637 USA",0892-8649,,978-0-226-07654-6,TAX POL EC,,,2009,23.0,,,,,,37,72,,10.1086/597054,0.0,,,36,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BKM84,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268600700002,0

(2000, 2002) show that the strong protection of investor rights encourage the development of capital markets and are associated with higher levels of firm valuation as measured by Tobin's Q. Related research finds that well-developed capital markets produce higher rates of economic growth and allocate capital more efficiently. These studies fail, however, to explain how the investor protection environment produces higher firm values or facilitates the more efficient allocation of investment capital. Using a sample of 158 ADRs representing 26 different countries, this study provides such a linkage by examining the effect of investor protection levels on share liquidity and the firm's cost of capital. We find that lower levels of investor protection reduce share liquidity while simultaneously resulting in a higher cost of equity capital. The combination of less liquidity with a higher cost of capital suggests an explanation for the lower values observed for firms incorporated in countries with fewer investor protections.","[Chhabra, Monish; Sen, Nilanjan] Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Banking & Finance, Singapore, Singapore; [Ferris, Stephen P.] Univ Missouri, Dept Finance, Coll Business, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Chhabra, Monish; Sen, Nilanjan] Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Banking & Finance, Singapore, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; Nanyang Technological University,"Ferris, SP (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Dept Finance, Coll Business, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",ferriss@missouri.edu,,,,,,,19,5,6,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The key empirical findings are: (1) EMU helped the restructuring of capital within the same sector of manufacturing activity among euro area firms; (2) joining the EU favoured both horizontal and vertical mergers; (3) policy-makers can help attract capital by reducing the corporate tax rates and the degree of product market regulations and by improving the country's financial systems; (4) the service industry has not yet fully benefited from European integration because the level of protection and barriers to entry in the services sector act as a strong deterrent to cross-border M&As in services.","[Coeurdacier, Nicolas] London Business Sch, London, England; European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany; Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",University of London; London Business School; European Central Bank; Paris School of Economics,"Coeurdacier, N (通讯作者)，London Business Sch, London, England.",,,,,,,,67,64,75,0,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

This paper presents a reference case of the world economy to 2100 and analyses some key regional and global results for the various global mitigation scenarios, including emission prices, emission levels, primary energy consumption and economic growth. Modelling results suggest that a transition to a low-carbon world would require a significant decarbonisation of electricity generation without necessarily cutting the electricity output in the long run. With the uptake of hybrids and non-fossil-fuel technologies, the transport sector could make an important contribution to global abatement of greenhouse gases. Furthermore, with substantial international mitigation efforts and uptake of low- and/or zero-emission technologies, the achievement of 3.7 W/m(2) and 4,5 W/m(2) radiative forcing targets by the end of the century could occur at emission prices of up to $550/t CO2-e. However, achieving the 2.6 W/m(2) (overshoot) radiative forcing target would require considerably higher emission prices and an immediate global mitigation action.

We apply this method by conducting experiments on a class of one-shot coordination games with strategic complementarities and choices between simple lotteries and sure payoff alternatives, both framed in a similar way. Despite the multiplicity of equilibria in the coordination games, aggregate behaviour is fairly predictable. The pure or mixed Nash equilibria cannot describe subjects' behaviour. We present two global games with private information about monetary payoffs and about risk aversion. While previous literature treats the parameters of a global game as given, we estimate them and show that both models describe observed behaviour well. The global-game selection for vanishing noise of private signals offers a good recommendation for actual players, given the observed distribution of actions. We also deduce subjective beliefs and compare them with objective probabilities.","[Heinemann, Frank] Tech Univ Berlin, D-1000 Berlin, Germany; [Nagel, Rosemarie] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain",Technical University of Berlin; Pompeu Fabra University,"Heinemann, F (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Berlin, D-1000 Berlin, Germany.",,"Nagel, Rosemarie/C-6311-2013","Nagel, Rosemarie/0000-0001-6599-0664",,,,,45,116,124,2,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

We interpret this as evidence that the menstrual cycle increases female absenteeism. To investigate the effect on women's earnings, we use a simple model of statistical discrimination. Consistent with the model, we find absenteeism has a more negative effect on men's earnings and this difference declines with seniority. The increased absenteeism induced by the 28-day cycle explains at least 14 percent of the earnings gender differential.

Focusing on the most open small economy, this paper tests the two hypotheses directly by estimating the relative contributions at the industry level for Singapore. Results suggest that productivity contributes more in the electronics industry, but domestic endowments matter more in other industries.

Finally, with these companies' features, we give some appropriate policy recommendations to improve efficiency.","[Li, Shuangjie; Xi, Yun] Beijing Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing University of Technology,,xiyun1985@126.com,"wang, zhiwen/JDV-9990-2023",,,,,,2,1,1,0,1,WORLD ACAD UNION-WORLD ACAD PRESS,LIVERPOOL,"113, ACADEMIC HOUSE, MILL LANE, WAVERTREE TECHNOLOGY PARK, LIVERPOOL, L13 4 AH, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84626-071-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,219,222,,,,,,4,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BQC52,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280689800050,0

The new technical production mode based on the implementation of information and communication technologies exhausted its growth potential, technologies that generated in the past three decades progress and economic efficiency and implicitly significant mutations of the living standard. Any analysis of a crisis period should starts from the understanding of similar previous situations in the recent economic history of mankind. First, we should make the difference between the problems, threats and effective crises. Although one uses the term of crisis management (like in the case of the chaos theory, the catastrophic denominations often have a powerful impact), the effective crisis management is in general that management that does not lead to the crisis triggering. Practically we deal rather with a management of problems, or an efficient administration of the activity, but we must admit that the denomination is less striking. It is true, though that in certain cases crises are of an exogenous nature, they could not be prevented and their negative effects must be faced and eliminated.","[Minica, Mirela; Zaberca, Vasile Mircea] Univ Eftimie Murgu Resita, Oravita, Romania",Eftimie Murgu University,,minica_mirela@yahoo.com; vasileza@yahoo.com,"Minica, Mirela/ABD-5935-2020; Minica, Mirela/A-2217-2015","Minica, Mirela/0000-0001-8783-8276; Minica, Mirela/0000-0001-8783-8276",,,,,8,0,0,0,5,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,191,197,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS68,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287983800028,0

While there is always a positive correlation between upstream bargaining weight and offshoring activities, there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between these and growth. Whether offshoring with incomplete contracts also increases consumption depends on firm heterogeneity. As for welfare, whereas with complete contracts an R&D subsidy is enough to solve the inefficiency due to R&D spillovers, with incomplete contracts a production subsidy is also needed.","[Naghavi, Alireza] Univ Bologna, IT-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Ottaviano, Gianmarco] Bocconi Univ, IT-20136 Milan, Italy",University of Bologna; Bocconi University,"Naghavi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, IT-40126 Bologna, Italy.",alireza.naghavi@unibo.it; gianmarco.ottaviano@unibocconi.it,,"NAGHAVI, ALIREZA/0000-0003-3978-9267",,,,,34,6,7,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

During this period, racial segregation markedly declined, while there was a fairly sizable increase in ethnic segregation. Almost all the changes in racial and ethnic segregation were due to the racial or ethnic composition effect. This finding is important since the composition effect truly measures the change in racial or ethnic segregation by eliminating the effect of changes in the size of occupations.

It also follows a well-trodden path laid down by centuries of financial folly. Is the special problem of sub-prime mortgages really different? Our examination of the longer historical record finds stunning qualitative and quantitative parallels across a number of standard financial crisis indicators. At this juncture, the book is still open on how the current dislocations in the United States will play out. The precedent found in the aftermath of other episodes suggests that the strains can be quite severe, depending especially on the initial degree of trauma to the financial system (and to some extent, the policy response). The average drop in real per capita output growth is over 2 percent, and it typically takes two years to return to trend. For the five most catastrophic cases (which include episodes in Finland, Japan, Norway, Spain, and Sweden), the drop in annual output growth from peak to trough is over 5 percent, and growth remained well below pre-crisis trend even after three years.","[Reinhart, Carmen M.] Univ Merilend, Skola Javnu Polit & Ekon Dept, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Rogoff, Kenneth S.] Harvard Univ, Ekon Dept, Littauer Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Reinhart, CM (通讯作者)，Univ Merilend, Skola Javnu Polit & Ekon Dept, Munching Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",creinhar@umd.edu; krogoff@harvard.edu,"Rogoff, Kenneth/G-1894-2018",,,,,,6,6,6,1,15,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2009,56.0,3,,,,,291,299,,10.2298/PAN0903291R,0.0,,,9,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,506DR,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000270754300001,0

A firm posts part and full-time job offers as a result of the trade-off between its demand variability, its wage costs and its hiring costs. Utility as a function of wages and the number of weekly worked hours is the criterion workers consider when accepting or rejecting job offers. We prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium, in which all firms hire both part- and full-time workers. Simulating the model, we show that the relationship between hours and wages depends dramatically on the firm's demand shape parameter and not on the individual preference for leisure.","[Roger, Muriel] INRA, Paris Sch Econ, F-75014 Paris, France; [Roux, Sebastien] Ctr Rech Econ & Stat CREST INSEE, F-92245 Malakoff, France",Paris School of Economics; INRAE,"Roger, M (通讯作者)，INRA, Paris Sch Econ, 48 Bd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",muriel.roger@ens.fr; roux@ensae.fr,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,3,DE BOECK UNIVERSITE,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

Accordingly, this paper examines the effects of overeducation on wages and early retirement decisions. The impact of overeducation on the wages of older workers is remarkably similar to that found in younger cohorts. With regards to the retirement decision, the literature suggests a link between overeducation and job dissatisfaction and a separate link between job dissatisfaction and early retirement. However, overeducation late in one's career may not be reflective of genuine skill mismatches or job dissatisfaction if skill mismatches occur. If overeducation has any impact on the likelihood of early retirement it is small as the empirical analysis finds no such evidence.","Sacred Heart Univ, John F Welch Coll Business, Fairfield, CT USA",Sacred Heart University,"Rubb, S (通讯作者)，Sacred Heart Univ, John F Welch Coll Business, Fairfield, CT USA.",rubbs@sacredheart.edu,,,,,,,16,10,14,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The coefficients of lagged OIs are negative but not significant. It can be explained as asymmetric information effect. After controlling for contemporaneous OI, it shows continuation in lag-one relations in 90-second interval. In 3-minute and 15-minute interval tests, the results are mixed. Finally, the relation of contemporaneous coefficients and market capitalization is significantly negative.

For the study area we chose an important part of the road network of Belgium, situated in the corridor between the main cities of Brussels and Ghent. Simulations were carried out using an elastic static traffic assignment method. Special care was taken to use realistic parameters for resource costs, time costs, external environmental costs and tax rates. The reduction of traffic caused by the increased trip prices as well as the route changes induced by the tolls were taken into account. The main objective of tolling as considered in this paper is the maximisation of the social welfare gain but possible adverse effects of tolling on traffic streams are also investigated. The relative merits of cordon and corridor tolling schemes are discussed. A combination of these two tolling schemes appears to give the best results, both in terms of welfare gain and traffic streams.","[Tampere, Chris; Stada, Jim; Immers, Ben] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Ind Management Traff & Infrastruct, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Tampère, C (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Ind Management Traff & Infrastruct, Celestijnenlaan 300A Bus 2422, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium.",ben.immers@cwi.kuleuven.be,"Tampere, Chris/ABD-6296-2021","Tampere, Chris/0000-0002-5489-7816",,,,,13,7,8,0,9,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-8619,,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

We use a variety of empirical techniques, including fixed effects and a matching estimator, to identify the impact of smoking on babies of teen and nonteen mothers. Both ordinary least squares and matching estimators yield large impacts of smoking on birth weight for teens and adults. However, to the extent that unobservables are fixed over time, they can be controlled using fixed effects.

These so-called escape clauses, however, are usually hard to interpret and discretionary in nature. This paper argues that a practical and more viable option is to specify a hard edged target range. Within the range, the central bank enjoys complete independence. Should, however, a large supply shock force inflation outside the range, the government may overrule the bank unless it adjusts its policy to address the government's concerns. Such an arrangement has the advantage of being easily understood and non-discretionary. Furthermore, it is shown that the bandwidth of the target range is inversely related to the degree of flexibility of the inflation targeting regime and thus, provides an easy way for the central bank to communicate its preferences to the public. The paper also discusses various determinants of the optimal design of the target range.","CUNY Hunter Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Hunter College (CUNY),"Westelius, NJ (通讯作者)，CUNY Hunter Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA.",niklas.westelius@hunter.cuny.edu,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,5,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

The JPBL comprises two leagues, the Central League (CL) and the Pacific League (PL). The CL is far more popular with fans than the PL. Our estimation results showed that the number of the PL clusters continues to go towards unity, thereby raising the uncertainty of the outcome to increase the PL game attendance more rapidly. Also, attendance by CL fans tends to be more inelastic with team performance than for the PL. Therefore, the PL payroll was more elastic to wins than that of the CL. The features of each League have crucial impacts on the outcomes and the behaviours of team insiders such as players and managers.","[Yamamura, Eiji] Seinan Gakuin Univ, Dept Econ, Fukuoka 8148511, Japan; [Shin, Inyong] Asia Univ, Dept Econ, Tokyo 1808629, Japan",,"Yamamura, E (通讯作者)，Seinan Gakuin Univ, Dept Econ, 6-2-92 Sawaraku, Fukuoka 8148511, Japan.",yamaei@seinan-gu.ac.jp,,"SHIN, INYONG/0000-0002-4686-7510",,,,,27,5,5,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Question has been raised for the empirical robustness of the index. I am also doubtful with Rodrik's analysis but develop my argument from a different perspective. This paper briefly reviews Rodrik's methodology and identifies other factors his empirical results potentially hinge on. Based on this, it elaborates on China's unique processing trade regime, the uneven distribution of its exports across Chinese regions and the limitation of HS codes in terms of identifying differentiated products, in an attempt to show that these factors also contribute to higher estimations of China's export sophistication level. Finally, it organizes trade data to reveal the trade patterns that are indeed consistent with the country's comparative advantage.","[Yao, Shunli] Univ Int Business & Econ, Inst Appl Int Trade, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yao, Shunli] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics; University of International Business & Economics,"Yao, SL (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Inst Appl Int Trade, Beijing, Peoples R China.",shunliyao@yahoo.com,,,,,,,14,30,32,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2009,17.0,1,,,,,47,65,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2009.01130.x,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,400PH,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000262880100003,0

Its true source should be attributed to structural changes that took place during recent decades in the world economy, and especially in the US. These changes are rooted in the basic alteration of the line of thought in economic policies by the Western countries. Since late 1970. this line was dominated by the neo-liberal ideology. The author critically assesses theoretical foundations of economic policies carried out in the framework of neo-liberal doctrine and analyses their main outcomes: increase of inequalities as well as the excessive financialization of economies. The latter depended on the explosive growth of financial markets and their departure from the real economy. The thesis formulated by the author is: the problem of the contemporary crisis cannot be solved unless its structural causes, fuelled by the neo-liberal ideology, are addressed. In the first place the inequalities in income distribution should be reduced (return to the progressive taxation systems should help in this case), and secondly, the financial markets should be subjected to stricter regulations that would stabilize financial system. The return to the ideas similar to these that supported the Glass-Steagall Act would be helpful in this area.","Uniwersytet Warszawski, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Zyzynski, J (通讯作者)，Uniwersytet Warszawski, Warsaw, Poland.",jzyzyn@hotmail.com,,,,,,,24,2,2,0,5,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,2299-6184,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2009,,2,,,,,163,188,,,,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,476TQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268469100001,0

Consequently, it was revealed that Ireland, the Netherlands, Denmark, Austria, France, Cyprus, Finland, Germany, and Belgium have achieved the highest level of well-being as of 2009.

S. economy, and thereby the entire world, has its origins in not just the subprime markets but is more of a systemic crisis. Its roots can be found in certain significant economic developments in the United States since the late 1970s: dramatic growth in inequality of income; restricted government sector, especially in the 1990s; growing trade deficit; and declining business investment. Given that the three main sources of demand, and thereby of growth, were declining in importance, the only way that the U. S. economy could have grown was through injection of consumption demand. Here again, an increase in income inequality had the potential of dampening consumption through the route of underconsumption. Therefore, for even the consumption demand to increase there was a need for some external impetus. I present a theoretical model arguing that the growth process in such a situation perforce becomes dependent on speculative asset price markets which have the potential of influencing consumption of households through the wealth effect. It is precisely for this reason that such a trajectory of growth becomes a bubble in the whirlpool of speculation.","S Asian Univ, Fac Econ, Delhi, India",,"Rohit (通讯作者)，S Asian Univ, Fac Econ, Delhi, India.",rohit@econ.sau.ac.in,,,,,,,15,4,7,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

New insights from a village-level analysis in Jiangxi Province, China",CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Off-farm employment; Agriculture-based environmental pollution; Input use; CGE model,LABOR-MARKETS; EMERGENCE; DISTORTIONS; TRANSITION; MIGRATION,"This study examines the conventional wisdom that off-farm employment contributes to environmental pollution by increasing the use of agro-chemicals. In order to analyse the role of household decision making and village factor markets in more detail, we run simulations with a hybrid farm household/village computable general equilibrium model that is applied to a village in Northeast Jiangxi Province. We find that the negative lost-labour effect of off-farm employment on agricultural incomes is much stronger than the (small) positive income effect. As a result of reduced labour resources and increased leisure consumption, farm households reduce the intensity of rice cultivation as well as the production of (especially) cash crops. The shift in production activities is stronger for migration than for off-farm employment, because migrants cannot combine off-farm work with onfarm work, and because migration reduces the village market price of oxen services. The shift towards less intensive rice production means that off-farm employment (and migration in particular) reduces the levels of chemical inputs and manure used in agricultural production. The decline in fertilizer input is much larger than the decline in manure use, because manure is a nontradable commodity and is applied only once per year. We therefore conclude that migration and, to a lesser extent, local off-farm employment lead to lower incomes from agricultural production, but have benign effects on environmental quality.

Notwithstanding this popularity the role of core inflation measures in the monetary policy-making process is questionable since most of these measures are based exclusively on statistical criteria without any theoretical justification. In this paper we propose an approach to building a benchmark measure of core inflation that explicitly treats core inflation as an artificial concept whose usefulness rests exclusively with its use in improving monetary policy effectiveness. Using this measure, constructed on the basis of the solution to a standard optimal monetary policy problem, we assess the performance and policy usefulness of other, popular core inflation indicators.

The goal of this paper is to answer several questions about the nature of this movement: How has the expansion of the economy after 2000 affected off farm labor market participation? Has off farm labor continued to rise? What is this rise being driven by-migrant wage earners or self employment opportunities? What is, in part, driving these trends? Using a national representative set of data that consists of two waves of surveys done in 2000 and 2008 in six provinces, the paper finds that off farm labor market participation has continued to rise steadily in the early 2000s. However, there has been a structural break in the trends of occupational choice before and after 2000. Unlike before 2000, after 2000 migration's growth accelerated; during this same period the self employed subsector stagnated. The number of wage earning migrants in 2008 was greater than the number of those in the self employed subsector. The data also show that the rise in wage-earning migration is mainly being driven by the younger cohorts. Our analysis also shows that the rise of migration is happening in conjunction with a rising unskilled wage.

Using a generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model to generate a measure of inflation uncertainty, the empirical evidence from the linear and nonlinear Granger causality tests indicate a bidirectional causality between the series. The estimates from both the linear vector autoregressive (VAR) and nonparametric regression models show that higher inflation rates lead to greater inflation uncertainty for all countries as predicted by Friedman (1977). Although VAR estimates imply no significant impact, except for Japan, nonparametric estimates show that inflation uncertainty raises average inflation in all countries, as suggested by Cukierman and Meltzer (1986). Thus, inflation and inflation uncertainty have a positive predictive content for each other, supporting the Friedman and Cukierman-Meltzer hypotheses, respectively.","[Cakan, Esin] Univ New Haven, Dept Econ & Finance, West Haven, CT 06516 USA; [Ozdemir, Zeynel Abidin] Gazi Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06500 Ankara, Turkey; [Balcilar, Mehmet] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Econ, Famagusta, Turkey",University New Haven; Gazi University; Eastern Mediterranean University,"Cakan, E (通讯作者)，Univ New Haven, Dept Econ & Finance, 300 Boston Post Rd, West Haven, CT 06516 USA.",mehmet.balcilar@emu.edu.tr; zabidin@gazi.edu.tr; ecakan@newhaven.edu,"BALCILAR, MEHMET/K-7346-2019","BALCILAR, MEHMET/0000-0001-9694-5196; ozdemir, zeynel abidin/0000-0001-8600-0463",,,,,40,7,8,1,9,UNIV CEMA,BUENOS AIRES,"AV CORDOBA 374, BUENOS AIRES, C1054AAP, ARGENTINA",1514-0326,,,J APPL ECON,J.

Our benchmark model without any frictions and taxes accounts for 86% of the observed change in the growth rate of GDP per-working age person and once we extend the model with taxes and capital adjustment costs it accounts for 60% of the observed reduction in hours worked per-working age person and 35% of the change in the growth of capital-output ratio. Also, we identify that the Turkish economy experienced a depression from 1976 to 1984 and the extended model performs remarkably well to account for the depression period.

This paper focuses on a factor that has been less well documented: the differential ability of households to take on risky production technologies for fear of the welfare consequences if shocks result in poor harvests. Building on an explicit model, this is explored in panel data from Ethiopia. Historical rainfall distributions are used to identify consumption risk. Controlling for unobserved household and time-varying village characteristics, it emerges that not just ex ante credit constraints, but also the possibly low consumption outcomes when harvests fail, discourage the application of fertilizer. The lack of insurance or alternative means of keeping consumption smooth leaves some trapped in low return, lower risk agriculture, one of the mechanisms through which poverty perpetuates itself in agrarian settings.

Given any initial rule for the composition of the feedstock, we consider the possibility of revising it if economic circumstances make it profitable. Flexibility in the mix is an advantage under randomly fluctuating input costs and comes at a higher investment cost. We show that the degree of flexibility in the productive technology installed depends on the value of the option to profitably re-arrange the input mix. Such option adds value to the project in that it provides a device for hedging against fluctuations in the input relative convenience.

If a firm considers production in a host country, it must decide whether to acquire an existing company or to create a completely new establishment. The latter issue has been less frequently addressed in the literature, especially in the case of firms from emerging markets. Firms from less advanced economies possess distinctive features; therefore, the determinants of purchasing a foreign company or creating a new plant may also differ from the ones observed for firms from advanced economies. The main aim of this paper is to define characteristics of firms that choose between the two modes of serving foreign markets. The paper also investigates the characteristics of host markets (market size, market structure, and competition intensity). The study should also shed some light on the question of why, during recent years, the number of cross-border mergers and acquisitions exceeded the number of green field projects.","Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Int Econ, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Klimek, A (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Int Econ, Wroclaw, Poland.",,"Klimek, Artur/Q-7410-2018","Klimek, Artur/0000-0001-5504-528X",,,,,16,8,8,1,45,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0012-8775,,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

This observation has recently led support to the view that, in these economies, the long-end of the yield curve has decoupled from its short-end and naturally to a concern that monetary policy may have lost some of its autonomy. We set up and estimate a two-country small open economy model in which the expectations hypothesis and uncovered interest rate parity hold to study the co-movement of long-term nominal interest rates of different currencies. We show that differences in the persistence of domestic and foreign disturbances, a hypothesis for which we find support in recent data, can explain the observed pattern of correlations. These correlations are not evidence of weaker monetary policy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We term the condition restricted deception-proofness. It requires that, in environments with identical preferences, the social choice function be immune to all deceptions, making it then stronger than incentive compatibility.

The model shows that credit rationing on investment loans decreases as capital accumulates and the enforcement cost decreases. We find that the evolution of the interest rate factor (lending interest rate/depositing interest rate) has a similar pattern to the credit rationing probability. However, simulations show that the evolution of the interest rate spread through the capital accumulation process depends on the degree of the enforcement cost. In the empirical part of the paper, we consider fifty-two countries, at different stages of development, over the period 1995-2005.

At fixed return agents optimize their demands using an utility with a statistical tolerance against deviations from the deterministic maximum of the utility which leads to information entropies for the agents. Interactions are described by coupling the agents to a large system, called 'market'. The main problem in economic markets is the absence of the analogue of the first law of thermodynamics (energy conservation in physics). We solve this problem by restricting the utilities to be at most quadratic in the demand (ideal gas approximation). Maximizing the sum of agent and market entropy serves to eliminate the unknown properties of the latter. Assuming a stochastic volatility decomposition for the return we derive an expression for the pdf of the return which is in excellent agreement with the daily DAX data. The pdf exhibits a power law behaviour with an integer tail index equal to the number of agent groups. With the assumption of an Ornstein Uhlenbeck model for the risk aversity parameters of the agents the autocorrelation for the absolute return is well described up to time lags of 2.5 years.","Univ Kiel, Inst Theoret Phys, D-24098 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Wagner, F (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Inst Theoret Phys, Leibnizstr 15, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.",wagner@theo-physik.uni-kiel.de,,,,,,,31,2,2,0,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

Wages, job creation, urban housing prices are endogenous and we characterize the steady-state equilibrium. We then consider three different policies: a transportation policy that improves the public transport system in the city, an entry-cost policy that encourages investment in the city and a restricting-migration policy that imposes some costs on migrants. We show that all these policies can increase urban employment but the transportation policy has much more drastic effects. This is because a decrease in commuting costs has both a direct positive effect on land rents, which discourages migrants to move to the city, and a direct negative effect on urban wages, which reduces job creation and thus migration. When these two effects are combined with search frictions, the interactions between the land and the labor markets have amplifying positive effects on urban employment. Thus, improving the transport infrastructure in cities can increase urban employment despite the induced migration from rural areas. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Each individual receives a signal about the underlying state of the world, observes the past actions of a stochastically generated neighbourhood of individuals, and chooses one of two possible actions. The stochastic process generating the neighbourhoods defines the network topology. We characterize pure strategy equilibria for arbitrary stochastic and deterministic social networks and characterize the conditions under which there will be asymptotic learning-convergence (in probability) to the right action as the social network becomes large. We show that when private beliefs are unbounded (meaning that the implied likelihood ratios are unbounded), there will be asymptotic learning as long as there is some minimal amount of expansion in observations. We also characterize conditions under which there will be asymptotic learning when private beliefs are bounded.","[Acemoglu, Daron; Dahleh, Munther A.; Ozdaglar, Asuman] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Lobel, Ilan] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); New York University,"Acemoglu, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,"Acemoglu, Daron/JQW-5242-2023",,,,,,38,346,409,5,113,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

We present a simple model grounded in interviews with legislators and highlight three forces shaping incentives to exert legislative effort. We exploit two natural experiments in the Argentine Congress (where term lengths were assigned randomly) to ascertain which forces are empirically dominant. Results for separate measures as well as an aggregate index of legislative effort show that longer terms increase effort. Shorter terms appear to discourage effort not due to campaign distractions but due to an investment payback logic: when effort yields returns over multiple periods, longer terms yield a higher chance of capturing those returns. A broader implication is that job stability may promote effort despite making individuals less accountable.","[Dal Bo, Ernesto] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Dal Bó, E (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,,26,56,76,2,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

It is shown that in the case of Shapley regular normal form games, the identified set is characterized by the inclusion of the true data distribution within the core of a Choquet capacity, which is interpreted as the generalized likelihood of the model. In turn, this inclusion is characterized by a finite set of inequalities and efficient and easily implementable combinatorial methods are described to check them. In all normal form games, the identified set is characterized in terms of the value of a submodular or convex optimization program. Efficient algorithms are then given and compared to check inclusion of a parameter in this identified set. The latter are illustrated with family bargaining games and oligopoly entry games.","[Galichon, Alfred] Ecole Polytech, F-91128 Palaiseau, France; [Henry, Marc] Univ Montreal, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada",Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Universite de Montreal,"Galichon, A (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech, F-91128 Palaiseau, France.",,,,,,,,39,65,87,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

J,"Tomer, JF",,,,"Tomer, John F.",,,Enduring happiness: Integrating the hedonic and eudaimonic approaches,JOURNAL OF SOCIO-ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Enduring happiness; Eudaimonic; Hedonic; Intangible capital; Imbalances; Buddhism; Personal capital,WELL,"In explaining individual happiness, economists have largely emphasized the hedonic, utilitarian, material, and tangible aspects of a person's life. Another important explanation which owes much to Aristotle's thought emphasizes the eudaimonic, the realization of a person's inherent qualities, one's true potential. An interesting and pertinent development is very recent research which draws on both psychology and Buddhist thought in order to understand individual happiness. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to an understanding of enduring happiness that integrates these different approaches. To do this, it is necessary to modify the happiness formula and interpret it somewhat differently than psychologists have. The modified happiness formula is: H=S+U-C+E where H is an individual's enduring happiness; S is an individual's set point, one's inherited disposition to happiness; Lk is the contribution to happiness made by the relatively utilitarian or hedonic aspects of an individual's circumstances; and E is the contribution to happiness made by the eudaimonic aspect of life. According to Buddhism, ordinary people typically suffer from a number of types of imbalance, and thus experience some degree of unhappiness. An important implication of the model is that people can improve their H through efforts to remedy their imbalances, thereby raising the eudaimonic component of their H. The Lk and E variables reflect how much the individual (or the individual's community and society) has invested in tangible assets and intangible capital that contribute to his/her happiness.

Higher dispersion in quality creates greater demand for future product by increasing the incentive of buyers with inferior quality realizations to repeat purchase and this, in turn, reduces the incentive of the seller to cut future price. For various levels of product improvement, I characterize the range of quality uncertainty for which the market equilibrium is identical to one where the monopolist can credibly precommit to future prices. I also show that the presence of quality uncertainty can lead to no trading in the primary good market. Further, in contrast to the literature on the Coase conjecture, inability to precommit to future prices can reduce social welfare as a result of the market closure.","So Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA",Southern Methodist University,"Dener, E (通讯作者)，So Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA.",evrimdener@gmail.com,,,,,,,16,0,0,2,20,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,,,J ECON,J.

These results are consistent with the predictions of a widely set of open-economy models and illustrate that demand policies are the main responsible of trade imbalances.","[Garcia-Solanes, Jose] Univ Murcia, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, E-30100 Murcia, Spain; [Rodriguez-Lopez, Jesus] Univ Pablo de Olavide Sevilla, Dept Econ Metodos Cuantitat & Hist Econ, Seville 41013, Spain; [Luis Torres, Jose] Univ Malaga, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, E-29071 Malaga, Spain",University of Murcia; Universidad Pablo de Olavide; Universidad de Malaga,"García-Solanes, J (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, Campus Espinardo, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",solanes@um.es; jrodlop@upo.es; jtorres@uma.es,"Torres, José/ABF-6814-2021","Rodriguez Lopez, Jesus/0000-0002-2482-2346",,,,,32,3,3,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

While these documentations pointed to various problems arising from the reforms, a systematic analysis is rarely found. Based on five years' data, the present study aims at providing empirical evidence of inefficiency of hospitals in China. Using the data envelopment analysis, the sources of inefficiency were examined. Echoing the unnecessary care, over-prescription of drugs and the adoption of high-tech treatments since the implementation of health care reforms, the sampled hospitals were found quite inefficient and pure technical inefficiency played a dominant role in driving the inefficiency of hospitals. Combining the panel nature of the data and the Malmquist Index computation, hospitals had experienced productivity growth between 2004 and 2008. Mirroring the behavior of hospitals, technological progress was the underlying force for the growth and the deterioration in efficiency change was found. The results summarized by region revealed that the stage of economic development and the efficiency performance of hospital did not necessarily go hand in hand. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

J,"Parker, JA",,,,"Parker, Jonathan A.",,,On Measuring the Effects of Fiscal Policy in Recessions,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,GOVERNMENT; EXPENDITURE; MODELS; SHOCKS; INCOME,"We do not have a good measure of the effects of fiscal policy in a recession because the methods that we use to estimate the effects of fiscal policy-both those using the observed outcomes following different policies in aggregate data and those studying counterfactuals in fitted model economies-almost entirely ignore the state of the economy and estimate the government multiplier, which is presumably a weighted average of the one we care about-the multiplier in a recession-and one we care less about-the multiplier in an expansion. Notable exceptions to this general claim suggest this difference is potentially large. Our lack of knowledge stems significantly from the focus on linear dynamics: vector autoregressions and linearized (or close-to-linear) dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. Our lack of knowledge also reflects a lack of data: deep recessions are few and nonlinearities hard to measure. The lack of statistical power in the estimation of nonlinear models using aggregate data can be addressed by exploiting estimates of partial-equilibrium responses in disaggregated data. Microeconomic estimates of the partial-equilibrium causal effects of a policy can discipline the causal channels inherent in any DSGE model of the general equilibrium effects of policy. Microeconomic studies can also provide measures of the dependence of the effects of a policy on the states of different agents, which is a key component of the dependence of the general-equilibrium effects of fiscal policy on the state of the economy.","[Parker, Jonathan A.] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Parker, Jonathan A.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Parker, JA (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,,,,,,,51,84,96,3,23,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

How East European Countries Responded to the Outflow of Capital in 1997-99 and in 2008-09,ACTA OECONOMICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,devaluation; capital flows; reaction to shocks,CURRENCY UNION; TRADE; MONEY,"If there is a negative terms of trade or financial shock leading to the deterioration in the balance of payments, there are two basic options for a country that has limited foreign exchange reserves. First, a country can maintain a fixed exchange rate (or even a currency board) and wait until the reduction of foreign exchange reserves leads to the reduction of money supply: this will drive domestic prices down and stimulate exports, raise interest rates and stimulate the inflow of capital, and finally will correct the balance of payments. Second, the country can allow the devaluation of national currency - flexible exchange rate will automatically bring the balance of payments back into the equilibrium. Because national prices are less flexible than exchange rates, the first type of adjustment is associated with the greater reduction of output. The empirical evidence on East European countries and other transition economies for the 1998-99 period (outflow of capital after the 1997 Asian and 1998 Russian currency crises and slowdown of output growth rates) suggests that the second type of policy response (devaluation) was associated with smaller loss of output than the first type (monetary contraction). The 2008-09 developments provide additional evidence for this hypothesis.","UN, DPAD, DESA, New York, NY 10017 USA",,"Popov, V (通讯作者)，UN, DPAD, DESA, 2 United Nations Plaza,DC 2,2076, New York, NY 10017 USA.",vladimir-popov@carleton.ca,"Popov, Vladimir/B-7314-2013","Popov, Vladimir/0000-0003-0428-3725",,,,,32,0,1,0,6,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Furthermore, this difference is statistically significant. We use these findings to evaluate the cost of adjustment hypothesis suggested by Borenstein and Shephard (2002). We also find that there is an asymmetry in the effect of gasoline inventory on gasoline and oil prices.

The mechanisms and causes of life satisfaction seem to be similar in the two samples. Among Second Life users, satisfaction with their virtual life is higher than satisfaction with their real life. Regression analysis indicates that people in certain life situations, such as unemployment, gain more life satisfaction from 'switching' to the virtual world than from changing their real-life circumstances. In other words, an unemployed person can become happier by visiting Second Life rather than finding a job.

This helps provide both normative and statistical confidence in establishing poverty rankings across distributions. The tests, which can take into account the complex sampling procedures that are typically used by statistical agencies to generate household-level surveys, are implemented using the Canadian Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics (SLID) for 1996, 1999, and 2002. Although the yearly cumulative distribution functions cross at the lower tails of the distributions, the more recent years tend to dominate earlier years for a relatively wide range of poverty lines. Failing to take into account SLID's sampling variability (as is sometimes done) can inflate significantly one's confidence in ranking poverty. Taking into account SLID's complex sampling design (as has not been done before) can also decrease substantially the range of poverty lines over which a poverty ranking can be inferred.

Goods-producing firms in this model are bank dependent in the sense that they have no choice but to borrow funds from banks to cover labor wages that must be paid in advance of production. The results show that a cut in the policy rate enhances firm entry by mitigating the severity of credit rationing. This policy transmission is different from the conventional balance sheet channel in that a change in the policy rate directly affects borrowers credit availability. I also show that a sudden stop in the credit supply to new firms is most likely to occur shortly after a credit boom. This is because endogenous downward wage rigidity prohibits the credit risk of prospective firms from decreasing enough to re-equilibrate the loan market. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

These two concepts are deeply rooted in ECLAC thinking. Countercyclical policies must withstand the challenges posed by abrupt external financing cycles and sharp fluctuations in commodity prices. Fiscal policy is of pivotal importance, but it must be coupled with equally countercyclical monetary and exchange-rate policies. In the light of the experience over the past decade, this policy mix seems to be achievable if intermediate exchange regimes are introduced alongside macroprudential policies, including regulation of capital flows. At the same time, the strategy used to spur the development of the production sector should foster innovative economic activities that generate domestic production linkages. The concept of innovation must be understood in a broad sense, but the critical test is its contribution to the accumulation of technological capabilities.","[Ocampo, Jose Antonio] Columbia Univ, Comm Global Thought, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Ocampo, JA (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Comm Global Thought, New York, NY 10027 USA.",jao2128@columbia.edu,,,,,,,91,21,23,0,10,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,AUG,2011,,104,,,,,7,35,,,,,,29,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,865EW,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298294700001,0

Overall, this paper shows that listed firms in China, as they become more and more market-oriented, have adopted a pay structure that is largely consistent with the predictions of tournament theory, and that it is important to consider both state ownership and corporate governance in analyzing executive compensation structure.","Jinan Univ, Coll Econ, Dept Finance, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Jinan University,"Su, DW (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Coll Econ, Dept Finance, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",tdsu@jnu.edu.cn,"Su, Larry/AAH-8426-2021","Su, Dongwei/0000-0002-6306-1850",,,,,32,5,5,3,49,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

I develop a theoretical framework that shows that privatization can have ambiguous effects on prices in the private market, and that the degree of misallocation of the assets prior to privatization determines the subsequent price effects. I test the predictions of the model using a large-scale housing reform in China. The results suggest that the removal of price distortions allowed households to increase their consumption of housing and led to an increase in equilibrium housing prices.

The principal requires goods made from both firms in equal proportions. The question we study is whether, at zero cost, the principal would wish to monitor the contract between the subcontractor and contractor. Without monitoring the contractor will determine the type of the subcontractor. Hence, when contracting with the principal he can extract an information rent on this knowledge. Monitoring would reveal the subcontractor type and so lower the principal's bill. However, if the principal monitors the contract between contractor and subcontractor then he may prefer to not screen the subcontractor. So, the contractor must be offered an incentive to screen below. The paper shows that the second of these costs is smaller for a range of parameter values, so that monitoring and incentivizing screening is cheaper than not monitoring.","Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ, I-20126 Milan, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca,"Cella, M (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",michela.cella@unimib.it,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

We also examine various Bayesian and classical time-series models in our forecasting exercise to compare to the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model, estimated using Bayesian methods. In addition to standard vector-autoregressive and Bayesian vector autoregressive models, we also include the information content of either 10 or 120 quarterly series in some models to capture the influence of fundamentals. We consider two approaches for including information from large data sets-extracting common factors (principle components) in factor-augmented vector autoregressive or Bayesian factor-augmented vector autoregressive models as well as Bayesian shrinkage in a large-scale Bayesian vector autoregressive model. We compare the out-of-sample forecast performance of the alternative models, using the average root mean squared error for the forecasts. We find that the small-scale Bayesian-shrinkage model (10 variables) outperforms the other models, including the large-scale Bayesian-shrinkage model (120 variables). In addition, when we use simple average forecast combinations, the combination forecast using the 10 best atheoretical models produces the minimum RMSEs compared to each of the individual models, followed closely by the combination forecast using the 10 atheoretical models and the DSGE model. Finally, we use each model to forecast the downturn point in 2006:Q2, using the estimated model through 2005:Q2. Only the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model actually forecasts a downturn with any accuracy, suggesting that forward-looking microfounded dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models of the housing market may prove crucial in forecasting turning points.

The notion of the own-rate of money interest is utilised to develop a multi-asset liquidity preference framework, which is consistent with uneven variations of liquidity-premia across assets in response to changes in the degree of strong uncertainty that is specific to different investors with variable allocation of assets in their portfolios. More specifically, in the context of this portfolio framework it is established that an increase in the state of strong uncertainty (state of bearishness) makes less liquid assets further less inconvenient than more liquid assets. In periods characterised by greater strong uncertainty, equilibrium is restored through a greater demand for more liquid assets including money relative to the demand for less liquid assets and, therefore, through a higher own-rate of money interest for less liquid assets than warranted, which shows the ineffectiveness of standard monetary policy.","[Koutsobinas, Theodore T.] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business,"Koutsobinas, TT (通讯作者)，Serron 18, Athens 16674, Greece.",koutsobinas@aueb.gr,,,,,,,49,3,3,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We show that a convergence process has occurred across these countries since 1950. We argue that the major driver of this phenomenon is the existence of decreasing aggregate returns to education that have limited the extension of compulsory schooling. Then we test whether convergence holds when confronted with other explanations described in the literature. Conditional convergence does hold and we find that openness has been another significant determinant of compulsory years of schooling, reflecting the need of a skilled labour force in an increasingly globalized world.","[Viarengo, Martina] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Viarengo, Martina] London Sch Econ, London, England",Harvard University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,,,,"MURTIN, FABRICE/0000-0002-5479-9191",ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,75,33,34,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,JUL,2011,78.0,311,,,,,501,522,,10.1111/j.1468-0335.2009.00840.x,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,774PW,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291399600006,0

A study of monthly airfare data from 2002 to 2004 confirms that fare wars occur periodically, as well as price collusion. Both tend to be short-lived. The fact that collusion is more likely to occur in January and April when demand is high, as revealed by China Eastern's and China Southern's price-war and collusion models, has been confirmed by interview information obtained from the airlines' sales managers. However, there is also evidence in these models suggesting that collusion can be more easily formed when demand is low. High airport concentration measured by the HHI may facilitate collusion in certain circumstances, but it may also lead to more price wars under other conditions. Concentration in both airports and routes does not appear to systematically affect the occurrence of fare wars and collusion in all the models estimated. We also reject the possibility that mutual forbearance due to multimarket contact plays any important anti-competitive role in China's airline markets. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In the South African case the published record on public debt distorts the historical perspective on the associated fiscal decisions.

The adjusted series is less volatile and rose less steeply between 1989 and 1996 than the official, cash-based debt series. Failing to account for the evolution of these obligations exaggerates the impression of weak fiscal discipline in the early 1990s and exemplary fiscal prudence in preceding decades.","[Calitz, Estian; Du Plessis, Stan; Siebrits, Krige] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, ZA-7602 Matieland, Western Cape, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Calitz, E (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, Private Bag 11, ZA-7602 Matieland, Western Cape, South Africa.",calitz@sun.ac.za; stan@sun.ac.za; krigesiebrits@sun.ac.za,,"Du Plessis, Stan/0000-0002-2899-5172",,,,,22,3,5,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

We show that (a) uniform optimal patent breadth is a weighted average of sector-specific optimal patent breadth and (b) sector-specific optimal patent breadth is larger in the sector that has a larger market size and more technological opportunities. To derive the optimal policy, we allow for an arbitrary path of patent breadth and derive the optimal path by solving a Stackelberg differential game. We find that the optimal path of patent breadth under each patent regime is stationary, time-consistent and subgame perfect. Finally, we perform a numerical investigation and find that even a moderate degree of asymmetry across sectors can generate a significant welfare cost of uniform patent protection.

Worker flows among labour-market states act as key determinants of this variation. We examine how the structure of unemployment across groups and its cyclical movements across time are shaped by changes in labour-market flows. Using novel estimates of flow transition rates for the UK over the last 35 years, we decompose unemployment variation into parts accounted for by changes in rates of job loss, job-finding, and flows via non-participation. Close to two-thirds of the volatility of unemployment in the UK over this period can be traced to rises in rates of job loss that accompany recessions. The share of this inflow contribution has been broadly the same in each of the past three recessions. Decreased job-finding rates account for around one-quarter of unemployment cyclicality and the remaining variation can be attributed to flows via non-participation. Digging deeper into the structure of unemployment by gender, age, and education, the flow approach is shown to provide a richer understanding of the unemployment experiences across population sub-groups.","[Elsby, Michael W.

Yet, mobilization is costly and militants have to be compensated accordingly.

We first review the connections between the eductive viewpoint on expectational stability and standard game-theoretical rationalizability concepts. The eductive reasoning selects different plausible beliefs that are a priori, and possibly a posteriori, diverse. Such beliefs are associated with the sets of Cobweb tA cent tonnement outcomes, Rationalizable States and Point-Rationalizable States (the latter two being shown to be convex). In the case where our model displays strategic complementarities, unsurprisingly, all our eductive criteria support similar conclusions, particularly when the equilibrium is unique. With strategic substitutabilities, the success of expectational coordination, in the case where a unique equilibrium does exists, relates with the absence of cycles of order 2 of the Cobweb mapping: in this case, full expectational coordination would be achieved. However, when cycles of order 2 do exist, our different criteria predict larger sets of outcomes, although all tied with cycles. Under differentiability assumptions, the Poincar,aEuroHopf method leads to other global stability results. At the local level, the different criteria under scrutiny can be adapted. They lead to the same expectational stability conclusions, only when there are local strategic complementarities or strategic substitutabilities. However, for the local stability analysis, it is demonstrated that the stochastic character of expectations can most often be forgotten.","[Jara-Moroni, Pedro] Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago 3363, Chile; [Guesnerie, Roger] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Guesnerie, Roger] Coll France, F-75231 Paris, France",Universidad de Santiago de Chile; Paris School of Economics; Universite PSL; College de France,"Jara-Moroni, P (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Econ, Av Lib Bdo OHiggins, Santiago 3363, Chile.",roger.guesnerie@college-de-france.fr; pedro.jara@usach.cl,"Jara-Moroni, Pedro/C-2269-2013","Jara-Moroni, Pedro/0000-0001-5760-388X",,,,,49,17,17,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Monetary and fiscal policy faces the phenomenon of lag. One of the controversial and pressing questions of monetary policy is the nature and length of lag between the application of the measures of monetary policy and the effects on macroeconomic aggregates. While the monetary strategy points to several possible reasons for the lag, there is no general agreement on the length of the lag. The study of the phenomenon of lag imposes two questions: what does the lag of the application of monetary processes and policy imply and why are the asset holders not capable of immediately adjusting their portfolios at the time of disbalance? There are two categories of lag known in economic literature: the inside lag (which encompasses the recognition of the problem and the implementation of measures) and the outside lag (which encompasses the reaction of macroeconomic aggregates to the applied measures of monetary policy). The paper descriptively notes the different identifications of time lag and provides schematic representations of the effects of the observed phenomenon.",,,,mesamuric@gmail.com,,,,,,,20,10,10,3,19,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIVERSITY PULA,PULA,"PRERADOVICEVA 1-1, PULA, 52 100, CROATIA",1331-677X,,,EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

It is analyzed the role of returns, participation rates, occupational choices, schooling endowments, subsidies, pensions and household size. The inertia shown by inequality reflects the interplay of factors that cancel each other out, others that operate slowly over time, and the emergence of new developments that affect distribution. Furthermore, there are no clear indications that this situation will change over the next few years.

When the asymmetry in information quality is large, we find that voting groups largely coordinate on the SVC equilibrium which is also Pareto optimal. However, we find that when the asymmetry in information quality is not large and the Pareto optimal equilibrium is for all to participate, significant numbers of voters with low-quality information abstain. Furthermore, we find that information asymmetry induces voters with low-quality information to coordinate on a non-equilibrium outcome. This suggests that coordination on letting the experts decide is a likely voting norm that sometimes validates SVC equilibrium predictions but other times does not. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We generate forecasts from six different models of the US economy and compare them to professional forecasts from the Federal Reserve's Greenbook and the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF). The model parameters and model forecasts are derived from historical data vintages so as to ensure comparability to historical forecasts by professionals. The mean model forecast comes surprisingly close to the mean SPF and Greenbook forecasts in terms of accuracy even though the models only make use of a small number of data series. Model forecasts compare particularly well to professional forecasts at a horizon of three to four quarters and during recoveries. The extent of forecast heterogeneity is similar for model and professional forecasts but varies substantially over time. Thus, forecast heterogeneity constitutes a potentially important source of economic fluctuations. While the particular reasons for diversity in professional forecasts are not observable, the diversity in model forecasts can be traced to different modeling assumptions, information sets and parameter estimates.","[Wieland, Volker] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, CEPR & CFS, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany; [Wieland, Volker] CFS, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Wieland, V (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, CEPR & CFS, Grueneburgpl 1,House Finance, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany.",wieland@wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de; wolters@wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de,,,,,,,58,22,24,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Rich panel datasets for Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa are assembled to define informality in a comparable way and to control for (time-invariant) unobserved heterogeneity. Estimations are conducted at different points of the conditional earnings distributions. Interesting results emerge. First, informal salary workers are systematically underpaid compared to their formal sector counterparts, in all countries and at almost all conditional quantiles. Yet penalties are very moderate in Brazil and Mexico while more substantial in South Africa, a country where legal advantages in formal employment are effective. Second, informal self-employment contributes to a more dispersed earnings distribution in all three countries. International comparisons reveal a continuum of situations reflecting historical and legal differences across countries, from very large self-employment penalties in South Africa to significant conditional earnings premia in Mexico.","[Bargain, Olivier] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Econ, Geary Inst, IZA,ESRI,CHILD,CEPS INSTEAD, Dublin 4, Ireland",University College Dublin; Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"Bargain, O (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Econ, Geary Inst, IZA,ESRI,CHILD,CEPS INSTEAD, Newman Bldg,Belfield Campus, Dublin 4, Ireland.",olivier.bargain@ucd.ie,"Bargain, Olivier/A-5972-2019","Magejo (nee Kwenda), Prudence/0000-0001-9496-3526",,,,,50,45,52,1,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

As a result, informal firms are managed by less able entrepreneurs, are smaller, and employ a lower capital-labor ratio. The model predicts that the interaction of an index of observable inputs to entrepreneurial ability and formality is positively correlated with firm size, which we verify in the data.

In each period firms simultaneously set a price-quantity pair specifying the price for the period and the maximum quantity the firm is willing to sell at this price. Under price-quantity competition firms are able to ration their output below capacity. For a wide range of capacity pairs, the equilibrium path providing the smaller firm with its highest stationary perfect equilibrium payoff requires that it undercut its rival's price and ration demand. Furthermore, for some capacities and discount factors supporting security level punishments, price shading and rationing arise everywhere on the set of stationary perfect equilibrium paths yielding (constrained) Pareto optimal payoffs. That is, price shading may not only be consistent with optimal collusion, it may be a requirement of optimal collusion.","[Dechenaux, Emmanuel] Kent State Univ, Dept Econ, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Kovenock, Dan] Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Tippie Coll Business, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Salem; Kent State University Kent; University of Iowa,"Dechenaux, E (通讯作者)，Kent State Univ, Dept Econ, Kent, OH 44242 USA.",edechena@kent.edu,"Kovenock, Dan/Q-3767-2019","Dechenaux, Emmanuel/0000-0003-4734-0793",,,,,37,5,5,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

We argue that whether MNCs have an incentive to develop international human resource policies is shaped by the extent and nature of international integration, which we define as the commonalities and inter-dependencies in the production process across borders. In particular, we identify three aspects of the integration of MNCs that are crucial in this respect: whether the firm pursues financial economies or synergistic linkages from its international operations; whether it segments or replicates its operations across countries; and whether it standardises or differentiates its product internationally.","Kings Coll London, Dept Management, London SE1 9NN, England",University of London; King's College London,"Edwards, T (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Management, 150 Stamford St, London SE1 9NN, England.",tony.edwards@kcl.ac.uk,,,,,,,63,15,18,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We develop an overlapping-generations model with increasing returns which suggests that international integration of the market for skilled labor aggravates between-country inequality by harming those which are source economies to begin with while benefiting host economies. The result is robust to allowing governments to optimally adjust productivity-enhancing investments which could potentially attenuate brain drain.

We examine EKC-type transitions of pollutant levels not with respect to economic growth but more generally in time. Assuming that each policy maker optimally executes the two switching options of regulation and unregulation for pollution, the switching dynamics of environmental policy can be described by an alternating renewal process. It is shown that the double Laplace transform of transition density of a pollutant level can be obtained by a novel application of renewal theory. The expected level of overall pollutants is then calculated numerically and found to exhibit either a A-shaped or an N-shaped pattern in time.

Using a calibration theorem, we argue against standard curvature-based explanations for the finding. We axiomatize a model of preferences over dated rewards that generalizes the standard exponential discounting model by permitting the discount factor to depend on the reward being discounted. The model is shown to behaviorally subsume the hyperbolic discounting model as a special case. When embedded in a sequential bargaining game the model gives rise to multiple stationary subgame perfect equilibria. There may exist equilibria in which the first mover gets a smaller share despite also being the more patient player. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Third, we refer to the sophisticated meta-analytical methodology and present a coherent strategy to choose the meta-regression estimator most suitable for the meta-data at hand. As compared to prior surveys, the meta-analysis is thus based on a much broader methodological basis and a considerably richer meta-data set. The median tax semi-elasticity of FDI based on 704 primary estimates is 2.49 in absolute terms. The precision weighted average of the full sample of semi-elasticities is 2.55, again in absolute terms. Moreover, our meta-analysis shows that there is a publication bias in the primary literature. Meta-regressions show that studies based on aggregate data report systematically larger semi-elasticities than firm-level analyses, that integrating bilateral tax regulations into effective tax rates leads to more effective measurement of adverse tax incentives on foreign investment, and that tax effects are not compensated by public spending.","[Feld, Lars P.] Univ Freiburg, D-7800 Freiburg, Germany; [Heckemeyer, Jost H.] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany",University of Freiburg; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Feld, LP (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, D-7800 Freiburg, Germany.",,,,,,,,113,119,126,2,63,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Moreover, our identification also exploits the fact that the stringency of the law's provisions and the intensity of the law's enforcement vary with establishment size.

This paper proposes a methodology based on a state-space model to estimate TFP and its determinants. With this methodology, it is possible to reduce the measurement of our ignorance. As a by-product, this estimate yields the capital share in output and the long-term growth rate. When applied to Chile, the estimation shows a capital share around 0.5 and long-term growth of TFP around 1%. Capital accumulation tends to explain the growth rate in the fast growth periods under the econometric estimation more than the traditional growth accounting methodology.","[Rodrigo Fuentes, J.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Morales, Marco] Univ Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; University Diego Portales,"Fuentes, JR (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Econ, Avda Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",rfuentes@faceapuc.cl,"Fuentes, Rodrigo/AAF-4459-2020",,,,,,27,11,11,0,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We examine this question using detailed data on sovereign bond issuances and public syndicated bank loans between 1980 and 2000. A key finding of this paper is that the probability of market access is not influenced by a country's frequency of defaults, and that a default, if resolved quickly, does not reduce significantly the probability of tapping the markets. We also find that trade openness, a standard measure of a country's links with the rest of the world, and traditional liquidity and macroeconomic indicators do not help much in explaining market access. However, a country's vulnerability to shocks and the perceived quality of economic policies and institutions appear to influence the government's ability to tap the markets.

The theoretical effect of these regime shifts on the wage differential between skilled and unskilled workers is ambiguous. On the one hand, openness to trade causes demand shifts in the labor market which may widen or narrow the differential. This result depends on whether the unskilled wage is depressed. as in the case of importing countries, or raised, as in the case of exporting countries. On the other hand, an increased supply of more educated workers reduces their wages and narrows the skill wage gap. In this study of the labor market of Hong Kong, we document that recent changes in response to the trade liberalization of Mainland China and expanded access to education have increased the earnings differential between skilled and unskilled workers. Using detailed census data, we argue that the main reason for this outcome is the widened dispersion of skills across the earnings distribution. resulting front demand and supply shifts in the labor market caused by trade openness and expanded access to higher education. journal of Comparative Economics 39 (1) (2011) 82-91.

We propose a simple model in which the power of each armed group depends on the number of combatants it is able to recruit. This is in turn a function of the relative 'distance' between the group leadership and potential recruits. We emphasize the moral hazard problem of recruitment: fighting is costly and risky so combatants have the incentive to defect from their task. They can also desert altogether and join the enemy. This incentive is stronger the farther away the fighter is from the principal, since monitoring becomes increasingly costly. Bigger armies have more power but less monitoring capacity to prevent defection and desertion. This general framework allows a variety of interpretations of what type of proximity matters for building strong cohesive armies ranging from ethnic distance to geographic dispersion. Different assumptions about the distribution of potential fighters along the relevant dimension of conflict lead to different equilibria. We characterize these, discuss the implied outcome in terms of who wins the war, and illustrate with historical and contemporaneous case studies.","[Vargas, Juan F.] Univ Rosario, Bogota, Colombia; [Mahmud, Ahmed Saber] Johns Hopkins Univ, Adv Acad Program, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Universidad del Rosario; Johns Hopkins University,"Vargas, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Rosario, CI 14 4-80, Bogota, Colombia.",juan.vargas@urosario.edu.co,"Vargas, Juan/F-8966-2016; Vargas, Juan/P-1787-2019","Vargas, Juan/0000-0001-8090-8091; Vargas, Juan/0000-0001-8090-8091",,,,,40,0,0,0,18,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

The results suggest the following conclusions. The hierarchy of switching costs is mobile phone service, fixed phone service, ISP (Internet Service Provider), and broadband access service, in descending order. Even if the government prohibits the formerly state-owned monopoly NIT from forming alliances with other carriers, the legacy NIT group would still command more than half of the market share under FMC if each carrier adopts a pure bundling strategy. If mixed bundling emerges as the primary strategy in the FMC market, the resulting type of competition from the introduction of FMC does not stimulate competitive pricing. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we assess recent legal arguments that racial preferences at selective colleges promote meaningful on-campus interracial interaction. As such, we model such interaction as a function of minority representation and, in some cases, perceived social similarity between students of different races. We estimate a structural model to capture these effects and use the results to trace out the net effects of racial preferences on population rates of interracial contact. The results suggest that the interaction-maximizing degree of racial preference, while positive, is significantly weaker than that observed in practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Together with growing electronic substitution, current liberalization policies promoting competitive entry may put the traditional universal service at risk. Hence, there is an increased interest in estimating the cost of universal service provision. The 3rd EC Postal Directive proposes a calculation approach to separately determine the net cost of a universal service obligation and to compensate the universal service provider (USP). This paper discusses the interaction between universal service costing and financing and shows that the EC approach may result in distorted results. It also quantifies the effects based on a model calibration with Swiss data. The results show that separate costing and financing leads to a considerable under-compensation of the USP if there is a compensation fund to which every operator contributes. The USP is over-compensated if it is exempt from contributing to the fund (pay or play mechanism). The problem of under- or overcompensation can be resolved by an integrated computation of the net cost that includes the competitive effects of the financing mechanism. Such an integrated approach results in a fair compensation of the USP.","[Jaag, Christian; Trinkner, Urs] Swiss Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Jaag, Christian] Univ St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland; [Trinkner, Urs] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland",University of St Gallen; University of Zurich,"Jaag, C (通讯作者)，Swiss Econ, Stampfenbachstr 142, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",christian.jaag@swiss-economics.ch,,,,,,,23,11,11,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

The aim of this article is to assess whether these differences are stochastic or deterministic. The analysis is implemented for a number of British industrial subsectors over the 1970-2004 and 1978-2004 time periods. It turns out that the results of the tests are very influenced by whether one allows for the presence of structural breaks. Only when modelling structural breaks, one can conclude that the evidence in favour of the long-term differences being deterministic outbalances the evidence pointing to their nature being stochastic. This supports the adoption of policy instruments which are applied across productive sectors in a way which is not affected by the short-run evolution of the sectors.","[Agnolucci, Paolo] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge Ctr Climate Change Mitigat Res, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England; [Agnolucci, Paolo; Venn, Andrew] Cyril Sweett, London, England",University of Cambridge,"Agnolucci, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge Ctr Climate Change Mitigat Res, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England.",p.agnolucci@gmail.com,,"Agnolucci, Paolo/0000-0002-5133-6706",,,,,78,22,22,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Unlike schooling-based models, which require an assumption regarding a smaller local stock of knowledge, this study relies on the size of the industrial sector and the limited supply of training opportunities, therefore highlights barriers to development, even when technology and capital are available.

The author considers the effects of both the expected and unexpected tightening of monetary policy. The results of the analysis show that: (a) the reactions of inflation and of the output gap are consistent with economic theory; (b) the strongest reaction to an unexpected tightening of the monetary policy appears quite soon (after 1-2 quarters in the case of inflation and 2-3 quarters for the output gap; in the case of an expected monetary tightening (with the prevision horizon of 4 quarters) the most pronounced reaction of the output gap appears simultaneously with the tightening or 1 quarter later while inflation may react even before the actual tightening.

They have addressed this lacuna in the literature by using a real options approach to model fertility decisions by relating uncertainty experienced by individuals to the likelihood of childbirth. However, they did not present empirical evidence. Since the theory implies the existence of two offsetting effects of uncertainty on fertility decisions, a positive insurance effect and a negative option value effect, it is not easy to reject the theory on the basis of empirical analysis, when one of these effects offsets the other. We construct such a test for East (and also West) Germany during that country's reunification, which takes advantage of the fact that because of the country's strong welfare system, the insurance effect should be dominated by the option value effect, thereby suggesting that the net relationship should be negative. The results provide rather strong support for the real options link, especially for Eastern Germany.","[Bhaumik, Sumon Kumar] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England; [Bhaumik, Sumon Kumar] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Bhaumik, Sumon Kumar] William Davidson Inst, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Nugent, Jeffrey B.] Univ So Calif, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",Aston University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Southern California,"Bhaumik, SK (通讯作者)，Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England.",Sumon.Bhaumik@brunel.ac.uk,,,,,,,36,15,16,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This article focuses on MDG4 (reduction of two thirds in the under-five mortality rate between 1990 and 2015) and analyses the relative merit of the MDG framework as well as the success or failure of SSA in achieving this target. The authors argue that despite the positive impetus which the MDG4 target has represented for child health, it has failed to provide a framework within which equity considerations could be analysed, has detracted from the recognition of the importance of social determinants of health and has failed to highlight the interconnectedness of all MDGs. Further, whilst SSA is fairing worst in terms of MDG4, some countries have managed to get on track to achieve MDG4 or improve the health prospects of their children. A combination of intervention scale-up, additional resource allocation, health systems strengthening approach, partly explain these successes. Overall however, real challenges remain: lack of international and national resources, lack of health systems strengthening, lack of human resources at all levels of the health system, limited social protection mechanisms, slow 'diagonalisation' of programmes, and persistent environmental and socio-political factors.",,,,N.Brikci@savethechildren.org.uk; A.Holder@savethechildren.org.uk,,,,,,,54,7,7,0,9,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

The framework adopted is a Factor-Augmented Vector Autoregression model with latent factors extracted from the dataset, as proposed by Bernanke et al. (2005). The main results can be summarized as follows. First, based on impulse responses, we show that carbon prices tend to respond negatively (between -0.2 and -1.2 standard deviation) to an exogenous shock that reduces global economic indicators by one standard deviation. Second, we find evidence that the responses are heterogeneous among the different kinds of carbon prices: CER futures prices tend to react much more significantly than EUA spot and futures prices. Third, the factors explain about 50% of the total variance of all variables in the dataset. The largest contribution is accounted for by the factor correlated with commodities markets, which explains about 28% of the total variability. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In our empirical approach, knowledge encompasses several formal and informal skills, to complement the mainstream view narrowly concerned with education and on-the-job training. Our results for Italy point out that despite much rhetoric about the reduction (or even the reversal) of gender gaps in education, women often lack the main skills and competencies that can profitably be deployed in the labour market. Unsurprisingly, in Italy women's accumulation of labour market experience is mostly hindered by unpaid housework burdens. However, when adopting an extensive definition of knowledge these activities may be regarded as a source of relevant knowledge. Yet, they do not seem to be positively valued by the market, either in terms of employability or in terms of wages, thus calling for a serious rethinking of the role of knowledge in shaping men's and women's economic opportunities.","[Cipollone, Angela] LUISS G Carli, Rome, Italy; [Corsi, Marcella; D'Ippoliti, Carlo] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy",Luiss Guido Carli University; Sapienza University Rome,"Cipollone, A (通讯作者)，LUISS G Carli, Rome, Italy.",angelacipollone@hotmail.com; marcella.corsi@uniroma1.it; carlo.dippoliti@uniroma1.it,"D'Ippoliti, Carlo/GWU-7191-2022","D'Ippoliti, Carlo/0000-0003-4518-5523",,,,,35,1,1,0,9,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2011,58.0,5,,,SI,,735,757,,10.2298/PAN1105735C,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,877OY,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299193000010,0

We estimate the responsiveness of labor supply to these two conventions, focusing on a previously neglected but increasingly important segment of the prostitution market: indoor sex workers who advertise on the Internet. Using a differences-in-differences estimator of prostitution advertisements posted on a major classified ads website, we find that the conventions caused a 29-44 percent increase in advertisements in Minneapolis and a 47-77 percent increase in Denver.

This paper considers the determinants of teachers' salaries across countries and examines the relationship between the real (and relative) level of teacher remuneration and the (internationally) comparable measured performance of secondary school pupils. We use aggregate panel data on 39 countries published by the OECD to model this association.

The saving-investment (SI) correlation depends on the origin and the volatility of macroeconomic (productivity) shocks, the persistence of these shocks and country-size. Simulating a two-country Real Business Cycle (RBC) model we show that as the variance of common shocks increases (relative to country-specific shocks), as the persistence of these shocks decreases and as country-size increases, the SI correlation increases. Using annual data from 1960 to 2002, productivity changes in 11 OECD countries are decomposed into common and country-specific shocks (from which foreign shocks are also constructed). The empirical findings show that the 11 countries share a statistically significant common component in productivity changes and common shocks generally account for at least half of the variations in the countries' productivity changes. We then use the estimated variances of the shocks, in addition to each country's size, in the RBC model to compute the predicted SI correlation for each country, under the assumption that capital is perfectly mobile. The predicted SI correlation is then compared to the actual correlation to assess the relative degree of capital mobility in the 11 countries. The findings indicate that Norway, the Netherlands and the US have the highest degree of capital mobility whereas in Canada, Sweden, Belgium and Japan capital mobility has been the lowest.

Using a stochastic frontier approach, our analysis reveals that the average cost efficiency of South-Eastern European banks is 68.59 percent, and the average profit efficiency is 53.87 percent. Regressions on the determinants of bank efficiency show that foreign banks are characterized by higher profit efficiency but lower cost efficiency, and government-owned banks are associated with lower profit efficiency than domestic private banks. However, the efficiency gap between foreign-, domestic private-and government-owned banks narrows over time. We also find that the market power of a bank has a positive association with both cost and profit efficiency. Institutional development, proxied by progress in banking regulatory reforms, privatization and enterprise corporate governance restructuring, also has a positive impact on bank efficiency.","[Fang, Yiwei; Hasan, Iftekhar] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, New York, NY USA; [Hasan, Iftekhar] Bank Finland, New York, NY USA; [Marton, Katherin] Fordham Univ, New York, NY 10023 USA",Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; Fordham University,"Fang, YW (通讯作者)，Rensselaer Polytech Inst, New York, NY USA.",fangy2@rpi.edu; hasan@rpi.edu; marton@fordham.edu,,,,,,,54,54,55,2,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

A saving model is developed based on the system of simultaneous equations which are estimated from reduced form, using the Indirect Least Squares (ILS) method. Robustness of the estimated parameters of the model is verified by the Instrumental Variable (IV) Method. It is found that the savings of students are significantly dependent on their total expenditure, other income, expenditure on special items (cars, computers, mobiles etc.) and the number of eat-outs. It also estimates the saving elasticity. Results show that students' savings increase if they have other income in addition to educational allowance; and their saving is reduced by 3% if they make 10% more total expenditure. Gender and year of study do not have any effect on students' savings. However, living at home rather than hostel students save significantly more. It demonstrates that unlike many developed countries, university students of Brunei save money irrespective of age and sex by their own initiatives without any state financial training. Most university students in Brunei save money, which is a good start for their educational and financial security.","Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Sch Business, Ctr Catolica, Lima 33, Peru",Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru,"Hague, MO (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Sch Business, Ctr Catolica, Calle Daniel Alomia Robles 125-129, Lima 33, Peru.",,,,,,,,29,1,1,0,13,NATIONAL ACAD MANAGEMENT,KYIV,"VUL PANASA MYMOGO 26, KYIV, 01011, UKRAINE",1993-6788,,,ACTUAL PROBL ECON,Actual Probl.

The monetary policy than becomes a one-size-fits-all and is oriented towards common goals, putting national interests to the second place. The common opinion, especially in transition countries, is that entering European economic and monetary union is their final and ultimate goal that requires long term, committed fulfilling of rigorous criteria.

Such cycles can also be observed in banking activities - decreasing crediting volumes can be noticed in the majority of countries. However, the interaction between financial and business cycles is not fully revealed and differs in different countries. In the case of Lithuania credit volume and business activeness cyclic interaction can be also named as specific, reflected in gross domestic product (GDP) and credit volume fluctuations. Based on various economic cycle stages identification methodologies, not every single fluctuations can be assigned as an economic cycle stage: some of them are not identified as significant and are not recognised as economic cycles, the others match an economic cycle stage and time criterions and can be recognized as economic cycles. In the current situation, when global economy and the situation in Lithuania show recovery signs from recession to growth, credit market reacts respectively. Though the question of business and credit volume cycles is very actual, because knowing credit market dynamics indications and synchronization level between credit and economic cycles different financial stability implementation politics measures can be developed. The importance of business and credit volume cycles interaction research is also evident from the number of theoretic studies, however, to investigate interaction between an economic cycle and crediting activities in Lithuania banks there was adopted methodology developed by Kress (2004) and Avouyi-Dovi et al. (2006), including these main stages: 1) identification of turning points according to Avouyi-Dovi et al. (2006) adopted Harding and Pagan methodology, identifying peaks and troughs when two different economic cycle indicators are selected (Industrial production (Lt) and GDP (Lt)) with three credit cycle indicators (Total loans (Lt); Household loans (Lt); Loans to non-financial corporations (Lt)); 2) Calculation of concordance index between economic cycle and banks provided credit volume using business and credit cycle indicators; 3) Valuation of dependence between economic indicators and banks credit activities ratios using correlation function; 4) Conclusions delivering. Research methodology consists of separate independent stages, what makes possible to compare the results in separate stages and deliver more comprehensive conclusions. Obtained results revealed that peak in Total loans indicator converge with the peak in economic cycle indicators, but the peak in Household loans is accessed earlier than the peak in economic cycle indicators. These tendencies were also approved by the correlation analysis and calculation of a conformity indicator. The results allow to deliver significant conclusions about government monetary political decisions influencing the country's economic cycle fluctuations and determining financial stability.","[Lakstutiene, Ausrine; Krusinskas, Rytis; Platenkoviene, Jovita] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Lakstutiene, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Laisves Av 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",ausrine.lakstutiene@ktu.lt; rytis.krusinskas@ktu.lt; j.platenkoviene@ub.lt,"Krusinskas, Rytis/ABG-9619-2020",,,,,,33,8,8,0,24,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The data include Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index, the primary eight stock sector indices, and the U.S. Dow Jones Industrial Average index to proxy the impact of U.S. stock market on Taiwan's stock market performance. The empirical finding of this study could be used to reconfirm the existence of the so-called sunshine effect. In addition, by comparing the long-run impulse multiplier effects of the cloud cover on the stock return in the two sub-sample periods; this study could examine the transition of the sunshine effect in Taiwan's stock market. The empirical results suggest that cloud cover has a significant negative impact on Taiwan's stock market, especially in the low cloud cover periods. Moreover, the pre-determined distribution of the error term plays an important role on the significance of the sunshine effect. The empirical result shows that most long-run multipliers are negative and the multiplier is more effective in the low cloud cover periods than in the high cloud cover periods.

An alternative approach is to test the properties that should hold for all models based on a given stochastic process for the underlying asset. Following Perignon (2006), we test the empirical validity of the monotonicity property for option prices by collecting all transaction data from 1 July 2006 to 31 December 2006 for option contracts traded on the Taiwan Futures Exchange (TAIFEX). We find that sampled intraday option prices violate the monotonicity property between 29.97% and 57% of the time, and that call and put prices often increase, or decrease, together. We also find evidence to show that the frequent violations of the monotonicity property are to a large extent attributable to microstructure effects and that they arise from rational trading tactics.","[Lin, Chuang Yuang; Chen, Dar Hsin] Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taipei 105, Taiwan; [Tsai, Chin Yu] China Univ Technol, Dept Int Business, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taipei University,"Lin, CY (通讯作者)，Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Business Adm, 69 Sect 2,Chien Kuo N Rd, Taipei 105, Taiwan.",cylin46@hotmail.com,,,,,,,36,4,4,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Someone lacking a subjective distribution faces a problem of choice under ambiguity. This article reviews recent research on policy choice under ambiguity, when the task is to choose treatments for a population. Ambiguity arises when a planner has partial knowledge of treatment response and does not feel able to place a subjective distribution on the unknowns. I first discuss dominance and alternative criteria for choice among undominated policies. I then illustrate with the choice of a vaccination policy by a planner who has partial knowledge of the effect of vaccination on illness. I next study a class of problems in which a planner may want to cope with ambiguity by diversification, assigning observationally identical persons to different treatments. Lastly, I consider a setting in which a planner should not diversify treatment.","[Manski, Charles F.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Manski, Charles F.] Northwestern Univ, Inst Policy Res, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University; Northwestern University,"Manski, CF (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",cfmanski@northwestern.edu,"Manski, Charles/AAV-7497-2021",,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0911181] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,42,24,26,0,13,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4603-4,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

The methodology combines searches in the MesH database of PubMed with the search in the principal journals of Health Economics. 20 primary studies were found that met the criteria for inclusion. No single pattern of results is clearly identified. Among the 20 articles, four consider income to be the principal determinant of healthcare expenditure, two of them jointly with population ageing. Six highlight population ageing, as against six others that emphasize the proximity to death. The remaining six do not focus on a specific variable, or focus on another variable, e. g. technological progress or territorial decentralization. 11 of the 20 articles calculate the income elasticity of demand, only two of them obtaining a value greater than 1, thus cataloguing healthcare expenditure as a luxury good. There is, therefore, no unanimity in the variables and econometric regressions of healthcare expenditure in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. No solid empirical evidence exists that population ageing is one of the principal determinants of healthcare expenditure, and factors such as technological progress, closeness to death and territorial decentralization of healthcare are increasingly seen as important in the development of explanatory models of healthcare expenditure.","[Martin Martin, Jose J.; del Amo Gonzalez, M.

We estimate the response of macroeconomic aggregates to anticipated and unanticipated tax shocks in the US and find that unanticipated tax cuts have persistent expansionary effects on output, consumption, investment and hours worked. Anticipated tax cuts give rise to contractions in output, investment and hours worked prior to their implementation, while stimulating the economy when implemented. We show that a DSGE model can account quite successfully for these findings. The main features of the model are adjustment costs, consumption durables, variable capacity utilization and habit formation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Decentralization, however, cannot be achieved without political decentralization, a democratization process of democracy, achieved from top to bottom, in which the state supports the evolution of the civil society through partnership, by stimulating local initiative and community development. According to Anthony Giddens' theory, which is even more relevant due to the present economic recession, it states that the civil society represents a third option (neo-liberalism and social democracy being the other two) in achieving social welfare. The welfare type state concept is replaced by the welfare society concept, in which the state and the civil society work together for progress, development and mutual support. Apart from the need for a participant democracy, the objective of this present study is to analyze the stages of the present political decentralization in Romania. We intend to find explanations and solutions regarding the fragile voice of the Romanian participant political culture. What were we lacking: logistics or the collective mentality (a consequence of the emerging democracy...)? What are the distinctive mechanisms for proper governing, by which we can monitor the citizens' involvement in the process of public decision and the ongoing possibility of influencing the governmental authorities' policies and decisions by the people, at a national level by empowering the citizens with more authority? Respecting the existing interests of the society and not only those of the dignitaries, constitutes a condition for representation, something that the Romanian democracy lacks. Monitoring the manner in which the citizens' interests are represented by public decision, constitutes a fundamental element of proper governing. This study's objective is to create certain logistic conditions for the organization of the citizens' public policies debates, regarding the governing programs or the text of certain laws; the mechanisms should not be limited only to collecting and monitoring, but they should encompass the manner in which the citizens, the experts' and the civil society's representatives proposals are existing in the public decision.","[Mina, Simona] Univ Ovidius Constanta, Fac Law & Adm Sci, Dept Adm Econ & Commun Studies, Constanta, Romania",Ovidius University,"Mina, S (通讯作者)，Univ Ovidius Constanta, Fac Law & Adm Sci, Dept Adm Econ & Commun Studies, Constanta, Romania.",simonamina@univ-ovidius.ro,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-606-12-0139-6,,,,2011,,,,,,,472,475,,,,,,4,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH0UM,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000396639300068,0

Farm operators and spouses have dual income sources, from farm and off-farm activities. Further, farm households on an average possess higher wealth than nonfarm households. This article estimates permanent income for the US farm households using data from a large national farm level survey. The estimated income is then used to identify the determinants of wealth accumulation by the US farm households. Results confirm that permanent income is closely related to age of the operator, education, occupation, farm size, location and number of earners in the household. Along with age, permanent income is a significant determinant of household wealth. It was also found that the wealth-income curve is nonlinear, upward sloping, and convex. Hausman's specification test indicates that variations in farm household wealth is better explained by estimated permanent income than observed total household income. Off-farm income cannot be treated as residual or transitory income.","[Mishra, Ashok Kumar; Paudel, Krishna P.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Mishra, AK (通讯作者)，Louisiana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",amishra@lsu.edu,"Mishra, Ashok K./J-7228-2019","Mishra, Ashok K./0000-0002-0988-1428",,,,,35,12,15,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS USING TWO-EQUATION AND THREE-EQUATION PROBIT MODEL WITH ENDOGENOUS SWITCHING,EKONOMISTA,,,Polish,Article,,,,,,probit model; endogenous switching; intertemporal dependence; employment status; initial conditions,,"The paper presents an analysis, based on panel survey data for Poland for the years 1997-2000, of the transfers of persons aged 20-65 to full-employment status. The analysis is made using two-equation and three-equation probit model with endogenous switching. It focuses on the probability of entry to full-employment status. The results of the analysis indicate that the status of a given person in the labour market in the given year depends not only on its status in the preceding year, but also on the status held before. The analysis also shows that the impact of individual characteristics of the persons acting in the labour market on the conditional probability of being employed depends on their past employment status, supporting the hypothesis of intertemporal dependence of employment status. The paper also presents the statistics, obtained from the estimated model, describing the duration of employment and unemployment, depending on individual characteristics of the persons concerned.","[Nehrebecka, Natalia] Uniwersytetu Warszawskiego, Narodowy Bank Polski, Warsaw, Poland; [Nehrebecka, Natalia] Uniwersytetu Warszawskiego, Wydzial Nauk Ekon, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw; Narodowy Bank Polski; University of Warsaw,"Nehrebecka, N (通讯作者)，Uniwersytetu Warszawskiego, Narodowy Bank Polski, Warsaw, Poland.",Natalia.Nehrebecka@nbp.pl,"Nehrebecka, Natalia/AAZ-9268-2020","Nehrebecka, Natalia/0000-0003-3870-7231",,,,,41,0,0,0,4,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,2299-6184,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2011,,2,,,,,235,268,,,,,,34,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,774XB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291419000004,0

Because the estimation of hidden employment extent is very complicated and multiple problem the article is based on various data sources and on the methodology of statistical researches. The article widely presents the results of survey of Statistics Lithuania(1) and it's acummulated experience, various methodological problems of hidden employment estimation are disscused. Employed in the unofficial labour market population dynamics tendencies are estimated based on prepared methodology of calculation by the Institute of Labour and Social Research scientists(2)). According to calculations made by authors, hidden employment in Lithuania kept growing fast and reached the maximum value of 380 thousand till 1994. Later (in 1995-2001) it declined substantially to 230 thousand. 2002-2004 were the year of temporal stabilization (with a number of 210 thousand illegally employed), after which a period of sudden fall took place (down to 120 thousand in 2008). Despite this, the favorable conditions for hidden employment growth were formed in 2009, while in the threat of the economic crisis the country experienced an especially deep recession. Increased taxes and unemployment, made the favorable conditions for shadow business.","[Neverauskiene, Laima Okuneviciute; Pocius, Arunas] Lithuanian Social Res Ctr, LT-09318 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Neverauskiene, Laima Okuneviciute] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Business & Management, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Neverauskiene, LO (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Social Res Ctr, Rinktines G 48 A, LT-09318 Vilnius, Lithuania.",Laima.Okuneviciute@dsti.lt; Arunas.Pocius@dsti.lt,,,,,,,27,5,5,0,12,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-8619,,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Applying the kernel technique, we estimate the effects of the transition process on labour productivity and its main sources. We find that Spanish regions experienced a major convergence process in labour productivity mostly driven by human capital in the 1977-1993 period. Conversely, the dynamics of investment in physical capital appear to be neutral with respect to the transition dynamics of labour productivity. Finally, from 1995 to 2002, no dynamic processes seemed to have taken place. Spanish regions exhibit a persistent relative position with established convergence clubs: the human capital effect is less important and the investment in physical capital seems not to have a triggering effect on labour productivity growth.","CSIC, Inst Analisi Econ, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE),"Nicolini, R (通讯作者)，CSIC, Inst Analisi Econ, Campus Univ Autonoma Barcelona, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",rosella.nicolini@iae.csic.es,"Nicolini, Rosella/J-8838-2012","Nicolini, Rosella/0000-0002-3331-8926",,,,,28,1,1,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

An important portion of the Chilean government's revenue is the result of royalties it earns from the extraction of copper. An appropriate test for tax-smoothing therefore must recognize that this part of the government's revenue is not completely under its control. The results provide strong evidence for tax smoothing when royalties from copper are treated as not being under government control, but only weak evidence if they are treated as if they are under government control.","[Cover, J.

Unfortunately, little is known about their statistical properties, which makes valid inferencing difficult. In this article we prove asymptotic normality for a certain class of scientometric, technological and some economic, though nonmonetary, specialization indices.

We find a co-movement of oil exports with construction and service variables from the rolling regression. The non-linear model reveals that oil exports movements cause asymmetric reaction of construction, service and other variables under study. The variance decomposition shows that crude oil exports contribute to the variability of the key variables. We find a strong relationship between oil exports changes and tradable sector. Decreases in oil exports appear to play a greater role in construction variation than oil exports increases. For variable of service, positive oil shock plays a considerable role as a source of variable fluctuations.

Treating public revenues as endogenous and tax rates as exogenous variables, the model explicitly incorporates both the tax structure and the oil-exporting sector as important sources of government revenues. The results confirm that the fiscal problem in Mexico lies in the low degree of tax compliance. By simulating the reform starting in the year 2008, the results suggest that consumption taxes are not necessarily the unique solution to the tax collection process in a developing country like Mexico.","El Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudios Econ, Mexico City 10740, DF, Mexico",Colegio de Mexico,"Sobarzo, H (通讯作者)，El Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudios Econ, Camino Ajusco 20,Col Pedregal Santa Teresa, Mexico City 10740, DF, Mexico.",hsobarzo@colmex.mx,,,,,,,27,2,3,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

It is found that tighter patent enforcement in some industries allows a patent enforcement externality effect to emerge, whereby varieties with relatively softer patent protection have relatively stronger innovation incentives. The theoretical mechanisms hold for a wide range of the elasticity of substitution between varieties and also hold in a North-South framework when IPR harmonization is considered. A numerical simulation shows that merging both endogenous technological change and institutional aspects in the form of imperfect and heterogeneous IPR protection can contribute to explaining the different innovation and wage inequality performances of the U.S. and the EU regions.","Univ Roma Tre, Rome, Italy",Roma Tre University,"Spinesi, L (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tre, Rome, Italy.",lspinesi@uniroma3.it,,,,,,,66,6,6,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

I implement long-horizon regressions to analyse the predictive power of the Fed's GDP growth forecasts. The regressions conclude that the Fed's GDP growth forecasts can be used to predict long-and short-term stock returns. The size of the coefficient of the Fed's orthogonal GDP growth forecast indicates that 1% increase in the Fed's forecast predicts 2-4% decrease in real and excess stock returns. The regressions considering the size effect suggest that the predictive power of the Fed's GDP growth forecasts increases as the size of the portfolio decreases. A comparison of the Fed's forecasts and the commercial forecasts shows that the Fed's GDP growth forecasts contain information that does not exist in the commercial forecasts. I investigate the sources of the Fed's superior private information and predictive power.

This research improves the way in which managerial decision making is analysed by developing a model better representing the price risks and opportunities faced by firms that produce using a portfolio of commodities. Using the situation of cattle feedlot investors and managers as an example, this is accomplished by recognizing the multivariate (live cattle, feeder cattle and corn prices) situation that feedlots operate in and employing corresponding multivariate simulation techniques. Evaluation suggests that properly modelling the cattle feeding margin as a multivariate set of prices significantly improves the accuracy of forecasting future feeding margin values realized in the cash market. The model also suggests incorporating both implied and historical time-varying volatility information when forecasting margin variability. Implications for other multicommodity situations and future research are also provided.","[Tonsor, Glynn T.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Schroeder, Ted C.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Michigan State University; Kansas State University,"Tonsor, GT (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, 317-B Agr Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",gtonsor@msu.edu,,,,,,,21,3,6,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The core of long-term models is extended by introducing production functions generating potential output. Their specification includes total factor productivity (TFP) being representative of technological progress. It depends on knowledge capital, i.e. human capital, domestic and foreign R&D. Several channels of transfer of foreign R&D can be distinguished. The potential output differs from the effective output, representing final demand, underlying business cycle fluctuations. To study potential disequilibria a system of equations explaining final demand must be established. Thus the long-term macroeconometric model must be a complete model. Its use may cover long-term forecasts and scenario analysis based on model simulations. The paper outlines the above specifications of the long-term model using as example a new model of the Polish economy. The model is medium-sized. It covers demand and supply side, including prices and financial flows. The results of multiplier analysis are shown revealing model feedbacks, including generation of business cycles.

Although the phenomenon is well analyzed and explained, most of the research ignores an individual investor's costs, constraints and perspective. We suppose that after taking these issues into consideration, there may be not much money left on the table. The paper consists of three main parts. First, we characterize IPO underpricing anomaly and review the performance patterns from many countries together with their theoretical explanations. In the second section, we indicate the usually ignored issues which may potentially significantly impede IPO investments. The last part of the paper presents the empirical analysis based on 209 offerings in the Polish stock market between 2001 and 2010. The paper comes to the conclusion that high IPO returns result from just a few outliers and are not significantly higher than the benchmark returns.

The intermediate input is produced by capital and labor with a constant returns to scale technology. If the degree of increasing returns in the production of final products is sufficiently high, the return to a factor can increase with the amount of this factor. Thus a higher amount of a factor in a region leads to a higher return to this factor and attracts additional amount of this factor to move in. Capital movement and labor movement can be reinforcing. This type of circular causality means that unbalanced regional development can persist over time.","[Zhou, Haiwen] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Econ, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA",Old Dominion University,"Zhou, HW (通讯作者)，Old Dominion Univ, Dept Econ, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.",hzhou@odu.edu,,,,,,,30,1,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

J,"Ashworth, S; Shotts, KW",,,,"Ashworth, Scott; Shotts, Kenneth W.",,,Does informative media commentary reduce politicians' incentives to pander?,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Elections; Pandering; Media,,"Elections sometimes give policy makers incentives to pander, i.e., to implement a policy that voters think is in their best interest, even though the policy maker knows that a different policy is actually better for the voters. Pandering incentives are typically attenuated when voters learn, prior to the election, whether the policy chosen by the incumbent truly was in their best interest. This suggests that the media can improve accountability by reporting to voters information about whether an incumbent made good policy choices. We show that, although media monitoring does sometimes eliminate the incumbent's incentive to pander, in other cases it makes the problem of pandering worse. Furthermore, in some circumstances incumbent incentives are improved when the media acts as a yes man-suppressing some information that indicates the policy maker made the wrong choice. We explain these seemingly paradoxical results by focusing on how media commentary affects voters' tendency to apply an asymmetric burden of proof to the incumbent, based on whether she pursues popular or unpopular policies.

Players are allowed to make any level of contribution toward funding the good, which is provided if the cost threshold is reached. Otherwise, contributions are refunded. Conditions ensuring existence and uniqueness of a Bayesian equilibrium are established. Further restricting the threshold uncertainty to a uniform distribution, we show the equilibrium strategies are very simple, even allowing for any number of players with asymmetric distributions of values. Comparative statics with respect to changes in players' distributions are derived, allowing changes in both the intensity and the dispersion of values. For example, increased uncertainty, in the sense of mean-preserving spreads of players' distributions of values, increases equilibrium contributions. Finally, we show the equilibrium is interim incentive inefficient. The sharpness of our results greatly contrasts with the more qualified insights of earlier private-values models with known cost threshold, which relied on there being two symmetric players and generally exhibited multiple equilibria.

Evidence from referenda voting patterns,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Median voter hypothesis; Referenda; Education spending,LOCAL PUBLIC-SERVICES; PRIVATE DEMANDS; TIEBOUT BIAS; MODEL; PREFERENCES; GOODS; REDISTRIBUTION; JURISDICTIONS; EXPENDITURES; EQUILIBRIUM,"This paper examines whether the voter with the median income is decisive in local spending decisions. Previous tests have relied on cross-sectional data while we make use of a pair of California referenda to estimate a first difference specification. The referenda proposed to lower the required vote share for passing local educational bonding initiatives from 67 to 50% and 67 to 55%, respectively. We find that voters rationally consider future public service decisions when deciding how to vote on voting rules. However, the empirical evidence strongly suggests that an income percentile below the median is decisive for majority voting rules, especially in communities that have a large share of high-income voters with attributes that suggest low demand for public services. Based on a model that explicitly recognizes that each community contains voters with both high and low demand for public school spending, we also find that an increase in the share of low demand voters is associated with a lower decisive voter income percentile for the high demand group. This two type model implies that our low demand types (individuals over age 45 with no children) have demands that are 45% lower than other voters. Collectively, these findings are consistent with high-income voters with weak preferences for public educational services voting with the poor against increases in public spending on education.

Moreover, by utilizing variation in the presence and level of small stipends paid to the firefighters, we find that the positive effect of monetary incentives declines with image concerns, supporting a prediction that extrinsic incentives can crowd out image motivation for prosocial behavior.

Moreover, we use the variance decomposition approach to examine the relative importance of these factors.

In the short run, a competition effect amplifies the propagation of the shocks and generates procyclical profits and countercyclical mark ups. We extend the model to different forms of competition (as imperfect collusion and Stackelberg competition). The analysis of technology and preference shocks and of the second moments suggests that the model outperforms the RBC in terms of variability of output, labor and, of course, profits and mark ups.

The fallacy of the oil spot dynamic,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Complexity theory; History of economic ideas; Samuelsonian Paradigm,SYSTEMS,"This paper is essentially a rebuttal of the view that neoclassical economics can handle complexity. I have coined the locution 'oil spot dynamic' to denote the neoclassical ability to subsume each and every new perspective. The main part of the paper is devoted to showing why the oil spot dynamic cannot work with the complexity approach, which is seen as a coherent stand-alone research program that stems from the SFI Economics Program and manifests itself with different nuances. The fallacy of the oil spot dynamic is relevant in this period, in which economists are beginning to realize that the Neoclassical Samuelsonian Paradigm no longer represents the common language of their profession. The spread of the complexity approach and the dissolving notion of 'mainstream' are here interpreted as indicative of a changing economics. A short foray into the features of the process of change completes my arguments by showing that the shift from one paradigm to another has many interrelated dimensions, and that there may be rigidities internalizing changes.

Comparing these countries and reviewing the literature, we conclude that the relation between openness and growth is not a simple one. Using standard trade theory, we find that Mexico has gained from trade, and by some measures, more so than China. We sketch out a theory in which developing countries can grow faster than the United States by reforming. As a country becomes richer, this sort of catch-up becomes more difficult. Absent continuing reforms, Chinese growth is likely to slow down sharply, perhaps leaving China at a level less than Mexico's real GDP per working-age person.

Using a within-subject design we manipulated two aspects of the decision, the relative cost of sharing and the nature of the lottery: the draws were either independent for the two players ('noncompetitive' condition) or one's success meant other's failure ('competitive' condition). We also asked for decisions in a standard, non-probabilistic, setting. The main results can be summarized as follows: first, a substantial fraction of subjects do share chances to win, also in the competitive treatments, thus showing concern for the other player that cannot be explained by outcome-based models. Second, subjects share less in the competitive treatment than in other treatments, indicating that procedural fairness alone cannot explain the data. Overall, these results suggest that models aiming at generalizing social concerns to risky environments will have to rely on a mix of distributive and procedural fairness.","[Le Lec, Fabrice] Catholic Univ Lille, Lille Econ & Management UMR 8179, CNRS, F-59000 Lille, France; [Krawczyk, Michal] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Warsaw,"Le Lec, F (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Lille, Lille Econ & Management UMR 8179, CNRS, 41 Rue Port, F-59000 Lille, France.",mkrawczyk@wne.uw.edu.pl; fabrice.lelec@icl-lille.fr,"Krawczyk, Michał/ABA-7468-2020","Le Lec, Fabrice/0000-0002-1869-5520; Krawczyk, Michal/0000-0001-6795-1175",,,,,17,74,80,2,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,,,EXP ECON,Exp.

An increase in labor mobility implies neither an intensified tax competition nor an erosion of revenues. In fact, the equilibrium tax rate even increases in labor mobility. Amenities offered to students are non-monotonically related to labor mobility; overall, net revenues increase with labor mobility. An increase in student mobility, however, erodes revenues, mainly due to intensified tax competition. A concurrent cutback in expenditures mitigates this erosion but cannot fully prevent it.","[Krieger, Tim] Univ Gesamthsch Paderborn, Dept Econ, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany; [Lange, Thomas] Ifo Inst Econ Res Munich, Dept Econ, D-78457 Constance, Germany; [Lange, Thomas] Univ Konstanz, D-78457 Constance, Germany",University of Paderborn; Ifo Institut; University of Konstanz,"Krieger, T (通讯作者)，Univ Gesamthsch Paderborn, Dept Econ, Warburger Str 100, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany.",tim.krieger@notes.uni-paderborn.de; thomas.lange@uni-konstanz.de,"Krieger, Tim/G-6241-2012","Krieger, Tim/0000-0003-0045-9172",,,,,36,13,14,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

In today's health policy arena there is considerable discussion, but little conclusive strategy, about how to improve health outcomes by increasing levels of physical activity. In this paper, we explore how individuals with different levels of human capital (educational attainment) allocate time to physically-demanding activities that we characterize as health-producing behaviors. Our hypothesis is that many individuals are confronted with significant constraints on their allocation of time to exercise, and that these constraints differ importantly by level of human capital (e.g., educational attainment). However, the prediction of how human capital influences time allocated to physical activity is ambiguous because there are both substitution and wealth effects at work: since the shadow price of non-labor time use is relatively greater for high-wage individuals, they may spend less time engaged in health-promoting activities (as has been documented for activities like sleep); yet individuals who have amassed high levels of human capital are both more able to afford health-producing behaviors and more likely to prefer greater levels of produced health. We explore a set of empirical questions suggested by this framework using data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), administered by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. We focus on respondents ages 25-64 using the combined 2005 and 2006 ATUS data. The ATUS data are based on daily time use diaries completed by individuals aged 15 and older, including information on a large number of detailed physical activity time uses. We compare time allocated to physical activity to time allocated to sleep, household and personal activities, care for others, work, and non-exercise leisure activities. Since the ATUS time use categories are mutually exclusive and exhaustive (i.e. multitasking is not accommodated) we employ econometric share equation techniques to enforce the adding-up requirement that time use is constrained to 1,440 minutes per day. Our findings largely bear out the hypothesis that different levels of human capital endowment (educational attainment) result in different manifestations of how time is used in ways that may produce different health outcomes. While more-educated individuals tend to sleep much less than less-educated individuals and to work more hours, they are more likely to allocate time to physical activity in their leisure time. Our application of economic share equation techniques allows us to extend the literature by demonstrating not only how educational status is associated with time allocated to physical activity, but also where the other minutes of the day are allocated to and from.","[Mullahy, John; Robert, Stephanie A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Madison, WI 53726 USA; [Mullahy, John] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Robert, Stephanie A.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Social Work, Madison, WI 53726 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Mullahy, J (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, 707 WARF,610 Walnut St, Madison, WI 53726 USA.",jmullahy@wisc.edu; sarobert@wisc.edu,,,,,,,43,49,65,0,34,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

The framework is based on discrete choice theory, in which product differentiation and quality change are explicitly modeled. For illustration, the framework is then applied to the Japanese retail industry. The estimated quality index shows that, between 1985 and 1999, Japanese retail services quality improved, and the estimated COL index declined monotonically. Furthermore, the results from growth accounting suggest that ignoring both differentiation in the retail services market and changes in service quality may downwardly bias estimated output and productivity growth.","Osaka Prefecture Univ, Sch Econ, Naka Ku, Osaka 5998531, Japan",,"Sunada, M (通讯作者)，Osaka Prefecture Univ, Sch Econ, Naka Ku, 1-1 Gakuen Cho, Osaka 5998531, Japan.",msunada@eco.osakafu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,29,2,2,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Results from our analysis of over 1000 plans and a million participants demonstrate that most sponsors offer efficient investment menus, but participants undo this by constructing inefficient portfolios thus reducing their potential retirement wealth by one-fifth. Because participants are the main source of inefficient pension investment choices, strategies targeting their behavior may be useful - including improved default investment strategies or educational programs.

First, although skilled labor efficiency has a strong upward trend, I find no evidence of acceleration in its growth rate to support the common view that there has been an acceleration in the new skilled-biased technologies. Second, beginning around 1970, there has been a decline in the absolute level of the efficiency of unskilled labor, implying that the decline has played a significant role in the overall productivity slowdown and the substantial widening in the US wage structure.

J,"Volpi, F",,,,"Volpi, Franco",,,From Empiricism to Realism. Scientific Method and Economics in the Second Half of Twentieth Century,ECONOMIA POLITICA,,,Italian,Article,,,,,,,,"In the second half of the 20(th) century, the crisis of positivism led to the rise of new directions in the philosophy of science. In the same period many economists expressed an increasing dissatisfaction with the so far dominant economic paradigms. The aim of this paper is to point out the relation between the main trends in the philosophy of science and the debate on the nature and the method of economics. The paper will review the main thesis of logical empiricism, proposed by Hutchison as research guidelines in the field of economics, and the transition from verificationism to Popper's falsicarionism. It will then examine how the empirical-deductive method of positivism was interpreted. by Friedman and Samuelson, who many consider the main exponents of neo-classic economics. With Kuhn and Lakatos, the emphasis of the new philosophy of sciences shifts from what scientists should do to what they actually do in the research practice. Another important evolution occurs with the works of Feyerabend and Rorty and the emergence of post-modernist trends, which deny any a kind of epistemology and maintain that a theory is acceptable only inasmuch it is endorsed by the scientific community. The relation between these radical changes in the philosophy of sciences and the debate on the methods and status of economics is complex. Heterodoxes economic theories, wishing to address the crisis of mainstream economics and the economists' uneasiness, do not imply a refusal of positivism, and post-modernists approach had a limited appeal among economists. The paper presents the contributions of McCloskey and Rosenberg, two economists who particularly developed the arguments against positivist epistemology applied to economics, but it observes that, if interesting, such ideas do not provide a solid enough basis to overcome neoclassical orthodoxy. The conclusions briefly examine a still evolving and promising research approach, the critical realism recently promoted by the Cambridge Group, which links criticism to the empirical-deductive method with the proposal of alternative economic theories.",,,,,,,,,,,84,2,2,2,16,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

This paper presents Swedish survey evidence regarding i) Why people vote, ii) Why people vote as they do and their beliefs about why others vote as they do, and iii) How bad not voting and voting selfishly are perceived to be. Large majorities find it important to vote in order to affect the outcome, because it is a democratic obligation to vote, and because they want to express their political views. While most respondents say that they and others vote as they do both because of self-interest and because of conviction, people generally believe that they themselves vote less selfishly than do others, consistent with the hypothesis that people wish to have a self-image of being a good person. Moreover, people tend to believe that others with similar political views as themselves vote less selfishly than do people with the opposite political views, which is consistent with social identity theory. The norm saying that it is bad not to vote appears to be much stronger than the norm against voting selfishly. Women and older individuals are more affected by the norm saying that it is an obligation to vote.

Two popular forms of spatial autocorrelation are considered, namely, spatial autoregressive random effects (SAR-RE) and spatial moving average random effects (SMA-RE).

While there has been dramatic progress in information and communications technology, the recent record of innovation in the crucially important agriculture, energy, transportation, and health care sectors is cause for concern. The paper also considers whether the pace of innovation is sufficient to improve or even maintain living standards in the face of still rapidly growing population, global warming, and other challenges. I review the major market failures that lead to under-provision of innovation and question whether current innovation policy, particularly patent policy, is effective in promoting innovation.Ce memoire se demande si l'innovation a ralenti au cours des dernieres decennies.

Information induced a net increase in vaccines distributed and, perversely, the net increase originated entirely in non-priority individuals. The surprising finding is that calls on cooperative restraint induced an uncalled for positive response among priority individuals, while they induced an increase in cheating among non-priority individuals.

This paper studies the relationship between improvements in inspection technology within a Principal-Supervisor-Agent model, where the supervisor is an inspector who is hired by the principal to investigate the agent's potentially illegal actions. We show that when technology increases the marginal or total productivity of the supervisor's effort, improvements in inspection technology encourage some types of bribery. Although such technological improvements induce an equilibrium with bribery, compliance and social welfare can still rise. However, when technology and supervisory effort are sufficiently substitutable, improvements in technology may reduce compliance when bribery occurs in equilibrium even when those same technological improvements would have raised compliance in the absence of bribery. We also characterize the relationship between the principal's socially optimal technology and the anti-corruption policy available to the principal and find that the socially optimal inspection technology may be a substitute for or a complement to the anti-corruption policy. Finally, we show that for any set of policies that optimally induces a no-bribe equilibrium, there exists another set of policies that induces an equilibrium with bribery that is pareto superior to it.","[Samuel, Andrew] Loyola Univ Maryland, Baltimore, MD USA; [Lowen, Aaron] Grand Valley State Univ, Grand Rapids, MI USA",Loyola University Maryland; Grand Valley State University,"Samuel, A (通讯作者)，Loyola Univ Maryland, Baltimore, MD USA.",asamuel@loyola.edu,,"Lowen, Aaron/0000-0002-1769-9693",,,,,18,2,2,0,13,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,,,ECON GOV,Econ.

For R&D intensive industries, the effects of FDI on TFP growth through inter-industry linkages are small, but imports turn out to be an important source for TFP growth.Il existe une vaste litterature sur les effets de l'investissement direct de l'etranger (IDE) sur la productivite par le truchement des liens interindustriels.

The price dispersion of OBMCRs is higher than that of Dotcoms at the beginning and does not change much over time, but the price dispersion of Dotcoms increases significantly over time, indicating that the latter will eventually be higher than the former.

An executive makes a policy proposal and an overseer then decides whether or not to veto the executive's proposal. Both the executive and the overseer have private information as to the correct policy to pursue, and both are motivated by the desire to appear competent. A partisan overseer is one who, in addition to seeking to promote her own reputation, cares how her decision will impact the executive's reputation. Our main result is that partisanship can improve the efficacy of an oversight regime, as the distortions caused by a partisan overseer's desire to affect the executive's reputation can offset the distortions caused by her desire to enhance her own. Our results provide a new rationale for divided government, as partisan considerations are often necessary to prevent the overseer from rubber stamping all executive proposals. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Although the investment amount needed to start a business has more than tripled, this amount remains low enough that formal bank loans remain an insignificant source of finance. Because of low entry barriers, the number of firms in the cluster has risen, driving down profits and bidding up wages, particularly since the year 2000. Facing severe competition, more firms have begun to upgrade their product quality.

This study investigates the relevance of the EPS for Chinese exports of apples and pears to the EU accounting for changes over time and seasonal variation. Our results suggest that the high relevance of the EPS for apples originating in China was of temporary nature, whereas the relevance of the EPS for pears originating in China is of a more general nature. In addition, the relevance of the EPS varies seasonally. Finally, we find that the production of pears in China is more competitive than the production of apples vis-a-vis the EU. Therefore, China's fresh fruit and vegetable (FFV) producers would benefit more from an improved EU market access for pears than for apples. Thus, China should put more effort in negotiating improved EU market access conditions for pears rather than for apples. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Our findings contradict the findings of price, output, exchange rate and trade puzzles that have been found in many empirical studies. Furthermore they are consistent with the theoretical expectations regarding the effect of a contractionary policy.

Transitions from jobs to unemployment are countercyclical, but the effects are small and in most cases insignificant.

Co-evolution is generated by two elements missing in previous analyses: securitisation and bank equity capital. As banks evolve via improvements in credit screening, they securitise higher quality credits. This encourages greater investor participation and spurs capital market evolution. And, if capital market evolution is spurred by greater investor participation, banks find it cheaper to raise equity capital to satisfy endogenously arising risk-sensitive capital requirements. Bank evolution is thus stimulated as banks consequently serve previously unserved high-risk borrowers.

It is found that both R&D and on-the-job training positively contribute to total factor productivity (TFP). Firms' investment in employees' health insurance and pensions, which are components of workers' compensation, generate a productivity-enhancing effect, supporting the efficiency wage hypothesis. The estimated impact of R&D on productivity varies among different forms of ownership, and foreign-owned enterprises experience higher R&D efficiency than state or private enterprises. After controlling for potential endogenous causality between TFP and R&D, the above findings remain unchanged. We also find that on-the-job training can improve the quality of human capital and is helpful in promoting productivity. Therefore, establishing indigenous technological capability through various technological sources is quite important, and the government should devote further effort to investing in human capital.","[Yang, Chih-Hai] Natl Cent Univ, Jhongli, Taiwan; [Lin, Chun-Hung] Tamkang Univ, Tamsui, Taiwan; [Ma, Daw] Chung Hua Inst Econ Res, Taipei, Taiwan",National Central University; Tamkang University,"Yang, CH (通讯作者)，Natl Cent Univ, Jhongli, Taiwan.",chyang@mgt.ncu.edu.tw; chlin@mail.tku.edu.tw; daw_ma@cier.edu.tw,,,,,,,31,19,19,1,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,SEP-OCT,2010,18.0,5,,,,,72,89,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2010.01213.x,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,649UG,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000281798800005,0

We find that periodic orbits and complex dynamics may arise even if the model under rational expectations has a unique stationary solution.

This conversion feature introduces another complication not only because of the added conversion timing problem (by the bond holder) but also because the equity holder needs to take future conversion into account when evaluating her expansion/financing decision. We have two main objectives here. We use game options techniques to analyze optimal strategies involved in this convertible debt financed expansion problem. The first goal is to provide a comprehensive framework and procedure for solving the problem in a mathematically tractable way. Secondly, we illustrate our solution method through a concrete example with economic analysis. This includes a comparison with straight bond financing and comparative statics with respect to price volatility and conversion ratio. In this regard, we attempt to clarify how the conversion feature affects the equity holder's investment decisions. Throughout the paper, we study expansion options by viewing a firm's existing operation, bankruptcy threat, conversion decisions and financing decisions all together. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We then show how this welfare loss can be estimated empirically using identifying variation in the price of insurance. Such variation, together with quantity data, allows us to estimate the demand for insurance. The same variation, together with cost data, allows us to estimate how insurers' costs vary as market participants endogenously respond to price. The slope of this estimated cost curve provides a direct test for both the existence and the nature of selection, and the combination of demand and cost curves can be used to estimate welfare. We illustrate our approach by applying it to data on employer-provided health insurance from one specific company. We detect adverse selection but estimate that the quantitative welfare implications associated with inefficient pricing in our particular application are small, in both absolute and relative terms.","[Einav, Liran; Cullen, Mark R.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Einav, Liran; Finkelstein, Amy] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Finkelstein, Amy] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Einav, L (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,"cullen, mark/0000-0001-7996-1864","NIA NIH HHS [R37 AG032449, R01 AG032449, R01 AG032449-01A1, R01 AG026291] Funding Source: Medline",NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,37,151,212,7,69,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

The trade-off between cash and a debit card as means of payment is incorporated such that a buyer incurs disutility cost proportional to the amount of cash holdings, while a seller accepting a debit card bears a fixed record-keeping cost regardless of transaction amount. As record-keeping cost decreases with the development of information technology over time, disutility cost of cash holdings required for pairwise trade eventually exceeds record-keeping cost so that all the agents with different wealth levels choose to use a debit card as a means of payment. Also, disutility cost of cash holdings required for pairwise trade would be higher for the rich than for the poor, implying the cross-sectional feature of payment pattern that the rich use a debit card more frequently than the poor. There are two distinct mechanisms that improve welfare as record-keeping cost decreases: one is to reduce deadweight loss from holding cash and the other is to reduce its distortionary effect on output produced in pairwise trade.

The Interaction of these two factors, which depend on the market state and the performance of winner and loser momentum portfolios in relation to the reference price, provide the key to explaining the intensity of the momentum and the likelihood of its long term reversal.

We show that reduced transaction costs cause licensors to raise royalties in some cases, which makes them worse off due to the 'tragedy of the anticommons'. Downstream welfare effects may also be positive or negative and we characterize the effects on downstream manufacturers and final consumers. We also show that total welfare is most likely to increase following a transaction cost reduction when the number of intellectual property rights per downstream use is small, or if rights are relatively substitutable in downstream use, but it is also possible for welfare to decrease.

In this paper, we focus on the relationship between incentives and social norms and survey the literature that could constitute the foundations of a motivation-based economic analysis of social norms. Our main findings are that (1) the interaction between incentives and social norms is far from obvious since taking social norms into account involves the introduction of supplementary motives, in addition to self-interest, into the economic analytical framework; (2) the analysis of the interaction between incentives and social norms resists an approach exclusively in terms of crowding-in and -out effects because it is sensitive to whether it concerns behaviours driven by honour or by social stigma; (3) as a result, it is difficult to precisely evaluate the policy implication of the interactions between incentives and social norms.","Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, Sophia Antipolis, France",Universite Cote d'Azur,"Festré, A (通讯作者)，Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, Sophia Antipolis, France.",,,,,,,,107,37,39,2,53,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

I show how work in the social studies of technology has successfully avoided the ontological problems associated with Veblenian economics.

Limited participation model is then used to inspect the effects of financial development and integration on macroeconomic volatility. Under a standard calibration, limited participation model leads to the conclusion that financial development and integration are associated with higher investment and output volatility.

Mobile telephony has brought new possibilities to the continent. Across urban-rural and rich-poor divides, mobile phones connect individuals to individuals, information, markets, and services. These effects can be particularly dramatic in rural Africa, where in many places mobile phones have represented the first modern telecommunications infrastructure of any kind. Mobile phones have greatly reduced communication costs, thereby allowing individuals and firms to send and to obtain information quickly and cheaply on a variety of economic, social, and political topics. An emerging body of research shows that the reduction in communication costs associated with mobile phones has tangible economic benefits, improving agricultural and labor market efficiency and producer and consumer welfare in specific circumstances and countries. This paper first examines the evolution of mobile phone coverage and adoption in sub-Saharan Africa over the past decade. We then explore the main channels through which mobile phones can effect economic outcomes and appraise current evidence of its potential to improve economic development. We conclude with directions for future research and outline the necessary conditions for mobile phones to promote broader economic development in Africa.","[Aker, Jenny C.] Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Aker, Jenny C.] Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Aker, Jenny C.] Ctr Global Dev, Washington, DC USA; [Mbiti, Isaac M.] So Methodist Univ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA",Tufts University; Tufts University; Southern Methodist University,"Aker, JC (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",Jenny.Aker@tufts.edu; Imbiti@smu.edu,,"Mbiti, Isaac Mulangu/0000-0003-0257-609X",,,,,81,797,930,14,221,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

These gains are only achieved if the turnover rate of committee members is low and the committee is small. The former is associated with a low risk of being replaced for not supporting the government's preferred policy.

We consider an n-country model in which international trade occurs between economies with imperfectly competitive product markets. In each country, the labor market is either unionized or non-unionized. We show that, if all countries are non-unionized, the global free trade network is both the unique pairwise stable network and the unique efficient network. If all countries are unionized, the global free trade network is pairwise stable and the unique efficient network among the class of symmetric networks. If some countries are unionized while others are non-unionized, other networks apart from the global free trade network may be pairwise stable. However, the efficient network is still the global free trade network. Thus, a conflict between stability and efficiency may occur. Moreover, starting from the network in which no country has signed a free trade agreement, all sequences of networks due to continuously profitable deviations do not lead (in most cases) to the global free trade network, even when global free trade is stable.","[Mauleon, Ana] Fac Univ St Louis, FNRS, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Mauleon, Ana] Fac Univ St Louis, CEREC, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Mauleon, Ana; Vannetelbosch, Vincent] Catholic Univ Louvain, FNRS, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Mauleon, Ana; Song, Huasheng; Vannetelbosch, Vincent] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Song, Huasheng] Zhejiang Univ, CRPE, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China; [Song, Huasheng] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Econ, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China",University Saint-Louis - Bruxelles; Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS; University Saint-Louis - Bruxelles; Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Catholique Louvain; Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University,"Mauleon, A (通讯作者)，Fac Univ St Louis, FNRS, Blvd Jardin Bot 43, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",mauleon@fusl.ac.be; songucl@hotmail.com; vincent.vannetelbosch@uclouvain.be,"Mauleon, Ana/H-1970-2015","Song, Huasheng/0000-0002-6047-3841",,,,,31,10,12,2,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

The approach we take involves a two-stage process where output efficiency scores are first estimated using data envelopment analysis, and then in the second stage, variation in the resulting efficiency scores is explained using a truncated regression model with inference based on a semi-parametric bootstrap routine. Among the results we find that a heavy industrial presence is associated with reduced agricultural production efficiency and may be an indication that externalities from the industrial process, such as air and ground water pollution, affect agricultural production. We also find evidence that counties with a large percentage of the rural labor force engaged in agriculture tend to be less efficient, and suggests that nurturing and promoting growth of non-primary agriculture may lead to more efficient use of labor resources in agriculture.

However, it is difficult to analyze the exchange rate impact on services due to the lack of price data. Regression of output or export on exchange rate, while highly intuitive, is likely to suffer from the endogeneity problem since Singapore's exchange rate is used as a counter-cyclical policy tool. This results in inconsistent estimates.

Traditionally, comovement is assessed in the time domain through the well-known correlation coefficient while the evolving properties are investigated either through a rolling window or by considering non-overlapping periods. More recently, Croux et al. [Review of Economics and Statistics 83 (2001)] have proposed a measure of comovement in the frequency domain. While it allows to quantify the comovement at the frequency level, such a measure disregards the fact that the strength of the comovement may vary over time. Herein, it is proposed a new measure of comovement resorting to wavelet analysis. This wavelet-based measure allows one to assess simultaneously the comovement at the frequency level and over time.

Our results indicate that increased compulsory education from seven to nine years increased the general level of education beyond the compulsory education. We also find that the effect of family background on educational attainment was weaker after the reform. The average treatment effect on returns to education is surprisingly high for education of intermediate duration. This means that increasing the general level of education potentially generates high returns in the form of wages.

As a result, it becomes necessary for each household to store its own water as a hedge against this uncertainty. Since arrivals of water are not synchronized across households, serious distributional inefficiencies arise. We develop a model describing the optimal intertemporal depletion of each household's private water storage if it is uncertain when water will next arrive to replenish supplies. The model is calibrated using survey data from Mexico City, a city where many households store water in sealed rooftop tanks known as tinacos. The calibrated model is used to evaluate the potential welfare gains that would occur if alternative modes of water provision were implemented. We estimate that most of the potential distributional inefficiencies can be eliminated simply by making the frequency of deliveries the same across households which now face haphazard deliveries. This would require neither costly investments in infrastructure nor price increases. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we show that the effect of a mean-preserving increase in risk in wage rate or non-labor income on labor supply is best understood as a special case of an Nth degree risk increase (as defined by Ekern (Econ Lett 6:329-333, 1980)) and the conditions for signing the effect of a higher-order risk increase in wage rate or non-labor income on labor supply are analogous to those for signing the effect of a simple non-stochastic decrease in wage rate or non-labor income.

In a controlled laboratory experiment based on a sequential dictator game, we find that subjects tend to give more when placed in a generosity tournament, and tend to give less when placed in an earnings tournament - even if there is no award whatsoever for winning the tournament. Further we find that subjects' experimental behavior correlates with their responses to a post-experiment questionnaire, particularly questions addressing altruistic and rivalrous behavior.

The less democratic and the smaller a country the greater is its loss due to a catastrophe. In autocracies, exports and imports are significantly reduced.

Using firm level input and output data and employing a nonparametric data envelopment analysis (DEA), we calculate technical, pure technical and allocative efficiencies for a sample of 82 firms collected over two periods of time: 1993 and 1998. Then, applying a Malmquist index method, we calculate indices of total factor productivity change and decompose them into technological change, technical efficiency change and scale efficiency change. Our results show that the majority of Bangladeshi manufacturing firms experienced a positive total factor productivity growth between 1993 and 1998, averaging 29% over a five-year period. Export-oriented firms have performed better than import-oriented firms in improving their technical efficiency relative to the hest-practice firms in their own sub-group. When these results are compared with the official statistics on the output performance of manufacturing firms, we can conclude that trade liberalization in the 1990s did not adversely affect the Bangladeshi manufacturing industry.

The purpose of the present paper is to study the link between performance of multinational firms and the choice to participate in foreign investment. In so doing, this paper explicitly differentiates exports and FDI decisions. Using firm-level data for large South Korean manufacturing firms. I provide evidence that the premium for FDI is huge compared to exports, and that good firms undertake FDI. Studying performance across firms, I find that firms that engage in FDI outperform other firms in the future in all possible dimensions; they are larger, pay higher wages, and are also more productive. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that good firms self-select to engage in FDI. I also find clear evidence that past FDI experience has a strong positive effect on the probability of current investment abroad. This implies that the sunk cost involved in FDI plays a role in current decisions to undertake FDI.","Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea",Korea University,"Lee, H (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",honglee@korea.ac.kr,,"Lee, Hongshik/0000-0002-7189-2494",,,,,34,8,8,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

After financial liberalization, local investors have a magnified informational advantage since information processed under autarky remains useful after liberalization. A gradual shift towards foreign assets occurs as the relevance of autarkic information declines over time. In the long run, home bias remains large due to the interaction between information and portfolio choices. Empirical evidence supports the main predictions of our model, namely that bias increases with information capacity and decreases with financial openness. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We find that an increase in the overall education public spending crowds out the total level of private contributions and increases the share of resources that households devote to K-12 education. For a given public budget, a higher share of K-12 public funding induces higher private education spending overall, of which a larger share goes towards higher education. The model broadly matches data on education finance in the OECD countries. The calibrated parameter values suggest that at both stages public and private inputs are good yet imperfect substitutes, with a higher degree of complementarity in basic education. We show that the growth maximizing share of public spending devoted to K-12 should be high, irrespective of the size of the public budget. Using the calibrated model to compare the structure of education funding in the EU and the US, we find that, to maximize growth, high tax countries should use more of their public resources in tertiary education relative to low tax countries. This suggests that US efforts to improve K-12 education and the reform of higher education in Europe are consistent with the objective of increased economic growth. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, a link is made with an approximation of an arbitrary order of a general indirect utility function.

As eligibility for UI does not automatically follow from employment, the two types of unemployed workers have different threat points, which delivers equilibrium wage dispersion. The parameters of the model are estimated for France, and the model is also calibrated for Denmark and the U.S. Re-entitlement effects are shown to be sizeable for all three countries. For France, re-entitlement effects lower by 15% the rise in the wage and by 25% the rise in unemployment following a 10% increase in the benefit level. Finally, we show that in all three countries the optimal compensation system is characterized by time-decreasing unemployment benefits and non-automatic eligibility for UI, with higher levels of both UI and UA benefits, a smaller decrease in benefits over time, and a longer employment duration required for UI eligibility than in the current system.

I find that migrant women after migration do not experience significantly different earnings or employment prospects, compared to migrant males and female stayers. They do, however, face an additional negative effect on hours worked and on annual income.

Yet while civil war is central to many nations' development, it has stood at the periphery of economics research and teaching. The past decade has witnessed a long overdue explosion of research into war's causes and consequences. We summarize progress, identify weaknesses, and chart a path forward. Why war? Existing theory is provocative but incomplete, omitting advances in behavioral economics and making little progress in key areas, like why armed groups form and cohere, or how more than two armed sides compete. Empirical work finds that low per capita incomes and slow economic growth are both robustly linked to civil war. Yet there is little consensus on the most effective policies to avert conflicts or promote postwar recovery. Cross-country analysis of war will benefit from more attention to causal identification and stronger links to theory. We argue that micro-level analysis and case studies are also crucial to decipher war's causes, conduct, and consequences. We bring a growth theoretic approach to the study of conflict consequences to highlight areas for research, most of all the study of war's impact on institutions. We conclude with a plea for new and better data.

REMS (a Rational Expectations Model for the Spanish economy) is a small open economy dynamic general equilibrium model in the vein of the New-Neoclassical-Keynesian synthesis models, with a strongly micro-founded system of equations. In the long run REMS behaves in accordance with the neoclassical growth model. In the short run, it incorporates nominal, real and financial frictions. Real frictions include adjustment costs in consumption (via habits in consumption and rule-of-thumb households) and investment into physical capital. Due to financial frictions, there is no perfect arbitrage between different types of assets. The model also allows for slow adjustment in wages and price rigidities, which are specified through a Calvo-type Phillips curve. All these modelling choices are fairly in line with other existing models for the Spanish economy. One valuable contribution of REMS to the renewed vintage of D(S)GE models attempting to feature the Spanish economy is the specification of the labour market according to the search paradigm, which is best suited to assess the impact of welfare policies on both the intensive and extensive margins of employment. The model's most valuable asset is the rigour of the analysis of the transmission channels linking policy action with economic outcomes.","[Bosca, J.

This paper instead applies a GARCH-in-Mean (GARCH-M) model to estimate a time-varying measure of risk aversion that is based on the observed risk preferences of energy hedging market participants. The resulting estimates are applied to derive explicit risk aversion based optimal hedge strategies for both short and long hedgers. Out-of-sample results are also presented based on a unique approach that allows us to forecast risk aversion, thereby estimating hedge strategies that address the potential future needs of energy hedgers. We find that the risk aversion based hedges differ significantly from simpler OLS hedges. When implemented in-sample, risk aversion hedges for short hedgers outperform the OL-S hedge ratio in a utility based comparison. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Individuals can display two kinds of behavior: G(good) or B (bad). We assume that the exposure of a G agent to bad behavior on the part of peers/neighbors triggers her own switch to B behavior, but only temporarily. We model the implications of such peer effects as an epidemic process in the standard SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) framework. The key novelty of our model is that, unlike in the received literature, the network is taken to change over time within the same time scale as behavior. Specifically, we posit that links connecting two G agents last longer, reflecting the idea that B agents tend to be avoided. The main concern of the paper is to understand the extent to which such biased network turnover may play a significant role in supporting G behavior in a social system. And indeed we find that network coevolution has nontrivial and interesting effects on long-run behavior. This yields fresh insights on the role of (endogenous) peer pressure on the diffusion of social behavior and also has some bearing on the traditional study of disease epidemics.

As they only comprise a small share of the global coconut product export market, demand for coconut products from North Sulawesi is generally very elastic. Conversely, the supply of coconuts is highly inelastic, especially in the short to medium term. Hence, small shifts in supply and demand lead to large fluctuations in farmer incomes. In this context, an equilibrium displacement model is used to examine the intra-industry consequences of R&D investments in farm productivity and product development. These investments are assessed in terms of the producer surplus benefits that they generate.","[Henderson, Benjamin] Food & Agr Org United Nations, I-00153 Rome, Italy; [Henry, Lynn; MacAulay, Gordon] Univ Sydney, Fac Agr Food & Nat Resources, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Tatuh, Jen] Sam Ratulangi Univ, Fac Agr, Socioecon Dept, Manado, North Sulawesi, Indonesia",Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); University of Sydney; Universitas Sam Ratulangi,"Henderson, B (通讯作者)，Food & Agr Org United Nations, Viale Terme Caracalla, I-00153 Rome, Italy.",benjamin.henderson@fao.org; l.henry@usyd.edu.au; g.macaulay@usyd.edu.au; jentatuh@yahoo.com,,,,,,,32,1,1,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

The main finding is that the government taxes capital and subsidizes labor so that only the dynamic inefficiency of future capital taxes remains. If agents' preference for the public good is sufficiently high, then capital is confiscated. Setting bounds on taxes alleviates the dynamic inefficiency inherent in capital taxation, but some implementations carry a high welfare cost. Allowing for endogenous capital utilization makes the current capital tax distortionary and implies capital and labor tax rates that are relatively close to those measured for the U.S. economy.

A mixed vector autoregression (VAR)/event study approach is used for this purpose. The first empirical finding is that in the late 1990s, the negative effect of fiscal policy was larger and more persistent than the positive effect. This finding suggests that the large fiscal expansions in the late 1990s were inadequate for stimulating the macroeconomy in terms of the size and persistence of their policy effects. The second finding is that the permanent tax cuts implemented in the former part of the 1990s increased consumer durable spending significantly and persistently. This increase may reflect consumers' incentive to spend before the increase in the consumption tax rate in April 1997. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Despite minor differences in mean performance, many more boys than girls perform at the right tail of the distribution. This gender gap has been documented for a series of math tests including the AP calculus test, the mathematics SAT, and the quantitative portion of the Graduate Record Exam (GRE). The objective of this paper is not to discuss whether the mathematical skills of males and females differ, be it a result of nurture or nature. Rather we argue that the reported test scores do not necessarily match the gender differences in math skills. We will present results that suggest that the evidence of a large gender gap in mathematics performance at high percentiles in part may be explained by the differential manner in which men and women respond to competitive test-taking environments. The effects in mixed-sex settings range from women failing to perform well in competitions, to women shying away from environments in which they have to compete. We find that the response to competition differs for men and women, and in the examined environment, gender difference in competitive performance does not reflect the difference in noncompetitive performance. We argue that the competitive pressures associated with test taking may result in performances that do not reflect those of less-competitive settings. Of particular concern is that the distortion is likely to vary by gender and that it may cause gender differences in performance to be particularly large in mathematics and for the right tail of the performance distribution. Thus the gender gap in math test scores may exaggerate the math advantage of males over females.","[Niederle, Muriel] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Niederle, Muriel] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Vesterlund, Lise] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA USA",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Niederle, M (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",niederle@stanford.edu; vester@pitt.edu,"Niederle, Muriel/F-2613-2011",,,,,,55,236,325,3,57,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

The provisioning of infrastructure services in India is steadily moving away from the realm of government to that of private sector. The critical issue has been getting economic structures right: in those sectors where there has been a recognition (and systemic implementation) of the principles of appropriate market structures, competition, and measured regulatory oversight, development has been rapid. The outcomes have varied by sector, with Indian telecom providing services that are globally cost-effective and electricity remaining a nightmare for consumers and a major bottleneck for India's continuing growth. While a few ports have significantly increased their efficiency, the ports sector overall remains behind international benchmarks. The initial remarkable spurt in the National Highways Development Project enabled (and probably to an extent, fuelled) growth, and brought in some of India's most innovative policy responses, but there has been a slowdown in momentum in expanding the programme. In recent years, there has simply not been the requisite (political) commitment to ownership of the innovation and motivation that is needed to sustain the pace of reform in key infrastructure sectors.

The central bank has private information about the future aggregate shock. We compare two possible monetary policy regimes, transparent and opaque. The ex-ante welfare level is higher under the Opaque regime, in which the central bank does not release its forecast. This is due to smoother consumption over the business cycle. We demonstrate that the welfare difference between the two regimes increases with the degree of monopoly power in the intermediate sector. In particular, the welfare difference vanishes when the intermediate sector is perfectly competitive. We also show that the welfare difference increases with the accuracy of information possessed by the central bank, and the welfare difference disappears when the central bank has no information advantage over the private sector about the economy, And, finally, we establish that the welfare difference increases with the level of shock fluctuations.

This paper examines the nature of this process, especially the relationship between returns in the stock market and returns on real investment. Shaikh (1998) makes the case that the rate of return on new physical (real) investment is the required rate of return for the stock market and that competitive forces produce a rough equalization between these two rates of return, what he terms turbulent arbitrage. In contrast to neoclassical theories of perfect competition, with its notions of perfect information and convergence to a uniform rate of return, the notion of turbulent arbitrage is a dynamic process that requires a tendency toward convergence as well as the constant differentiation of profit rates (Botwinick 1993). Data on rates of return at the country, industry, and firm level for Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States are analyzed and correlated with Shaikh's incremental rate of return on real investment which, it is argued, is the target of the equalization process. Statistical and econometric tests based on time series methods and pooling techniques support the hypothesis that the rate of return on equity prices is linked to the incremental return on real investment. In addition, this association is examined for two industries-steel and retail trade-across these same four countries. Global and domestic equity markets are found to be significantly correlated with the incremental returns for the steel industry but not for the retail trade sector.","[Hecht, Jason] Ramapo Coll, Anisfield Sch Business, Mahwah, NJ 07430 USA; [Sarich, John] New York City Dept Finance, New York, NY USA",Ramapo College New Jersey (RCNJ),"Hecht, J (通讯作者)，Ramapo Coll, Anisfield Sch Business, Mahwah, NJ 07430 USA.",jhecht@ramapo.edu,,,,,,,51,0,0,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

Because of the usefulness of this class of models for addressing questions regarding the impact and consequences of alternative monetary policies they are nowadays widely used for forecasting and policy analysis at central banks and other institutions. In this paper we provide a brief description of the two main aggregate euro area models at the ECB. Both models share a common core but their detailed specification differs reflecting their specific focus and use. The New Area Wide Model (NAWM) has a more elaborate international block, which is useful for conditioning the euro area projections on assumptions about foreign economic activity, prices and interest rates and to widen the scope for scenario analysis. The Christiano, Motto and Rostagno (CMR) model instead has a more developed financial sector, which allows it to be used for monetary and financial scenarios and for cross checking. Based on the comparison of two models we find a broad agreement on the qualitative predictions they make, although, in quantitative terms, there are some differences. However, the perspectives provided by the two models are often complementary, rather than conflicting.","[Smets, Frank; Christoffel, Kai; Coenen, Guenter; Motto, Roberto; Rostagno, Massimo] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Smets, F (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany.",Frank.Smets@ecb.int,,,,,,,27,17,18,0,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

We find that the standard results of international taxation do not carry over to the case of international mergers and acquisitions. The deduction system is no longer optimal from a national perspective and the foreign tax credit system fails to ensure global optimality. The tax exemption system is optimal if ownership advantage is a public good within the multinational firm.

We place these instruments in a dynamic context. Here, cost minimization is defined in an intertemporal setting allowing for induced technical change. It turns out that the relative performance of alternative policy instruments regarding their 'dynamic cost-effectiveness' crucially depends on the information available to the involved agents.

Many argue that a renminbi appreciation would help to rebalance China's trade. Using a panel dataset including China's exports to 33 countries we find that a 10% renminbi (RMB) appreciation would reduce ordinary exports by 12% and processed exports by less than 4%. A 10% appreciation of all other East Asian currencies would reduce processed exports by 6%. A 10% appreciation throughout the region would reduce processed exports by 10%. Since ordinary exports tend to be simple, labor-intensive goods while processed exports are sophisticated, capital-intensive goods, a generalized appreciation in East Asia would generate more expenditure-switching towards US and European goods and contribute more to resolving global imbalances than an appreciation of the RMB or of other Asian currencies alone.","[Thorbecke, Willem] George Mason Univ, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1008901, Japan; [Thorbecke, Willem] RIETI, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1008901, Japan; [Smith, Gordon] Anderson Univ, Anderson, SC 29621 USA",,"Thorbecke, W (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Chiyoda Ku, 1-3-1 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1008901, Japan.",wthorbec@gmu.edu; gsmith@andersonuniversity.edu,"Thorbecke, Willem/I-1963-2019","Thorbecke, Willem/0000-0003-2688-7044",,,,,23,79,90,1,31,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We explicitly model the trade-off between devoting effort to studying and to job search. Furthermore, we allow for on-the-job search. The model is estimated using a unique data set of individuals who completed undergraduate education in the Netherlands between 1995 and 2001. Our estimation results show that labor market returns of high grades are low. Wage increases between jobs are explained by labor market friction rather than returns of early work experience. Our results indicate that a 1 percentage point decrease in the unemployment rate increases wage offers on average by 3 percent, but that the amount of job search effort is not very sensitive to business cycle fluctuations. Policy simulations show that study effort and hence academic achievement are much more sensitive to financial incentives than job search effort and labor market outcomes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The calculation of the structural fiscal balance is useful, since it provides a clear picture of the fiscal stance of the economy and it is essential in the context of a medium term fiscal framework. In order to ensure the robustness of the estimation, we employed two methodologies for the computation of the elasticities of various categories of government revenues and expenditures with respect to the output gap. The two approaches issued similar results, the overall average budget sensitivity being equal to 0.285 and 0.290, respectively. The amplitude of the cyclical budget balance is around 1% of GDP. After constant improvement, the structural balance worsened in 2008, due mainly to the current crisis.","[Altar, Moisa; Necula, Ciprian; Bobeica, Gabriel] Acad Econ Studies, DOF1N, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Altar, M (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, DOF1N, Bucharest, Romania.",maltar@ase.ro,"Necula, Ciprian/AAM-6491-2020; Bobeica, Gabriel/B-6771-2011","Necula, Ciprian/0000-0002-8809-3605",,,,,16,8,8,0,11,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

The advent of electronic journal distribution implies that bundling is an efficient sales strategy and can act to extend the reach of a journal. Current arrangements are discussed and shown to lead to tensions between commercial publishers and nonprofit journals. The article argues that nonprofit journals should not necessarily abandon collection sales programs. Rather, nonprofit journals may benefit from withdrawing from commercial publishers which distribute their own for-profit journals, and joining together to be distributed by less commercial publishers who set relatively low prices for their collections.

Goals, defined in the strategy, and instruments for seeking them are identified by structural indicators as well as their systems. It is possible to evaluate specific country's situation and compare it with other countries by using various specific indexes or applying statistical - mathematical methods. The aim of this article is to describe main structural indicators, which identify the implementation of Lisbon Strategy as well as progress in sustainable development and to evaluate Lithuania's and other Baltic States' position in the EU using statistical methods. In order to achieve this aim, the following tasks were raised: 1) to describe and classify structural indicators; 2) to overview main methods of quantitative analysis and to apply them when evaluating Lithuania's and other Baltic States' position in the EU. Lithuania's progress in achieving Lisbon Strategy goals was evaluated using the system of 13 shortlist structural indicators from Eurostat database and applying MULTIMOORA (Multi-Objective Optimization by Ratio Analysis plus Full Multiplicative Form) method. The analysis showed that Lithuania is among top EU countries by such indicators as employment rate, youth education attainment rate, comparative price level and greenhouse gas emission. Thus there are no serious environmental problems in Lithuania and its production can successfully compete at international markets due to relative low production costs. Lithuania is backward by GDP per capita, labour productivity and employment rate of older workers. In addition, energy intensity of the economy needs to be optimized. Considering all the above, technologic backwardness is characteristic for Lithuania's industry (due to low labour productivity on the one hand and high energy intensity on the other) which can be eradicated by encouraging innovations and R&D activities. Baltic region is quite homogenous in innovation and research as well as in economic reform areas, thus it can become attractive for investors. Lithuania and Estonia could be assigned to medium performance group and Latvia is on the very limit of the low performance group.","[Balezentis, Alvydas] Mykolas Romeris Univ, LT-10101 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Balezentis, Tomas; Valkauskas, Romualdas] Vilnius Univ, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania",Mykolas Romeris University; Vilnius University,"Balezentis, A (通讯作者)，Mykolas Romeris Univ, Valakupiu G 5, LT-10101 Vilnius, Lithuania.",a.balezentis@gmail.com; t.balezentis@gmail.com; romualdas.valkauskas@ef.vu.lt,"Balezentis, Tomas/D-8609-2015","Balezentis, Tomas/0000-0002-3906-1711",,,,,50,50,50,0,34,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-8619,,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Workers, who were paid to enter data, were exposed to different degrees of peer pressure under both payment systems. The peer pressure was generated in the form of private information about the productivity of their peers. We have two main results. First, we find no level of peer pressure for which the productivity of either male or female workers is significantly higher than the productivity without peer pressure. Second, we find that very low and very high levels of peer pressure can significantly decrease productivity (particularly for men paid fixed wages). These results are consistent with models of conformism and self-motivation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The basic hypothesis is that apparel exporting firms from central and Eastern Europe can draw on the Asian tigers experience, by shifting from mere assembly of imported inputs to other forms of exporting, which are more domestically integrated and higher value-added. They can thus concomitantly, follow the Asian model of triangular trade and turn to account their own trumps, resulting from European integration.

This study focuses on addressing the direct impact of a female school stipend programme in Punjab, Pakistan - Did the intervention increase female enrolment in public schools? To address this question, we draw upon data from the provincial school censuses 2003 and 2005. We estimate the net growth in female enrolments in grade 6-8 in stipend eligible schools. Impact evaluation analysis, including difference-and-difference (DD), triple differencing (DDD) and regression-discontinuity design (RDD), indicate a modest but statistically significant impact of the intervention. The preferred estimator derived from a combination of DDD and RDD empirical strategies suggests that the average programme impact between 2003 and 2005 was an increase of six female students per school in terms of absolute change and an increase of 9% in female enrolment in terms of relative change. A triangulation effort is also undertaken using two rounds of a nationally representative household survey before and after the intervention. Even though the surveys are not representative at the sub-provincial level, the results corroborate evidence of the impact using school census data.","[Chaudhury, Nazmul; Parajuli, Dilip] World Bank, Washington, DC USA",The World Bank,"Chaudhury, N (通讯作者)，World Bank, MCH-261, Washington, DC USA.",nchaudhury@worldbank.org,,,,,,,21,28,30,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We find that EPL reduces investment per worker, capital per worker and value added per worker in high reallocation sectors relative to low reallocation sectors, while increasing the average frequency at which firms adjust their capital stock. The reduction in capital per worker and value added per worker is less pronounced in financially sound firms. Also, the propensity to invest appears to increase only in firms that are likely to be financially unconstrained.

A split decision occurs when the U. S. government simultaneously investigates multiple countries for dumping the same product but imposes antidumping duties on only a subset of these countries. In the U. S., 76% of antidumping petitions filed between 1980 and 2004 involved two or more countries accused of dumping the same product. Among these multi-country investigations, roughly 30% concluded with a split decision in the final stage of an investigation. The model in this paper shows that selectively applying antidumping duties against foreign countries that are selling increased quantities of imports at a price below long run average total cost improves the importing country's welfare. Imperfectly competitive firms in different countries face stochastic demand and are subject to capacity constraints. As a result, foreign firms dump when they face weak demand in their own markets. In response to the shift in a foreign country's export supply, the importing country's optimal rent-shifting tariff against the foreign country with weak demand increases while its optimal tariff against other countries falls. This paper suggests an economic rationale behind the differential treatment afforded to different countries accused of dumping.","Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL 60604 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago,"Crowley, MA (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, 230 S LaSalle St, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",mcrowley@frbchi.org,,"Crowley, Meredith A./0000-0003-2864-4580",,,,,31,3,3,1,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We show that, despite large differences in their immigrant populations, there are similar and significant differences in cyclical responses between immigrants and natives in both countries, even conditional on education, age, and location. We decompose changes in outcomes into a secular trend and a business cycle component. We find significantly larger unemployment responses to economic shocks for low-skilled workers relative to high-skilled workers and for immigrants relative to natives within the same skill group. There is little evidence for differential wage responses to economic shocks. We offer three explanations for these findings: an equilibrium search model, where immigrants experience higher job separation rates, a model of dual labour markets, and differences in the complementarity of immigrants and natives to capital.

In a context of mediocre demand growth, productivity in services is growing slowly, which in economies increasingly oriented towards services is a strong restriction to the increase in aggregate productivity. On the other hand, manufacturing contributes very significantly to that productivity growth. This is because industry presents better conditions for achieving productivity gains trough the expansion of demand. This is confirmed by the empirical analysis whose statistical source is the Groningen Growth and Development Centre, 60-Industry Database (GGDC).

In symmetric two-by-two games, basins of attraction are invariant to a wide range of learning rules including best response dynamics, replicator dynamics, and fictitious play. In this paper, we construct a class of three-by-three symmetric games for which the overlap in the basins of attraction under best response learning and replicator dynamics is arbitrarily small. We then derive necessary and sufficient conditions on payoffs for these two learning rules to create basins of attraction with vanishing overlap. The necessary condition requires that with probability one the initial best response is not an equilibrium to the game. The existence of parasitic or misleading actions allows subtle differences in the learning rules to accumulate.","[Golman, Russell] Univ Michigan, Dept Appl & Interdisciplinary Math, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Page, Scott E.] Univ Michigan, Ctr Study Complex Syst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Golman, R (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Appl & Interdisciplinary Math, 2082 E Hall,530 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",rgolman@umich.edu; spage@umich.edu,,,,,,,40,14,14,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,,,J EVOL ECON,J.

We consider a principal agent relationship where the agent may be trustworthy (dedicated to the project) or not. The principal may trust the agent (i.e. have a high belief of facing a trustworthy agent), or distrust him. The proposal of a complete contract, including fines and other explicit incentives, is shown to signal distrust. When trust is important in some non-contractible part of the relationship, a principal may prefer to leave the contract incomplete rather than to signal distrust by proposing a complete contract. Contractual incompleteness arises endogenously due to asymmetric information about how much one partner trusts the other side. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

What is the correct notion of efficiency to use? To address these issues, this paper develops an extension of the notion of Pareto efficiency, referred to as Millian efficiency, to evaluate symmetric allocations in an overlapping generations setting with endogenous fertility. This extension is based on preferences of those agents who are actually alive, and exclusively allows for welfare comparisons of symmetric allocations. First, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions to determine whether an allocation is Millian efficient or not, and we show that the sufficient conditions for dynamic efficiency offered by Cass (1972) and Balasko and Shell (1980) cannot be directly applied when fertility decisions are endogenous. Second, we characterize Millian efficient allocations as the equilibria of a decentralized price mechanism, and we present a sufficient condition for dynamic efficiency that uses the sequence of prices associated to such decentralized equilibria. Finally, we analyse how intergenerational policies should be designed to restore efficiency and achieve net welfare gains in two different settings in which markets yield inefficient allocations: dynamic inefficiencies and financial market incompleteness regarding human capital. In the former, a pay-as-you-go social security system eliminates dynamic inefficiencies, provided pensions are explicitly linked with fertility decisions. In the latter, a specific link between social security and public education becomes a necessary condition for Millian efficiency.","[Ignacio Conde-Ruiz, J.] Univ Complutense Madrid, FEDEA, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Gimenez, Eduardo L.] Univ Vigo, Rede Res Grp Econ Business & Environm, Vigo, Spain; [Perez-Nievas, Mikel] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Santiago De Compostela, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid; Universidade de Vigo; Universidade de Santiago de Compostela,"Conde-Ruiz, JI (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, FEDEA, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",,"Giménez, Eduardo L./L-3361-2014; Conde-Ruiz, Jose Igancio/L-6523-2014","Giménez, Eduardo L./0000-0002-3089-854X; Perez-Nievas Montiel, Mikel, Miguel/0009-0001-1402-3655",,,,,35,19,21,1,19,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Without common approach as to evaluating progress and development based on integral indices and calculus as well as the authentic source of information, there is always room for subjectivity. Integration into the European Union accelerates the solution of the difficulties of regional policy in Lithuania. Pay attention to the regions is a constant part of the policy of European Union countries. The article analyzes the concepts of a region. There are analysed the conceptions, which differ in the nature and role of the regions, dynamism and development of regionalization processes, level of economic integration. The conceptions are the following ones: social geography, administrative-territorial, institutional, geopolitical and economic. Furthermore, the evaluation analysis of regional development level and its application in different foreign countries, prosecuted by the researchers are introduced in this article. It has been proven that regional policy in the EU level is necessary, as the European Union consists of 27 member states with 493 million people and the home market. It is evident, that there are economic and social differences in such a large territory within states and 268 regions, and the process of convergence is very slow and problematic. Thus, the article focuses on working out an effective evaluation method, which could be applied to achieve reliable results and would be effective in solving problems of regional development. The evaluation of regions' social and economic development is a part of a broader analysis, comprising the preparation of evaluation methodology of regional policy's influence and application in the content of the EU, where the first stage includes the composition of optimal set of indicators of social and economic development of regions. It should allow to perform interregional comparisons in order to prove the effect the regional policy on the development of problem-orientated branches of a region. The prepared evaluation methodology is applied empirically evaluating social and economic development of the region in the context of NUTS 2 statistical regions of the European Union, situated in the territory of twelve new the EU member states.","[Kilijoniene, Akvile] Klaipeda Univ, LT-92291 Klaipeda, Lithuania; [Simanaviciene, Zaneta; Simanavicius, Arturas] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Klaipeda University; Kaunas University of Technology,"Kilijoniene, A (通讯作者)，Klaipeda Univ, H Manto Str 84, LT-92291 Klaipeda, Lithuania.",akvile_kilijoniene@yahoo.com; zaneta.simanaviciene@ktu.lt; arturassim@yahoo.com,"Simanaviciene, Zaneta/W-3675-2019; Simanaviciene, Zaneta/U-7817-2019","Simanaviciene, Zaneta/0000-0001-6008-2405;",,,,,72,30,30,0,20,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

While maximum efficiency in the spirit of Friedman advocates long-run deflation so that the nominal interest rate is zero, business cycle consideration requires positive long-run inflation so that the nominal interest rate can be adjusted for stabilization without encountering the zero bound. In an estimated DSGE model for the US economy that can generate both effects, we find that the welfare-maximizing monetary policy rule is characterized with a steady-state inflation rate of 0.12% per annum, significantly above the rate required for maximal efficiency and significantly below what is believed to have been targeted by the Federal Reserve. It is also found that, if the monetary authority tries to minimize typical loss functions comprising volatilities of macro variables such as output and inflation, the resultant policy rules are flawed: they lead to too high long-run inflation and too much policy activism, compared to rules that maximize welfare.","Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Int Econ & Law, Seoul 130791, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Kim, J (通讯作者)，Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Int Econ & Law, 270 Imundong Dongdaemungu, Seoul 130791, South Korea.",kjryoul@hufs.ac.kr,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

Of particular interest are the cooperative or communal farming structures among new entrants into Fiji's sugar industry. These structures are emerging in response to government rationalisation policies in agricultural support-from individuals to groups-and the growing emphasis from the indigenous community on economic activity to reflect community requirements, values and imperatives. Our study finds that growers who are members of a cooperative group have higher levels of technical efficiency than growers who live in villages and that their performance is on par with galala or independent growers. Group structures are used as vehicles to centralise management decision-making and pool resources, thereby overcoming experience and capital accumulation constraints. The research also shows that these structures provide a vital mechanism for aligning cultural values and legitimising individual economic activity that has communal benefits. This finding is not only important for Fiji's struggling agricultural sector, it points a way forward for other South Pacific island nations and other countries where agricultural intensification is carried out on communally owned land.","[Kingi, Tanira T.] Massey Univ, Inst Nat Resources, Palmerston North, New Zealand; [Kompas, Tom] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Massey University; Australian National University,"Kingi, TT (通讯作者)，Massey Univ, Inst Nat Resources, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",,"Kompas, T/F-5930-2010; Kompas, Tom/M-8851-2019","Kompas, Tom/0000-0002-0665-0966",,,,,52,1,2,1,6,ASIA PACIFIC PRESS,CANBERRA,"AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIV, CRAWFORD SCH ECONOMICS & GOVERNMENT, CANBERRA, ACT 0200, AUSTRALIA",0817-8038,,,PAC ECON BULL,Pac.

The paper focuses on the actually complete market (actually covered market) and on market niche (the uncovered part of markets). Studies show that from the viewpoint of logistic analysis, markets can be divided according to their closure. It has been established that according to the degree of closure a market can be open, close and intermediate. Possible scenarios of partly closed market formation have been studied.

Our analysis provides for the first time insights into the process of convergence across European banking markets as measured by the speed of adjustment of cost efficiency. In particular, we employ a quadratic loss function specification based on forward-looking rational expectations to model the underlying dynamics of efficiency scores in the banking industry of the EU-15 region over the period 1998-2005. Results show that there is considerable variation in the speed of adjustment across banking systems, while over time it appears that continuing efforts to advance financial integration have led to some improvement in the speed of adjustment to the long-run equilibrium.

Next, on the basis of effective demand model of economic dynamics, there follows a comparative analysis of GDP dynamics in the two countries in 2008-09 and of the factors that in 2009 made the rate of GDP growth positive in Poland and negative in Czech Republic. In 2009 both countries experienced the rate of exchange depreciation which, however, was significantly greater in Poland, as was the rise of rate of private savings, which negatively affects the GDP growth rate. On the other hand, fiscal expansion was slightly greater in Czech Republic than in Poland. What factors then helped to avoid the GDP growth to decline in 2009 in Poland but not in the Czech Republic? The key difference in the GDP generation was that in the latter country net exports were too small to offset the rate of growth of private savings, while in Poland improvement in the trade balance, heavily negative in earlier years, together with strong fiscal expansion outbalanced the effect of much greater than in the Czech Republic rise in the rate of private savings. The derived results are strongly sensitive to variations in such parameters of our model as sectoral import intensities and private propensity to save, which may well change with changes in growth of GDP and its components. This does not undermine theoretical foundations of our analysis, yet it limits validity of any conclusions with respect to hypothetical future impact of fiscal expansion or fiscal contraction. Nevertheless, it appears that maintaining a positive rate of GDP growth may require that the rate of private savings no longer continues to rise (i.e. that the average private propensity to consume no longer falls) at least until the dynamics of private investment and/or exports do not recover.","[Laski, Kazimierz] Uniwersytetu Linzu, Linz, Austria; [Zieba, Jolanta] Narodowy Bank Polski, Inst Ekon, Warsaw, Poland",Narodowy Bank Polski,"Laski, K (通讯作者)，Uniwersytetu Linzu, Linz, Austria.",k.laski@aon.at; jerzy.osiatynski@sejm.gov.pl; jolanta.zieba@nbp.pl,,,,,,,9,0,0,1,8,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2010,,6,,,,,805,830,,,,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,714BW,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000286783500003,0

Adopting the multieconomy income convergence model and employing the panel unit root testing techniques, this paper finds that relative incomes of Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao have no tendency to deviate from one another in the long run. The occurrence of income convergence among these Chinese economies can be attributed to rapid growth on the Mainland China and Macao sides but relatively sluggish performance of Hong Kong in recent years. Macao can be regarded as playing a catalytic role in this long-run income convergence process. The finding of convergence indicates promising prospects for deepening economic cooperation and integration among the Chinese economies for their long-run sustainable economic growth.","[Lei, Chun Kwok; Tam, Pui Sun] Univ Macau, Fac Business Adm, Macao, Peoples R China",University of Macau,"Lei, CK (通讯作者)，Univ Macau, Fac Business Adm, Macao, Peoples R China.",henrylei@umac.mo,"Tam, Pui Sun/AAN-2474-2020; Lei, CK Chun Kwok/HNC-3630-2023","Tam, Pui Sun/0000-0002-9790-2910; Lei, Chun Kwok/0000-0002-8939-4194",,,,,35,3,3,3,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Tobacco control spending is found to exert no significant effects on smoking prevalence across the 50 states. Cigarette prices are found to lower prevalence of daily smokers, but exert no effect on nondaily smoking prevalence. Several reasons are suggested for why these results might conflict with previous research. These include that most previous studies examined two states (California and Massachusetts) with long-standing tobacco control programmes and that most studies examined periods in which many of the states in their samples did not actively fund their programmes. Another reason may be that, unlike most previous studies, this study controls for the possibility that tobacco control spending is endogenous when, for example, states exhibiting relatively low smoking prevalence are also states with relatively high distaste for smoking and accordingly fund tobacco control programmes more generously. A negative relation between tobacco control spending and smoking prevalence does not necessarily indicate that higher spending causes lower prevalence when spending is endogenously determined.","Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Coll Business, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA",California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo,"Marlow, ML (通讯作者)，Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Coll Business, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA.",mmarlow@calpoly.edu,,,,,,,43,3,3,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In the case of a transition economy like China, it would be appropriate to assume the presence of a significant level of disparity in the cost of funds between State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and non-SOEs. For this purpose, a dataset of the provincial deposit rates and the provincial loan rates for the state and the nonstate sectors is built. Even after controlling the national- and province-specific shocks, the correlation between the local deposit rates and the local loan rates for the nonstate sector, in contrast with that for the state sector, is even higher than for the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries. The findings suggest that serious asymmetric information problems between banks and non-SOEs might impede cross-regional lending and prevent the development of the nonstate sector within China.","Waseda Univ, Fac Educ & Integrated Arts & Sci, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1698050, Japan",Waseda University,"Ohkuma, M (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Fac Educ & Integrated Arts & Sci, Shinjuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishi Waseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan.",ohkuma@aoni.waseda.jp,,,,,,,14,3,3,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

If a reduction in user sanctions leads to an increase in consumption, drug prices will rise unless supply is perfectly elastic. In equilibrium, a change in consumption associated with decreasing user sanctions could be relatively small if supply is upward sloping. Using a novel dataset with rich transaction-level information, this paper evaluates the impact of recent changes in user sanctions for marijuana on marijuana prices.

This paper develops a growth model wherein an economy's technology is endogenous to agents' communication decisions. In equilibrium, there is too little communication and insufficient risk-taking relative to the first best. The model can generate an abrupt take-off of output growth without an exogenous 'catastrophe.' A numerical example illustrates such a take-off. In that example, the endogenous fall in the cost of communication leads to the acceleration of the growth rate of output by facilitating the transmission of knowledge and by encouraging risk-taking.","Univ Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",University of Rochester,"Pancs, R (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",rpancs@gmail.com,,,,,,,52,0,0,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

In this paper we focus on the determination of the capital charges for market risk for given portfolio according to Solvency II (SCR time horizon one year, confidence level 99.5 %) and Basel II (time horizon ten days, confidence level 99 %) with the help of Value at Risk methodology and Conditional Value at Risk approach.

It is argued that an adequate approach to the role of the human and the non-human should not buy into a distinction between ontology and epistemology but instead should focus upon the contested interaction of humans and non-humans in everyday life and thereby restore the analysis of intentionality and meaning to its rightful place at the core of the sociology of technology.","Cornell Univ, Dept Sci & Technol Studies, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Pinch, T (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Sci & Technol Studies, 309 Rockefeller Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",tjp2@cornell.edu,"Pinch, Trevor/K-1811-2017",,,,,,33,29,41,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We present evidence from two field experiments designed to measure the existence of transaction costs that inhibit charitable giving in such fundraising campaigns, and shed light on the nature of such transaction costs. The experiments are designed in conjunction with the Bavarian State Opera House. The first mail-out experiment was implemented over two stages using a within-subject design. We develop a theoretical framework that makes precise the identifying assumptions under which we can exploit this two-stage design to measure the following structural parameters among potential donors: (i) the share of donors who would make a strictly positive donation in the complete absence of transaction costs and (ii) the probability that a potential donor has sufficiently low transactions costs to make a strictly positive donation. Our results imply response rates to mail-out solicitations would almost double in the complete absence of transaction costs. The second field experiment provides more evidence on the nature of transaction costs. We distinguish between ex ante transaction costs, which prevent the choice problem from being considered and ex post transaction costs, which prevent choices being implemented. We find that the likelihood of a donation being made increases by 26% in response to even a small reduction in ex post transaction costs.","[Rasul, Imran; Huck, Steffen] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Rasul, I (通讯作者)，UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England.",i.rasul@ucl.ac.uk; s.huck@ucl.ac.uk,,"Huck, Steffen/0000-0001-7586-7985",,,,,36,37,41,0,18,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The author assumed that a consumer can buy or lease a new car, or he/she can buy a used or a CPO car. While, like Kim (1985), the author assumed that the quality of a car depends on the maintenance level, the maintenance level in this model is chosen when a car is still a 'new' car, i.e. after the warranty ends. The model implied that the average quality of traded used cars can be either higher or lower than the average quality of nontraded used cars. The study also found that leasing and CPO have substantially improved the information mechanism between buyers and sellers of used cars, which, in turn, has helped reduce adverse selection and improved the average quality of traded used cars in the market.","Saginaw Valley State Univ, Dept Econ, Univ Ctr, Saginaw, MI 48710 USA",,"Sultan, A (通讯作者)，Saginaw Valley State Univ, Dept Econ, Univ Ctr, 7400 Bay Rd, Saginaw, MI 48710 USA.",asultan@svsu.edu,,,,,,,14,5,5,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We find that the initiation of CU talks results in an easing of multilateral trade tensions, especially with regard to the employment of special-protection instruments, such as anti-dumping duties or safeguards. However, once the CU agreements come into force, a retreat to a more protectionist trading environment becomes necessary so that multilateral cooperation does not break down. Interestingly, in comparison with the pre-CU world, the utilization of special-protection tools in the post-CU world is more severe for high import volumes, but is less frequent overall. Moreover, normal protection remains low, largely unchanged from the pre-CU era.","Univ Nova Lisboa, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Tabakis, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal.",ctabakis@fe.unl.pt,,,,,,,27,5,5,0,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

This article attempts to get a deeper understanding of the finance-growth process by disaggregating the total financial sector impact and examining the individual and relative effects of each type of institution in the financial sector. We explore the empirical properties of alternative specifications of models of the impact of financial institutions' functioning on economic growth, by conducting a number of exercises.

More specifically, we consider the environmental and welfare effects of subsidizing consumers who purchase environmentally friendly goods in the case of a partially covered market with a Cournot duopoly. We show that, paradoxically, the subsidy policy degrades the environment, and that the optimal policy depends on the degree of marginal social valuation of environmental damage. That is, if the marginal social valuation of environmental damage is larger than a certain value, a consumer-based environmental subsidy policy is not socially optimal. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

European Union (EU) is the largest market for agricultural products of MENA countries, though new outlets and new partnerships can expand the market of their products. Enhancing agriculture's potentials safeguards the economy's general expansion and impede the flee of MENA countries' huge labour reserves to the developed world. In this work, introducing a few possible trade reforms, a general equilibrium model is employed to assess the impacts upon region's export potentials and welfare changes. Selecting certain distinct scenarios from a wide spectrum of anticipated trade reforms, and feeding them into the model, insights on the direction of the expected changes and rough estimates of accrued benefits can be extracted. The model results suggest that the region might benefit the most under special provisions for developing countries in a World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement, while in the case of EU-Med agreement, agricultural trade will benefit MENA countries and can induce economic growth through the expansion of agricultural exports.","[Tsakiridou, Efthimia; Mattas, Konstadinos] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Agr Econ, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece; [Somwaru, Agapi] Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC USA",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Mattas, K (通讯作者)，Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Agr Econ, POB 225, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.",,"TSAKIRIDOU, EFTHIMIA/ABE-9265-2020","Mattas, Konstadinos/0000-0001-8304-4292",,,,,22,1,2,3,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

General method of moments estimation of conditional international asset pricing model of Dumas and Solnik (1995) is applied to investigate ADR return premiums. We find that stock returns are more affected by disequilibrium between ADR and stock prices in an inefficient way. For US investors, foreign exchange rate risk premiums and world market risk premium (beyond US index) are priced in ADRs returns ex ante.

First, I consider the case in which agents have common evaluations (or identical preferences), as in the previous literature. I then propose an extension to the heterogeneous case. In both cases I identify an appropriate egalitarian benchmark relative to which inequality can be measured, and I establish that this yields a theory of measurement analogous to that of income inequality. Consequently, the introduction of money (or an infinitely divisible commodity) avoids the difficulty reported in Ok (J Econ Theory 77:300-329, 1997). The results of the paper are immediately applicable to the measurement of multidimensional economic inequality including economies with indivisible goods.","SUNY Albany, Dept Econ, Albany, NY 12222 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany,"Kranich, L (通讯作者)，SUNY Albany, Dept Econ, Albany, NY 12222 USA.",lkranich@albany.edu,,,,,,,42,3,3,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

Technologies and institutions co-evolve in a system of mutual causation. Although some institutions inhibit growth while others encourage it, no single institution is either necessary or sufficient to produce sustained growth. However, some non-unique bundle of encouraging institutions is necessary. Sustained growth began with the Industrial Revolutions that did not just 'fall out of the blue' but were instead the culmination of three trajectories of technological advance in steam power, electric power, and the mechanization of textile manufacturing. These stretched over several centuries. Growth then became sustained when the West 'invented how to invent'. A necessary condition for the Industrial Revolutions was Western science whose roots lie as far back as the scholastic philosophers and the medieval universities. Its absence elsewhere is a sufficient reason why no other place developed its own indigenous industrial revolution.","Simon Fraser Univ, Vancouver, BC, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Lipsey, RG (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",rlipsey@sfu.ca,,,,,,,35,14,14,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

The time-series studies distinguish between short-run and long-run links between consumption, income and wealth. They allow us to identify which variables adjust to restore the long-run equilibrium in the case of a shock, and to determine the time taken by the adjustment process. The micro-econometric literature improves our understanding of the link between wealth and expenditure and distinguishes among the alternative hypotheses - of direct wealth effect, common causality and collateral channel - that have been proposed to explain this relationship. The relationship between wealth and consumer spending appears to be strong, but there is some disagreement as to its size and nature. Furthermore, there appear to be some important differences across countries, which should be allowed for by policy makers when appraising the policy implications of a change in asset prices.","Univ Naples Parthenope, Naples, Italy",Parthenope University Naples,"Paiella, M (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Parthenope, Naples, Italy.",,,,,,,,68,34,41,1,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Within our model, heterogeneous traders use a blend of technical and fundamental trading strategies to determine their orders. In addition, they may become inactive if the profitability of trading decreases. We find that in a continuous double auction market the imposition of a transaction tax is not likely to stabilize financial markets since a reduction in market liquidity amplifies the average price impact of a given order. In a dealership market, however, abundant liquidity is provided by specialists, and thus a transaction tax may reduce volatility by crowding out speculative orders. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The deprivation approach overcomes these limitations by identifying deprivation as an inability to afford items that receive majority support for being essential. This paper estimates the incidence of deprivation and compares the results with those produced using a conventional poverty framework. The results confirm overseas findings by showing that the groups most deprived differ from those with the highest poverty rates and that there is a low degree of overlap between income poverty and deprivation. Older people show up as faring better under the deprivation approach, while working-age individuals and families fare worse and the relative position of the most highly disadvantaged groups are worse in terms of deprivation than in terms of poverty. Deprivation also provides a clearer differentiation between those who can and cannot afford specific necessities than a classification based on low income, and is also shown to vary systematically with several indicators of subjective well-being. Estimates of consistent poverty that combine low income with deprivation are shown to differ from conventional (income-based) poverty rates, and provide the basis for future poverty measures.","[Saunders, Peter; Naidoo, Yuvisthi] Univ New S Wales, Social Policy Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Saunders, P (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Social Policy Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",P.Saunders@unsw.edu.au,"Naidoo, Yuvisthi/I-6598-2017","Naidoo, Yuvisthi/0000-0001-5551-6096",,,,,52,47,50,3,24,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0249,,,ECON REC,Econ.

The option to conduct discovery has several important effects. First, because discovery is cheaper than litigation, it reduces the defendant's incentive to settle under asymmetric information. Second, discovery must be credible. Because discovery is more valuable the greater the uncertainty it resolves, this introduces a credibility constraint on pre-discovery settlement offers. This can further reduce the probability and size of a defendant's pre-discovery settlement offer. Lastly, discovery reduces the ability of NEV plaintiffs to use asymmetric information to extract significant settlements from defendants.","[Schwartz, Warren F.] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Wickelgren, Abraham L.] Univ Texas Austin, Sch Law, Austin, TX 78712 USA",Georgetown University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Schwartz, WF (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",schwarwf@law.georgetown.edu; awickelgren@law.utexas.edu,,,,,,,21,12,14,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

During a crisis that increases macroeconomic uncertainty and reduces asset prices, the threshold required return that triggers investment is lower for an informed investor than for an uninformed investor. Simulation of the model suggests that when macroeconomic uncertainty is high investment may increase, is mostly by informed investors, and as time goes on is progressively more by investors who were initially relatively uninformed about model parameters. For over 10,000 instances of firm-level FDI data for Korea from 1996 to 2001, regression results are consistent with the hypothesis that disproportionably more FDI is made by more informed investors during a period of high macroeconomic uncertainty.","[Ni, Shawn] Univ Missouri, Dept Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; Univ Western Sydney, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; Western Sydney University,"Ni, S (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Dept Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",NiX@missouri.edu; r.ratti@uws.edu.au,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,2,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,NOV 23,2009,3.0,,,,,,,,200941,,,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,V20MV,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000208145000001,0

Differently from most of the literature. we focus on the case in which, under full information, it would be inefficient to trade goods of sufficiently poor quality. We show that the unique equilibrium surviving D1 is characterized by market breakdown, although trade would be mutually beneficial in some state of nature. This occurs independently of the precision of the information available to the buyer. The model thus implies that signaling through prices may exacerbate the effect of adverse selection rather than mitigate it. Under D1, the seller would always benefit from committing to prices that do not reveal her information. We develop this intuition by analyzing the strategic advantages of price rigidities. We show that price rigidities help restore trade and could even enhance effectiveness of prices as signals of quality. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We claim that the changing role of credit intermediaries due to securitisation has also modified the effectiveness of the bank lending channel and banks' ability to grant loans. We use a novel database of securitisation activity and a large sample of European banks and find that the use of securitisation shelters banks' loan supply from the effects of monetary policy. Securitisation activity has also strengthened banks' capacity to supply new loans. This capacity, however, depends oil business cycle conditions and, notably, on banks' risks positions.

The results indicate that the impact of these funds on economic growth is conditional on the quality of the institutions of the receiving countries. In the case of countries with poor institutional quality, the effect of Structural Funds on economic growth will be negative. The reason being, that Structural Funds do affect the allocation of recourses and in countries with poor institutional quality the misallocation of resources might worsen. For example, corruption might divert funds from productive activities; increased opportunities for rent seeking might absorb resources and so on. To the extent that EU Structural Funds have a negative impact on the allocation of resources and growth this might affect the attractiveness of the country as a location for FDI. In this research we investigate the impact of EU Structural Funds on the volume of FDI inflows in EU-15 countries. The econometric analysis is based on a panel analysis of EU-15 countries for the period 1970 - 2005. We utilize a variety of econometric techniques appropriate for this kind of panel data (fixed effects, random effects, OLS and GMM estimators). The results are extremely robust to these alternative specifications. The empirical findings are consistent with the findings of previous studies regarding the determinants of FDI and indicate that the impact of EU Structural Funds on FDI inflows critically depends on the institutional quality of the receiving countries. For countries with high quality institutions the EU Structural Funds have a positive impact on FDI, for countries with low quality institutions the impact will be negative.","[Katsaitis, Odysseas; Doulos, Dimitris] Amer Coll Greece, Athens 15342, Greece",,"Katsaitis, O (通讯作者)，Amer Coll Greece, 6 Gravias Str, Athens 15342, Greece.",katsa@acg.edu; ddoulos@acg.edu,,,,,,,36,19,22,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,NOV,2009,62.0,4,,,,,563,578,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2009.00451.x,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,509QK,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271033000008,0

The scale-free networks are obtained as growing networks where new nodes (agents) are linked to the existing ones according to a preferential attachment rule with an initial attractiveness ascribed to each node. In certain ranges of parameters, depending on the exponent in the degree distribution, the time series of the logarithmic price returns exhibit intermittent bursting typical of volatility clustering, and the tails of the distributions of returns obey a power scaling law with exponents comparable to those obtained from the empirical data. The distributions of returns show also dependence on the number of agents, in particular in the case of networks with the scaling exponents of the degree distributions typical of the social and communications networks.","Warsaw Univ Technol, Fac Phys, PL-00662 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Technology,"Krawiecki, A (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Technol, Fac Phys, Koszykowa 75, PL-00662 Warsaw, Poland.",akraw@if.pw.edu.pl,,"Krawiecki, Andrzej/0000-0001-5837-4193",,,,,40,5,5,0,16,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

We show that the cusp catastrophe model explains the crash of stock exchanges much better than other models. Using the data of U.S. stock markets we demonstrate that the crash of October 19, 1987, may be better explained by cusp catastrophe theory, which is not true for the crash of September 11, 2001. With the help of sentiment measures, such as the index put/call options ratio and trading volume (the former models the chartists, the latter the fundamentalists), we have found that the 1987 returns are bimodal, and the cusp catastrophe model fits these data better than alternative models. Therefore we may say that the crash has been led by internal forces. However, the causes for the crash of 2001 are external, which is also evident in much weaker presence of bifurcations in the data. in this case, alternative models explain the crash of stock exchanges better than the cusp catastrophe model.

Currency crisis literature identified a decline in credit as one of the channels through which such crises affect real economic activity. We find empirical evidence of the existence of this channel and quantify its extent and persistence: controlling for a host of fundamentals, we find a decline in foreign credit to emerging market private firms of about 25 percent in the first year following large depreciations. This decline is especially large in the first five months, is less pronounced in the second year, and disappears entirely by the third year. We show that only about a quarter of the initial decline in credit could be attributed to the credit crunch, while the rest of the decline is due to contracting demand. After six months, however, most of the credit decline could be attributed to supply effects.

As an application, the effect of delay in refereeing time on publication outcome is analyzed in a publication process in economics journals. Though the delay causes efficiency loss by postponing the dissemination of new research, it will better sort the papers to each journal by their qualities by preventing mediocre papers from being submitted to a prestigious journal and published by luck. If an assortative outcome (good papers in prestigious journals and mediocre papers in less prestigious journals) is efficient, the delay may actually improve the publication outcome.

Individuals are cash-short in a recession, and economize by greater use of WIR-credits. A money in the production function (MIPF) specification implies that transactions in WIR form a stabilizing balance that makes up for the lack of ordinary currency. Thus, unlike the ordinary money, WIR money is negatively correlated with GDP in the short run. This implication is confirmed by empirical estimates.

We find that elicited prices are systematically affected by the range of feasible minimum selling prices. Expected utility theory cannot explain these results.

We assume that the preferences of agents exhibit ambiguity aversion; in particular, they are represented by the epsilon-contamination model. We show that a simple variation of a discrete Dutch auction can extract almost all surplus. This contrasts with optimal auctions under IPV without ambiguity as well as with optimal static auctions with ambiguity-in all of these, types other than the lowest participating type obtain a positive surplus. An important point of departure is that the modified Dutch mechanism is dynamic rather than static, establishing that under ambiguity aversion-even when the setting is IPV in all other respects-a dynamic mechanism can have additional bite over its static counterparts. A further general insight is that the standard revelation principle does not automatically extend to environments not characterized by subjective expected utility. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In other words, self-fulfilling runs can arise in a generalized Green-Lin model and these runs are necessarily partial, with only some agents participating. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The paper provides an analytical framework for making real income comparisons across countries and over time that satisfy transitivity and at the same time reflect an underlying nonhomothetic utility function for a representative consumer. The concept of reference price comparisons is developed and implemented using nonhomothetic translog and almost ideal demand systems. The paper discusses a direct approach, which uses all the parameters of the demand system to make real income comparisons, and an indirect approach, which adjusts the national price-based comparisons using reduced information only on income elasticities of demand. The proposed approach is empirically implemented using data from the 1980 and 1996 benchmark data from the International Comparison Program, and the empirical results confirm the analytical results discussed in the paper.","[Rao, D.

This paper reports on an experimental test of the effects of asymmetry in the Tullock contest success function. Both the simultaneous-move and sequential-move frameworks are considered. Despite high levels of overbidding across the different conditions, the introduction of asymmetries in the contest function generates experimental behavior on aggregate qualitatively consistent with the theoretical predictions. At the individual level, behavior seems divided into those subjects who bid very high amounts and those who bid very low amounts. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper analyses the impact of the shift away from a US dollar focus of systemically important emerging market economies (EMEs) on configurations between the US dollar, the euro and the yen. Given the difficulty that fixed or managed US dollar exchange rate regimes remain pervasive and reserve compositions mostly kept secret, the identification strategy of the paper is to analyse the market impact on major currency pairs of official statements made by EME policy-makers about their exchange rate regime and reserve composition. Developing a novel database for 18 EMEs, we find that such statements not only have a statistically but also an economically significant impact on the euro, and to a lesser extent the yen against the US dollar. The findings suggest that communication hinting at a weakening of EMEs' US dollar focus contributed substantially to the appreciation of the euro against the US dollar in recent years. Interestingly, EME policy-makers appear to have become more cautious in their communication more recently. Overall, the results underscore the growing systemic importance of EMEs for global exchange rate configurations. Journal of Comparative Economics 37 (3) (2009) 335-358.

J,"Hoxby, CM",,,,"Hoxby, Caroline M.",,,The Changing Selectivity of American Colleges,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,RETURNS,"Over the past few decades, the average college has not become more selective: the reverse is true, though not dramatically. People who believe that college selectivity is increasing may be extrapolating from the experience of a small number of colleges such as members of the Ivy League, Stanford, Duke, and so on. These colleges have experienced rising selectivity, but their experience turns out to be the exception rather than the rule. Only the top 10 percent of colleges are substantially more selective now than they were in 1962. Moreover, at least 50 percent of colleges are substantially less selective now than they were in 1962. To understand changing selectivity, we must focus on how the market for college education has re-sorted students among schools as the costs of distance and information have fallen. In the past, students' choices were very sensitive to the distance of a college from their home, but today, students, especially high-aptitude students, are far more sensitive to a college's resources and student body. It is the consequent re-sorting of students among colleges that has, at once, caused selectivity to rise in a small number of colleges while simultaneously causing it to fall in other colleges. This has had profound implications for colleges' resources, tuition, and subsidies for students. I demonstrate that the stakes associated with choosing a college are greater today than they were four decades ago because very selective colleges are offering very large per-student resources and per-student subsidies, enabling admitted students to make massive human capital investments.","[Hoxby, Caroline M.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hoxby, Caroline M.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Hoxby, CM (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,"Hoxby, Caroline M/B-2392-2009",,,,,,57,186,262,1,24,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

To accommodate and encourage foreign merchants, England modified its legal system by creating legal institutions that were available to both domestic and foreign traders. Among the most important of these institutions were streamlined debt collection procedures and mixed juries composed of both Englishmen and foreigners. By introducing institutions that treated locals and foreigners equally, England created a level playing field that enabled English merchants to become increasingly prominent in the later Middle Ages. England's ability to modernize its law was facilitated by the secular nature of English law, the representation of merchants in Parliament, and legal pluralism. Medieval England contrasts sharply with the early modern Ottoman Empire. The latter created special institutions for foreign merchants, which eventually put Ottoman Muslims at a competitive disadvantage. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Subsequently, the crisis has spread to financial sectors in European and Asian economies and led to a severe worldwide recession. The existing literature on financial crises rarely distinguishes between factors that create the original strain on the financial sector and factors that explain why these strains lead to system-wide contagion and a possible credit crunch. Most of the literature on financial crises refers to factors that cause an original disruption in the financial system. We argue that a financial crisis with its contagion within the system is caused by failures of legal, regulatory, and political institutions. One policy implication of our view is that various forms of financial rescue would be reduced in times of crisis if appropriate controls and safeguards were already in place. We draw on experiences from the financial crises in the Nordic countries at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s. In particular, the Swedish model for crisis resolution, which has received attention during the current crisis, is discussed to illustrate the problems policymakers face in a financial crisis without appropriate institutions. We discuss European Union approaches to the current crisis before turning to policy implications from an emerging market perspective in the current crisis.","[Ostrup, Finn; Wihlborg, Clas] Copenhagen Sch Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Oxelheim, Lars] Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden; [Oxelheim, Lars] Inst Econ Res, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Oxelheim, Lars] Res Inst Ind Econ, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden; [Wihlborg, Clas] Chapman Univ, Orange, CA 92866 USA",Copenhagen Business School; Lund University; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); Chapman University System; Chapman University,"Ostrup, F (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Sch Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance, Solbjerg Plads 3,Solbjergvej 3, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",fo.ckk@cbs.dk; lars.oxelheim@fek.lu.se; wihlborg@chapman.edu,,,,,,,51,6,7,0,16,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

This paper investigates whether investors were compensated for the tax burden of equity securities over the period between 1913 and 2006. Taxes on equity securities vary over time due to changes in dividend and capital gains tax rates and due to changes in corporate payout policies.

New evidence from the multiple race question on the 2000 Census,LABOUR ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Race; Discrimination,AFRICAN-AMERICANS; COLOR; WAGES,"The inclusion of multiple race information for the first time in the 2000 Census allows for a novel test for the presence of labor discrimination using the one-drop rule. Identifying discrimination is straightforward and essentially relies on the discontinuous nature of the one-drop rule, which treats biracial blacks similarly as monoracial blacks. If biracial blacks have levels of unmeasurable and measurable human capital that lie between the wages of the two groups. Estimates from the Census indicate that biracial blacks have levels of education that lie almost perfectly between monoracial blacks and whites then, absent discrimination, their wages should also lie between the wages of the two groups. Estimates from the Census indicate that biracial blacks have levels of education that lie almost perfectly between monoracial blacks and whites. In contrast, however, biracial blacks have wages that are roughly similar to monoracial blacks after controlling for education and potential work experience. Estimates form the 1980 Census also do not indicate that the parental characteristics and educational outcomes of biracial children differ from what would be expected by having both black and white parents. Several additional factors that potentially affect the human capital of biracial adults are explored. These findings provide some suggestive evidence on the one drop rule and the presence of discrimination in the labor market and provide new estimates of wages and educational levels of biracial blacks.

I estimate that, in steady state, tolls are 20 to 40 percent higher than they would have been without ETC. Consistent with a salience-based explanation for this toll increase, I find that under ETC, driving becomes less elastic with respect to the toll and toll setting becomes less sensitive to the electoral calendar.

After a theoretical discussion, the paper focuses on the econometrical analysis of this thesis in an institutional context, like the Italian one, in which firms are likely to use temporary contracts, mainly to adjust the workforce during the cycle. Data are drawn from ISFOL-Plus 2005 and from ECHP (1996-2001) for Italy.

This paper develops a new refinement criterion, based on epistemic game theory, that captures the concept of a Nash equilibrium that is plausible when players are rational. I call this the local best response (LBR) criterion. This criterion is conceptually simpler than the standard refinement criteria because it does not depend on out-of-equilibrium, counterfactual, or passage to the limit arguments. The LBR is also informationally richer because it clarifies the epistemic conditions that render a Nash equilibrium reasonable. The LBR criterion appears to render the traditional refinement criteria superfluous. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

I use data from the 1997 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97) to model the probability of gang involvement. The effect of the local unemployment rate is statistically significant and positive. Robustness checks reveal gang participation of individuals less than sixteen years of age (the legal minimum age for most jobs) is not responsive to the local unemployment rate. However, the effect of the local unemployment rate on sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds is statistically significant and positive, which suggests juvenile gang participation depends on economic incentives.

In all of our models, as productivity increases, the Veblen good eventually dominates the economy in the sense that, by reducing leisure, more than all the added productivity is dissipated in the production of this good.

These include excess liquidity, income polarisation, conflicts between financial and productive capital, lack of appropriate regulation, asymmetric information, principal-agent dilemmas and bounded rationalities. However, the paper then proceeds to argue that perhaps more than ever the 'macroeconomics' that led to this crisis only makes analytical sense if examined within the framework of the political settlements and distributional outcomes in which it had operated. Taking the perspective of critical social theories the paper concludes that, ultimately, the current financial crisis is the outcome of something much more systemic, namely an attempt to use neo-liberalism (or, in US terms, neo-conservatism) as a new technology of power to help transform capitalism into a rentiers' delight. In particular, into a system without 'compulsions' on big business; i.e., one that imposes only minimal pressures on big agents to engage in competitive struggles in the real economy (while doing the opposite to workers and small firms). A key component in the effectiveness of this new technology of power was its ability to transform the state into a major facilitator of the ever-increasing rent-seeking practices of oligopolistic capital. The architects of this experiment include some capitalist groups (in particular rentiers from the financial sector as well as capitalists from the 'mature' and most polluting industries of the preceding techno-economic paradigm), some political groups, as well as intellectual networks with their allies-including many economists and the 'new' left. Although rentiers did succeed in their attempt to get rid of practically all fetters on their greed, in the end, the crisis materialised when markets took their inevitable revenge on the rentiers by calling their (blatant) bluff.","Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England",University of Cambridge,"Palma, JG (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Sidgwick Ave, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England.",jgp5@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,73,125,142,2,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Then, it explores a bargaining model with incomplete information where parties can choose the scope of the confrontation they may want to engage in. This model shows that conflict can have a double-edged effect: it may open the door to agreement when no agreement is feasible. But it can also create inefficiency when agreement is possible but the agents fight in order to improve their bargaining position.","Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Sánchez-Pagés, S (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland.",,,,,,,,30,16,17,0,8,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0133,,,ECON J,Econ.

The argument is based on a simple circular flow model of a pure credit economy, where production takes time. In this economy, positive growth rates are necessary in the long run in order to enable firms to make profits in the aggregate. If the growth rate falls below a certain positive threshold level, firms will make losses. Under these circumstances, they will go out of business, which moves the whole economy into a downward spiral. According to the model presented, capitalist economies can either grow (at a sufficiently high rate) or shrink if the growth rate falls below the positive threshold level. Therefore, a zero growth economy is not feasible in the long run.","Univ Appl Sci NW Switzerland, Olten, Switzerland",FHNW University of Applied Sciences & Arts Northwestern Switzerland,"Binswanger, M (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci NW Switzerland, Olten, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,30,45,50,0,40,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0160-3477,,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

The diversity of data collected and methodologies used by empirical studies make it difficult to compare the literature results. On the one hand, some studies seem to have overestimated the impact of digital piracy which may be due, for example, to the use of Internet access as a proxy for piracy. On the other hand, the problem of finding a good instrument to avoid the endogeneity between files illegally downloaded and purchased goods, has probably led to an underestimation of the impact of piracy. As a result, the major finding of empirical works about piracy could be the change in the role of industry stakeholders as well as the way cultural goods are distributed and consumed. We also discuss the different evolutions of the music and the movie industries revenues since the appearance of the first P2P network.

In particular, an aid-receiving country at the median of the donor fractionalization distribution will grow one percentage point faster than a country at the 75th percentile.

Allowing for productive public spending yields threshold effects between long-run growth and both income taxation and seigniorage, thus reproducing recent stylized facts. Moreover, in the cash-in-advance special case, we show that, to maximize long-run growth and/or welfare, government must use seigniorage-only or taxes only, depending on parameters, and in particular on the degree of financial development. In contrast, the general form of money demand motivated by a transaction cost technology produces interior solutions in which both seigniorage and taxes are used.

But now criminal networks have emerged - online black markets in which the bad guys trade with each other, with criminals taking on specialized roles. Just as in Adam Smith's pin factory, specialization has led to impressive productivity gains, even though the subject is now bank card PINs rather than metal ones. Someone who can collect bank card and PIN data, electronic banking passwords, and the information needed to apply for credit in someone else's name can sell these data online to anonymous brokers. The brokers in turn sell the credentials to specialist cashiers who steal and then launder the money. We will examine the data on online crime; discuss the collective-action aspects of the problem; demonstrate how agile attackers shift across national borders as earlier targets wise up to their tactics; describe ways to improve law-enforcement coordination; and we explore how defenders' incentives affect the outcomes.","[Anderson, Ross] Univ Cambridge, Comp Lab, Cambridge CB2 3QG, England",University of Cambridge,,tmoore@seas.harvard.edu; Richard.Clayton@cl.cam.ac.uk; Ross.Anderson@cl.cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,38,130,160,0,45,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

A year after the intervention, treatment communities are more involved in monitoring the provider, and the health workers appear to exert higher effort to serve the community. We document large increases in utilization and improved health outcomes-reduced child mortality and increased child weight-that compare favorably to some of the more successful community-based intervention trials reported in the medical literature.","[Bjoerkman, Martina] Bocconi Univ, IGIER, Bocconi, Italy; Stockholm Univ, Inst Int Econ Studies, NHH, Stockholm, Sweden",Bocconi University; Stockholm University,"Björkman, M (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, IGIER, Bocconi, Italy.",,,,,,,,31,385,448,2,67,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

We discuss both tradable procreation allowances and exemptions domestically and globally, to address underpopulation as well. We focus on three effects. Notably, the rights' tradability entails that whereas exemptions or expensive enough allowances benefit the poor, cheap allowances benefit the rich. A natalist policy also worsens the average education level of the next generation, whereas population control enhances it. Also, if procreation rights are grandfathered to countries, the scheme redistributes further.

A candidate is a Condorcet loser if the majority of the voters place that candidate at the bottom of their preference rankings. We first show that a Condorcet loser might win the election in a three-way race. Next we introduce to the model an endorser who has private information about the true probability distribution of the preferences of the voters. Observable endorsements facilitate coordination among voters who may otherwise split their votes and lead to the victory of the Condorcet loser. When the endorser has an ideological bias towards one of the candidates, the coordination impact of endorsements remains unaltered, moreover the endorser successfully manipulates the outcome of the election in favor of his bias, even if his ideological bias is known by the voters. The results are true for any endorsement cost and any magnitude of bias as long as the electorate is large enough. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

This paper sheds new light on the issue by examining the relationship using state-level data for the United States over three decades. Additional contributions include examining the effects of the Master Settlement Agreement, and studying the dynamic effects of advertising and smoking. Findings show that U.S. cigarette demand is inelastic, the income effects are mixed. advertising elasticities are relatively small, post-MSA advertising seems smoking-reducing and that the full effects of the MSA are probably still unfolding.

The fixed-coefficients production function assumptions ignore substitutions in response to price changes that can be expected to accompany most shocks- skipping over the heart and soul of market economics. This research note suggests a simple approach to estimating new technical coefficients matrices after a shock so that the consequences of short-term substitution effects can be studied. Given a reduction in income (as reflected in the value added row), households are likely to make Substitutions, reducing their final demand by less than the application of base-year I-O coefficients would indicate. But if ex post changed income and consumption can be observed, the application of RAS procedures can generate an appropriately modified A matrix. The resulting set of interdependent substitutions that occurred can be identified. Due to some well known limits in applying the traditional RAS approach, we reformatted it and suggest a new economic model that can link coefficient adjustments to degrees of a priori substitutability and complementarity. Based on this resolution. we look forward to detailed Studies of specific coefficients and how they evolve over the short term. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents and estimates an empirical model of renewable energy consumption for the G7 countries. Panel cointegration estimates show that in the long term, increases in real GDP per capita and CO(2) per capita are found to be major drivers behind per capita renewable energy consumption. These results are robust across two different panel cointegration estimators. Oil price increases have a smaller although negative impact on renewable energy consumption. Deviations from equilibrium are driven mostly by the error correction term as opposed to short term shocks. Short term deviations from the long term equilibrium take anywhere from between 1.3 years (France) and 7.3 years (Japan) to correct. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We find that laws that increase the cost of dispute resolution or employment protection substantially reduce registered sector employment and output, although the cost of industrial dispute regulation on output is larger. There is evidence of strong complementarities on labor laws: The output or employment costs of EPL are larger in states and periods where it is more difficult to resolve disputes, and not very important when such costs are low. Workers do not benefit from EPL or DL, as they do not increase the labor share or the wage bill, although EPL has a small positive effect on earnings per worker. Labor-intensive industries, such as textiles, are the hardest hit by amendments that increase employment protection while capital-intensive industries are the most affected by laws that increase the cost of labor dispute resolution.

International comparisons show that the small size of Ugandan banks, persistently high T-Bill rates and institutional deficiencies explain large proportions of the high Ugandan interest rate margins. The Ugandan bank panel confirms the importance of macroeconomic factors, such as high inflation, high T-Bill rates and exchange rate appreciation. There is also evidence for the small market place and high costs of doing business explaining persistently high spreads and margins; smaller banks and banks targeting the low end of the market incur higher costs and therefore higher margins. Spreads and margins also vary significantly with the sectoral loan portfolio composition of banks, while there is little evidence for foreign bank entry, privatization or changes in market structure explaining variation in spreads or margins over time.

In the first part of the paper we analyse the distribution of electricity in Mali by income deciles, showing that few poor households are connected to the electricity grid. We then apply a sequential CGE micro-simulation model to track the transmission mechanisms between increases in electricity prices and changes in poverty and inequality among different household groups. Our results show that direct price increases have a minimal effect on poverty and inequality, whereas the general equilibrium effects of such increases are quite strong and negative. The compensating policies we tested do not help those who lose from the pricing reform.

Outside a small group of rich countries, heavy regulation of business, leftist rhetoric, and interventionist beliefs flourish. We relate these phenomena to the presence of corruption, with causality running in both directions. The paper presents evidence that, within a country, those who perceive widespread corruption also tend to demand more regulation. As regulation is held constant within a country, this finding is hard to explain if one assumes that causality runs only from regulation to corruption. We also find that over time, increases in corruption in a country precede increases in left-wing voting. To explain our findings, we present a model where corrupt capitalists are disliked, and voting for left-wing policies is a form of punishment available to voters even in weak judicial systems. Evidence on emotions supports this explanation: the frequency with which people report experiencing anger is positively correlated with perceived corruption, but this relationship is significantly weaker when business is heavily regulated.","[Di Tella, Rafael] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Macculloch, Robert] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London SW7 2AZ, England",Harvard University; Imperial College London,"Di Tella, R (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",,,,,,,,85,43,47,0,10,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

We construct an overlapping-generations model which incorporates a realistic description of the mortality process. Agents engage in educational activities at the start of life and thus create human capital to be used later on in life for production purposes. Simple and intuitive expressions are derived which demonstrate the key economic and demographic mechanisms that are operating in the model. The engine of growth during the demographic transition is an intergenerational externality in the production of human capital. In a calibrated version of our model, we find that the effects of increased longevity on human capital formation are small whereas the reduction in fertility has a rather strong effect.

Second, there is a decrease in integration over time translated by a drop in synchronisation of cycles. The impact of an increase in comovement of GDP is outweighed by the structural reforms initiated by the government after the end of apartheid.

An economic model is outlined that shows that ability decreases the effective price of bandwidth. As a result of this decrease, part of the total effect of an increase in ability will always be an increase in the demand for bandwidth. The implication is empirically investigated with an econometric approach that overcomes the limitations of the aggregated data that is currently available to describe consumer preferences. Results show that high-ability, urban consumers are willing to pay a substantive monthly premium for an improvement in bandwidth relative to rural consumers. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We begin by setting up a simple microeconomic model in which accident compensation schemes can be studied. Using this model, the accident compensation scheme that maximizes the expected utility of the insured for a given expected outlay of the scheme (that is, for a budget constraint for the insurer) is characterized. We show that, in order for the optimal schedule of indemnities to be increasing (more severe accidents lead to greater compensation) then, contrary to what has been assumed in the literature, the marginal utility of wealth must be decreasing in health. In particular, if the marginal utility of wealth is non-decreasing in health, then an optimal indemnity schedule cannot provide full compensation, in the sense that utility in each state is a constant.","[Vazquez, Francisco J.] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Dept Anal Econ Econ Cuantitat, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Watt, Richard] Univ Canterbury, Christchurch 1, New Zealand",Autonomous University of Madrid; University of Canterbury,"Vázquez, F (通讯作者)，Autonomous Univ Madrid, Dept Anal Econ Econ Cuantitat, C Francisco Tomas & Valiente 5, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",richard.watt@canterbury.ac.nz; franciscojose.vazquez@uam.es,"HERNANDEZ, FRANCISCO JOSE VAZQUEZ/AAE-3997-2019","HERNANDEZ, FRANCISCO JOSE VAZQUEZ/0000-0002-0250-1517",,,,,9,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-5469,1435-5477,,SPAN ECON REV,Span.

Many economists have argued that efforts to operate adjustably pegged exchange rate regimes have been a major contributor to the unstable middle hypothesis and some have argued that this unstable middle is so broad that only the two corners of hard fixes or floating rates will be stable in a world of high capital mobility-the two corners or bipolar hypothesis. Two recent empirical studies by researchers at the International Monetary Fund reach opposing conclusions on these issues. We examine the issue further and show that conclusions can be quite sensitive to how exchange rate regimes are grouped into categories and the measures of currency crises that are used. In general we find that the dead center of the adjustable peg is by far the most crisis prone broad type of exchange rate regimes, but that countries need not go all the way to freely floating rates or hard fixes to substantially reduce the risks of currency crises.","[Angkinand, Apanard] Univ Illinois, One Univ Plaza Dr, Springfield, IL 62703 USA; [Chiu, Eric M.

Our results indicate that the effect of a nomination or win is positive in the week of the announcement and gradually increases in successive weeks, presumably due to publicity and word-of-mouth. Winners experience an increase in demand as late as 1 year later when awards are publicized for the following season. Moreover, nominees that do not win the award are penalized heavily in the weeks following the Award announcements. We find that winning a Tony Award increases a production's revenues by 12% in the week immediately following the Awards.","[Boyle, Melissa] Coll Holy Cross, Dept Econ, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Chiou, Lesley] Occidental Coll, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA",College of the Holy Cross; Occidental College,"Boyle, M (通讯作者)，Coll Holy Cross, Dept Econ, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",mboyle@holycross.edu; lchiou@oxy.edu,,,,,,,22,9,13,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,,,J CULT ECON,J.

PORTFOLIO REBALANCING BY INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS,QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,DISPOSITION; INVESTMENT; WEALTH; PARTICIPATION; CONSUMPTION; HABIT,"This paper investigates the dynamics of individual portfolios in a unique data set containing the disaggregated wealth of all households in Sweden. Between 1999 and 2002, we observe little aggregate rebalancing in the financial portfolio of participants. These patterns conceal strong household-level evidence of active rebalancing, which on average offsets about one-half of idiosyncratic passive variations in the risky asset share. Wealthy, educated investors with better diversified portfolios tend to rebalance more actively. We find some evidence that households rebalance toward a greater risky share as they become richer. We also study the decisions to trade individual assets. Households are more likely to fully sell directly held stocks if those stocks have performed well, and more likely to exit direct stockholding if their stock portfolios have performed well; but these relationships are much weaker for mutual funds, a pattern that is consistent with previous research on the disposition effect among direct stockholders and performance sensitivity among mutual fund investors. When households continue to hold individual assets, however, they rebalance both stocks and mutual funds to offset about one-sixth of the passive variations in individual asset shares. Households rebalance primarily by adjusting purchases of risky assets if their risky portfolios have performed poorly, and by adjusting both fund purchases and full sales of stocks if their risky portfolios have performed well. Finally, the tendency for households to fully sell winning stocks is weaker for wealthy investors with diversified portfolios of individual stocks.","[Calvet, Laurent E.] HEC PARIS, Paris, France; Harvard Univ, Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Stockholm Sch Econ, Natl Bur Econ Res, Stockholm, Sweden",Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC) Paris; National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University; Stockholm School of Economics,"Calvet, LE (通讯作者)，HEC PARIS, Paris, France.",calvet@hec.fr; john_campbell@harvard.edu; Paolo.Sodini@hhs.se,"Calvet, Laurent/B-8315-2013","Calvet, Laurent/0000-0001-9086-925X",,,,,34,221,263,2,59,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

The panel cointegration statistics reject the null hypothesis of no cointegration in all tests except the panel variance test with time dummies, implying that trade balance is cointegrated with the real exchange rate, domestic income, and foreign income at both bilateral and panel levels. In both between-dimension FMOLS and DOLS, the three panel coefficients of the real exchange rate, domestic, and foreign real income variables carry correct signs and are statistically significant at the 1% level.

It also appears that whereas the systematic monetary policy response dampened fluctuations in economic activity during the 1970s, it has had virtually no effect after the Great Moderation.","[Herrera, Ana Maria] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48895 USA; [Pesavento, Elena] Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",Michigan State University; Emory University,"Herrera, AM (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, 110 Marshall Adams Hall, E Lansing, MI 48895 USA.",herrer20@msu.edu,,"Pesavento, Elena/0000-0002-6975-2433; Herrera, Ana Maria/0000-0003-3583-2555",,,,,39,133,145,0,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Applying an augmented generalized method of moments-estimator that accounts for selectivity and simultaneity bias on data from 1,249 MNEs, our research has resulted in five distinct conclusions. First, we find that the knowledge spillovers via R&D collaboration typically take place as a network phenomenon rather than a process between the local firm and a single innovation partner. Second, successful collaboration is conditional on the presence of foreign innovation partners in the network. Third, output is found to be an increasing function of R&D-collaboration only among non-export oriented firms. Fourth, foreign MNEs, selling mainly to local and regional markets in Sweden, benefit more from R&D collaboration than do other firms. Overall, the results show that demand-driven motives that require entrepreneurial knowledge to adapt products to local consumers and markets are more important for successful R&D-collaboration than supply-driven motives.","[Loof, Hans] Royal Inst Technol, Ctr Excellence Sci & Innovat Studies, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Loof, Hans] Royal Inst Technol, Div Econ, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology; Royal Institute of Technology,"Lööf, H (通讯作者)，Royal Inst Technol, Ctr Excellence Sci & Innovat Studies, Drottning Kristinas Vag 30B, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",hansl@infra.kth.se,"Lööf, Hans/C-2137-2017; Lööf, Hans/AAN-5394-2020","Lööf, Hans/0000-0002-5871-8571;",,,,,48,32,34,0,38,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

This empirical study identifies a novel firm-level influential condition. It hypothesizes and finds that for firms that trade at a premium to book value the value-relevance of two fundamental financial statement value drivers (i.e. earnings and book value), is negatively related to the level of sophistication of the firm's information environment. However, for firms that trade at a discount to book value, the level of sophistication of information environment does not affect the value-relevance of these financial statement value drivers. The level of complexity of the firm's information environment is proxied by the firm's capitalized value.

In addition, the paper shows that results depend on countries' initial fiscal conditions and on the type of fiscal consolidations: Fiscal adjustments that occur in country-years with high levels of government deficit, that are implemented by cutting government spending, and that generate a permanent and substantial decrease in government debt are associated with larger reductions in interest rates and increases in stock market prices.

I therefore submit this informal account of some developments in economic theory without research, just as a set of recollections. It is also not ail autobiography, nor a systematic account of my own work. Rather, I consider primarily those developments in economic theory that have had both general interest in the field and special concern for me. For example, as social choice theory is still a specialized field, I am not going to discuss it at all. Further, as it has turned out, I emphasize the developments of technique, although to some extent I refer to some of the underlying visions of the economy to which they are applied. To evaluate my eyewitness testimony, I give the reader some idea of my background and, in particular, the path that led me to be an economist and that has influenced my work and my perception of the development of economics in general. (As my friend Paul David keeps on reminding me and the rest of the world, all development is path-dependent.) I then follow up with four major aspects of economic research in the last 60 years, the period of my scholarly activity. One, econometric methodology and practice, is of such fundamental importance that it cannot go unnoticed, although I played no role in it. With the other three, general equilibrium, dynamic processes, and uncertainty and information, I was more intimately involved.","Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Arrow, KJ (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",arrow@stanford.edu,,,,,,,66,13,16,0,25,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1941-1383,,,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

By contrast, policymakers in the arms purchasing countries see offsets as an opportunity to extract technology transfer, as well as employment, investment and export sales opportunities. Establishing the actual impact of offsets, however, is not easy. The subject is shrouded in secrecy and myth, with anecdote and generalisation pervading even the intellectual press.

This paper analyses the approach of the construction of such type of bio-robots with possibilities to integrate different knowledge representation techniques for the development of the reinforcement framework with multiple cooperative agents for the recognition of the diagnosis of emotional situation of disabled persons. Large-scale of multidimensional recognitions of emotional diagnosis of disabled persons often generate a large amount of multi-dimensional data with complex recognition mechanisms, based on the integration of different knowledge representation techniques and complex inference models. Sensors can easily record primary data; however, the recognition of abnormal situations, cauterisation of emotional stages and resolution for certain type of diagnosis is an oncoming issue for bio-robot constructors. The research results present the development of multi-layered model of this framework with the integration of the evaluation of fuzzy neural control of speed of two wheelchair type robots working in real time by providing moving support for disabled individuals.

This paper proposes an analytic framework for determining optimal R&D investment allocation and presents some numerical results to demonstrate the implementation of the methodology. The value of technological advance in three targeted areas-fossil-based generation, renewables, and carbon capture and storage-is represented by the increase in expected welfare in the presence of an emissions policy constraint of initially uncertain stringency. R&D expenditure increases the probability of advance. Optimal investment is determined by its relationship with success probability, which is assumed to exhibit decreasing returns to scale, relative to the value of success. While the numerical results are speculative, the paper offers insights into the nature of an optimal technology strategy for addressing climate change. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Cost-Benefit Approach to Emigration Question,INZINERINE EKONOMIKA-ENGINEERING ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,emigration; brain drain; consequences; feedback; costs; benefits; policy,IMMIGRATION; EUROPE,"If raising of the infamous iron curtain just half-opened the door for labour emigration from the post-communist countries, the full-fledged membership to the European Union threw that door wide open. As a result most of these countries experienced significant upsurge of labour emigration after they entered EU. Most demographers and economists of the Eastern European countries tend to conclude that the loss of human capital due to international migration is detrimental to donor nation's productive capacity and reduces its economic growth and wellbeing. The following adverse effects of emigration are usually cited: depletion of the country's human capital assets, resulting in lower productivity; loss of return on investment in education; smaller tax base; larger inequality in the donor country. It is rather obvious that if country looses its skilled educated and demanded workforce this could retard its development. However, could does not necessarily means should, and the net-impact of migration is subject to the kind and scale of feedback effects. While outward negative consequences of emigration are emphasized in many academic studies and public discussions, the issues of potential positive feedback effects of it on the donor country are generally ignored. Acknowledging the existence of direct and indirect adverse effects of workforce emigration, particularly of brain drain, this article nevertheless attempts to challenge conventional assumption of the unequivocal calamity of emigration by pointing out that it can also trigger quite a few offsetting feedback effects that would bring gains for the sending country. Those hidden benefits of emigration for the donor country include, but are not limited to decrease of unemployment and entailed reduction of demand in welfare payments, remittance flows, stimulation of exports and technological advancement, shrinkage of shadow economy. The authors advocate the cost-benefit approach to migration, and suggest that in the long-term perspective these positive effects, enhanced by economic multipliers, might offset or even outweigh for sending country immediate losses caused by the workforce emigration. While usually such optimism is not reserved for brain drain phenomenon, the authors argue that in the long run it probably will bring efficiency gains to all parties, both donor and recipient, as well. Theoretical insights of the paper are illustrated, wherever possible, by the appropriate statistical evidence from Lithuania as the country with one of the highest rates of emigration in the European Union.","[Cekanavicius, Linas; Kasnauskiene, Gindra] Vilniaus Univ Tarptautinio Verslo Mokykla, LT-10225 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University International Business School,"Cekanavicius, L (通讯作者)，Vilniaus Univ Tarptautinio Verslo Mokykla, Sauletekio Al 22, LT-10225 Vilnius, Lithuania.",,"Galisanskiene, Aida/AAG-2160-2020",,,,,,36,16,16,0,22,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We focus on the short-term heterogeneous impact on two subpopulations of unemployed individuals: young (targeted by the Inserjovem program) and old (targeted by the Reage program). We show that the latter program has a small and positive impact (reduction) on unemployment duration of workers finding a job upon participation, whereas the impact of Inserjovem is generally negative (extended durations). These results are robust to a wide variety of constructions of quasi-experimental settings and estimators. The identification of heterogeneous effects showed that the program results were less satisfactory for young workers, for those over 40 and for the less educated. Women also benefited less from the programs. The results seem to improve slightly for young workers in the 2nd semester of implementation, but they deteriorate in the medium term. The lack of wage subsidies in the Portuguese programs may explain the minor impacts obtained, when compared to similar programs. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Extending the Gershenson-Grossman (2000) framework of conflict in a two-stage game to the case involving outside intervention in a three-stage game as in Chang et al. (2007b), we examine the conditions under which an outside party optimally intervenes such that (i) the strength of the rebel group is diminished or (ii) the rebellion is deterred altogether. We also find conditions in which a third party optimally intervenes but at a level insufficient to deter rebellion. Such behavior, which improves the incumbent government's potential to succeed in conflict, is overlooked in some conflict studies evaluating the effectiveness of intervention. One policy implication of the model is that an increase in the strength of inter-governmental trade partnerships increases the likelihood that third-party intervention deters rebellion.","[Chang, Yang-Ming] Kansas State Univ, Dept Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Sanders, Shane] Nicholls State Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Thibodaux, LA 70310 USA",Kansas State University; University of Louisiana System; Nicholls State University,"Chang, YM (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Econ, 319 Waters Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",ymchang@ksu.edu; shane.sanders@nicholls.edu,,,,,,,41,26,31,2,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Among other things this happens because many definitions of concepts, models and procedures on behaviour established in business as exemplary, unfortunately become outdated very soon and many of them are not efficient at all against accepted expectations. Changeability and unpredictability of situations in an organization make it complex, and managers, in spite of their better and better qualifications, as well as various competences, still cannot feel comfortable. They do not know how to efficiently motivate people to work, how to solve conflicts, and how to choose an optimal management style. The source of inefficient knowledge is the above mentioned changeability and turbulence of surrounding elements, organization variability and its system-like character. Due to the fact, that the area of human resources management brings most trouble for managers, it seems to be expedient to undertake further research in this scope. The authors of the monograph focused their attention on the analysis of a complicated problem connected with groups and teams functioning in an organization. They have made meticulous review of both concepts definitions; there was no unanimity among researchers in the scope of making difference in their essence. However, they have noticed many differences, which undoubtedly enrich knowledge in this subject. Important issue that was paid attention to at work is a problem of managing team in an organization. The authors often mention the advantage of team work over individual, especially in the context of gained synergic effect. It is, however, worth remembering that individualization of an approach to human resources management in an organization demands the necessity of noticing the fact that not every employee has predisposition and will to work in a team, similarly as not every manager can build and manage the team. Anyway one conclusion could be made that actually there is no an ideal style of management. Everything depends on what kind of employees' supervisor faces, what kind of features he owns himself and what preferences he has towards organization. Much is also depended on a type of organization culture established in a given organization, which mainly determines the way of people's work in an organization and its teams. The results of the authors' research present a lot of important aspects of the issue. An up-to-date problem taken into consideration is also a matter of gender equality. The authors' remarks confirm the thesis that there are no significant differences in managing styles for women and men; it is only a deeply rooted thinking in many people's minds. The monograph makes up a rich compendium of knowledge about the role and meaning of groups and teams in an organization and contributes a lot to systematizing discussed issues. It may serve as an important source of information for both theoreticians and practitioners of managing.","[Ciegis, Remigijus] Vilnius State Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Ciegis, Remigijus] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Fac Econ & Management, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vilnius University; Vytautas Magnus University,"Ciegis, R (通讯作者)，Vilnius State Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Muitines Str 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",remigijus.ciegis@aula.vukhf.lt,,,,,,,0,1,1,0,5,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Despite their dubious theoretical foundations gravity models have been extremely successful empirically. All theoretical attempts to provide a formal justification for the gravity equation assume complete specialization in production. This leads to a misleading impression that complete specialization is a necessary condition for deriving the gravity equation. In this paper we demonstrate formally that the gravity equation can be derived also from a variety of incomplete specialization models based on both neoclassical and monopolistic competition assumptions. The common prediction that emerges from these models is that factor proportion variables, along with the country size variables, play a key role in determination of bilateral trade volumes, however, their impact is model specific. The neglect of these variables in empirical studies employing gravity equations derived from complete specialization models might result in estimates that suffer from the omitted variable bias if trading partners differ in terms of their relative factor endowments.","Warsaw Univ, Dept Econ, Macroecon & Int Trade Theory Div, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Cieslik, A (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ, Dept Econ, Macroecon & Int Trade Theory Div, Ul Dluga 44-50, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland.",cieslik@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Cieslik, Andrzej/AAJ-7497-2020","Cieslik, Andrzej/0000-0002-7834-7384",,,,,34,22,23,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The results of out-of-sample density forecast and probability forecasts suggest that a shift from a univariate autoregressive model to a multivariate model improves forecast performance.

We find a higher dividend yield and a higher pay-out ratio for financially distressed firms than for financially stable firms. We also find that financially distressed firms tend to change the dividend per share more rapidly than stable firms. Furthermore, these firms' dividends depend more on earnings than do the dividends of stable companies. This finding is consistent with the frequent dividend changes observed in distressed firms. Stable firms, in contrast, prefer paying dividends that are less dependent upon earnings. These results may stem from the relatively high level of importance that financially distressed firms ascribe to dividend payments or to the aggressive dividend policy that eroded the firms' financial stability and forced them to reduce the dividend per share rapidly.","[Yagil, Joseph] Univ Haifa, Sch Business, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; [Cohen, Gil] Emek Yezreel Acad Coll, Dept Econ & Management, Emek Yezreel, Israel",University of Haifa,"Yagil, J (通讯作者)，Univ Haifa, Sch Business, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",yagil@gsb.haifa.ac.il,,"COHEN, GIL/0000-0002-1173-0338",,,,,10,6,6,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Our finding of substantial leakages in targeting that allow relatively well-off households to obtain FFW employment yield important implications for the prevailing FFW wage.

Also, we aim to discover whether the change in the fiscal framework, which took place after 1992 has had a substantial impact on the fiscal policy applied. The principal novelty is that the estimation is performed simultaneously by means of a seemingly unrelated regression estimator model. We are thus able to obtain different coefficients for each country, while developing possible correlations between national fiscal policies, which would reveal the existence of common factors. The results provide clear evidence of a structural break in the rule after the introduction of the new fiscal regulations and, as the hypothesis of equality in the national coefficients of the rule is clearly rejected, reveal a need to consider specific national factors.","[Garcia, Agustin; Arroyo, M.

We set up the succession decision as an intertemporal optimization problem. The empirical results show that larger and more profitable farms, which are specialized in dairy production are significantly more likely to have an intra-family successor. We find that a nonagricultural education of the current manager or the successor delay succession. When the family decided to stop farming operations, nonagricultural education of the owner delays closure of the farm. Closure occurs earlier if the manager is able to lease out the land in the process of retirement.

In our model, a vibrant civil society initiates public debate in a reform process otherwise dominated by partisan interest groups and politicians. Civil society involvement can alleviate or aggravate adverse selection problems that arise because interest groups are better informed about reform consequences than politicians. Since aid increases the cost to the politician of excluding civil society, it affects institution building. We show analytically, and illustrate empirically, that the welfare implications of fostering civil society critically depend on the specifics of local politics, thereby casting new light on the experience of civil society aid in transition and developing countries.","[Grajzl, Peter] Cent European Univ, Dept Econ, Budapest, Hungary; [Murrell, Peter] Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, IRIS Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Central European University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Grajzl, P (通讯作者)，Cent European Univ, Dept Econ, Budapest, Hungary.",grajzlp@ceu.hu; murrell@econ.umd.edu,,,,,,,92,4,6,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

It is shown that the equilibria in an asymmetric oligopoly are substantially different from those in a duopoly and symmetric oligopoly. In an asymmetric triopoly, it is possible that (i) a continuum of equilibria exists and that (ii) the lowest price of the smallest firm is higher than that of the others and the smallest firm earns more than the max-min profit in undominated strategies. In particular, the second finding sheds light on a new pricing incentive in Bertrand competitions.

It induces tourism business system actors to create national, regional, and place networks of business companies. The new organizational and management paradigms in the context Of tourism industry and destinations change the attitude towards the nature of organizations' relationships. Agile competition and fast development of information and communication technologies have the capacity to modify the traditional time-space interaction and form different modern organizational structures of business systems. The analysis of scientific literature shows that actors of business system integrate into different partnership networks as clusters, networks, virtual organization and others. Virtual organizing of tourism business system actors could be defined as a dynamic collaborative network of tourism stakeholders (private and public organizations) able to combine their own capabilities and resources that could be proposed as integrated value-added services to satisfy consumer needs in tourism destination. The scientific problem of this research is to ascertain what structure of relationships among tourism business system actors guarantees their successful use of virtual organizing potential of tourism business system increasing the competitiveness of network partners and enabling the exploration of new market opportunities. The aim of the paper: to evaluate the potential of virtual organizing of tourism business system actors. Methods of the research: reviewing, evaluation and systematic analysis of scientific literature; mixed method research design, panel expert interview; Kluber's Wheel of Virtual Organizing model. Various aspects of business system and explanation of virtual organizing features of business system are discussed According to the empirical research, the virtual organizing of tourism business system actors appears, but it is not sufficient for distinguishing the features of virtual business system. Closer collaboration and the utilization Of ICTs would enable tourism business system actors to expand their supply and to enhance their competitiveness.","[Hopeniene, Rimante; Railiene, Ginta; Kazlauskiene, Egle] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44239 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Hopeniene, R (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio Str 20, LT-44239 Kaunas, Lithuania.",rimante.hopeniene@ktu.lt; ginta.railiene@ktu.lt; egle.kazlauskiene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,47,11,12,1,37,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Job losses in state firms and job creation in new private firms are the dominant employment changes, other than retirements from the labour force. In the Polish case, a significant proportion of this movement over the 1988-1998 period involves a spell of unemployment or exit from the labour force before obtaining a private sector job. This results in considerable job competition between workers leaving the state sector and those who are out of the labour force or unemployed. Income differences between the state sector and the de novo sector appear to have little association with mobility. These results suggest that movement to the new private sector is more likely to be the result of job loss than the result of people looking for better, higher paying jobs. Self-employment plays an important role in the development of the private sector. People working on their own account have higher incomes than wageworkers and are likely to become owners employing additional workers. Incomes are higher in regions with high rates of job creation and depressed in regions with job destruction.","[Jackson, John E.] Univ Michigan, Dept Polit Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Mach, Bogdan W.] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Polit Studies, Warsaw, Poland",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Political Studies of the Polish Academy of Sciences,"Jackson, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Polit Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",jjacksn@umich.edu; bmach@isppan.waw.pl,"Mach, Bogdan W/GPP-3212-2022",,,,,,38,9,9,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

Using data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), we investigate the determinants of job satisfaction and attempt to explain why workers in Wales are happier in their work than workers in other parts of the UK. We find that workers in Wales appear to be less concerned about pay than workers in other regions. We suggest that because lower earnings tend to be associated with higher levels of unemployment and inactivity, being in work may be regarded more favourably in more economically depressed regions.

The investigation is carried out with great vision and a combination of scholarly methods. In this review essay, we embrace the theoretical core of the book, but find a number of problems in the execution. We see a need to distinguish between attending school and acquiring the pertinent skills; we criticize the way that Goldin and Katz talk about years of schooling as a continuous variable, when the underlying phenomenon is that the combination of high school graduation rates and college attendance rates increased more slowly after 1970 primarily because of a slowdown in the former, a slowdown which was arithmetically driven by the fact that high school graduation rates can only go up to 100 percent. We criticize the way they break up time periods in a way that buries the productivity acceleration of 1990-2005. This increase in productivity growth suggests that in the race between education and technology the speed of the latter is more important than the slowdown of the former. We see a need to recognize the profound institutional changes that occurred during the twentieth century, for their consequences can help to explain why the populations' skills are not keeping up with technology. Finally, Goldin and Katz make a reasonable argument that the wage premium for college graduates would be lower if more young people earned quality maintained college degrees. However, at the margin, sending additional students to college probably does little or nothing to increase the number of successful college graduates.","[Kling, Arnold] High Sch, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Merrifield, John] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA; [Kling, Arnold] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); George Mason University,"Kling, A (通讯作者)，High Sch, Silver Spring, MD USA.",arnold@arnoldkling.com; John.Merrifield@utsa.edu,"Merrifield, John/K-7226-2013","Merrifield, John/0000-0003-4772-8296",,,,,23,1,3,2,3,INST SPONTANEOUS ORDER ECONOMICS,FAIRFAX,"9745 KINGS CROWN COURT #102, FAIRFAX, VA 22031 USA",1933-527X,,,ECON J WATCH,Econ.

National strategies on development of electricity markets vary considerably from country to country due to different national constraints. As Lithuania is a member of the European Union, its national energy strategy has to be consistent with the policy of the European Union. Lithuania also has to seek the best strategy to develop electricity market at the national level taking into account its national conditions. Changes in the structure of electricity supply, which will occur because of shutting down of the reactor of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant, have prompted the government to review its current energy policy related to development of national and regional electricity market. The objective of the article is to analyze the consistence of recent changes in shareholding of Lithuanian electricity companies with the model of ownership unbundling of the transmission system operator. The first part of the article is devoted to the analysis of ownership unbundling model of the transmission system operator. It discuses (i) existing models of unbundling of the transmission system operator, (H) the necessity and objectives of ownership unbundling of the transmission system operator, (iii) the main features of ownership unbundling of the transmission system operator, (iv) the main problems and advantages of implementing ownership unbundling of the transmission system operator. The second part of the article analyses the development and changes in the ownership of shares of Lithuanian electricity companies. It discuses (i) the formation of national investor - LEO LT AB; (ii) the specific problems related to the unbundling of supply and generation of electricity from distribution and transmission of electricity. The main conclusion is that that the creation of LEO LT AB is inconsistent with the ownership unbundling model, which is the most favored by European Commission, as future legislative policy of the European electricity market and the best for enhancement of competition in the sector.","[Milciuviene, Saule; Tikniute, Ague] Mykolo Romerio Univ, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania",,"Milciuviene, S (通讯作者)，Mykolo Romerio Univ, Ateities Str 20, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania.",saule@hydrogen.lt; agne.tikniute@mruni.lt,,,,,,,28,5,5,0,4,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Fixed exchange rate systems within gradually widen bands (Czech Republic, Slovak Republic) and crawling peg system (Hungary, Poland) were replaced by the managed floating in the Czech Republic (May 1997), Poland (April 2000), Slovak Republic (October 1998) and fixed exchange rate to euro in Hungary (January 2000) with broad band (October 2001). Higher macroeconomic and banking sector stability allowed countries from the Visegrad group to implement the monetary policy strategy based on the interest rate transmission mechanism. Continuous harmonization of the monetary policy framework (with the monetary policy of the ECB) and the increasing sensitivity of the economy agents to the interest rates changes allowed the central banks from the Visegrad countries to implement monetary policy strategy based on the key interest rates determination. In the paper we analyze the impact of the central banks' monetary policy in the Visegrad countries on the selected macroeconomic variables in the period 1999-2008 implementing SVAR (structural vector autoregression) approach. We expect that higher sensitivity of domestic variables to interest rates shocks can be interpreted as a convergence of monetary policies in candidate countries towards the ECB's monetary policy.","Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Mirdala, R (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Kosice, Slovakia.",rajmund.mirdala@tuke.sk,"Mirdala, Rajmund/P-4891-2017","Mirdala, Rajmund/0000-0002-9949-3049",,,,,15,4,4,1,22,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2009,56.0,3,,,,,359,377,,10.2298/PAN0903359M,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,506DR,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000270754300004,0

Peace has been elusive, and the term 'post-conflict' often a sad misnomer. War is expensive and hence has powerful economic consequences. Civil war, which is now, by far, the most common form of conflict in Africa, is particularly damaging, reduces incomes, increases capital flight and diverts activity into subsistence livelihood. Post-conflict situations are characterised by unusually wide range of outcomes. While on average economies rebound from war, in some the economies decline and in others they revert to conflict after some time (Collier et al., 2003). Policy choices concerning the economic recovery of these hopeful but fragile situations have received far less attention than issues of humanitarian needs. The current efforts of many African countries coming out of conflicts to develop Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) reflect increased emphasis on mainstreaming poverty reduction through better inter-agency and inter-sectoral co-ordination, and through participatory consultation, consensus building and planning. In addition, it has been widely agreed upon that HIV/AIDS should be prominent in the Poverty Reduction Strategies of poor African countries in light of the challenges that the pandemic poses to poverty reduction efforts. PRSP has become the primary tool in nearly all African countries for articulation of the strategies for growth and poverty reduction. The paper provides the main challenges that the PRSP formulation faces in a post-conflict environment. The key questions discussed in the paper include: Can PRSP work in a post-conflict situation? Are PRSP really relevant at all in such countries? Does a PRSP formulated in a conflict-free country guarantee poverty reduction and overall welfare of the society? Since PRSPs in Africa came at a time when the continent had no choice, are they really home grown as often alleged? How have international donors engaged in the process and what is the way forward? The paper also reviews the historical perspective of conflicts in Africa and points out experiences in some of the conflict-affected African countries as they develop and implement their PRSPs. It concludes that not all African countries in post-conflict recovery have successfully developed their PRSPs. Some are still in the process of doing so and others who have endeavoured to draft one, have not correctly spelled out the donor-specific key objectives of the government's commitment to poverty reduction. Finally, PRSPs often emphasise consumption-related expenditures in mainly social sectors like-education and health while ignoring the sectors where the poor are dominant (for example, agriculture). Quite often, the emphasis on such sectors do not lead to significant poverty reduction whether in a post-conflict or conflict-free country.","[Obwona, Marios; Guloba, Madina] Ctr Econ Policy Res, Kampala, Uganda",,"Obwona, M (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Policy Res, Kampala, Uganda.",obwona@eprc.or.ug,,,,,,,12,5,5,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

Economies of scale and the need to expand into new markets around the world have been, in part, the cause of mergers and acquisitions of cruise companies. Today, on a global scale, three large corporations dominate the cruise market. They account for 84.3% of the total gross tonnage and 83% of the total number of lower berths. The companies enriched their supply with the introduction of increasingly larger ships and with product innovations, and exploit an internationally renowned corporate image to extend operations overseas.

These hierarchies are compared and contrasted across different locations and with formal household survey expenditure data.

Our purpose is to prove if these kinds of changes have damaged the EE of European and American companies compared with Asian carriers, and if Asian carriers are the new leaders in the air transport market. A stochastic frontier is estimated for cost function. From these estimations, we obtain indices for EE. For measuring productivity change, we use Malmquist indexes.

Further, the prior literature generally does not estimate the pollution effects associated with regulation, making it difficult to assess the relative social costs and benefits of government action. This article considers a specific set of state policies to examine the results of environmental regulations in the agricultural sector, providing estimates of the magnitude of effects on production as well as pollution. During the 1990's, North Carolina's hog production more than tripled after passage of welcoming state legislation. I find that North Carolina's laws led to an additional 11% increase per year in pork industry presence in North Carolina relative to the rest of the U.S., as well as a 10% increase per county per year in ambient air pollution. Through a series of falsification tests and examinations of alternative hypotheses, I conclude that the air pollution is attributable to the industry; a doubling of production yields a 92% increase in ambient air pollution. The magnitude of the changes in air pollution is large enough to result in significant public health effects, totaling in cost to at least 12% of North Carolina's hog production revenue.","Wellesley Coll, Wellesley, MA 02181 USA",Wellesley College,"Sneeringer, SE (通讯作者)，Wellesley Coll, Wellesley, MA 02181 USA.",ssneerin@wellesley.edu,,,,,,,43,10,10,0,18,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Since its implementation in 1995, the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) system has often failed to quell the controversy concerning what team is the Division 1 Football Bowl Subdivision football champion. Many of the BCS controversies have spawned changes in the title selection format, while others are perhaps the result of certain changes. What remains now is the cry from some college football fans for an expanded 'national championship playoff,' though college and university presidents and many college football coaches continue to resist these cries. We try to explain this resistance to expanding the number of teams invited to compete for the BCS championship and the persistence of the two team playoff format in college football. For three championship eras-pre-BCS, BCS and a futuristic post-BCS expanded playoff-we first relate some of the controversial details to concepts such as optimal tournaments and the public goods concept of collective consumption.","[Mixon, Franklin G.] Auburn Univ, Dept Econ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Swofford, James L.] Univ S Alabama, Dept Econ & Finance, Mobile, AL 36688 USA; [Green, Trellis G.] Univ So Mississippi, Dept Econ Finance & Int Business, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; University of South Alabama; University of Southern Mississippi,"Mixon, FG (通讯作者)，Auburn Univ, Dept Econ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",f.mixon@comcast.net,,,,,,,26,6,8,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The yearly data from 1960 to 2007 is used in this study. This study applied the bounds testing for co-integration and the leveraged bootstrap simulation approaches to examine the relationship between three different categories of government spending and national income in Malaysia. It is found that government spending on education and defence are co-integrated with national income. Nevertheless, there is no evidence of co-integrating relation between government spending on health and national income. The MWALD causality test shows strong evidence of unidirectional causal relationship running from national income to the three major government spending in Malaysia. However, bilateral causality evident exists only between government spending on health and national income.","Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Social Sci, Econ Programme, George Town 11800, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Tang, CF (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Social Sci, Econ Programme, George Town 11800, Malaysia.",tcfoon@yahoo.com,"Tang, Chor Foon/F-9289-2011","Tang, Chor Foon/0000-0003-2242-9222",,,,,44,19,20,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

An insurance company needs predictions of the future claims in order to evaluate premiums, to assess its financial situation, probabilities of ruin, etc. Therefore, modeling the claims distribution is of great importance, but since this distribution is usually different from the classical ones (e.g. skewed and heavy tailed), researchers are trying to find new models that can fit better to insurance data. Such a composite model unifying a Lognormal and a Pareto distribution was introduced by Cooray and Ananda [1] and generalized by Scollnik [6]. In this paper we go even further and study a composite model obtained from two arbitrary distributions, then exemplify it with the Exponential and Pareto distributions.

The special feature is that each firm is assumed to operate multiple plants, which can be run alone or in combination. Each firm has two plants with different capacity limits, so each has three cost options, the third being to run both plants, dividing the load according to the principle of equal marginal costs. As a consequence, the marginal cost functions come in three disjoint pieces, so the reaction functions, derived on basis of global profit maximization, may also consist of disjoint pieces. This is reflected in a particular bifurcation structure, due to border-collision bifurcations and to particular basin boundaries, related to the discontinuities. It is shown that stable cycles may coexist, and the non-existence of unstable cycles constitutes a new property. We also compare the coexistent short periodic solutions in terms of the resulting real profits. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

To safeguard the sustainability of the UROI, necessary to improve farmers' system needs, motivate the innovation of local governments.","[Yu Juyun] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Adm, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics,,yjy.1122@163.com,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,WORLD ACAD UNION-WORLD ACAD PRESS,LIVERPOOL,"113, ACADEMIC HOUSE, MILL LANE, WAVERTREE TECHNOLOGY PARK, LIVERPOOL, L13 4 AH, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84626-071-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,365,368,,,,,,4,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BQC52,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280689800082,0

Despite the widely known problems with these models, there has been little movement to adopt more recently developed asset pricing models to provide additional evidence for estimating the cost of capital. This paper presents, validates empirically and applies a general yet simple consumption-based asset pricing specification to model the risk-return relationship for stocks and estimate the cost of common equity for public utilities. The model is not necessarily superior to other models in its practical results, yet these results do indicate that it should be used to provide additional estimates of the cost of common equity. Additionally, the model raises doubts as to whether assets such as utility stocks are a consumption (business cycle) hedge.","[Michelfelder, Richard A.] Rutgers State Univ, Sch Business, Camden, NJ 08102 USA; [Ahern, Pauline M.; Hanley, Frank J.] AUS Consultants, Mt Laurel, NJ 08054 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University Camden; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Michelfelder, RA (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Sch Business, Camden, NJ 08102 USA.",pahern@ausinc.com; Fhanley@ausinc.com; richmich@rutgers.edu,,,,,,,21,5,6,1,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Surprisingly, in equilibrium, wages are always equalized between domestic and undocumented workers, even if they do not work in the same sectors of the economy. This is driven by the interaction of firm level decisions with optimal government policy.

It integrates different notions of uncertainty in economic literature into the discussion of the underlying action principles of the Bourdieuian approach. The study concludes that only a historical perspective which integrates social, structural and cognitive analysis can adequately explain the generation, reproduction, and transformation of individual action itself.

It applies well to Latin America in the 1980s and 1990s. However, the effort to introduce these Anglo-American institutional structures (Global Standard Institutions; GSIs) in the 1980s and 1990s resulted in uneven and unstable economic performance, not development. As a result, the relationship among institutions, development and economic policy in Latin America today has generally moved far beyond this 'mainstream'. The institutions to insure macro stability have generally been preserved, and some countries do follow GSI prescriptions. However in most countries, especially in South America, the effort to find the right mix of institutions for development has moved far beyond this mainstream. The result has been innovative initiatives to address more fundamental development issues such as inequality, property rights and international economic institutions. This process is likely to continue, facilitated by the currently robust democratic political systems that grew out of the earlier turmoil.","Univ Utah, Dept Econ, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Jameson, KP (通讯作者)，Univ Utah, Dept Econ, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",jameson@economics.utah.edu,,,,,,,11,2,2,1,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,,,J I ECON,J.

The paper then develops a dynamic programming framework for optimizing the timing of carbon trades (i.e., the timing of the acquisition of the required carbon certificates to cover carbon emissions liabilities of the company), given banked credits or allocations of carbon credits at the start of the planning period and the emissions liabilities resulting from the company's joint energy and carbon portfolio optimization problem.","[Kleindorfer, Paul R.] INSEAD, Fontainebleau, France; [Li, Lide] Exelon Corp, Kennett Sq, PA USA",INSEAD Business School,"Kleindorfer, PR (通讯作者)，INSEAD, Fontainebleau, France.",Paul.Kleindorfer@insead.edu; Lide.Li@exeloncorp.com,,,,,,,13,0,0,1,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

This paper introduces a new paradigm for decision making a composite choice model in which economic agents are constantly weighing rationality versus irrationality when encountering options. In an exploratory, deterministic, two-period model, an assumption of a two-way cross-embedment (i.e., a two-way interaction between the rational and irrational components) results in a paradoxical phenomenon, an outcome of either tending toward bliss or abyss at the end of the first period. This implies, for instance, a psychological struggle between two selves within the mind. The paradigm proposed is compared to the dual-process theories recently developed by the cognitive sciences. Future research will explore implications for public policy design and implementation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

It argues that the definitions of mainstream and heterodox, and consequently the differences between them, are highly problematic. Specifically it challenges Lee's characterizations of mainstream and heterodox economics as noncomparable. Attempts to contrast them starkly are part of a rhetoric of distinction which may be problematic. Thus, Lee's concept of intellectual pluralism may be weaker than it seems, because it is based on distinction and its tolerance, rather than an embrace of diversity. Further, both theoretical and intellectual pluralism may be based on wider epistemological and ontological grounds and thus Lee's distinction between them may also be problematic. Sheila Dow's structured pluralism may be a more productive way of embracing difference.","Univ W England, Bristol Business Sch, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England",University of West England,"Mearman, A (通讯作者)，Univ W England, Bristol Business Sch, Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England.",andrew.mearman@uwe.ac.uk,,"Mearman, Andrew/0000-0003-0601-8060",,,,,45,12,13,1,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

This paper uses an efficient structure hypothesis model to examine the relationship between the banks' efficiencies and their profitability. The data envelopment analysis method is applied to measure the efficiency and profitability of the banking industry in order to minimize possible bias due to the inflow of public funds for the bank consolidation. The two-step Heckman selection method is used to correct for survivorship bias in the model. The derived result indicates that banks with higher efficiencies tend to record higher profit. Moreover, higher pure technological efficiency and scale efficiency have a positive effect on a bank's market share and concentration.","[Kim, Brian H.

With only modest imports, China has succeeded in feeding 22% of the world's population on only 7% of its land. However, a high price has been paid for this enormous achievement. Increase in grain yields, in particular in rice, as the main source of production growth, relied heavily on intensive use of physical inputs and increasing intensity of farming systems. Soil degradation, water scarcity, and severe pollution were among the consequences as well as declining efficiency of fertilizer application. Using county-level panel data from 1980 to 2003 and graphical (GIS-based) analysis, this paper first looks at the spatial change of the major grain production across regions over the past two decades, towards the northern and northeastern provinces. The analysis is complemented by using a random panel data model, which underscores the significant influence of land availability, degree of urbanization, and government policy on grain production. Finally, this analysis addresses environmental stress which includes both soil degradation and water shortage. The latter is already severe in many of the traditional grain producing areas, but will now become a bigger problem in the new grain producing areas, as these have traditionally much less water resources. Hence, while the economic rational of the grain shift towards the northern and northeastern regions is understandable, its sustainability is not guaranteed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The firm optimally decides when to review costly information on the adequacy of its price. Upon each review, the firm chooses whether to adjust its price, one or more times, before the next price review. Each price adjustment entails paying a menu cost. The firm's choices map into several statistics: the frequency of price reviews, the frequency of price adjustments, the size distribution of price changes, and the hazard rate of price adjustments. The simultaneous presence of observation and menu costs produces complementarities that change the predictions of simpler models featuring one cost only. For instance, infrequent observations may reflect a high menu cost rather than high observation costs: in spite of these complementarities, we show that the ratio of the two costs is identified by several statistics on price observations and adjustments.","[Alvarez, Fernando E.] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Sassari, I-07100 Sassari, Italy",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Sassari,"Alvarez, FE (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,,"Lippi, Francesco/0000-0001-7721-7257",,,,,49,67,78,0,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

(Rev Int Econ 13(4):770-786, 2005). The model predicts that there are both horizontal and vertical motivations for engaging in FDI. The horizontal motives regard access to new markets in the case of trade frictions, whereas the vertical motivations imply that multinational enterprises seek to take advantage of relative skill differences in different countries. The impact of the vertical component in the KCM has been largely debated and thereby is of the greatest interest. Another issue addressed in the study is the relevance of spatial interdependencies in FDI flow. To check for these kinds of FDI determinants the KCM model is augmented with a surrounding market potential and a spatial lag term. By using large data sets for FDI stocks among OECD countries from 1982 to 2003 along with structural breaks and spatial econometric techniques, the paper evaluates the significance of traditional and spatial FDI determinants. The results show that the vertical component is indeed important, even for FDI among OECD countries, but that this importance is clearly decreasing over time. The findings point towards the existence of spatial linkages that are also compatible with export-platform motivations.","[Mariel, Petr] Univ Basque Country, Dept Appl Econ 3, Bilbao 48015, Spain; [Hultgren, Viktor] Vagverket, S-40533 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Rodriguez Gonzalez, Carlos] Univ Basque Country, Dept Appl Econ 5, Bilbao 48015, Spain",University of Basque Country; University of Basque Country,"Mariel, P (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, Dept Appl Econ 3, Lehendakari Agirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain.",viktor.hultgren@trafikverket.se; petr.mariel@ehu.es; carlos.rodriguezg@ehu.es,"Rodriguez, Carlos/DNT-3892-2022; Mariel, Petr/K-8399-2014","Rodriguez, Carlos/0000-0001-6629-2147; Mariel, Petr/0000-0002-7412-0684",,,,,32,1,1,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

However, due to linkage offsetting, FDI at both stages may yield lower domestic welfare than FDI at a single stage. Vertical integration not only solves the coordination problem, it also eliminates double marginalization. But since the integrated multinational does not sell the intermediate to local firms, its entry generates no vertical linkages and can yield lower welfare than FDI by independent firms.","[Lin, Ping] Lingnan Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Tuen Mun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",Lingnan University; Vanderbilt University,"Lin, P (通讯作者)，Lingnan Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Tuen Mun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",plin@ln.edu.hk,"Saggi, Kamal/B-1756-2012","LIN, Ping/0000-0002-0641-6440",,,,,16,5,6,2,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,,,INT ECON REV,Int.

The case of Mexico between 1988 and 2002 is representative of several episodes in Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe in which countries opening to capital flows experienced large appreciations accompanied by a significant reallocation of workers towards the non-tradable sector. We account for these facts using a two sector dynamic general equilibrium model of a small open economy with frictions to labor reallocation and two driving forces: (i) A decline in the cost of borrowing in foreign markets, and (ii) differential productivity growth across sectors. These two mechanisms account together for 60% of the decline in the domestic relative price of tradables in Mexico and for a large fraction of the observed reallocation of labor across sectors. The decline in the interest rate faced by Mexico in international markets is quantitatively the most important channel. Our results are robust to the inclusion of terms of trade into the model.

The methods modify a technique proposed in Phillips, Wu, and Yu (2011) and provide a technology for identifying bubble behavior with consistent dating of their origination and collapse. The tests serve as an early warning diagnostic of bubble activity and a new procedure is introduced for testing bubble migration across markets. Three relevant financial series are investigated, including a financial asset price (a house price index), a commodity price (the crude oil price), and one bond price (the spread between Baa and Aaa). Statistically significant bubble characteristics are found in all of these series. The empirical estimates of the origination and collapse dates suggest a migration mechanism among the financial variables. A bubble emerged in the real estate market in February 2002. After the subprime crisis erupted in 2007, the phenomenon migrated selectively into the commodity market and the bond market, creating bubbles which subsequently burst at the end of 2008, just as the effects on the real economy and economic growth became manifest. Our empirical estimates of the origination and collapse dates and tests of migration across markets match well with the general dateline of the crisis put forward in the recent study by Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas (2008a).","[Phillips, Peter C.

The agent-based model is designed to match the experimental rules that Brandts and Guillen (J Ind Econ 55:453-474, 2007) used with human subjects. Their model uses posted prices and advance production of a perishable good. When the marginal cost is zero, the analytical Bertrand solution is almost perfect competition. When the marginal cost is nonzero, the game does not have a theoretical equilibrium in pure strategies. The agent-based model results show that with one or two firms, prices are at or near the monopoly level, which matches the human experiments. With four firms, prices are always at the perfectly competitive level when particle swarm optimization is used. Results using a genetic algorithm, however, are noisier than those using the particle swarm optimization, and the genetic algorithm falls short of the competitive solution. The triopoly market changes from mostly monopoly to a price in between monopoly and perfect competition when a marginal cost is added. The computerized agents tend to overproduce so that profits are negative in the three- and four-firm cases when production is costly. While the prices in the simulation are close to those observed in experiments with human subjects, the inefficiency due to overproduction is much greater in the agent-based model results. This result suggests that human agents are able to reach solutions, perhaps through social norms, that are missed by the simple agent-based rules used here.","[Brorsen, B.

Such models are currently used to derive the benefits of carbon mitigation policies through estimates of the social cost of carbon (SCC). To remain tractable these models often utilize highly simplified representations of complex natural, social, and economic systems. The authors consider three prominent IAMs, DICE, FUND, and PAGE, and compare their highly simplified temperature response models to two upwelling diffusion energy balance models that better reflect the progressive heat uptake of the deep ocean. They find that all three IAMs fail to fully capture important characteristics in the dynamics of temperature response, especially for high equilibrium climate sensitivities. This has serious implications given these models are often run with distributions for the equilibrium climate sensitivity which have a positive probability for such states of the world. The authors find that, all else equal, the temperature response model in FUND can lead to estimates of the expected SCC that are 10-75% lower than those derived using more realistic climate models, while the models in DICE and PAGE lead to expected SCC estimates that are 10-110% and 40-260% higher, respectively.","US EPA, Natl Ctr Environm Econ, Washington, DC 20460 USA",United States Environmental Protection Agency,"Marten, AL (通讯作者)，US EPA, Natl Ctr Environm Econ, Washington, DC 20460 USA.",marten.alex@epa.gov,,"Marten, Alex/0000-0003-3427-9719",,,,,42,17,21,0,6,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics-Kiel,OCT 20,2011,5.0,,,,,,,,201118,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2011-18,0.0,,,43,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,865CD,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298287500001,0

This traditional view does not permit reconfiguration of the transmission grid by the system operators to improve system performance and economic efficiency. The current push to create a smarter grid has brought to the forefront the possibility of co-optimizing generation along with the network topology by incorporating the control of transmission assets within the economic dispatch formulations. Unfortunately, even though such co-optimization improves the social welfare, it may be incompatible with prevailing market design practices since it can create winners and losers among market participants and it has unpredictable distributional consequences in the energy market and in the financial transmission rights (FTR) market. In this paper, we first provide an overview of recent research on optimal transmission switching, which demonstrates the substantial economic benefit that is possible even while satisfying standard N-1 reliability requirements. We then discuss various market implications resulting from co-optimizing the network topology with generation and we examine how transmission switching may affect locational Marginal Prices (LMPs), i.e., energy prices, and revenue adequacy in the FTR market when FTR settlements are financed by congestion revenues.","[Hedman, Kory W.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Elect Comp & Energy Engn, Engn Res Ctr 579, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Oren, Shmuel S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Ind Engn & Operat Res Dept, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [O'Neill, Richard P.] Fed Energy Regulatory Commiss, Off Energy Policy & Innovat, Washington, DC 20426 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Hedman, KW (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Sch Elect Comp & Energy Engn, Engn Res Ctr 579, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",kory.hedman@asu.edu; oren@ieor.berkeley.edu; richard.oneill@ferc.gov,,,Directorate For Engineering [0969016] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Industrial Innovation & Partnersh [0969016] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)); Div Of Industrial Innovation & Partnersh(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)),,,32,40,48,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

However, if bank runs are linked to a fall in asset values, providing deposit insurance can be very costly and, as the case of Ireland has shown, can even threaten sovereign solvency.

Proponents of each view question the ontological validity and explanatory power of the other. This paper argues that information theory, rooted in modern thermodynamics, offers the potential to integrate these two perspectives in a common and rigorous framework. Both evolution and self-organization can be generalized as computational processes that can be applied to human social phenomena. Under this view, evolution is a process of algorithmic search through a combinatorial design space, while self-organization is the result of non-zero sum gains from information aggregation. Evolution depends on the existence of self-organizing forces, and evolution acts on designs for self-organizing structures. The framework yields insights on the role of agency and the emergence of novelty. The paper concludes that information theory may provide a fundamental ontological basis for economic and institutional evolution.","McKinsey Global Inst, London, England",,"Beinhocker, ED (通讯作者)，McKinsey Global Inst, London, England.",eric.beinhocker@mckinsey.com,"Kim, Soohyun/N-6460-2014; Schiller, Gabrielle/H-7617-2012",,,,,,114,28,28,1,72,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

This holds for a long forecasting sample 1960-2005, as well for more recent subperiods, including the Volcker and Greenspan eras. However, the contribution of money to inflation forecasting accuracy is quantitatively limited and tends to be close to negligible in recent subperiods.

To this end, we begin by analyzing whether the changes introduced by the regulator led distribution companies to improve their efficiency; we then address whether the reimbursements paid to the distribution companies are linked to efficiency; lastly, we examine whether consumers benefited from the efficiency improvements. We focus on Spain because the electricity regulator in that country is a longstanding pioneer in the implementation of incentive-based regulatory models. Our analysis was implemented using the regulatory model proposed by Bogetoft (1997) as a benchmark. The results show that the Spanish electricity regulator did not establish a link between efficiency and the reimbursements paid to electricity companies; in addition, the electricity companies benefited to the detriment of consumers.

We show that the model has a continuum of steady state equilibria under free trade, with the initial conditions determining which equilibrium will be attained. We establish conditions under which a static Heckscher-Ohlin theorem will hold in the steady state, and also conditions for a dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin theorem to hold. If both goods are normal, each country will have a unique autarkic steady state, and all steady state equilibria are saddle points. We also consider the case in which one good is inferior, and show that this can lead to multiple autarkic steady states, violations of the static Heckscher-Ohlin theorem in the steady state. Furthermore, there may exist steady state equilibria that Pareto dominate other steady states. These steady states will be unstable if discount factors are the same in each country, although they may exhibit dynamic indeterminacy if discount factors differ.","[Iwasa, Kazumichi; Nishimura, Kazuo] Kyoto Univ, KIER, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Bond, Eric W.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Econ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",Kyoto University; Vanderbilt University,"Nishimura, K (通讯作者)，Kyoto Univ, KIER, Sakyo Ku, Yoshida Honmachi, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",eric.bond@vanderbilt.edu; iwasa@kier.kyoto-u.ac.jp; nishimura@kier.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,"Bond, Eric/0000-0001-7028-1125","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [21243021, 23330063] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,27,10,11,1,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

In each period, the subjects simultaneously choose whether or not to make, irreversible contribution to the provision of an indivisible public good. Subjects observe the past actions of other subjects if and only if they are connected by the network. NE works may be incomplete so subjects are asymmetrically informed about the actions other subjects in the same network, which is typically an obstacle to the attainment of efficient outcome. For all networks, the game has a large set of (possibly inefficient) equilibrium outcomes. Nonetheless, the network architecture makes certain strategies salie and this in turn facilitates coordination on efficient outcomes. In particular, asymmetric in the network architecture encourage two salient behaviors, strategic delay and strategic commitment. By contrast, we find that symmetries in the network architecture can lead mis-coordination and inefficient outcomes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

During development the variety of sectors expands, which allows better sorting of entrepreneurial talent. The paper shows that, in addition to increasing the average productivity of matches between agents and sectors, this process also mitigates informational frictions in the financial markets. Furthermore, the impact of sectoral variety on the operation of financial markets gives rise to an interesting feedback between financial development and R&D effort, which may lead to different types of dynamics. A successful economy exhibits a progressive increase in the variety of sectors, which in turn enhances the operation of financial markets. However, a poverty trap may also arise. This situation is characterised by a rudimentary productive structure with poor matching of skills to activities and severely inefficient credit to talented entrepreneurs. (C) 2010 Elsevier By.

We consider an economy with two islands and two types of agents, farmers and traders. Farmers can produce two goods, but to sell these goods in centralized (Walrasian) markets, they need to be matched with a trader, and this entails costly search. In the absence of search frictions, our model reduces to a standard Ricardian model of trade. We use this simple model to contrast the implications of changes in the integration of Walrasian markets, which allow traders from different islands to exchange their goods, and changes in the access to these Walrasian markets, which allow farmers to trade with traders from different islands. We find that intermediation always magnifies the gains from trade under the former type of integration, but leads to more nuanced welfare results under the latter, including the possibility of aggregate losses.","[Antras, Pol] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Antràs, P (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,51,86,103,1,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

We analyze data spanning from the early 19th century until the present day in Sweden and the United Kingdom. Hence, in contrast to previous studies, we evaluate the validity of Wagner's Law and the ratchet effect hypothesis over a very long time period, starting at the beginning of industrialization. Cointegration analysis is used to investigate the long-run relationships between government expenditure and GDP, focusing on sub-periods and structural breaks. Moreover, we test the ratchet effect hypothesis by estimating models which allow for asymmetric adjustment. According to our main results, Wagner's Law does not hold in the long run, although the data are consistent with Wagner's Law between roughly 1860 and the mid 1970s. This can be traced to the formation of the modern public sector, including the introduction of public education, health care, and so forth. Yet Wagner's Law did not hold during the initial industrialization phase (before 1860), and in recent periods GDP only affects the government spending share when we control for population age structure. Finally, we find some evidence of asymmetric adjustment in the UK, particularly in the post-WWII period. However, the ratchet effect is not a general cause of the growth of government spending.

The pilot ran during the summers of 2008 and 2009 and was called the Smart Energy Pricing (SEP) Pilot. In 2008, it tested two types of dynamic pricing tariffs: critical peak pricing (CPP) and peak time rebate (PTR) tariffs. About a thousand customers were randomly placed on these tariffs and some of them were paired with one of two enabling technologies, a device known as the Energy Orb and a switch for cycling central air conditioners. The usage of a randomly chosen control group of customers was also monitored during the same time period. In 2009, BGE repeated the pilot program with the same customers who participated in the 2008 pilot, but this time it only tested the PTR tariff. In this paper, we estimate a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) model on the SEP pilot's hourly consumption, pricing and weather data. We derive substitution and daily price elasticities and predictive equations for estimating the magnitude of demand response under a variety of dynamic prices. We also test for the persistence of impacts across the two summers. In addition, we report average peak demand reduction for each of the treatment cells in the SEP pilot and compare the findings with those reported from earlier pilots. These results show conclusively that it is possible to incentivize customers to reduce their peak period loads using price signals. More importantly, these reductions do not wear off when the pricing plans are implemented over two consecutive summers. Our analyses reveal that SEP participants reduced their peak usages in the range of 18 to 33% in the first summer of the SEP pilot and continued these reductions in the second summer.",,,,ahmad.faruqui@brattle.com,,,,,,,11,35,40,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

If fines are unbounded, laissez faire is optimal if the social harm from innovation is sufficiently unlikely; otherwise, regulation should impose increasing penalties as innovation becomes more dangerous.

Using a stochastic distance frontier approach that allows decomposing total factor productivity change into different sources, we examine (a) whether Baumol's cost-disease hypothesis is valid in this sector and (b) if so, whether any negative influence of the cost-disease effect on productivity can be compensated by efficiency gains. The findings indicate an increase in real unit labor cost as a result of rising wage rates and thus do support the cost-disease hypothesis. Further, increasing returns to scale are observed for the majority of the theaters, implying that significant efficiency gains can be realized by the exploitation of scale economies. However, because of the increasing unit labor cost and an increasing scale inefficiency, we find an overall decrease in average productivity of about 8% within the sample period.","[Last, Anne-Kathrin] Univ Luneburg, Inst Econ, D-21314 Luneburg, Germany; [Wetzel, Heike] Univ Cologne, Inst Energy Econ, D-50827 Cologne, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg; University of Cologne,"Last, AK (通讯作者)，Univ Luneburg, Inst Econ, POB 2440, D-21314 Luneburg, Germany.",last@uni.leuphana.de; heike.wetzel@uni-koeln.de,,"Wetzel, Heike/0000-0002-3945-6318",,,,,34,17,19,4,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,,,J CULT ECON,J.

K. and France. We build a new firm-level data set that combines a global M&A database with balance sheet data for the years 2000 to 2007. Combining matching techniques with a difference-in-differences estimator, we find that cross-border M&As boost on average acquirers' domestic sales and investment, and they are not accompanied by a downsizing of the domestic labour force in either country. Further, cross-border M&As in knowledge-intensive industries lead to improvements in domestic productivity. Our results display some heterogeneity across industries and types of acquisitions, suggesting a connection between the motives for international M&As and their resulting effects.

They also sow the seeds for the ensuing sudden stops, or capital flow reversals, observed in financial crises in emerging markets. This paper tests the implications of applying the Kindleberger-Minsky model of financial crises to capital account reversals in emerging economies, or sudden stops as they have been called in the recent literature. It uses a panel-probit framework with heterogeneous unobserved country effects. The most important variables that account for sudden stops are preceding capital surges, the share of flows other than foreign direct investment, the size of the current account deficit, contagion from sudden stops in other emerging markets and the ratio of external debt to exports. The main policy conclusion is that emerging economies need specific policies to deal with capital surges. In addition, macroeconomic policies geared toward preserving sustainable macroeconomic balance may be necessary to avoid sudden stops but they are clearly insufficient.","[Agosin, Manuel R.] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Huaita, Franklin] Catholic Univ Peru, Lima, Peru",Universidad de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru,"Agosin, MR (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Diagonal Paraguay 205, Santiago, Chile.",managosin@gmail.com,"Agosin, Manuel R./ABH-1852-2020; Agosin, Manuel/AAD-9648-2019","Agosin, Manuel R./0000-0002-4196-918X;",,,,,43,18,26,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We study how health-impairing pollution affects long term growth, and the effect of an emissions' reduction policy (tax). We show that a tighter environmental tax has positive effects on growth via two channels. On the one hand, it improves workers' health and, thereby, productivity; on the other hand, it induces a reallocation of resources towards R&D and, thereby, higher research intensity. The size of the growth effect of a tighter environmental tax, and the level of the optimal environmental tax, are both positively correlated with the weight individuals place on health relative to consumption. As for welfare, a tighter environmental tax brings about utility gains in the long run and, potentially, also in the short run. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Using the survey data on different aspects of migration in Moldova, we find that those who stayed illegally in the host country tend to go into wage employment on return to the home country. We also show that relatively better educated migrants tend not to be in formal employment (i.e., appear not to participate in the labor market), whereas those with relatively lower skills or who obtained a worse-than-expected outcome in the host country are more likely to be wage employed in the home country on return. We offer an economic analysis of these paradoxical results.","[Piracha, Matloob] Univ Kent, Keynes Coll, Sch Econ, Canterbury, Kent, England",University of Kent,,,,"Piracha, Matloob/0000-0003-0885-349X",,,,,18,6,7,1,12,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0012-8775,,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.
