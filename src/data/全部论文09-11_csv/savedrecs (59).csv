The backlash corresponded chronologically with the development of neoclassical economics, and land barons became active in the establishment of academic economics institutions in the United States. Whereas the classical economists frequently referred to the factors of production as land, labor, and capital, neoclassical textbooks appearing in the 20th century increasingly ignored land and provided a production function, Y=f(K,L), in which capital and labor were the only factors explicitly identified. Neoclassical authors had several possible reasons for using a two-factor production function, but the political influence on neoclassical economics during its formative stages was conducive to avoiding reference to land when discussing factors of production. An emphasis on land would have invited scrutiny of land rents for tax purposes. Ecological economics has evolved as a response to the shortcomings of neoclassical economics in dealing with the environmental perils of economic growth. One of those shortcomings is the capital/labor production function which hides the importance of land and natural resources. Ecological economists have developed production functions that are more ecologically oriented, and one of them is explained herein. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

As a result, over time, large numbers of cotenants may own the same property; each cotenant possessing a fractional undivided interest to the jointly owned property. Property characterized by this form of joint ownership is often referred to as heir property. Recent literature has identified two prominent concerns regarding heir property: (1) efficiency concerns and (2) displacement concerns. In this paper we examine these issues using case study evidence from three families in eastern Kentucky. Our case studies provide evidence of both the efficiency and displacement concerns. To further assess and better understand the character of heir property we empirically examine affidavits of descent in Letcher County, Kentucky filed in the year 2000. The empirical results illuminate the general character of the family that survives an intestate death further clarifying the effect of intestacy law on specific family members. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A modified human development index (MHDI) is applied to measure the effects of human development in different countries. The MHDI includes many related social variables such as health effects, political rights, civil liberties. enrollment rate, and adult literacy rate. Apart from France, all countries follow increasing logarithmic or inverse-logarithmic curves that keep on the industrial pollution path.

The complete decomposition method developed by Sun is used to analyze the nature of the four factors: CO2 intensity, energy intensity, structural changes and economic activity. The results show that economic activity has the largest positive effect in CO2 emission changes in all the major economic sectors and China has achieved a considerable decrease in CO2 emission mainly due to the improved energy intensity. However. the impact of CO2 intensity and structural changes is relatively small. Structural changes only exhibit positive effect to the CO2 mitigation in agricultural sector, and CO2 intensity also contributes to the decrease of CO2 emission in transportation sector. Moreover, a formula about CO2 mitigation is presented in this paper, which shows that China has made a significant contribution to reducing global CO2 emission. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It is argued that there were considerable similarities between the backgrounds and life-cycle-related motivations of both servants and employers.

The CDM is an offsetting mechanism and, in principle, a zero game to the atmosphere: emission reductions achieved from CDM projects allow industrialised countries to increase their emissions, respectively. The article explores how the CDM could be moved beyond a pure offsetting mechanism in a post-2012 climate regime by crediting only a fraction of the emission reductions from CDM projects, thereby providing a net atmospheric benefit. Potential implications on the carbon market are assessed in a qualitative manner and different design options for such a reform to the CDM are discussed. An important conclusion is that the effects on carbon market depend considerably on whether the use of the CDM is limited through caps or not.","Oko Inst, D-10115 Berlin, Germany",,"Schneider, L (通讯作者)，Oko Inst, Novalisstr 10, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.",l.schneider@oeko.de,"Schneider, Lambert/Q-6090-2019","Schneider, Lambert/0000-0002-5704-0965",,,,,14,33,36,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

For the purpose of this study, highway conditions refer to the level of highway maintenance: the incidence of large potholes, large surface cracks, uneven sections, and debris. Primary computer collected data related to the fuel consumption of three types of trucks were analyzed. The data were derived from 88 trips taken over six routes, each route representative of one of two highway conditions: better or worse. Study results are initially presented for each type of truck being monitored. The results are then aggregated to approximate the entire Brazilian highway network. In all cases, results confirmed environmental benefits resulting from travel over the better routes. There was found to be an increase in energy efficiency from traveling better roads, which resulted in lower fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions. Statistical analysis of the results suggests that, in general, fuel consumption data were significant at *P < 0.05, rejecting the null hypothesis that average fuel consumption from traveling the better routes is statistically equal to average fuel consumption from traveling the worse routes. Improved Brazilian road conditions would generate economic benefits, reduce dependency on and consumption of fossil fuels (due to the increase in energy efficiency), and reduce CO2 emissions. These findings may have additional relevancy if Brazil needs to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to reach future Kyoto Protocol's emissions targets, which should take effect in January 2013.

The LCIA method Ecoindicator99 provides impact pathways ending in a physical score for each of the three safeguard subjects humans, ecosystems, and resources. We redefine these damage categories so that they can be measured in terms of Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) for impacts on human well-being, Biodiversity Adjusted Hectare Years (BAHYs) for impacts on ecosystems, and monetary units for impacts on resource productivity. The monetary value of a QALY can be derived from the budget constraint, i.e. the fact that the average annual income is the maximum that an average person can pay for an additional life year. Since a QALY by definition is a life-year lived at full well-being, the budget constraint can be determined as the potential annual economic production per capita at full well-being. We determine this to be 74,000 EUR with an uncertainty estimate of 62,000 to 84,000 EUR. This corresponds well to the 74,627 EUR willingness-to-pay estimate of the ExternE project. Differences to other estimates can be explained by inherent biases in the valuation approaches used to derive these estimates. The value of ecosystems can be expressed in monetary terms or in terms of QALYs, as the share of our well-being that we are willing to sacrifice to protect the ecosystems. While this trade-off should preferably be done by choice modelling, only one such study was found at the level of abstraction that allows us to relate BAHYs to QALYs or monetary units. Stressing the necessity for such studies, we resort to suggest a temporary proxy value of 1400 EUR/BAHY (or 52 BAHY/QALY), with an uncertainty range of 350 to 3500 EUR/BAHY. The practical consequences of the above-described monetarisation values has been investigated by combining them with the midpoint impact categories of two recent LCIA methods, thus providing a new LCIA method with the option of expressing results in both midpoints and an optional choice between QALY and monetary units as endpoint. From our application of the new method to different case studies, it is noteworthy that resource impacts obtain less emphasis than in previous LCIA methods, while impacts on ecosystems obtain more importance. This shows the significance of being able to express impacts on resources and ecosystems in the same units as impacts on human well-being. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

With an applied model that comprises twelve world regions we investigate: (i) a benchmark without transfers, (ii) scenarios with allocation-based rules where coalition members receive tradable emission permits proportional to initial or future emissions, (iii) scenarios with outcome-based rules where the coalition surplus is distributed proportional to emissions, and (iv) a scenario based on an optimal sharing rule where the coalition surplus is distributed proportional to outside option payoffs. We find that well-designed transfer schemes can stabilise larger coalitions and increase global abatement levels. In our applied setting we find that for allocation-based and outcome-based rules only small coalitions are stable, and, in the case of grandfathered emission permits, there is no stable coalition at all. Some obstacles associated with grandfathered emission. permits can be overcome by incorporating the expected growth of emissions in developing countries in the distribution of emission permits. For the optimal transfer scheme we find that larger coalitions, which include key players such as the United States and China, can be stable, but no transfer scheme is capable of stabilising the Grand Coalition.

Our results suggest that EU Emission Allowance (EUA) price developments matter to the stock performance of electricity firms: EUA price changes and stock returns of the most important European electricity corporations are shown to be positively related. This effect does not work asymmetrically, so that stock markets do not seem to react differently to EUA appreciations in comparison to depreciations. The carbon market effect is shown to be both time- and country-specific: It is particularly strong for the period of EUA market shock in early 2006, and differs with respect to the countries where the electricity corporations analysed are headquartered. Stock market reactions to EUA volatility could not be shown. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

There is little guidance regarding ISO 22000 implementation as well as inconsistencies regarding definitions and control measures specifications. This paper aims to provide a structured approach for the implementation of ISO 22000, applied to the case of industrial yoghurt. Design/methodology/approach - The approach consisted of two stages. The first primarily comprises the interpretation of the ISO 22000 specifications. The second includes the application of these requirements (as interpreted) to industrial yoghurt manufacture, considering all major varieties (set, stirred and strained) and types (with or without flavourings). Findings - The paper reveals a managerial perspective of ISO 22000, overcoming existing inconsistencies for determining the necessary control measures, as applied to industrial yoghurt. Research limitations/implications - This research is limited to the case of industrial yoghurt considered. However, the methodology used is general and can apply to any other product. Originality/value - This paper provides an interpretation of ISO 22000, based on other standardized management system practices and widely accepted managerial principles. The findings can help in the development of the necessary state-of-the-practice tools to facilitate future ISO 22000 implementations, in conjunction with the ISO 9001 quality standard.","[Chountalas, Panagiotis; Lagodimos, Athanasios] Univ Piraeus, Dept Business Adm, Piraeus, Greece; [Tsarouchas, Dimitrios] Nosis Business Solut, Athens, Greece",University of Piraeus,"Chountalas, P (通讯作者)，Univ Piraeus, Dept Business Adm, Piraeus, Greece.",pchountalas@yahoo.gr,"Chountalas, Panos/O-9252-2019; Lagodimos, Athanasios/AAP-8554-2021",,,,,,41,12,12,0,52,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This implies that the introduction of a traceability system should be perceived and positioned as a catalyst for better business practices. However, despite these benefits, a traceability system is also investment-worthy. Hence, the value of investment in a traceability system constitutes a matter of considerable concern and debate for both practitioners and academics alike. This paper seeks to present a cost-benefit evaluation applied in a natural mineral water company regarding the pilot deployment of an electronic-based traceability system. Design/methodology/approach - This is a case based study. Findings - Based on the experience described previously, a high-level framework is generated that any organisation can refer to as a proper guideline in order to demonstrate how the costs and benefits can be compared for overall evaluation of the deployment of any traceability system. The details of the framework are described by applying it to a specific case. Practical implications - The present framework has theoretical interest for replicability in a different number of food sectors. Originality/value - The paper contributes to closing the existing gap regarding the theoretical approach that food traceability systems can adopt when their costs and benefits are investigated.","[Chryssochoidis, George; Karagiannaki, Angeliki; Kehagia, Olga] Agr Univ Athens, Athens, Greece; [Karagiannaki, Angeliki; Pramatari, Katerina] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece",Agricultural University of Athens; Athens University of Economics & Business,"Chryssochoidis, G (通讯作者)，Agr Univ Athens, Athens, Greece.",gc@agribusiness.aua.gr,"Pramatari, Katerina/D-5725-2013; George Chryssochoidis- Professor of Marketing, University of Kent/I-1285-2019; Chryssochoidis, George/L-2504-2015","George Chryssochoidis- Professor of Marketing, University of Kent/0000-0001-9868-7119;",European Commission,European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"The research described in this paper is part of the TRACE (tracing the origin of food) project, which is funded by the European Commission through the Sixth Framework Programme.

Design/methodology/approach - The comparative advantage of China's vegetable sector is measured through an export specialisation index. A trade-shares accounting framework is used to identify the sources of change in China's aggregate market shares. An import demand function for China's vegetable exports is estimated. Findings - The paper finds that China has a comparative advantage in vegetable production and exporting. Although there have been negative structural changes in vegetable imports in many of China's major overseas markets, particularly East Asia, China's export share of those markets and its over-all world market share has increased since WTO membership. China's export growth rate has exceeded the global average for most vegetable categories. Penetration of SE Asian markets has been price driven, but there is little evidence that China's WTO membership has enabled greater penetration into EU markets for its vegetable exports. Originality/value - There have been many studies of the potential impact of China's WTO membership on world trade in agri-food products, but none examining its actual impact in the labour intensive vegetable sector. Although the methodologies applied are well established, their empirical application in the context of China's vegetable export sector in this article are original, and present a context against which to view China's future vegetable export prospects.","[Revell, Brian J.] Harper Adams Univ Coll, Newport, Shrops, England; [Xue, Liu] China Agr Univ, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",Harper Adams University; China Agricultural University,"Revell, BJ (通讯作者)，Harper Adams Univ Coll, Newport, Shrops, England.",bjrevell@harper-adams.ac.uk,,,,,,,21,10,11,3,37,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

With the rapid development of IT and e-commerce, 'a new model called drop-shipping has come into being, which provides a good reference for suppliers to reply to the squeeze of the dominant retailers. First, this paper compares the profit of supplier, retailer and the whole supply chain under traditional model and drop-shipping model. Then, on the basis of computer simulation, the pricing strategy of supplier to cope with dominant retailers is analyzed. The result indicates that, by means of an optimal pricing strategy, the supplier can benefit from drop-shipping model and enhance its power in supply chain without reducing the retailer's profit.","[Yan, Jianyuan; Cheng, Xia; Zhai, Chunjuan; Liu, Chenhao] Nankai Univ, Sch Business, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Nankai University,,nkyan5559@yahoo.com.cn; cxshine@yahoo.com.cn; zhai_chj@yahoo.com.cn; comliu@yahoo.cn,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,1,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9806057-2-3,,,,2009,,,,,,,383,389,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BKK53,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268388300050,0

This survey aims to contribute to a better understanding of population and resource dynamics models in general and facilitate further application of the model framework to relevant circumstances. Although often treated as exogenous in optimal growth models, making population growth an endogenous function allows us to analyze broader effects of economic activities on population. The issues of substitutability, innovation and capital accumulation are intertwined; allowing a model to address the effect of an endogenous technological change on substitutability between natural and man-made capital facilitates our analyses of sustainability issues. To address internalizing inter-generational externalities in resource use, incorporating property right changes and institutional designs to this type of model is a useful exercise, but careful attention is needed for the consistency between such an arrangement and the mathematical representation of the depicted economy. Finally, although the common criticism regarding convenient mathematical assumptions applies to the existing BT-type models, the use of computer simulation can relax such assumptions, to better represent the intended relationships between the relevant variables.

Two attributes - fishing control and lake side plantation - were identified as relevant attributes for the choice experiment. A monetary attribute - payment for fishing permit was also included. Multinomial and random parameter logit models were used for estimation. All the attributes included were significant factors in affecting the probability of choosing an alternative scenario. The results suggest that fishermen were more concerned about fishing control as reflected by the higher value they give to fishing control than lake side plantation. Household income, years of education, and family size were found to be significant The economic welfare measures we calculated for two scenarios show that fishermen were willing to pay 57 birr (US$5.3)) per month for a moderate improvement scenario and 93 birr (US$8.6) per month for an aggressive scenario for the two attributes.

It introduces new data on the parish of St Mary Whitechapel which casts doubt on the pattern of the age incidence of smallpox found by Davenport et al. However, it is concluded that there was a decline in adult smallpox in London, accompanied by a concentration of the disease among children under the age of five. Davenport et al.'s argument that the shift in the age incidence was due to the endemicization of smallpox in England is challenged, with an alternative view that these age changes can be accounted for by the practice of inoculation, both in the hinterland southern parishes of England and in London itself. A detailed discussion is carried out on the history of inoculation in London for the period 1760-1812. It is suggested that inoculation became increasingly popular in this period, rivalling in popularity the practice of vaccination. This was associated with a class conflict between the medical supporters of Jenner and the general population, with many of the latter being practitioners of the old inoculation.",,,,,,,,,,,58,13,13,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0117,,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

On Jeju Island, Korea, women traditional divers called Haenyeo harvest resources in a common fishing ground. To investigate the impact of introducing tourists on the benefit to the fishing association and the resource level, we examine two models that differ in the way the number of tourists is controlled. In the first model, the fishing association charges an entrance fee to tourists and the level of the fee is chosen to regulate tourist number. In the second, only a part of the fishing ground is made open to tourists, and the fraction of the ground open is chosen to control the tourist number. In both models, the fishing association seeks to maximize its total benefit. Analysis shows that the way the number of tourists increases with the availability of resources strongly influences the distribution of benefits among the fishing ground stakeholders. Finally, we discuss policy implications of our results and how local government can reduce the risk of introducing tourism. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Three indicators (district value added, share of agriculture on total product, and a composite index of land sensitivity) were used to classify 784 Italian local districts into eight performance classes. Four classes share a combination of high environmental quality (in terms of land degradation), high (or low) economic performances, and high (or low) productivity of the primary sector. The remaining four are characterised by a combination of low (and declining) environmental quality, high (or low) economic performances, and high (or low) productivity of the primary sector. The eight classes were grouped into four 'environmental quality' types and four 'target performance' categories to discriminate among high- and low-performance districts by considering twelve additional variables within a Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA). 148 high environmental performance districts (18% of total) were identified mainly across the Alps and Apennine while 314 districts (41%) were classified in the lowest performance class and concentrated in flat areas of southern Italy. The districts with high environmental performances were characterised, on average, by medium to low district value added, moderately low economic weight of the primary sector, and tourism specialisation. Districts with high economic performances and low environmental performances were characterised by high sensitivity to LD, low district value added, high share of agriculture in total product, and the lowest productivity of labour in all economic sectors. In these districts the risk of entering a downward spiral of rural poverty and environmental degradation is potentially high. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Conventional risk assessment, therefore, is limited in providing guidance in managing the risk of nonindigenous species (NIS). However, risk management decisions must be made facing these uncertainties to avoid high and irreversible impacts. We develop an integrated ecological economic modeling and deliberative multi-criteria evaluation (DMCE) approach to support group decision-making in risk prioritization, using an example of ten NIS that could potentially impact Australian plant industries. This innovative approach seeks to combine the advantages of dynamic modeling with the benefits of DMCE in assessing and communicating uncertainty. The model unveils the complexity of the socio-ecological system of biological invasion, with a scenario analysis designed to interactively communicate scientific uncertainty to decision-makers. The DMCE provides a structured approach to identifying stakeholders' key concerns in addressing economic, social, and environmental dimensions of NIS risk explicitly.

In this paper, we propose a new simultaneous equation multi-category count data model-the Poisson-lognormal simultaneous equation model-that allows for the Poisson parameter in one equation to be a function of the Poisson parameters in other equations. While generally applicable to any situation where simultaneity is an issue and the dependent variables are measured as counts, such a specification is particularly useful for our empirical application where physicians prescribe drugs in multiple categories. Accounting for the endogeneity of detailing in such situations requires us to explicitly allow for pharmaceutical firms' detailing activities in one category to be influenced by their activities in other categories. Estimation of such a system of equations using traditional maximum likelihood method is cumbersome, so we propose a simple solution based on using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Our simulation study demonstrates the validity of the solution algorithm and the biases that would result if such simultaneity is ignored in the estimation process. We apply our methodology to study multi-category physician prescription behavior, while accounting for the endogeneity and simultaneity of firms' detailing efforts within and across categories, at individual physician level. Substantively, we show that detailing responsiveness estimates, as well as their implications for physician segmentation and firms' profits are significantly affected when we leverage data from multiple categories to account for endogeneity in detailing decisions.","[Dong, Xiaojing] Santa Clara Univ, Leavey Sch Business, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA; [Chintagunta, Pradeep K.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Manchanda, Puneet] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Santa Clara University; University of Chicago; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Dong, XJ (通讯作者)，Santa Clara Univ, Leavey Sch Business, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA.",xdong1@scu.edu; pradeep.chintagunta@chicagobooth.edu; pmanchan@umich.edu,"Chintagunta, Pradeep K/A-4764-2017; huang, libo/JMB-4345-2023","Dong, Xiaojing/0000-0002-6866-9443; Chintagunta, Pradeep/0000-0003-2854-5216",,,,,44,12,14,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

The region- and industry-specific nature of the sample data allows us to empirically examine spatial spillovers associated with public and private research expenditures in own-and other-industry sectors for our sample of 94 French regions. We find that the largest direct and indirect effects are associated with private R&D activity that spills across industry boundaries.

Meanwhile, the 'catch-up' in the index is also disintegrated as two components: pure technological catch-up and frontier catch-up. An empirical application that uses unbalanced panel data of the Taiwanese and Chinese commercial banking industry is also conducted under a parametric framework. The results reveal that the adverse scale efficiency change is the key factor to inducing the inferior productivity growth seen in Chinese banks compared with Taiwanese banks, which spotlights the importance of the scale efficiency change term on productivity measures.

We develop and calibrate a heterogeneous-agent portfolio-theory model to the historical Southern Indiana land-use history. Calibration exercises demonstrate that our spatially-explicit approach provides an accurate description of landowners in our study area, with the most descriptive model explaining 70% of land-use variation across time and space. Comparative statics simulations indicate that landowners' heterogeneous calibrated preference parameters marginally influence the landscape more than suitability and externality parameters. Policy simulations demonstrate that weaker multi-policy management strategies simultaneously targeting heterogeneities and spatial interactions can provide 1-6% more forest that is 1-3% less fragmented compared to alternative strong single-policy approaches.

As a result, the level of the groundwater table has decreased continuously in this area, threatening the life of groundwater aquifer. The objective of the study is to analyze the impacts of irrigation water pricing and agricultural policy scenarios on aquifer conservation by considering the dynamic relations between aquifer groundwater balance and the agriculture sector. For this purpose a combination of simulation and optimization techniques is considered in a dynamic framework. Firstly, dynamic treatments of groundwater and the main factors affecting the balance of studied aquifer are simulated. Then, optimization behaviour of agriculture sector related to farmers' decision-making processes is defined on the time horizon. Thereafter all of the equations are used simultaneously by a non-linear dynamic programming method, which maximize present value of gross margins of agriculture sector subject to groundwater constrains and other input limitations. The analysis of the results indicates that water pricing by itself can considerably reduce the agricultural demand for aquifer groundwater in the Hamadan-Bahar plain. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Using a model of policy change, this paper analyses the circumstances that enabled the emergence of WUP and prompted BC Hydro to change its decision-making processes to better consider environmental and social concerns. External factors, including dam operations' ecological impacts, an imprecise regulatory environment, and worsening relationships with regulators, highlighted the need for a change in operating BC Hydro facilities. Factors internal to BC Hydro included the development of a business case, concems regarding the utility's reputation and public expectations. While different approaches were explored for solving BC Hydro's problems, a policy window for change opened within a shifting context provided by the election of a more progressive government, the growth of the environmental movement, and new approaches to taking complex multi-stakeholder, multiple resource decisions. Following a successful pilot process and government direction to expand WUP, factors that enabled its institutionalisation included financial resources to compensate for the foregone power, the presence of visionary individuals, the background preparation that facilitated a successful pilot WUP, and the urgent need of a solution.

We find that more than half of the indium and 20-30% of the barium, lead, antimony, strontium, zirconium, silver, gold, and tin in domestically discarded products were not recycled in Japan, but rather were exported in products to be used elsewhere. The destinations of these metals were mainly Asian countries with rudimentary recycling technology. These results demonstrate that although these metals could have been stockpiled domestically for future recovery and recycling, they were instead sent to countries where recycling of these scarce metals is unlikely. From a resource perspective, therefore, the free trade of used Japanese products compromises long-term domestic resource availability as it increases the quality of life in developing countries.

Pooling players of all ability levels leads to a systematic bias in regression coefficients. After addressing this problem by dividing players into talent quintiles, we find that the best players peak about 2 years later than marginal players, and development and depreciation of performance appear to be more pronounced for players with the highest ability levels. Within-career variation, however, is less pronounced than between-player variation, and the performance level of players within a given quintile will typically remain lower than the talent level for rookies in the next higher quintile. We also find preliminary evidence that free agents are paid proportionately to their production at all ability levels, whereas young players' salaries are suppressed by similar amounts.","[Turner, Chad] Nicholls State Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Thibodaux, LA 70310 USA; [Hakes, Jahn K.] Albion Coll, Dept Econ & Management, Albion, MI 49224 USA",University of Louisiana System; Nicholls State University; Albion College,"Turner, C (通讯作者)，Nicholls State Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Thibodaux, LA 70310 USA.",jhakes@albion.edu; chad.turner@nicholls.edu,,,,,,,26,12,16,4,40,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Biodiversity conservation differs in many respects to the classical applications of tradable permits like emissions control. One particularity is that, even if the permit system maintains a constant total amount of species habitat, habitat turnover (the destruction of a habitat and restoration elsewhere) affects the ecosystem. Another particularity is that the restoration of habitats often takes much time, leading to time lags between the initiation of restoration activities and the time when restored habitat is available for trading. We use an agent-based model of a tradable permit market to study the influence of heterogeneous and dynamic conservation costs and habitat restoration time lags on key variables of the market, such as the costs incurred to the market participants and the amount of habitat turnover. Our results show that there may be trade-offs between these key variables. We also find that restoration time lags can lead to fluctuations in permit prices that reduce the efficiency of the permit market. We conclude that temporal lags deserve a careful analysis when implementing tradable permit systems for the preservation of natural habitats and biodiversity. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Towards this end, we investigate the impact of the EU ETS on research, development and demonstration (RD&D), adoption, and organizational change. In doing so, we pay particular attention to the relative influences of context factors (policy mix, market factors and public acceptance) and firm characteristics (value chain position, technology portfolio, size and vision). Empirically, our qualitative analysis is based on multiple case studies with 19 power generators, technology providers and project developers in the German power sector which were conducted in 2008/09. We find that the innovation impact of the EU ETS has remained limited so far because of the scheme's initial lack of stringency and predictability and the relatively greater importance of context factors. Additionally, the impact varies significantly across technologies, firms, and innovation dimensions and is most pronounced for RD&D on carbon capture technologies and organizational changes. Our analysis suggests that the EU ETS on its own may not provide sufficient incentives for fundamental changes in corporate innovation activities at a level which ensures political long-term targets can be achieved.

Past research has focused on involvement, lifestyle or motives as segmentation criteria. The present study seeks to combine all three perspectives. Design/methodology/approach - A postal paper-and-pencil survey was sent out randomly using addresses from the telephone book in the German-speaking part of Switzerland, resulting in a final sample size of n = 929. Findings - A principal component analysis identified 17 factors with satisfactory reliability coefficients. Using factor scores, a hierarchical cluster analysis was run, resulting in six wine consumer segments. These segments were further analyzed and described as: the price-conscious wine consumer; the involved, knowledgeable wine consumer; the image-oriented wine consumer, the indifferent wine consumer; the basic wine consumer; and the enjoyment-oriented, social wine consumer. Research limitations/implications - The methodology used to identify the wine consumer segments was exploratory. It is recommended that future work should continue to develop and validate such a methodology for the wine industry. Practical implications - Wine producers and marketers should appreciate that there are different segments of wine consumers. The information provided by this research is useful for marketers who seek to gain a competitive advantage through differentiation.

Design/methodology/approach - A face-to-face survey was conducted with 360 consumers in order to collect data on importance of food production technology, respondents' knowledge about GM food, consumers' beliefs about GM food, fear of genetic modifications, willingness to consume and pay for GM food and respondents' demographics. Data were analysed with univariate and multivariate analyses. Findings - The knowledge of Croatian traditional food consumers about GM food is relatively low, which affects their negative attitudes about consumption of GM food. Rejection of GM food is mostly associated with fear of possible negative impact of such food on human health and the environment. A high percentage of respondents (70 per cent) consider GM foods harmful to human health, resulting in a low acceptability of GM food even if it would be cheaper than food without GMOs. Respondents believe that GM components improve freshness and shelf life of food, but significantly reduce its taste and nutritional value. Research limitations/implications - One limitation of this study is the choice of the sample. Further research would be needed in order to explore attitudes and buying intentions of a representative sample of the entire Croatian population. Practical implications - Research results show that the introduction of GM food in the market would find potential consumers if it would provide some health benefits. Originality/value - This paper gives the first insight into Croatian traditional food consumers' knowledge and concerns regarding GM food.","[Cerjak, Marija; Kovacic, Damir] Univ Zagreb, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Mkt, Zagreb 41000, Croatia; [Ggic, Ivo] Univ Zagreb, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Zagreb 41000, Croatia",University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb,"Cerjak, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Mkt, Zagreb 41000, Croatia.",mcerjak@agr.hr,"GARCIA, SERGIO ERICK/X-9320-2018; Cerjak, Marija/AFS-5955-2022","Cerjak, Marija/0000-0003-0696-4364",,,,,21,6,6,0,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The potential for transfer of E.coli and C. jejuni was monitored in a simulated domestic kitchen environment while food preparation was filmed (n = 60 respondents). A survey was also administered. Findings - The results of the study show that transfer of bacteria around the kitchen environment and onto prepared meals are predicted by a lack of thoroughly washing contaminated hands, knives and chopping boards both during and after meal preparation. A higher level of perceived importance of correct food handling behaviour is associated with higher levels of educational attainment and age and food risk perceptions are positively associated with age. Practical implications - The results highlight the importance of promoting preventative measures and the means of employing them specifically to the young and less educated public who do not frequently cook and prepare food.

Prussian foresters promoted European beech in western and south-western parts of Lithuania in the nineteenth century by planting these trees in Scots pine stands. This forest management practice ensured beech migration towards north-east, what resulted in arising of the new issues concerning sensitivity of European beech to current environmental changes, in areas outside their natural distribution range. Dendrochronological analysis of these trees revealed that wormer dormant period and precipitation amount over the entire year positively affected beech tree growth in Lithuania. Only the effect of summer air temperature on beech tree ring formation demonstrated different significance, i.e. on the seaside summer air temperature positively resulted in tree ring width, meanwhile in the central part of Lithuania - negatively. Further investigation in this field will allow explain this difference in beech growth formation and sensitivity to summer heat in Lithuania. Despite this we can conclude that seaside and south-western parts of Lithuania are rather favourable for beech growth under the changing climate conditions in Lithuania.","[Pilkauskas, Mantas; Augustaitis, Algirdas; Marozas, Vitas] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Forest & Ecol, LT-53362 Akademija, Kaunas Dstr, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Pilkauskas, M (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Forest & Ecol, LT-53362 Akademija, Kaunas Dstr, Lithuania.",m.pilkauskas@gmail.com; algirdas.augustaitis@asu.lt; vitas.marozas@asu.lt,,,Research Council of Lithuania [LEK-19/2010],Research Council of Lithuania(Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT)),This research was funded by a grant (No. LEK-19/2010) from the Research Council of Lithuania.,,13,3,3,0,10,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,2,,,,,106,110,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304698500019,0

Design/methodology/approach - Phenomenological research has raised awareness and increased insight into the role of various pizza ingredients and health benefits of different pizza toppings and consequently pizza is called a functional food. The approach is based on observation of the online research, a close watch on the pizza industry, analysis of research papers in journals, and brainstorming research on the effect of packaging on the quality of different pizza ingredients with a co-researcher for four years. Findings - The changing life patterns and food habits of people and their preferences have catapulted the market to grow for convenience and fast foods. Pizza is one of the most popular family foods worldwide and has gained widespread consumer acceptance as a healthy and convenience food. It is a multi-component product with composite number of toppings. It provides an array of nutrients in significant amounts, in relation to its energy and fat content, making it a nutrient-dense food. It is cheap and can be delivered in a very short time. In particular, pizza supplies 30 per cent of the USA recommended daily allowance of vitamins A, C, B-2, calcium and protein. It contains 50 per cent of vitamin B-1 and 35 per cent of iron. Furthermore, pizza has anticancerous effects beyond the basic nutrition it provides, because of the potent antioxidant lycopene present in tomatoes. Originality/value - This paper offers a holistic view that would guide a reader to identify the beneficial effects of pizza.","[Singh, Preeti] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Food Packaging Technol, Munich, Germany; [Goyal, G.

These methods include technological processes, where seeds of agricultural crops are exposed to electric, magnetic fields, electric current, light and ultrasound. One of the most promising opportunities of agrophysical methods usage in agriculture is the research on effect of electric and magnetic fields on agricultural crops. Through optimization of electric and magnetic field parameters (field strength, exposure and direction of the fields) it is possible to stimulate or inhibit germination dynamics of crop seeds, the plant growth, to predetermined yields and crop quality. Electric and magnetic fields have influence on crop seed germination dynamics. Exposure to electric and magnetic fields increases germination energy and germination capacity of seeds. Seed germination energy, germination, crop yields and crop quality are determined by the magnetic field strength, time of exposure and period after exposure. Light variable magnetic fields reduce weed germination energy and germination capacity, whilst stronger magnetic fields increase seed germination energy and germination itself. Steady exposure to magnetic fields has different effect on emerging seeds and young plants; it produces lasting effect, which has influence on crops and vegetables yields. Continuous exposure to stationary and variable magnetic fields has influence on morphological and physiological parameters of the first generation agricultural plants and on the second generation of plants after exposure. Magnetic fields have a lasting impact on morphological and physiological parameters of the second generation of plants after exposure.","[Staselis, Alfredas; Staselis, Virginijus] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Dept Agroenerget, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Staselis, A (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Dept Agroenerget, Kaunas, Lithuania.",aek@asu.lt; virginijus.s@retp.lt,,,,,,,20,0,0,1,7,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,1,,,,,442,447,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304706000072,0

The aim of the model is to illustrate an holistic view to school meals based on the pupils' needs. Design/methodology/approach - The paper introduces Maslow's hierarchy of needs and eight theoretical views to school meals. The empirical data were collected in 2007 from the pupils (168), their parents (82) and the school officials (42) of four comprehensive schools in Finland by using a structured questionnaire which included open questions. Consequently, a description of a nutritionally balanced school meal model for a comprehensive school was constructed. Findings - A constructed model for serving school meals consists of the following views: pupil's needs; nutrition, food choice and waste views; well-being and energy; education; social-ecological environment and school meal environment, as well as maintaining good health and preventing health problems. The model is structured according to the theoretical views as well as suggestions from the pupils, parents, and experts. Also the subjects responsible for the activities are included. Practical implications - The constructed nutritionally balanced school meal model can be utilized as a standard model when serving school meals in a comprehensive school.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on results of a survey conducted on a sample of 1,010 Polish consumers. The questionnaire included items to identify food choice motives, attributes of organic food and barriers to buy organic products. The data collected was analyzed with SPSS 15.0 using descriptive statistics and carrying out two step cluster analysis to identify consumers' segments. To get better insight into factors decisive to organic food consumption, the segments were profiled according to declared consumption of organic food. Findings - Sensory factors were the most important motives for food choice, followed by price and safety. Consumers with convenience and price orientation in their food choices were less inclined to buy organic products while consumers open to novelties and willing to try new foods more often declared to buy organic products. Polish consumers conceptualize organic food referring to aspects such as healthiness and safety. Despite the developments observed in the organic food sector in Poland, the information related that barriers to buy organic food still prevail. Research limitations/implications - The choice of validated scale items related to food choice and food related lifestyle was limited and there is a need to further explore Polish consumers food related lifestyle and its relation to organic food consumption. Cluster analysis used to identify segments is a method not based on probabilistic statistics, so it is the researcher's interpretation that is most relevant. Originality/value - Prior research concerning Polish consumers food choices with relation to organic food consumption is very limited. Such information is particularly pertinent to food manufacturers and distributors to support developing communication strategies to stimulate organic food market development in Poland.","Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Fac Human Nutr & Consumer Sci, Dept Org & Econ, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Zakowska-Biemans, S (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Fac Human Nutr & Consumer Sci, Dept Org & Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",sylwia_zakowska_biemans@sggw.pl,,"Zakowska-Biemans, Sylwia/0000-0001-8225-6533",,,,,40,172,179,5,93,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

In such cases, channel members have to decide which firm will own the units until demand uncertainty is resolved. The decision about who should retain ownership depends on the balance of benefit and risk to each member. Ownership, after all, is costly. Whichever member owns the units accepts the risk of loss if more units are produced than can be sold. But ownership also grants firms the flexibility to respond to demand once it becomes known by adjusting price. In this study, we analyze ownership decisions in distribution channels and how those decisions are affected by demand uncertainty. We model demand based on micro-modeling of consumer utility functions and capture demand uncertainty related to market size and price sensitivity. This study shows that as long as the degree of uncertainty about market size is intermediate, the retailer and the manufacturer both benefit when the manufacturer maintains ownership of the units. But when there is substantial uncertainty about market size, the retailer and the channel are better off if the retailer takes ownership but the manufacturer still prefers to maintain ownership. Thus, there is potential for channel conflict regarding ownership under high levels of uncertainty. We show that, using product returns, the manufacturer can achieve the same outcome under retailer ownership as under manufacturer ownership. This provides an additional new rationale for the prevalence of product returns. The first-best outcome (from the perspective of total channel profit), however, is under retailer ownership without product returns when uncertainty is high (i.e., product returns reduce the total channel profit). Negotiations between the manufacturer and the retailer can lead to the first-best outcome but only under quite restrictive constraints that include direct side payments by the retailer to the manufacturer and the retailer being pessimistic about its outside option (when an agreement cannot be reached) during the negotiation.","[Koenigsberg, Oded] Columbia Univ, Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Biyalogorsky, Eyal] IDC, Arison Sch Business, IL-46150 Herzliyya, Israel",Columbia University; Reichman University,"Koenigsberg, O (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ebialogorsky@idc.ac.il; ok2018@columbia.edu,"Koenigsberg, Oded/C-8541-2014","Koenigsberg, Oded/0000-0002-0551-6829",,,,,26,11,11,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

For an effective consumer policy to reduce the environmental load from society, we need insight into the environmental load from consumption patterns.

Current methods for establishing this information about many consumer products do not combine process data with multiregional data. This paper aims to give more insight into the added value of using multiregional data and process data. It also proposes to combine both kinds of data into one application. The use of multiregional input-output data appears to be important to establish the total environmental load from consumption. Using multiregional data and process data both result in substantial changes in the estimated environmental load of consumption products on a more detailed level. The results indicate that using both multiregional and process data will improve the estimates of the environmental impacts of consumption patterns.

Profit sharing, annual bonuses, a pension fund, a reduction in work hours, and an annual party were all means to ensure a productive, trouble-free workforce. We investigate the reasons why Siemens and Halske introduced this internal welfare system. We focus on the by-far most expensive part of the welfare system: the pension fund introduced in 1872, more than a decade before the nationwide social security system was implemented in Germany. We find that the adoption of the internal welfare system increased labor productivity, and in addition discouraged workers from striking. We estimate that the company's gains due to strike prevention and higher productivity were at least as high as the cost of the pension fund. This suggests that (1) the introduction of a pension fund is not inconsistent with simple profit maximizing behavior on the firm's side and (2) increased labor unionization induced firms to introduce subjective components of workers' remuneration packages.","[Moore, Lyndon] Univ Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Kastl, Jakub] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Universite de Montreal; Stanford University,"Moore, L (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",lyndon.moore@umontreal.ca,,,,,,,50,7,7,0,16,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,OCT,2010,4.0,3,,,,,321,348,,10.1007/s11698-009-0048-x,0.0,,,28,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,642SS,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000281238300004,0

Under the Madrid Protocol, all activities subject to advance notice reporting obligations under the 1959 Antarctic Treaty are required to undergo prior Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). The highest level EIA-termed a Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation (CEE)-requires international scrutiny. This is the only form of EIA where such scrutiny occurs and the only context under the Madrid Protocol or any other part of the ATS where the proposed actions of State Parties, or operators subject to their jurisdiction, are subject to formal international review. Whilst this review does not provide a veto, it has been viewed as an important development in the Antarctic multilateral regime. To date, there have been 19 CEEs. This article reviews the Antarctic CEE process and evaluates its application in practice against the environmental obligations established in the Protocol. Whilst most CEEs are substantial documents and processes, which have raised the standard of environmental care in the area, there are significant generic limitations. Not one CEE appears to have led to substantial modification of the activity as first elaborated by the proponent, let alone a decision not to proceed with the activity, despite this being a mandatory consideration. There are indications that the imperatives in the CEE process are often administrative and diplomatic rather than environmental and that notwithstanding the international scrutiny of draft CEEs, state action may not be significantly changed. Suggestions are made on improvements to the CEE process. The Madrid Protocol is a framework convention, designed so that its technical annexes, including that addressing EIA, may be periodically updated. Twelve years after its entry into force, and almost 20 years after its adoption, such updating may now be useful.","[Kriwoken, Lorne K.] Univ Tasmania, Antarctic Climate & Ecosyst Cooperat Res Ctr, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Kriwoken, Lorne K.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Geog & Environm Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Hemmings, Alan D.] Univ Canterbury, Gateway Antarctic Ctr Antarctic Studies & Res, Christchurch 8020, New Zealand",University of Tasmania; Antarctic Climate & Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre (ACE CRC); University of Tasmania; University of Canterbury,"Kriwoken, LK (通讯作者)，Univ Tasmania, Antarctic Climate & Ecosyst Cooperat Res Ctr, Private Bag 78, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",ahe30184@bigpond.net.au; l.k.kriwoken@utas.edu.au,,,,,,,46,22,27,0,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

But, given the higher margins for private labels and potential bargaining benefits for retailers, they have incentives to help private labels gain market share. The paper addresses two questions: First, do private labels enhance a retailer's bargaining power with respect to manufacturers? Second, given the higher profitability and potential increase in bargaining power, does the retailer strategically set retail prices to favor and strengthen the private label? We find support for the bargaining power hypothesis, but qualified support for the strategic retailer pricing hypothesis. Retailers gain bargaining power through lower wholesale prices on imitated national brands. But the gain is greater in niche categories than in mass categories, suggesting that niche national brands with limited pull power lose greater bargaining power. In terms of strategic pricing, the retailer, on initially introducing the private label, strategically sets prices to help private labels gain market share in high volume mass market categories. But retail prices revert to the category profit maximizing price after a year when the private label gains a stable market share.","[Meza, Sergio] Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Sudhir, K.] Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",University of Toronto; Yale University,"Meza, S (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, 105 St George St, Toronto, ON, Canada.",Sergio.meza@rotman.utoronto.ca; k.sudhir@yale.edu,"Sudhir, K./A-1616-2012",,,,,,40,75,97,3,43,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

Longstanding initiatives with local organic food systems and Ecological Recycling Agriculture (ERA) in the eight EU-countries in the Baltic Sea drainage area were evaluated during 2001-2004. The empirical results were scaled up to calculate environmental impact and food production for three different scenarios. In one scenario the Baltic Countries and Poland convert their agriculture following the average Swedish production. This resulted in 58% increase of nitrogen and 18% increase in phosphorus surplus, a corresponding increase in the load to the Baltic Sea and increased food production. In two other scenarios agriculture production in the whole Baltic Sea drainage area converts to ERA. This halved the nitrogen surplus from agriculture and eliminated the surplus of phosphorus. In these scenarios food production would decrease or remain stable depending on strategy chosen. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Its main research question concerns the association of social responsibility and environmental management with economic performance, determinants of the latter and possible moderation effects. Based on data collected from financial databases and Kinder Lydenberg Domini for the period 1992 to 2003, the paper analyses the link of corporate sustainability performance with economic performance using panel estimation techniques. The analysis shows that advertising intensity moderates the association of corporate sustainability performance and economic performance as measured by Tobin's q. For research and development efforts relative to firm size, no moderating role on the link between corporate sustainability and economic performance is identified. A sensitivity analysis using separate measures for social and environmental performance reveals that the latter only has a direct effect and the former only a fully moderated effect on economic performance. Policy and management implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 90: 47-45]) in examining food consumption patterns and arable land requirements of Guyuan District, a remote rural area of western China. Population growth and rapid economic development have increasingly been reducing the land available for primary production, creating potentially serious risks for China's food security. Land required to produce food is determined by population size, consumption patterns, land resource endowment - or agro-ecological conditions and the level of farm intensification. Per capita land requirements in Guyuan District were identified to meet basic consumption needs, and to evaluate nutritional conditions related to current consumption patterns. Data used for this analysis were obtained from surveys of household food consumption. Food consumption involved only meeting basic requirements for sustenance, with grains, potatoes, vegetables, fruits, and plant oils being the most commonly consumed foods. Per capita intake of calories totaled 11.1 MJ.day(-1), matching the recommended level for China to meet basic health requirements. Daily protein intake was 66.8 g.person(-1).day(-1), being below the recommended standard of 77 g.person(-1)-day(-1). Of this total, protein from animal meat accounted for only 7.5% of total protein. Fat intake totaled only 47.4 g.person(-1).day(-1), being far below the standard of 70 g.person(-1).day(-1). Yet, farmers must sell their limited livestock to earn enough income to meet their daily consumption needs. This expenditure accounted for nearly 33% of mean annual household income, so only 28% of domestic animal products were consumed locally.

Britain's indigo market, however, boomed in wartime on the bases of prize indigo captured from France and Spain and of indigo imported from South Carolina. The rise of South Carolina's trade from the mid-1740s was not caused, as the historiography claims, by its monopoly of the British market-such a monopoly never existed-but because the depression in South Carolina's major staple, rice, compelled a remodelling of the South Carolina plantation system, which produced an elastic supply of indigo. Carolina indigo was blighted by a poor reputation, not, as is usually argued, because British merchants maligned unfairly its quality, but because Carolina planters failed to achieve consistent production standards. Carolina indigo nevertheless succeeded in displacing French and Spanish indigo in the British and in some continental markets, reflecting the demand for cheap dyestuffs from manufacturers of low-cost textiles, the fastest-growing sectors of the European textile industries at the onset of industrialization.","Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Nash, RC (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",,,,,,,,143,14,25,1,14,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0117,,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

I find evidence that urban hospitals were able to shift part of the burden of Medicare payment reduction onto private payers. However, the overall estimated degree of cost shifting is small and varies according to a hospital's share of private patients. At hospitals where Medicare is a small payer relative to private insurers, up to 37% of BBA cuts was transferred to private payers through higher payments. In contrast, hospitals with greater reliance on Medicare were more financially distressed, as these hospitals saw large BBA cuts but were limited in their abilities to cost shift.","[Wu, Vivian Y.] Univ So Calif, Sch Policy Planning & Dev, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Wu, Vivian Y.] RAND, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California; RAND Corporation,"Wu, VY (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Sch Policy Planning & Dev, 650 Childs Way,RGL 305, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",vivianwu@usc.edu,,,,,,,43,25,33,1,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

Despite their sound critiques of that theory, ecological economists have not settled on an alternative theory of human behavior. As a potential alternative, Norgaard's socioecological coevolutionary framework remains underspecified in terms of variation, heredity, and selection. I review concepts and insights on human behavior from evolutionary biology and evolutionary social science in order to supply new theoretical tools for ecological economic problems, and help refine the coevolutionary framework. I argue that a synthetic evolutionary theory of human behavior provides a sufficient alternative to the neoclassical perspective, and that cultural evolutionary theory is a necessary prerequisite of a mature economic science, ecological, coevolutionary or otherwise. Finally, I suggest some potential topics that such a mature theory might begin to tackle. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The new EERE methodology was designed to answer the following questions about the EERE programs: To what extent have the programs thus far produced economic benefits in terms of resource savings relative to program costs? To what extent have the programs yielded environmental benefits, with a focus on health benefits from reduced air emissions? To what extent have the programs yielded energy security benefits in terms of reducing imported oil and reducing threats to the US energy infrastructure? To what extent have the programs built a knowledge base within each respective field and outside those fields? What has been the return on public investments in these energy programs thus far?

Data from a pilot after-school program indicated that graham snacks, containing 5 g whole wheat per serving, were consumed in the range of 73-88 percent, similar to the refined grain counterpart. This paper aims to examine whether a full serving (16 g) of whole grain delivered in a graham snack is acceptable as tested among children participating in an after-school snack program. Design/methodology/approach - Subjects included 100 children (grades K-6) participating in after-school snack programs. Over eight weeks, children were offered graham snacks containing 5, 8, 12, and 16 g whole wheat flour per 30 g serving. Plate waste was used to measure graham snack consumption, as children placed their unfinished snacks in a receptacle and waste was measured after each session. At week nine, a subgroup of children participated in taste tests and rated each snack for liking on a nine-point hedonic scale. Another subgroup was enrolled in group interviews to provide input about their perceptions of 'the products' quality and suggestions for improvement. Findings - Consumption for the 5, 8, 12, and 16 g graham snacks was 80, 76, 79, and 80 percent, respectively. The taste tests results showed no significant difference in rating of the four-graham snacks. The focus groups indicated that overall, the products are well-liked, particularly for texture. Originality/value - This paper suggests that graham snacks can contribute a significant dietary source, nearly one full serving of whole grain when offered in children's natural environment through an after-school snack program.","[Sadeghi, Leila; Marquart, Len F.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Food Sci & Nutr, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Marquart, LF (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Food Sci & Nutr, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",lmarquar@umn.edu,,,,,,,54,7,7,0,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The data's statistical descriptions and regression estimate show the following results: 1) the 77.64% of employers have labor demand, and the available vacancies of these sample units accounts for 93.29% of the total available jobs. Though there are a great number of small businesses, their employment intake capacities are not strong. The larger the enterprises, the more staff they employ. 2) Characteristics of enterprises, agencies and industries together impact on job vacancy incidence and job vacancy rates. 3) The research data over government organs, public institutions, enterprises prove that most of public institutions shall hire new staff every year, but enterprises have the least willingness to hire new employees. However, the data of Beijing show that ratio of agencies having labor demands far bigger than the survey data of the USA, the UK, and Canada. 4) There is a positive correlation between the hiring scale and job vacancy incidence, while there is a negative correlation between the qualification vacancy rate and the hiring scale. 5) The higher the labor turnover rate in agencies, the higher the job vacancy incidences and the vacancy rates are. 6) The 98.39% of institutions with prospects have labor needs, and 39.53% of agencies declining say they will hire new staff. 7) After decomposing the Theil Index which reflects the gaps among vacancy rates, the differences among vacancy rates of different agencies are mainly from the inner causes of various groups, and the intergroup reasons are not main ones.","[Tang Kuang; Qu Haihui] Renmin Univ China, Sch Labor & Human Resources, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,,tangkuang@sina.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,5,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-1-921712-15-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,182,194,,,,,,13,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BYE76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298265500033,0

The validation with trial data gained by setting cultivars and sowing experiments in Xinjiang Shihezi (44 degrees 26'N, 86 degrees 01'E) and Hejing (42 degrees 19'N, 86 degrees 24'E) of China showed that this model had a good predictability and practicability.","[Wang Jichuan; Yu Jun; Gao Shan] Tarim Univ, Coll Plant Sci, Alar 843300, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Yuan Jie] Xinjiang Acad Agr Sci, Inst Ind Crops, Urumqi, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Ma Fuyu] Xinjiang Prod & Construct Crops, Key Lab Oasis Ecol Agr, Shihezi 832003, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Ma Fuyu] Shihezi Univ, Coll Agron, Shihezi 832003, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Chen Yuanliang] Inst Vegetable Sci, Shihezi, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [He Wei] Xinjiang Prod & Construct Crops, Agr Div 2, 223Farm, Hejing 841300, Xinjiang, Peoples R China",Tarim University; Xinjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Shihezi University,"Wang, JC (通讯作者)，Tarim Univ, Coll Plant Sci, Alar 843300, Xinjiang, Peoples R China.",wjcwzy@126.com,"zhang, weijie/JQX-1450-2023",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [30560068]; Scientific and Technical Program of Tackling Key Problem of Xinjiang Production and Construction Crops [04GG06]; Special Fund Project for Outstanding Scholar of Shihezi University [RCZX200522],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Scientific and Technical Program of Tackling Key Problem of Xinjiang Production and Construction Crops; Special Fund Project for Outstanding Scholar of Shihezi University,"This work was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China(No. 30560068), Scientific and Technical Program of Tackling Key Problem of Xinjiang Production and Construction Crops (No.04GG06), the Special Fund Project for Outstanding Scholar of Shihezi University (No.RCZX200522).

Ten fish were sampled randomly pre-transport and at 0, 4, 12, 24, 48 and 96 h post-transport, respectively. After transport stress, the superoxide dismutase (SOD), lysozyme (LZM) and complement C3 decreased sharply by 60%, 82% and 87% at 0 h post-transport, respectively. The SOD and LZM recovered to pre-transport levels 96 h post-transport. The complement C3 maintained at low level during post-transport observation, being 75% lower than that of pre-transport. Transport caused a transient decrease in malondidehyde (MDA) during 12 hours post-transport. The catlase (CAT) declined significantly, reached the lowest value at 12 h (decreased by 77%) post-transport, and restored to pre-transport level at 48 h post-transport. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) peaked at 0 h post-transport (increased by 2.4-fold) then decreased gradually, restored to pre-transport level at 48 h post-transport. The glutathione (GSH) rose continuously, peaked at 48 h post-transport (increased by 2.7-fold). The GSH may be an offset of decreased SOD and CAT activities, and played an important role in reducing oxidative stress. Suppressed SOD, CAT, LZM and complement C3 levels following transport stress suggested a possible increased susceptibility to bacterial infections after stress. At least 96 hours of recovery time was needed for C. semilaevis fry after long-time commercial transport.","[Wang Qingkui] Ocean Univ China, Minist Educ, Key Lab Mariculture, 5 Yu Shan Rd, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China; [Wang Qingkui; Chen Chengxun; Sun Xueliang; Xing Kezhi] Tianjin Agr Univ, Tianjin Key Lab Aquaecol & Aquaculture, Dept Fishery Sci, Tianjin 300384, Peoples R China",Ocean University of China; Tianjin Agricultural University,"Wang, QK (通讯作者)，Ocean Univ China, Minist Educ, Key Lab Mariculture, 5 Yu Shan Rd, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China.",wqkmail@yahoo.com.cn,"xing, k/JEP-6928-2023; Sun, Xueliang/C-7257-2012","Sun, Xueliang/0000-0003-0374-1245","National High-Tech Research and Development Program of China [2007AA10Z232361, 2007AA10Z23236103]; National Spark Program of China [2007EA610021]; scientific program of Tianjin city [07ZHXHNC05400, 08JCYBJC27800, 033121411]",National High-Tech Research and Development Program of China(National High Technology Research and Development Program of China); National Spark Program of China; scientific program of Tianjin city,"This work was financially supported by National High-Tech Research and Development Program of China (2007AA10Z232361; 2007AA10Z23236103), National Spark Program of China (2007EA610021) and scientific program of Tianjin city (07ZHXHNC05400; 08JCYBJC27800; 033121411).

Hedonic pricing studies, predominantly for the US, have assessed the spatial incidence of risk and the associated implicit price of flood risk. Using these implicit price estimates and their associated standard errors, we perform a meta-analysis and find that an increase in the probability of flood risk of 0.01 in a year is associated to a difference in transaction price of an otherwise similar house of -0.6%. The actual occurrence of a flooding event or increased stringency in disclosure rules causes ex-ante prices to differ from ex-post prices, but these effects are small. The marginal willingness to pay for reduced risk exposure has increased over time, and it is slightly lower for areas with a higher per capita income. We show that obfuscating amenity effects and risk exposure associated with proximity to water causes systematic bias in the implicit price of flood risk. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This study presents a global estimate of net primary production (NPP) losses caused by human-induced dryland degradation. Due to the large uncertainties related to international databases on dryland degradation, we compiled a world map of the extent and degree of desertification based on existing regional and global maps. Two distinct approaches were followed in order to estimate NPP losses due to degradation on drylands: in the first approach, we combined these maps with model results on global potential NPP, determined with the LPJ-DGVM, with a set of factors on NPP losses per degradation degree, derived from the literature. In a second approach, we made use of spatially explicit information on potential and current NPP of agricultural areas obtained from a global HANPP assessment [Haberl, H., Erb, K.-H., Krausmann, F., Gaube, V., Bondeau, A.. Plutzar, C., Gingrich, S., Lucht, W. and Fischer-Kowalski, M., 2007. Quantifying and mapping the human appropriation of net primary production in earth's terrestrial ecosystems. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 104: 12942-12947.]. We used the difference between potential and current NPP on croplands situated in drylands in order to quantify the effect of dryland degradation on NPP. NPP losses were found to range between 799 and 1936 Tg C/yr in the first approach, and to amount to 965 Tg C/yr in the second approach. overall, approximately 2% of the global terrestrial NPP are lost each year due to dryland degradation, or between 4% and 10% of the potential NPP in drylands. NPP losses amount to 20-40% of the potential NPP on degraded agricultural areas in the global average and above 55% in some world regions. The results reveal that the contributions of dryland degradation to the total HANPP in drylands is of similar dimension than the overall annual socioeconomic biomass harvest. Accordingly, strategies aimed at reducing dryland degradation could present promising options to sustain future population numbers without putting further pressures on dryland ecosystems.

Three aspects of the epidemiology of measles are discussed: the synchronization of epidemic waves, seasonality, and age at infection. These epidemiological analyses are connected to, respectively, regional integration, governmental policy on primary school education, and the number of young children in families. In addition, based on the fact that measles did not become endemic in early modern Edo (Tokyo), this article corrects epidemiologists' misunderstanding about the threshold of endemicity and argues that the critical population size varied substantially according to the societal factors of a given community. In so doing, this article suggests that historians can use measles data as a new biometric index for studying human health and socio-economic conditions in societies of the past.","Keio Univ, Tokyo 108, Japan",Keio University,"Suzuki, A (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Tokyo 108, Japan.",,"Suzuki, Akihito/AAE-9583-2022; Suzuki, Akihito/ACM-6115-2022",,,,,,66,5,6,0,7,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0117,,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

In this policy, landowners receive payments from an environmental agency in exchange for land use practices that contribute to the supply of biodiversity. This approach may result in a conservation network which does not cover all focal ecological characteristics, because landowners determine the supply of potential targets. In addition, the contracts are typically allocated by using a scoring method that is not giving information on the representativeness of the species composition of the sites. In this study, we investigated what is the performance of a voluntary conservation program in selecting sites that would maximize the number of specific target species in the selected conservation network subject to a given budget constraint. We focused on the Finnish pilot program named Trading in Natural Values (TNV). Our data consisted of 56 mature stands covering both stands that were offered to the TNV program and stands that were not offered. All the stands were surveyed for specific groups of wood-inhabiting fungi and epiphytic lichens that can be considered as good surrogates for forest species diversity. Our results showed that the participation in the TNV program was large enough to meet the ecological goals, because the offered targets uncovered only two of the 73 surveyed species. and the cost-effective conservation network included only a few targets that were not offered in the pilot program. However, the contract allocation method used in the TNV could be improved, because many ecologically valuable targets that were offered to the program were not accepted. In general, it could be justified to survey some indicator species, which would be relatively easy to identify, to maximize species coverage in contract allocation. Surveying indicator species causes some extra costs, but these are likely to be minor compared with the costs savings in opportunity costs, due to the improved targeting of protected areas.

Hence, fuel choices by steam plants are key determinants of the industry's impact on national and global greenhouse gas emissions. and key foci for climate change policy. Yet, little research has been done to examine the economic and environmental tradeoffs among the different types of fuels that are used by these plants. This paper applies a Data Envelopment Analysis procedure that incorporates the materials balance principle to estimate the allocations of coal, gas and oil inputs that minimize carbon emissions and costs. Using EIA 906 and FERC 423 data, the paper estimates cost/carbon tradeoffs facing two sets of plants: those that use coal and gas inputs, and those that use coal. gas and oil inputs. Findings for our three-input sample show that there would be a 79% increase in cost for moving from the cost-efficient point to the carbon efficient point, while there would be a 38% increase in carbon for moving from the carbon efficient point to the cost-efficient point. These conclusions indicate that, in general, the gap between efficient cost and efficient environmental production is wide, and would require substantial policy intervention, technological change or market adjustment before it could be narrowed. However, our examination of individual plants shows that what is true in general is often not true for specific plants. Some plants that are currently less efficient than those on the production frontier could produce the same amount of electricity with less carbon output and less fuel input. Additionally, many plants on the production frontier could improve both cost and carbon efficiency by changing their mixture of fossil-fuel inputs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, there is little systematic analysis in the literature that explains the way social capital aids in fostering collective action. The paper integrates ideas from institutional ecological economics, sociology and anthropology to argue that power relations, involving struggle and resistance, should be acknowledged as they affect collective action. We address the question of why social capital should not be straightforwardly associated positively with common property resource management. To unravel the complexity of the links between social capital, collective action and common property resource management, the concepts of common knowledge and symbolic power are introduced.

Most virtual water literature has focused on quantifying virtual water flows and on its application to ensure water and food security. Nevertheless, the analysis of the potential gains from international trade, at least from a water resources perspective, needs to take into account both spatial and temporal variations of blue (groundwater and stream flow) and green (soil moisture) water, as well as the socioeconomic and policy conditions. This paper evaluates whether Spanish international trade with grains is consistent with relative water scarcity. For this purpose, the study estimates the volume and economic value of virtual water flow through international grain trade for the period 1997-2005, which includes 3 years with different rainfall levels. The calculations show that Spain is a net virtual water importer through international grain trade. The volume of net virtual water imports amounts to 3420, 4383 and 8415 million m(3) in wet (1997), medium (1999) and dry (2005) years, respectively. Valuing blue water at its shadow price or scarcity value, blue water exports oscillate between 0.7 and 34.2 million Euros for a wet and dry year, respectively. Overall, grain trade is apparently consistent with relative water scarcity as net imports increase in dry years. However, the evolution of grain exports, expressed as a variation in quantity and volume, does not match the variations in resource scarcity. A disaggregated crop analysis reveals that there are other factors, such as quality, product specialization or the demand for a standardized product, which also influence trade decisions and are not included in the notion of virtual water. These facts, among others, can therefore create potential distortions in the application of virtual water to the analysis of specific trade patterns. Nevertheless, from a water resources perspective, virtual water can bring important insights across countries for improving water and land management globally, fostering adaptation strategies to climate change and to transboundary resource management.

To address the dynamic dimension of the problem we consider tradable development rights as the instrument of choice. A particular challenge in applying tradable development rights is that the conservation benefit of an individual habitat patch depends on its spatial relationship with other habitat patches and thus is an emergent rather than a fixed property. We analyse with a conceptual model the spatial and temporal dynamics of habitats in a region under a tradable development rights market that takes spatial interaction of habitats explicitly into account. In our analysis two different outcomes may emerge depending on the levels of spatial interaction and cost heterogeneity: an ordered structure where habitat patches are clustered in space and are stable over time, and a disordered structure where habitat patches are scattered in space and subject to high turnover of destruction and recreation, A high level of spatial interaction or a low level of cost heterogeneity favours an ordered structure while a low level of spatial interaction or a high level of cost heterogeneity favours a disordered structure.

Food security is directly affected by climate change effects that lead to concerns in rural livelihoods. Bio-energy developments present both opportunities and challenges for socioeconomic development and the environment. In that sense, bio-energy solutions should strive to be environmentally sensitive and have a positive social impact. On the other side, trade policy enforced via World Trade Organisation (WTO) is expected to play a role in mitigating and adapting to global climate change by increasing incentives to use the most energy efficient environmental goods and services. The recent food and financial crises developed from different underlying causes but intertwined in complex ways through their implications for financial and economic stability, food security, and political security. As the majority of the poor in the world are considered to be depended on agriculture, the severeness of the climate change effects may lead to food system risks and more of the societal and political risks can be incurred in the future. The potential of food price volatility and climate change leading a rise in food insecurity among the poor groups is significant, and thus, can be expected to bring social disturbances and terrorism in the short to long term. Food security is a hot topic. Therefore, its disruption via environmental breakdown is an obvious cause for terrorism. Although the biotechnology revolution is very relevant to the problems of food security, poverty reduction, and environmental conservation in the developing world, it raises many questions relating to ethics, intellectual property rights, and bio-safety. Some policy alternatives for environment friendly support of food security consist in increasing productivity on the non-forest fertile soils and in animal production systems or to reduce postharvest losses, providing greater incentives for agriculture to use water more efficiently, promoting larger investments in agricultural research to raise production with environment friendly techniques. Global environmental change (GEC) will have serious consequences for food security, particularly for more vulnerable groups. Adapting to the additional threats to food security arising from major environmental changes requires an integrated food system approach, not just a focus on agricultural practices. In this respect, vulnerability assessment could help to address food supply-chain security by determining the selection of countermeasures and emergency responses.","[Alpas, Hami] Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Food Engn, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey; [Kiymaz, Taylan] State Planning Org, Ankara, Turkey",Middle East Technical University,"Alpas, H (通讯作者)，Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Food Engn, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey.",imah@metu.edu.tr,"Alpas, Hami/A-1457-2017","Alpas, Hami/0000-0002-7683-8796",,,,,29,1,1,2,58,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1871-4668,,978-94-007-0227-1,NATO SCI PEACE SECUR,NATO Sci.

Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative data were collected through six focus group discussions, three in Spain and three in Belgium. In each country, one group consisted of heavy users while two groups included light users. Findings - The same attitudinal motives and barriers for fish consumption can be found in both countries and across user groups, even though fish consumption levels differ considerably. The main motives for eating fish are health and taste, while the main barriers are price perception, smell when cooking fish, and that fish does not deliver the same level of satiety as compared to meat, Big differences are found between countries and user groups with respect to preparation skills and the use of quality cues. Heavy users are very skilled in evaluating fish quality, especially those in Spain,,while light users, especially those in Belgium, make seemingly irrational assumptions when evaluating the quality of fish. Research limitations/implications - This study is based on qualitative focus group discussions in two European countries only. Originality/value - This study explores and compares motives, barriers and quality evaluation among heavy and light fish consumers in two European countries.

Second, it aims to identify segments based on animal and fish welfare issues, environmental concerns and ambivalence about farmed fish. Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire was designed to investigate consumers' concern for environmental and animal and fish welfare issues together with variables used in profiling segments in the study. The measurement scales used here are adapted from validated scales in previous studies. The survey was conducted in Valencia, Spain, among 450 randomly-chosen respondents. Findings - Animal welfare issues related to fanned fish do not seem to be important for the consumers in Valencia. There are, however, differences among the consumers relating to general environmental and animal welfare concern, and ambivalence. Three segments were identified: the unconcerned (27 per cent), the wild fish concerned (34.5 per cent) and the ambivalent (38.5 per cent). Attitudes toward farmed fish, the importance of natural food and social class were most important in profiling differences between clusters. Practical implications - The findings indicate that the animal welfare issue has not yet become a barrier for farmed fish in Valencia. The results may help fish-fanning companies to find their target group among the consumers, based on environmental and animal welfare issues. The results also indicate that there are consumers who are somewhat ambivalent about farmed fish. For this group, more information and knowledge can change their attitudes so they become more positive toward fanned fish in the future. Originality/value - The paper provides useful information for fish-farming companies or the authorities planning healthy-eating campaigns targeting fish.","[Honkanen, Pirjo] Nofima Market Food Fisheries & Aquaculture Res, Tromso, Norway; [Olsen, Svein Ottar] Univ Tromso, Norwegian Coll Fishery Sci, Tromso, Norway",Nofima; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Honkanen, P (通讯作者)，Nofima Market Food Fisheries & Aquaculture Res, Tromso, Norway.",pirjo.honkanen@fiskeriforskning.no,,,SEAFOODplus [FOOD-CT-2004-506359]; European Union,SEAFOODplus; European Union(European Union (EU)),"This work was performed within the integrated research project SEAFOODplus, contract No. FOOD-CT-2004-506359.

However, wheat flour contains 8-12 per cent protein and is limited in essential amino acid, so supplementation of partially defatted soy dhal, sorghum, rice, maize and pearl millet will help to improve the nutritional value of chapatis. This paper seeks to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach - Wheat flour was supplemented with salt-treated partially defatted soy dhal, sorghum, rice, maize and pearl millet (50:10:10:10:10:10). Different salt treatments were given to soy dhal so as to remove its typical beany flavour. Different flours were mixed with water to form dough followed by preparation of chapati on flat iron plates. These were further evaluated organoleptically by the panel of judges. On the basis of organoleptic evaluation the best combination was used for nutritional evaluation. Findings - Organoleptic evaluation of developed chapatis indicated that they were acceptable in terms of various sensory parameters. Nutritional evaluation of unprocessed composite flour, wheat flour chapatis and composite flour chapatis revealed a significant increase in moisture and protein content and non-significant difference in ash and crude fibre contents of composite flour chapatis when compared with unprocessed composite flour and wheat flour chapatis. Various processing methods, namely dough making and roasting involved in chapati making, significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the phytic (11 per cent) and polyphenol (64 per cent) content of the developed chapati compared with unprocessed composite flour. As a result the protein and starch digestibility of the developed chapati was improved over the unprocessed composite flour. Research limitations/implications - Further research is needed regarding the amino acid profile of the developed chapati. Practical implications - Wheat flour should be supplemented with different cereals so as to improve the nutritional value. Originality/value - The paper has significance in terms of improving the nutritional quality of the chapati without any extra input of time and energy.","[Khetarpaul, Neelam; Goyal, Rajni] CCS Haryana Agr Univ, Dept Foods & Nutr, Hisar, Haryana, India",CCS Haryana Agricultural University,"Goyal, R (通讯作者)，CCS Haryana Agr Univ, Dept Foods & Nutr, Hisar, Haryana, India.",shubji_rgoyal@yahoo.co.in,"Goyal, Dr. Rajni/AAW-5470-2021",,ICAR,ICAR(Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)),The authors thank ICAR for financial support under the NATP scheme on Enhanching utilization of soybean through development of value added food products to undertake this research.,,30,6,7,0,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

B. Smith; plant tissue culture; rapid clonal propagation; composites; natural fibers; curaua,,"The world is changing quickly and there is a prediction that we could need options for renewable materials to replace the ones from fossil sources. For energy there are many more alternatives than for materials. Natural fibers play an important role in this context, mainly in tropical countries. In many of these there is lack of new jobs, especially in the rural sector of developing countries, where there already are economically deprived areas, resulting in increasing problems in urban zones, mainly related to waste disposal, pollution and destruction of natural resources. In this context a new concept called ecomenes was developed: the use of natural resources based on an ecological intuition of non linear biological processes. It is placed in between the extrativism - low pressure over natural resources - and the economics - high pressure over the ecosystem, making money at any cost. The resulting approach based on ecomenia relates to processes of low environmental impacts and hence good sustainability. Crop fibers can be an alternative to keep local populations in the regions where they grow these plants, preventing rural exodus. The productive chain for crop fibers can represent as many as five jobs per hectare. South America is a key supplier of natural fibers due to its environmental conditions as well as the traditional uses of native plants in artcraft, medicine and agroindustrial applications. Curaua (Ananas erectifolius L.B. Smith) is a bromeliacea originated from the Brazilian Amazon with great potentiality for fiber production of excellent quality. It is largely used in the automotive industry due its resistance, softness and reduced weight. Moreover, its inflorescence present values for the production of cut-flowers and landscape-gardening. The objective of this work was to develop the curaua production chain for some by-products including fibers, flowers and bromeline enzyme.","[Leao, A. L.; Machado, I. S.; de Souza, S.

Although now widely used, these technologies have been known to cause unintentional effects, such as increases in stress in those being observed. Further advancements in technology lead us towards the 'pervasive era' of computing, where a new means of monitoring ubiquitously becomes possible. This monitoring differs from existing methods in its distinct lack in physical boundaries. To address the effects of this kind of monitoring, we propose a model consisting of a series of factors identified in the monitoring and pervasive literature believed to influence behaviour. The aim of the model is to understand and predict behaviour, thereby preventing any potential undesirable side effects. Various socio-technical frameworks have been proposed to guide research within ubiquitous computing; in this paper we use the semiotic framework to analyse our model in order to better understand and explain the behavioural impact of ubiquitous monitoring.","[Moran, Stuart; Nakata, Keiichi] Univ Reading, Informat Res Ctr, Reading RG6 6WB, Berks, England",University of Reading,,stuart.moran@reading.ac.uk; k.nakata@henley.reading.ac.uk,,"Nakata, Keiichi/0000-0002-7986-6012; Moran, Stuart/0000-0001-8753-7377",,,,,25,2,2,0,0,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9806057-2-3,,,,2009,,,,,,,449,456,,,,,,8,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BKK53,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268388300059,0

Design/methodology/approach - A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data from 305 German students between the ages of 18 to 24 years. Findings - It was found that students who lived in the family home consumed more helpings of both fruit and vegetables each day, compared with young adults who lived independently. Further, higher proportions of dependent students ate more servings of every food group each day compared with their independent counterparts. It was also found that there is a significant difference in mood, weight concern and attitudes towards healthy eating between students under 21-years-old and those above 21-years-old. Research limitations/implications - The research was a cross-sectional study of a selected group of German university students from a single campus that was based on a quota sample and assessed self-reported behaviour on a self-administered questionnaire. While the limitations associated with these aspects of research design affect the generalizability of the findings, they, nonetheless, do not detract from the strengths and novelty of the research. Practical implications - In terms of education, campaigns may consider focusing on improving the attitude toward healthy eating among young German adults who live in a dependent arrangement within the family home, perhaps encouraging the young adult to be an influencer in food purchases. Furthermore, it is suggested that social marketing campaigns that educate young adults about food-related activities, such as budgeting, preparation and cooking, in readiness for, or in the early stages of, their transition to independent living would yield positive results. The motivation component of social marketing may also be informed by the research findings. Specifically, persuasive messages that correspond with Sheth and Frazier's inducement process may encourage healthier eating. Originality/value - Being a relatively unexplored area, the findings are novel and provide valuable insights for the implementation of an inducement process for planned social change as well as informing the education and motivation elements of intervention strategies.","[Sharma, Bishnu; Harker, Michael; Harker, Debra] Univ Sunshine Coast, Manoochydore S, Qld, Australia; [Reinhard, Karin] Univ Cooperat Educ, Dept Int Business, Ravensburg, Germany",University of the Sunshine Coast,"Harker, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sunshine Coast, Manoochydore S, Qld, Australia.",dharker@usc.edu.au,,,,,,,57,11,12,1,34,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

A total of 296 F-1 hybrids were produced from direct cross breeding of 'Queen' x 'Smooth Cayenne' and 131 F-1 hybrids from reciprocal crosses. However, no seeds were obtained from selfing of either cultivar. Ten F-1 hybrids with superior characteristics were selected from the crosses. After further evaluation of those hybrids from 2002 to 2006, the hybrids HQC34 and RC212 were selected. The two hybrids have good agronomic characteristics and yield, showed resistance to root rot and had fruits of good quality. Plants of the two hybrids have been propagated using tissue culture. In the heredity study, the ratios of 162: 134 were observed for spiny vs. smooth leaf types for the 'Queen' x 'Smooth Cayenne' crosses and 71: 60 for piping leaf types were observed for the 'Smooth Cayenne' x 'Queen' crosses. Neither ratio was significant by the chi-square test based on a 1: 1 hypothesis.

Design/methodology/approach - Food choice view concerning school meals, previous studies on developing school meals, and the plate model are briefly illustrated. The empirical data were collected in 2007 from four comprehensive schools. A total of 168 6th-9th graders and their 83 parents returned the questionnaires. Findings - The findings indicate that the pupils do not eat all the items of the plate model. The pupils and their parents gave the following suggestions on how to develop free school meals: more favourite dishes; more alternatives from which to choose; salads to be served as components; wider selection of salads; chilled milk, lactose-free and fat-free milk served with soft white bread, brown bread as well as rolls; finally, serve different components such as cold cuts on the bread. Practical implications - The practical implications are that the pupils' and the parents' desires and wishes could be consulted more often and the municipal budget should be taken into account. Originality/value - The pupils' self-reported school meal consumption patterns indicate that the intake of the items belonging to the plate model could be increased by serving the pupils' favourite dishes, which could be of great importance to those in charge of health education and school catering organisations.","[Tikkanen, Irma] Univ Kuopio, Dept Business & Management, FIN-70211 Kuopio, Finland; [Tikkanen, Irma] Laurea Univ Appl Sci, Espoo, Finland",University of Eastern Finland; Laurea University of Applied Sciences,"Tikkanen, I (通讯作者)，Univ Kuopio, Dept Business & Management, FIN-70211 Kuopio, Finland.",irma.tikkanen2@taloverkot.fi,,,,,,,18,3,3,0,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Quantifying and summarizing total human labor-energy input and total caloric energy output, we demonstrate that a successfully designed farm can produce a positive energy-return-on-investment (EROI) leaving excess caloric energy available for building economic-community structures (e.g., schools and hospitals). Farm products with negative EROI must be coupled with other products with positive EROI to assure nutritionally balanced diets are maintained while still achieving an overall positive EROI for the total agroecological operation. We show that similar to the ecosystem, energy budgets are tight which makes for difficult decisions on diet, farm plot diversity, and energy profitability for future growth. Considering the totality of this low energy agro-system based economy, we simplify many operational variables into a unique graphical solution space, which reveals both reasonable expectations of agroecological EROI performance, and extreme asymptotes, beyond which indicate regions of system failure.

This model proposes a mechanism explaining why and how they are of importance, distinguishing between high- and low-educated parents. We then bring this model to the data using a longitudinal dataset in Britain. The available information on social housing in big cities allows us to identify the role of neighborhood in educational outcomes. We find that the better the quality of the neighborhood, the higher is the parents' involvement in their children's education.

The new borders after 1918 are typically viewed as detrimental to the region's economic integration and development. We argue that this view lacks historical perspective. It fails to take into account that the new borders followed a pattern of economic fragmentation that had emerged during the late nineteenth century. We estimate the effects of the new borders on trade and find that the treatment effects of these borders were quite limited. There is strong evidence that border changes occurred systematically along barriers which existed already before 1914.,"[Wolf, Nikolaus; Heinemeyer, Hans-Christian] Univ Berlin, Dept Econ, D-10178 Berlin, Germany; [Schulze, Max-Stephan] London Sch Econ, Dept Econ Hist, London WC2A A2E, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Wolf, N (通讯作者)，Univ Berlin, Dept Econ, D-10178 Berlin, Germany.",nikolaus.wolf@wiwi.hu-berlin.de; m.s.schulze@lse.ac.uk; heinemeyer@wiwi.hu-berlin.de,,"Wolf, Nikolaus/0000-0002-7461-2910",,,,,71,22,28,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-0507,1471-6372,,J ECON HIST,J.

A potential risk is that some survey respondents may not be capable of developing and expressing preferences for such goods. The noise from these individuals may then conceal the well-defined preferences of other respondents and affect valuation estimates. We address this problem by estimating a range of models that accounts for scale heterogeneity (which we interpret as a respondent's ability to choose: ATC) and taste heterogeneity. These models are applied to two case studies: amenity from coastal defence and biodiversity. In both case studies, model fit was improved in a scale-heterogeneity multinomial-logit (S-MNL) model (compared to a standard MNL model) suggesting the accounting for ATC (scale heterogeneity) improved preference revelation. A mixed multinomial-logit (MIXL) model outperformed the S-MNL model suggesting that accounting for taste heterogeneity was also important. However, a generalised multinomial-logit (G-MNL) model improved model fit over the MIXL model only for the biodiversity data suggesting that for these data both taste heterogeneity and ATC were important. We conclude that accounting for ATC can improve the reliability and robustness of the results when valuing complex or unfamiliar environmental goods. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Efforts are being made to combat this problem through rehabilitation measures. However, the costs of deforestation and restoration benefits are not adequately estimated. This paper fills in the gap in knowledge by providing an empirical estimation of the cost of deforestation in monetary terms. Primary data collected regarding timber, non-timber forest products and soils in semi-deciduous forests were analyzed using opportunity cost and replacement cost techniques. The results emphasize differences in the value of these forest goods and services lost annually. The largest losses were in stumpage fees, edible fruits, and avoided carbon emissions values. The results show that US$133,650,000 gross revenue, equivalent to 2.6% of the 2008 agricultural sector Gross Domestic Product, is lost annually. It can be concluded that restoring the degraded forest lands would bring benefits particularly to the local communities through increased stumpage revenues and harvest of non-timber forest products, as well as additional funds from carbon credits. It is recommended that stakeholders of forest resources are made aware of these costs in order to raise awareness of what they are losing through deforestation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This builds on and develops previous coevolutionary analyses of long-term technological and industrial change, and recent renewed interest within ecological economics on coevolutionary approaches. Previous work has analysed how the coevolution of technologies and institutions has led to the lock-in of current high-carbon energy systems; and how the coevolution of physical and social technologies and business strategies has brought significant material and welfare benefits to the minority of the world's population living in industrialised countries. The coevolutionary framework proposed here may be used to undertake: (1) detailed empirical analyses at a micro-meso level of the challenges relating to the innovation and adoption of particularly low-carbon technologies; (2) as a framework for analysing the multi-level interaction of social and technological elements within potential transition pathways to a low carbon energy system; (3) to assess the implications for economic growth and prosperity of a transition to a low carbon economy; and (4) to assist in the development of more formal, multi-level evolutionary economic models.

It features a basin level decentralized water allocation mechanism which is adapted to incorporate sustainable water use and to deal with the externalities from upstream-downstream linkages. We formulate the profit maximization problem of various agents in a basin, each identifying a sub-basin, who operate within the boundaries of a spatially explicit model that describes the dominant hydrological processes. We address issues of non-convexities and non-steady state conditions and elicit the dependence of a decentralized water allocation on geophysical properties of the basin. In particular, the approach describes how the competition between the drying and drainage functions of sub-basins in dryland areas manifests itself in the optimal valuation of water. The application to an area of over 500,000 km(2) and 34 sub-basins in western India indicates that intra-basin cooperation could be beneficial; valuation of inter basin flows as a percentage of respective sub-basin income is on an average around 30% when each sub-basin includes downstream valuation as well.

As they travel, migratory species also provide ecosystem services to people in many different locations. Previous research suggests there may be spatial mismatches between locations where humans use services and the ecosystems that produce them. This occurs with migratory species, between the areas that most support the species' population viability - and hence their long-term ability to provide services - and the locations where species provide the most ecosystem services. This paper presents a conceptual framework for estimating how much a particular location supports the provision of ecosystem services in other locations, and for estimating the extent to which local benefits are dependent upon other locations. We also describe a method for estimating the net payment, or subsidy, owed by or to a location that balances benefits received and support provided by locations throughout the migratory range of multiple species. The ability to quantify these spatial subsidies could provide a foundation for the establishment of markets that incentivize cross-jurisdictional cooperative management of migratory species. It could also provide a mechanism for resolving conflicts over the sustainable and equitable allocation of exploited migratory species.

Therefore a possible objective for conserving a species is to minimise the cost of achieving that stated aim. For example, if a minimum viable population (MVP) of a species is to be conserved, the size and type of habitats reserved for this could be selected to minimise cost. This requires consideration of the comparative (relative) opportunity costs of reserving different land types for conservation. A general model is developed to demonstrate this and is applied to the case of the orangutan. In the ecological literature, recommendations for reserving different types of land for conservation have been based on comparisons of either the absolute economic returns they generate if converted to commercial use or on differences in the density of a species they support. These approaches are shown to be deficient because they ignore relative trade-offs between species population and economic conversion gains at alternative sites. The proposed model is illustrated for orangutan conservation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The ML productivity index and its components (technical and efficiency changes) are derived from the directional distance function which gives credit for an increase in good outputs and for reductions in undesirable outputs. The average annual ML productivity growth, accounting for undesirable outputs, is 2.46%, whereas the value of the traditional Malmquist productivity index is 4.84%, showing that the true TFP growth in China is overestimated if undesirable outputs are ignored. We explore the strictness in enforcing environmental regulations and its impact on improvements in ML productivity. The results show that, the enforcement of environmental regulations in China is, in general, far below the levels achieved in the best performing regions, and that the more stringent enforcement of environmental regulations would help to improve ML productivity growth in China.

An empirical application is provided for a forest owner producing maritime pine in Southwest of France. Our results indicate that a higher risk of fire will decrease the optimal rotation period. On the contrary, higher carbon prices increase the optimal harvesting age. To investigate the contradictory effects of fire risk and carbon price on forest rotation, we identify the set of carbon prices and fire risks that lead to a given rotation age. We also show that forest owner's willingness to pay for a risk reduction can be substantial (37.33 euros by ha and by year to reduce the annual fire risk from 1.26% to 0.07%). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This is the so-called Gisser Sanchez effect (GSE), which has been supported by the ensuing literature during recent decades. The GSE requires a number of assumptions, among which is the disregard for aquatic ecosystems linked and dependent on aquifer systems. The depletion of aquifer systems in arid and semiarid regions worldwide is causing acute water scarcity and quality degradation, and leading to extensive ecosystem damages. This study shows that by including environmental damages into the analytical model, results can change substantially. The analysis highlights both theoretically and empirically the importance of policies in groundwater management, as well as the potential role for stakeholders' cooperation. The empirical application deals with two large aquifers in Spain, the Western La Mancha aquifer which is grossly mismanaged, and the Eastern La Mancha aquifer, which is moving towards sustainable management. Western and Eastern La Mancha aquifers illustrate that policies and institutions are essential to avoid the current global aquifer mismanagement (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This arrangement introduced CBFM approaches named fisher-led, community-led and women-led approach. A wider range of local institutional arrangements as community based organizations (CBOs) have been established through participatory process with legal entity. Now, the CBOs as local institutions and fishers are more empowered in participation of fishery management under co-management arrangement The study reveals that there is still lack of institutional arrangement to be achieved at optimum level.

Most of these strategies have been applied individually, without considering the complementary relationships between them. This paper uses a discrete choice model to analyse the scope for combinations of tools for irrigation water demand management and farmers' acceptance of these. In terms of local irrigation water governance, the presence or absence of collective irrigation water management, in the form of a Water Users Association, is considered. Water rights are specified in terms of the duration and quality of the entitlement and its transferability. Finally, four types of water pricing methods (area, crop, block and volumetric pricing) are considered. Using a choice experiment, we elicit the most preferred water pricing method, under different water rights situations, at different price levels and under various contexts for local irrigation water governance. Our results indicated that under conditions of improved water rights, preference for volumetric pricing increases, whilst the presence of a Water Users Association reduces this preference. Furthermore, it was found that using an appropriate combination of water demand management tools considerably increases the willingness to pay for a change in scenario. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Because of the public good nature of biodiversity, Wart's neutrality theorem suggests that such transfers may have no effects at all (Warr, 1983). A model is developed, based on the simplifying assumption that northern countries have little biodiversity whereas southern countries are endowed with natural capital in the form of (generally unspoilt) biodiversity-rich land. Southern countries allocate optimally land and capital to two competing productive activities, agriculture and eco-tourism. When transfers are organized from the North to the South, we show that Wart's neutrality theorem collapses. Transfers can either reduce or increase the natural capital in the South, depending on some empirically verifiable hypotheses concerning the characteristics of the eco-tourism and agricultural production functions. In addition, we demonstrate that welfare improvements can be obtained even with reductions in the level of biodiversity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

As such, historic periods of climatic and economic volatility can be used as a way of developing frameworks for analyzing today's predicament. Western Europe's middle ages (circa 11-14th century) may be one such case. By the 12th century, medieval Europe had shifted from the subsistence agrarian economy that emerged following the collapse of the Roman Empire to one where spatially dispersed trade in agricultural commodities helped support a complex society that devoted considerable resources to cultural works. This shift was facilitated by new institutional arrangements centred on monastic orders that provided access to both new agricultural and food processing technologies as well as trade routes. These institutional arrangements contributed to population growth and land clearing. All of these factors increased the wealth of society but also concentrated this wealth in a small number of communities that were dependent on an ever-increasing and exploited hinterland for resources. Ultimately, this created a tightly coupled continent-wide subsistence system that was vulnerable to the weather, economic and disease shocks of the 14th century when Europe's population declined by perhaps 50%. In exploring this history, the goal of this paper is to draw on a diverse theoretical body of literature (that includes resiliency theory, landscape ecology, political science and ecological economics) to develop a series of hypotheses about how large-scale complex civilizations can become vulnerable to climate change.

And how can they be overcome, especially in the context of the present ongoing negotiations for an international regime on access and benefits sharing under the biodiversity convention? This article examines the impact of the national access laws and other instruments on the free access and exchange of these genetic resources and hence on the maintenance of agricultural biological diversity upon which food security hinges so critically.

This paper studies if the anchovy moratorium had a significant impact on the economic profitability of the fleet that fishes anchovy and other pelagic species in the North Atlantic waters. For this purpose, we compare the financial situations of the fleet before and after the moratorium from a statistical point of view using bootstrap, which is a flexible non-parametric and computationally intensive methodology.

Incentive-based agri-environmental policies are designed to influence farmers' land-use decisions in order to mitigate environmental degradation. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of agri-environmental schemes for biological conservation in a dynamic agricultural landscape under economic uncertainty. We develop a dynamic ecological economic model of agricultural land-use and spatially explicit population dynamics. We then relate policies (subsidies to grassland, taxation of agricultural intensity) to the ecological outcome (probability of persistence of a species of interest). We also analyze the associated trade-offs between agricultural production (in value) and biological conservation (in probability of persistence) at the landscape scale. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, opening to trade can be welfare maximizing even when resource stock declines.

In contrast to Europe where grape growing and winemaking were specialist activities, in the New World winemaking and selling were often integrated. This encouraged the appearance of large industrial wineries producing wines that could be branded. Differences within the New World itself can be attributable to the nature of demand and, in particular, to whether wine was considered an article of primary consumption (Argentina), or whether it competed with other, more popular alcoholic beverages such as beer and spirits (Australia and California).","[Simpson, James] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Hist Econ & Inst, E-28903 Getafe, Spain; [Simpson, James] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Inst Figuerola Hist & Ciencias Sociales, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Simpson, J (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Hist Econ & Inst, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",james.simpson@uc3m.es,,,,,,,75,4,6,2,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

J,"Alonso, AD",,,,"Alonso, Abel Duarte",,,"Muscadines, wineries and value-added products: an exploratory study",BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Wines; Value added; Winemaking,TOURISM; DIMENSIONS; ROUTES,"Purpose - Muscadines grapes, the fruit of a vine native to the South East of the USA have been studied extensively, including their alleged beneficial health properties. To date, however, very little is known about the business side of muscadine growing. For instance, very limited information exists on whether wineries growing muscadines are currently processing their grapes into other value-added products. The present study seeks to explore these aspects from winery operators' points-of-view. Design/methodology/approach - Telephone interviews, coupled with two face-to-face on-site interviews were conducted among 31 winery owners located in different states in the South East of the USA. Findings - Overall, winery operators acknowledge the potential for the diversification and development of muscadine value-added products, including juice, jellies, fortified wines or those for pharmaceutical purposes. However, the limited supply of muscadine grapes or muscadine juice to satisfy demand for value-added products is an area of concern that several muscadine growers acknowledged. Also of concern are laws and regulations that are preventing winery operators from capitalizing on some muscadine products with alcohol content. Research limitations/implications - The low number of participants in comparison with the much larger number of existing muscadine wineries limits the generalisability of the findings. Practical implications - With potentially greater demand for muscadine-related products in the future, industry support and the development of new initiatives are needed to facilitate the process of value-added muscadine product development for the benefit of operators, the industry and consumers.

The generic prescriptive content and school-like delivery methods used in current food safety training may be a barrier to application. The purpose of this paper is to develop a food safety communication tool, food safety infosheets, targeted specifically to foodservice food handlers, utilizing popular media stories to illustrate the consequences of poor food. handling. Design/methodology/approach - Food safety infosheets were designed to be surprising, connect food handlers'. actions and consequences, and generate discussion through a verbal narrative framework. A Delphi-like exercise (n=19), a posting pilot (n=8) were carried out to assess the appropriateness of the concept of food safety infosheets. An intense participatory ethnographic study with an Ontario, Canada, restaurant, and in-depth interviews with food service operators in Manhattan, Kansas, and Lansing, Michigan, (n=17) were conducted to gather qualitative data on the food service kitchen environment, including barriers to food safety practices, and the communication preferences of those who work in such kitchens. Findings - The expert group, foodservice operators, and food handlers accepted food safety infosheets as an appropriate concept and valued storytelling as an effective communication strategy. Learning in the kitchen environment is largely hands-on and visual, and time pressure dictates practices. It is often difficult to attract and keep the attention of food handlers. Storytelling, celebrity and local outbreaks are of interest to the target audience. Originality/value - This paper provides a blueprint for the design and refinement of food safety communication tools targeted towards a specific audience. By utilizing multiple methodologies, it provides a framework for other researchers to follow.","[Chapman, Benjamin] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Youth Dev & Family & Consumer Sci 4H, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [MacLaurin, Tanya] Univ Guelph, Sch Hospitality & Tourism Management, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Powell, Douglas] Kansas State Univ, Dept Diagnost Med Pathobiol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",North Carolina State University; University of Guelph; Kansas State University,"Chapman, B (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Dept Youth Dev & Family & Consumer Sci 4H, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",benjamin_chapman@ncsu.edu,"Chapman, Benjamin/E-2807-2014","Chapman, Benjamin/0000-0002-1686-700X",,,,,73,19,26,1,32,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The Kaunas Fortress complex, which was constructed at the end of IXth and at the beginning of XXth centuries, was the largest defensive structure of the firing ground-type, the main constructions of which were forts. The territories of remaining forts are located not only in the town but in the suburban localities as well. The objects occupying large areas are the significant part of the landscape structure. Though the Article 2 of the Law on Protection of Immovable Cultural Property (Lietuvos ..., 1994) provides the requirement to guarantee protection, increase and transfer of Lithuanian cultural heritage to future generations, a number of forts of Kaunas fortress that are included into the Register of Immovable Cultural Heritage is under the veil of mystery: objects are neglected, devastated and dangerous for the society. Around 78 per cent of Kaunas forts are in unsatisfactory condition and about 22 per cent of them are in satisfactory and good state. This problem downgrades the image of the city in the context of tourism and foreign investments. The European Union has established support of structural funds for development of cultural heritage; however, Lithuania prepares only few projects to attract such funds. In the territories of five forts two intersecting objects of the immovable cultural heritage and nature protection objects are being protected. Conservation regulations of these objects can't be inter-coordinated. The article analyses the issues of protection and management of nine forts of Kaunas stronghold and their territories and experience of foreign countries in regard to management of similar objects. The analysis of current state has been also performed and the perspectives on management and use of the analysed objects and their territories have been determined. The methods of analytical, logical thinking and analysis of literature sources have been used in this investigation. The completed investigations and SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis bring to the statement that the analysed objects are distinguished by high recreational potential and, upon implementation of the provided tasks by responsible authorities, these objects may be adapted for society needs.","[Gurskiene, Virginija; Ragauskaite, Indre] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Water & Land Management, Land Management Dept, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,,virginija.gurskiene@asu.lt; indrerag@gmail.com,"Gurskiene, Virginija/JWP-7276-2024","Gurskiene, Virginija/0000-0001-6493-7298",,,,,11,0,0,0,2,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,2,,,,,421,426,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304698500073,0

Hence, the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the extent of international (European and Asian) students' food acculturation in the United Kingdom. The paper seeks to report the findings from a qualitative study of the adjustment experience of a group of postgraduate international students at a university in the South of England. Design/methodology/approach - Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with a group of postgraduate international students (European and Asian) (n = 10) at a university in southern England. Findings - A push-pull model towards food choice is proposed where adjustment is described as a dynamic and multifaceted process fluctuating as a result of individual, cultural and external factors. A longing for home was apparent which could be alleviated by paying greater attention to food orientation. Practical implications - If adjustment is to be assisted, understanding the complexity of the process will help determine intervention strategies to support international students such as organising extracurricular activities in the form of tasting sessions or cooking clubs during orientation week which coincidently will also allow opportunity for group interaction and familiarisation. There should be an understanding on the part of all service providers and in so doing provide a climate for positive learning. Originality/value - The paper shows that adjustment can be a stressful experience, where the role of food in student acculturation is under researched. Understanding the complexity of the process will help to determine the intervention strategies to be used by those offering pastoral or social support.","[Hartwell, Heather J.; Edwards, John S.

Design/methodology/approach - Two experiments were conducted to examine the moderating effects of mood states and gender on the relationship between health-related information and VS. Findings - The results indicate that sad people incorporate more VS than happy people when health warnings and nutritional labeling are absent, but sad and happy people tend to converge to similar levels of VS when health warnings and nutritional labeling are present. Moreover, males incorporate less VS than females when health warnings are present, while females incorporate less VS than males when nutritional labeling is present. Practical implications - In the absence of health warnings and nutritional labeling, it is a wiser way for leading brands to cultivate positive consumer moods by utilization of humorous ads, so that they do not search for varied products. For less well-known brands, inducing negative consumer moods is a better way to encourage brand switching. Further, providing nutritional labeling will strengthen consumer brand loyalty by reducing their VS, especially for females. As the health warnings reduce the VS for males, marketers may take advantage of this effect by associating brand names with health warnings. Originality/value - As VS is found to be related to over-consumption, it is important to investigate the effects of health-related information on VS. However, little empirical evidence has been found on the effect of health-related information on VS behavior. Further, this study takes into consideration moderating factors as it is important for marketers to realize how health-related information interacts with the consumer's VS behavior under different mood states and gender. The findings demonstrate that the relationship between health-related information and VS is moderated by mood states and gender differences, an important contribution to the research on VS behavior.","[Lin, Hung-Chou] Hungkuang Univ, Dept Cultural Dev, Sha Lu Township, Taiwan; [Lin, Chien-Huang] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Business Adm, Zhongli City, Taiwan; [Lee, Sheng-Hsien] Yu Da Univ, Dept Business Adm, Chao Chiao Township, Taiwan",Hungkuang University; National Central University,"Lin, HC (通讯作者)，Hungkuang Univ, Dept Cultural Dev, Sha Lu Township, Taiwan.",kevin-lin@sunrise.hk.edu.tw,,,,,,,45,3,4,0,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Forests are an important carbon stock in a global scale. Portugal has about 3 million of hectares of forest (30% of the territory) so it is essential to understand the function of these ecosystems and especially how the water and nutrients cycles work in order to estimate the carbon sequestration and ecosystems productivity during climate changes. Ecophysiological models are often used to make scenarios of future carbon dynamics under different conditions, to monitor the ecosystems and to estimate variables such as net primary production (NPP). NPP is a key variable for ecological studies because allows us to monitor the impact of climate change on ecosystems. This is particularly important towards meeting Kyoto Protocol and subsequent meetings requirements, as the annual NPP represents the carbon net amount fixed by plants through photosynthesis each year. The object of this study is to assess the accuracy of the process-based biogeochemical model Forest-BGC for application in northeastern of Portugal forests. This kind of model offers a methodology to evaluate physiological variables in a quick and cheaper way than possible in field work. To analyze the Forest-BGC performance, NPP data obtained with the model was compared with data collected in the field, using the same sampling plots. To validate the model Forest-BGC and estimate the carbon dynamics, this study was based on 46 sampling plots with 500m(2) from the National Forest Inventory (NFI) 2006: 19 pure plots with pine stands, 17 pure plots with oak and 10 mixed plots of oak with pine.

For farms operating at a loss there is no income to forego and the economically realistic alternative is abandonment. Therefore the full cost of farming that land, is an 'additional cost' in itself. We propose a full cost of management approach which would be compliant under WTO agreements that could be applied to encourage ecosystem service provision and test these within the Scottish context of Higher Nature Value farming systems, identified through the Scottish farm account data. The FCM approach generates much higher levels of payment than under the present agri-environment support. However, this should not be a disincentive to explore these mechanisms further as it is recognised that the farms here are a special case for protection, provide important ecosystem service and therefore merit a higher level of support from society. There is sufficient scope within the existing WTO agreement to develop alternative payment approaches for encouraging the production of ecosystem services, if Member States and the EU to use it to its full potential.","[Schwarz, Gerald] Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Inst Farm Econ, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany; [Barnes, Andrew; Thomson, Steven; Waterhouse, Tony; Stewart, Sandra; McCracken, Davy] Scottish Agr Coll, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Keenleyside, Clunie; Polakova, Jana] Inst European Environm Policy, London, England",Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute; Scottish Agricultural College,"Schwarz, G (通讯作者)，Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Inst Farm Econ, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany.",gerald.schwarz@vti.bund.de; Andrew.Barnes@sac.ac.uk; Steven.Thomson@sac.ac.uk; Tony.Waterhouse@sac.ac.uk; Sandra.Stewart@sac.ac.uk; Davy.McCracken@sac.ac.uk; clunie@crex.co.uk; jpolakova@ieep.eu,"Poláková, Jana/AAY-1366-2021; McCracken, David/G-6869-2012; Barnes, Andrew P/E-5503-2015; Polakova, Jana/AIE-0269-2022; Waterhouse, Tony/AAF-1703-2019","Poláková, Jana/0000-0001-6166-1943; McCracken, David/0000-0001-5057-0448; Waterhouse, Tony/0000-0003-3666-6077; Barnes, Andrew/0000-0001-9368-148X",,,,,21,0,0,0,17,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,1,,,,,235,242,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304706000037,0

Design/methodology/approach - Three different batches of cheeses were produced using lactic acid Lactococcus spp. strains named LA-02, RE-02 and Blend (LA-02 plus RE-02). To study the quality of these products the paper uses quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA), a test of acceptability and an analysis of physical-chemical parameters. Findings - For the flavor attribute, the highest acceptabilities were for LA-02 (7.38) and Blend (6.92). The panelists found that 13 attributes were important to describe Coalho cheese. The Blend cheese was characterized by its yellow color, hardness, consistency, chewiness, typical Coalho cheese aroma and flavor. The LA-02 cheese was characterized by its acid flavor, homogeneity and softness. All the samples analyzed showed values of moisture and fat that were in line with Brazilian legislation. Practical implications - Coalho cheese is a typical Brazilian artisanal cheese that is normally produced with raw milk, even though legislation does not allow this. Pasteurization of the milk used to produce cheeses guarantees the microbiological safety of the product and, in this case, the cheese needs the addition of lactic acid bacteria in order to improve the sensorial quality and to give typical characteristics. Originality/value - Coalho cheese, as produced in the artisanal form, is widely appreciated for its sensorial characteristics. The Coalho cheese proposed in this research retains the typical sensory characteristics by using different strains of Lactococcus spp. that were isolated from artisanal Coalho cheese but according to the specification of good manufacturing practices (GMP).","[Mamede, M.

Plant-level production functions are estimated across the Canadian manufacturing sector as a whole and for five broad industry groups, each characterized by the nature of its output. The panel data overcome selection bias resulting from unobserved plant-level heterogeneity that is constant over time. A related set of estimates using instrumental variables allay persistent concerns with endogeneity. Results provide strong support for Marshall's claims about the importance of buyer-supplier networks, labor market matching and spillovers.

The aggregate series point to cyclical convergence, but a sector-level analysis traces this result to the decline in differentiated regional-policy shocks. The regional market cycles diverged, as regions specialized in different sectors of production; market-cycle convergence is observed only within the :industrial triangle, the regions of which also developed different specializations. This suggests that the balance between growing interdependence and growing differentiation is not general, as the current literature presumes, but specialization-specific.","[Ciccarelli, Carlo; Fenoaltea, Stefano; Proietti, Tommaso] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Fac Econ, Rome, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Ciccarelli, C (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Fac Econ, Rome, Italy.",carlo.ciccarelli@uniroma2.it; stefano.fenoaltea@uniroma2.it; tommaso.proietti@uniroma2.it,,"Proietti, Tommaso/0000-0001-5285-7522",,,,,51,8,8,0,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,OCT,2010,4.0,3,,,,,269,292,,10.1007/s11698-009-0046-z,0.0,,,24,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,642SS,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000281238300002,0

A number of recent publications have suggested ways to target and implement PES projects in order to maximize their cost-effectiveness and efficiency, and the Heredia Declaration (this issue) sets forth a list of agreed-upon principles concerning the use of PES schemes. One of those principles concerns the bundling of joint products of intact ecosystems in PES schemes in order to maximize the benefits to society. There have been several recent studies focusing on the degree of overlap between biodiversity and other ecosystem services and therefore the opportunities and constraints to bundling these services. Building on this idea, the bulk of this paper focuses on developing a method for selecting sites for PES where the main interest is to bundle biodiversity with other ecosystem services. We focus our analysis on Madagascar, a country with globally important biodiversity that is also beginning to explore the utility of PES as a conservation mechanism. Specifically, we assess the opportunities for bundling biodiversity conservation with carbon and water services at the national scale and identify where using PES to protect these areas of multiple benefits would be most cost-effective and efficient. This analysis identifies almost 30,000 km(2) out of 134,301 km2 of natural habitat that could potentially meet biodiversity conservation goals and protect additional ecosystem services through a PES scheme. One of the places identified by our methodology corresponds to an ongoing conservation project that has already begun using payments from carbon emission reductions to protect standing forests and restore important biodiversity corridors the Ankeniheny-Mantadia-Zahamena Biodiversity Conservation and Restoration Project. This project site was selected for its high biodiversity and carbon values, lending credibility to our spatial targeting methodology and providing a case study to draw insights on how multiple-benefit PES schemes can be implemented in biodiversity hotspots. In the discussion section of this paper we draw on experiences from this project to consider how many of the principles outlined in the Heredia Declaration affect implementation of PES schemes in Madagascar, providing lessons for similar countries experimenting with PES for biodiversity conservation.

Including socioeconomic variables further complicates assessments. While statistical or process-based regional environmental assessment models may be computationally or financially expensive, we propose a simple nonparametric outcomes-based approach using a directional distance function from the efficiency and productivity analysis literature. The regional environmental-economic directional distance function characterizes the relative efficiency of geographic units in combining multiple inputs to produce multiple desirable and undesirable socioeconomic and environmental outputs. This function makes no assumptions about the functional relationships among variables, but by quantifying the extent to which desirable outputs can be expanded and inputs and undesirable outputs contracted, the function can help decisionmakers identify the most important broad-scale management and restoration opportunities across a heterogeneous region. A case study involving 134 watersheds in the Mid-Atlantic region of the USA indicates that, depending on which outputs are specified as desirable in the models, 25%-33% of the watersheds are efficient in producing desirable outputs while minimizing inputs and undesirable outputs. Models including socioeconomic indicators exhibit increased watershed efficiency compared to models using only environmental indicators. Efficiency levels appear to be correlated with ecoregions.

To tackle this problem of continuing waste growth, the EU has on its agenda that waste generation should decouple from economic growth within the EU in the future. Sweden also has stated a target of non-increasing future waste quantities. The strength of the policy measures needed to attain this target is here illustrated by comparing the waste intensity outcomes in a 'Decoupling scenario' and a 'Baseline scenario' of the Swedish economy 2006-2030. A Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model is used for linking waste generation to firms' material input, firms' production and households' consumption when projecting future quantities of hazardous and non-hazardous waste in Sweden. We show that to offset the effect of economic growth on waste generation in the 'Decoupling scenario', the intensities of material-related wastes must decrease at a yearly rate that is about twice the historically estimated reduction rate used in the 'Baseline scenario'. The reduction in the intensities of waste related to firms' production and households' consumption must also be substantial compared to historical estimates. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The consequences of action and inaction in managing common pool resources are often most strongly felt (gains or losses) by local people. Several ecosystem services can be considered CPRs but in some cases the benefits of (mis)management are enjoyed by one group while the costs are levied on another group. Here we discuss some of the key findings of the CPR literature and how these relate to key considerations for using PES as a management tool. We focus on the role that ecosystems play in regulating water flows in two basins in Tanzania where feasibility studies have been conducted for the potential implementation of PES for water. We find that the lessons from CPR research shed light on some of the key implementation problems for PES mechanisms, and provide a useful guide for highlighting important user-resource considerations especially in contexts similar to East Africa, (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.","[Fisher, Brendan; Turner, R.

Property rights, social capital and contractual rules are critical in the success of CDM forest projects. In this paper, we ask what factors affect participation in the world's first CDM project, established in Guangxi Province. China. Using village-level surveys, we find that although the project facilitates participation through carbon pooling and a share-holding system, much of the project land remains unforested. We find that the primary reasons for the unforested regions are constrained contractual rules, property rights allocation disputes and low levels of social capital in some villages.

Using the world-economy system as a theoretical lens, the paper raises a concern as to whether the way these global institutions frame bioenergy's role in developing regions manifests energy and ecological inequalities between the core and the periphery, as well as creates internal contradictions that perpetuate unequal exchange embedded in the system. Simultaneously, these organizations frame Brazil as a semi-peripheral state that, while successful in finding a niche concurring with the core's demand for cheap energy and cost-effective decarbonization strategies, is not necessarily a suitable role model for the periphery's socio-economic development.

In this paper we report the results of two choice experiments designed to estimate willingness to pay (WTP) for an improvement in coastal water quality for two groups of beach recreationists' snorkellers and nonsnorkellers Responses from 284 respondents were analyzed and included both locals and tourists to the island who participated in beach recreation Latent class and mixed multinomial logit models were used in the analysis of the responses to explain the presence of any unobserved taste heterogeneity. An additional advantage of using these models was the ability to determine individual-specific WTP estimates for each attribute The results indicate that individual specific-means of WTP estimates vary significantly between snorkellers and nonsnorkellers The results from the analysis using the latent class model identified two subgroups with distinct preferences with the snorkeller group. Unobserved taste heterogeneity was better represented for the nonsnorkellers with a mixed multinomial logit model This study not only addresses the lack of valuation estimates on this island but also demonstrates the importance of using estimation methods that account for individual-specific differences in WTP estimates The inclusion of individual preferences is especially important in the context of a small-island developing country where there is a need to prioritise policy recommendations due to limited financial resources and conflicting objectives for natural resource management.

The case study under consideration is the implementation of a water-resource management plan in a water-scarce region of the world, namely Cyprus. Specifically, this plan proposes to replenish a depleting aquifer with treated wastewater. The proposed methodology first identifies the key stakeholder groups (farmers and the general public) who are hypothesized to derive economic values (benefits) from implementation of this plan, and then uses stated-preference methods to capture the total economic value of these benefits. Benefits are aggregated over the relevant populations of these stakeholder groups and weighed against the total costs of implementing the plan in a long-run cost-benefit analysis (CBA). An econometrically estimated time-declining trajectory of discount rates is used for the CBA in order to assess the long-run sustainability of the plan. The results reveal that the net benefit trajectory estimated with the time-declining discount rate takes one and a half to three times as long to come to a plateau compared to the constant discount rates of 3.5 and 6%, emphasizing the importance of using declining discount rates and capturing the entirety of the benefits generated by such plans. This methodology is particularly recommended for providing much needed information to support the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive, which advocates the use of CBA with consideration of the notion of sustainability for achieving the good water status for all European waters.

Such narratives of progress portray a sequence of improving water technologies that overcame environmental constraints, supplying more water to satisfy the demands of growing populations for better living. Water supply appears as the response to an insatiable demand, exogenous to the water system. Instead, as the history of water in Athens, Greece illustrates water supply and demand in fact coevolve, new supply generating higher demands, and in turn, higher demands favouring supply expansion over other alternatives. This vicious cycle expands the water footprint of cities degrading environments and communities in the countryside. Far from being predetermined and inevitable, as progressive narratives wants it, water resource development has been contingent on geographical and environmental conditions, institutional struggles, accidents, experiments and external geo-political and technological forces. In the last part of this paper, I discuss the policy implications of this coevolutionary reframing with respect to a the transition to a soft water path. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We find that banking systems in former socialist emerging economies are characterized by three distinct technological regimes. Based on the estimated efficiency scores we group the countries into three categories and provide an intuitive interpretation of these three regimes.,"[Poghosyan, Tigran] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Kumbhakar, Subal C.] SUNY Binghamton, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA",International Monetary Fund; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton,"Poghosyan, T (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",tpoghosyan@imf.org,,,,,,,35,12,13,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Design/methodology/approach - Correlation, regression and cluster analyses of data gathered in 2005 in the Dutch food and drink (F&D) industry were carried out. Findings - The deployment of managerial capabilities that support ecological modernization (such as supply chain cooperation and network information exchange, or product-redesign) in the Dutch F&D industry is low. The results show that different company profiles are connected with specific drivers and barriers for environmental pro-activeness. Prospector companies (a minority) are more pro-active with respect to environmental capability building than defenders. Research limitations/implications - Comparative longitudinal studies of environmental management drivers in subsectors could improve the understanding of the factors that stimulate environmental performance. Practical implications - Optimism that industry will enhance EM-performance through radical market-induced innovation is misplaced. Instead, a contingency approach is in place. Public environmental policy with respect to the F&D industry should be adjusted to discernable managerial patterns and categories of companies. Voluntary cooperation, self-governance, and market-induced environmental innovation are only effective with respect to a minority of the companies. Originality/value - The research opposes the existing foundation of public environmental policy on generic attributes assigned to the whole F&D-industry and, consequently, of generic policies to improve environmental management performance. A differentiation of public policy should be based on the understanding of the drivers of managerial behavior.","[Bremmers, Harry] Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Business Adm Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Haverkamp, Derk-Jan; Omta, Onno] Environ Netherlands, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Bremmers, H (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Business Adm Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",harry.bremmers@wur.nl,,,,,,,68,11,13,1,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The high concentration of the visit willingness on 35% of the heritage sites demonstrates that the development of the world culture heritage tourism in Macau is in status of uneven. It can be also found that there are significant differences between the satisfaction level of tourists with different educational background and different place. of origin.

Design/methodology/approach - A critical evaluation of space and time utilisation efficiency was achieved by on-site studying operations in a multiple produce handling and short-term storage facility in Kent, UK. The objective was to measure operational performance of distribution centres for agricultural perishables in terms of throughput and space utilisation. Findings - The inefficient utilisation of storage space within cold rooms is identified and quantified accurately, whilst the quality control task is recognised as the most time-consuming task and a critical cause for hindering the product flow. Research limitations/implications - Despite their importance, distribution centres for fresh fruit and vegetables have received little attention in the distribution and performance management literature. Given the lack of robust performance measurement systems reported, the measurement of operational performance in distribution centres for agricultural products was a challenge. Practical implications - The measurement and improvement of the operational performance in each linkage of the fresh produce supply chain, such is the distribution centre can lead to achieving higher levels of service at substantially reduced costs. Originality/value - A small number of publications are found in the literature providing information on physical distribution of agricultural perishables, and how the key features of perishability and voluminosity of the produce affect the distribution efficiency. The paper provides a step towards the improvement of the fresh produce distribution industry operational performance by evaluating the current operational status of a leading multiple produce distribution centre in the UK.","[Manikas, Ioannis] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Agr Sci, GR-54006 Thessaloniki, Greece; [Terry, Leon A.] Cranfield Univ, Plant Sci Lab, Postharvest Grp, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Cranfield University,"Manikas, I (通讯作者)，Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Agr Sci, GR-54006 Thessaloniki, Greece.",imanikas@agro.auth.gr,"Manikas, Ioannis/B-9754-2018","Manikas, Ioannis/0000-0002-4084-1651; Terry, Leon/0000-0001-5677-023X","Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)","Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA))","Special thanks are offered to all the staff at the FPDC studied and especially to Dr Alan Legge.

Since that time and in the wet/dry tropics of the Northern Territory, fire, weeds and feral animals have had, and continue to have, the greatest influence on landscapes and the ecosystem services they provide. Internationally, the links between Indigenous people and their experiences with natural and cultural resource management has been recognized and now have become an important and popular strategy for promoting sustainable development. Indigenous Natural and Cultural Resource Management (INCRM) is particularly relevant in the Northern Territory of Australia and has contributed to the formation of an Indigenous ranger program to manage threats to the landscape in conjunction with customary land management practice from Aboriginal people still living on their country. A closer examination of the success of INCRM suggests that the real challenge is one of managing knowledge pluralism rather than finding a common base for the different sources of knowledge. More recently these landscapes have been subject to a number of additional threats (spread of disease from feral animals, illegal international fishing vessels, exotic ant control, fire abatement etc), which still require management at a local level. Many of these are currently being managed under a payment for environmental service (PES) type arrangement. While PES has great public cost-benefit, it needs to be determined if the model provides the best mechanism for the progress of Indigenous people. This paper is about the intricacies of issues related with linking knowledge of Indigenous people with provision of ecosystem services and will conclude the ongoing commitment of PES to sustainable development.","[Vemuri, S.; Gorman, J.] Charles Darwin Univ, Sch Law & Business, Fac Law Business & Arts LBA, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia",Charles Darwin University,"Vemuri, S (通讯作者)，Charles Darwin Univ, Sch Law & Business, Fac Law Business & Arts LBA, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia.",,"Gorman, Julian T./N-2101-2013","Gorman, Julian/0000-0002-2013-3770",,,,,27,0,0,2,19,WIT PRESS,SOUTHAMPTON,"ASHURST LODGE, SOUTHAMPTON SO40 7AA, ASHURST, ENGLAND",1743-3541,,978-1-84564-436-9,WIT TRANS ECOL ENVIR,WIT Trans.

The purpose of this paper is to develop an instrument to assess these economic costs of food allergy at household level and to conduct an exploratory analysis of potential economic impact. Design/methodology/approach - A case-controlled postal pilot survey was conducted using a self-completion instrument. Cases had either clinically or self-diagnosed food allergy. Controls were obtained from households in which none of the members had food allergies. Findings - The instrument appeared sensitive to the economic cost differences between households with and without food allergic members. Direct costs of health care were significantly higher for cases than for controls. Similar differences were identified for indirect cost of lost earnings, and costs due to inability to perform domestic tasks because of ill health. Intangible costs (self-reported health status and well-being), indicated significantly lower subjective well-being for cases. Research limitations/implications - Larger sample sizes will be needed to reliably assess the size of impact, cross-cultural variation in costs, and whether costs vary according to severity of food allergy or between diagnosed versus self-reported food allergy. The costs effectiveness of diagnostic methods or interventions may also be assessed using this instrument If economic costs of food allergy are significant in the population further consideration from a public health policy perspective will be required. Originality/value - To date, economic impact of food allergy on individuals and households has not been quantified. The paper addresses this.","[Voordouw, Jantine; Cornelisse-Vermaat, Judith; Frewer, Lynn] Wageningen Univ, Mkt & Consumer Behav Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Fox, Margaret] Univ E Anglia, Sch Med Hlth Policy & Practice, Hlth Econ Grp, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Antonides, Gerrit; Mugford, Miranda] Wageningen Univ, Econ Consumers & Households Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; University of East Anglia; Wageningen University & Research,"Voordouw, J (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Mkt & Consumer Behav Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",jantine.voordouw@wur.nl,"Antonides, Gerrit/AAY-2234-2020; David, Maribel/E-2812-2012","Antonides, Gerrit/0000-0002-9983-1263;",European Commission [514000],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"This work was supported by the European Commission contract no. 514000 EuroPrevall The prevalence, cost and basis of food allergy across Europe.",,24,18,19,0,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The results showed that if household tolerated the rent-seeking behavior of village cadre, it will inevitably lead to infringement of households' rights and interests of rural land in case 1; If household resisted, then there were three possible game results in case 2 and 3: the first is reconciliation and settlement, the second is appeal and compensation, and the third is continuing toleration. But the final game result depends on determination and bargaining power of household. Finally, some proposals and measures on preventing and resolving disputes on rural land transfer were put forward from the perspective of farmers themselves, rural grassroots organizations, rural land transfer market and resolution mechanism of rural land disputes.","[Wang Yanqi; Guo Xiangyu] NE Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Harbin 150030, Peoples R China",Northeast Agricultural University - China,"Wang, YQ (通讯作者)，NE Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Harbin 150030, Peoples R China.",qiqi_77.@126.com,,,,,,,5,0,0,1,7,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-1-921712-17-3,,,,2010,,,,,,,333,340,,,,,,8,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BYF00,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298334500052,0

Environmental impact directly affects residents' satisfaction on tourism. The authors put Mount Lushan and Taishan, which are the World Culture Heritages of China, as the research objects and carried out a sample survey on the residents, analyzing descriptive data with SPSS13.0. Then the authors build a structural equation model of relations between the economic, social cultural & environmental impacts of tourism and community participation in tourism using AMOS7.0, and test the three hypothesis at the same time. Results show that the H1 and H2 are supported, while H3 is rejected. Thus this study draws three conclusions: firstly, more attention should be paid to the interests of community residents and environment. Secondly, the income of community residents should be more improved actually. Thirdly, the social & cultural impact should be put more importance to promote the tourism sustainable development in the destination.","[Wu Xinyu; Zhong Sheng] Wuhan Univ, Econ & Management Sch, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wu Xinyu] Soochow Univ, Suzhou, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Soochow University - China,"Wu, XY (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Econ & Management Sch, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.",wuxinyu18@yahoo.com.cn,,,Fund Project of National Social Science in China [07BJ Y136],Fund Project of National Social Science in China,"2007 Fund Project of National Social Science in China, NO.07BJ Y136.",,15,0,0,0,7,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-1-921712-15-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,346,+,,,,,,2,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BYE76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298265500060,0

Irrigated agriculture is the world's largest water user, so governments, donor organizations, water suppliers, and farmers continue to look for measures that would produce more crop per drop. Despite the importance of promoting water conservation in agriculture, little work has been done that integrates hydrologic, economic, institutional, and policy dimensions of water conservation. This paper presents an integrated basin scale analysis of water conservation subsidies for irrigated agriculture. A dynamic, nonlinear programming model is developed and applied for the Upper Rio Grande Basin of Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas, USA. Several potential public subsidies of drip irrigation are analyzed for their economic and hydrologic impacts at both the farm and basin levels. Results indicate that water conservation subsidies for drip irrigation produce several effects. These include greater on-farm implementation of water-conserving technology, less water applied to crops. more water consumed by crops, increased farm income, greater crop production, more land irrigated, and increased total water-related economic benefits for the basin. Findings provide a framework for designing and implementing water conservation policies for irrigated agriculture. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, there are historical examples where new products or technologies expanded rapidly and achieved a high output in a relatively short period of time. This paper explores the possibility of a 'technological breakthrough' in the renewable energy sector. using a partial equilibrium model of energy generation with endogenous R&D. Our results indicate, that due to increasing returns-to-scale, a multiplicity of equilibria can arise. In the model, two stable states can coexist, one characterized by a lower and one by higher supply of renewable energy. The transition from the low-output to the high-output equilibrium is characterized by a discontinuous rise in R&D activity and capacity investments in the renewable energy sector. The transition can be triggered by a rise in world energy demand, by a drop in the supply of fossil fuels, or by policy intervention. Under market conditions, the transition occurs later than in the social optimum. Hence, we identify a market failure related to path-dependence and technological lock-in, that can justify a strong policy intervention initially. Paradoxically, well-intended energy-saving policies can actually lead to higher emissions, as they reduce the incentives to invest in renewable energies by having a cushioning effect on the energy price. Hence, these policies should be supplemented by other instruments that restore the incentives to invest in renewable energies. Finally, we discuss the influence of monopoly power in the market for innovations. We show that market power can alleviate the problem of technological lock-in, but creates a new market failure that reduces static efficiency. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Policy research on EPI has grown to become a distinct and substantial field of study at the national and EU levels, where political commitment and interest in the topic have been large. In the study of international regimes, EPI analytical concepts have so far not been applied although the EPI quest is at least as important and critical at this level. This special issue addresses this gap, by combining these two sets of literature and examining various aspects of EPI in international regimes, its manifestations and its challenges. This introductory paper introduces key conceptual discussions underlying the development of this special issue, distils and discusses some of the key findings and messages from the four ensuing research articles and presents directions for future research. It finds that many EPI challenges and institutional barriers are strongly accentuated at international levels of governance, but also that similarities with the national level suggest that closer interactions between the two fields of study are warranted. At both levels, the EPI game'' is full of inherent tensions and goal conflicts, institutional constraints abound, and cognitive interactions and learning processes appear as key mechanisms to advance EPI. Suggestions for how to enhance EPI in international regimes are still tentative, and analysis beyond international relations and regime theory is needed to capture potential institutional innovations for advancing EPI.","[Nilsson, Mans] Stockholm Environm Inst, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Pallemaerts, Marc] IEEP, London, England; [von Homeyer, Ingmar] Inst Ecol, Berlin, Germany",Stockholm Environment Institute,"Nilsson, M (通讯作者)，Stockholm Environm Inst, Kraftriket 2B, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",mans.nilsson@sei.se,"Nilsson, Måns/C-5565-2011","Nilsson, Mans/0000-0003-2157-1083",,,,,29,31,32,1,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

However, the static snapshot of EF accounting is not designed to make projections of future sustainability consequences, which fails to elicit policy implications from a dynamic, temporally explicit perspective. This work attempts to incorporate system dynamics (SD) into EF to develop a dynamic EF forecasting framework, and provide a platform to support policy making for urban sustainability improvement. SD is firstly adopted to model the dynamics and interactions of EF driving forces, and then incorporated into the EF framework by correlating system drivers to EF-related consumption categories, embodied EF is finally calculated using the compound-based method. Based on different policy feasibility and sustainability targets, four policy scenarios are designed to explore future sustainability prospects and formulate integrated policies which would attain that sustainability scenario.

Crime rates are higher in more unequal cities; people in unequal cities are more likely to say that they are unhappy. There is a negative association between local inequality and the growth of city-level income and population, once we control for the initial distribution of skills. High levels of mobility across cities mean that city-level inequality should not be studied with the same analytical tools used to understand national inequality, and policy approaches need to reflect the urban context. Urban inequality reflects the choices of more and less skilled people to live together in particular areas. City-level skill inequality can explain about one-third of the variation in city-level income inequality, while skill inequality is itself explained by historical schooling patterns and immigration. Local income also reflects the substantial differences in the returns to skill across, which are related to local industrial patterns.","[Glaeser, Edward L.] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr 315A, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Resseger, Matt] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Tobio, Kristina] Harvard Univ, Kennedy Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; Harvard University; Harvard University,"Glaeser, EL (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr 315A, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",eglaeser@harvard.edu; resseger@fas.harvard.edu; kristina_tobio@hks.harvard.edu,,,,,,,33,190,224,2,43,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-4146,,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

As an illustration, we focus on the provision of Public Rights Of Way (PROW) by Local Government Authorities in England. These provide rights of passage over property to those other than the owners, and little information is available on the welfare effects of changes in the provision and use of PROW. Given limited funds, reliance on expert judgement could be a cost effective alternative for decision-making compared with stated preference surveys of citizens. Two methods are compared. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to elicit expert judgement to proxy citizen preferences for different attributes of PROW. The Choice Experiment (CE) technique is then used to derive preferences directly through personal interviews with citizens. Overall it was found that judicious use of AHP by experts can, in this instance, be used to represent citizen views. However, this result may not be easily generalisable to other settings.

Customer equity has traditionally been seen as the discounted sum of the lifetime earnings from all current and future customers and thus it has been largely assumed that maximizing customer lifetime value would lead to maximum customer equity. We show that the transition from CLV to CE is not that straightforward. Although the CLV model is appropriate for managing a single non-replaceable customer, the application of a CLV model to the acquisition and valuation of customers as an ongoing concern for the firm leads to sub-optimal customer relationship management and acquisition strategies. This leads the firm following a CLV maximization approach to have a smaller and less profitable customer base than one that follows a CE maximization strategy.","[Dreze, Xavier] UCLA Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Bonfrer, Andre] Singapore Management Univ, Lee Kong Chian Sch Business, Singapore, Singapore",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Singapore Management University,"Drèze, X (通讯作者)，UCLA Anderson Sch Management, 110 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",xavier.dreze@anderson.ucla.edu,"BONFRER, Andre/D-2158-2010",,,,,,21,17,20,4,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

Whether this R&D is conducted within companies. cooperatives or public research organizations (both publicly and privately funded R&D) is expected to influence the type of crops and traits that are developed and therefore the effects on society and ecosystems that potentially could follow from the use of GM-crops. This issue is analyzed empirically by statistical analysis of 1323 notifications for field trials with GM-crops that have been submitted under two EU Directives in seven European countries. The results show that the type of R&D organization influences the traits and crops that are developed. Companies are more likely to submit notifications that concern GM-crops that secure the potential for profit than are other types of R&D organizations. while R&D organizations that are purely publicly funded are more likely to submit notifications that only concern biosafety research than are cooperatives and companies. Consideration of the environment, food safety and food security might justify institutional reforms of R&D of GM-crops. This might include increased public funding combined with changes in intellectual property rights. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Livestock depredation by wolves is a cost of wolf conservation borne by livestock producers, which creates conflict between producers, wolves and organizations involved in wolf conservation and management. Compensation is the main tool used to mitigate the costs of depredation, but this tool may be limited at improving tolerance for wolves. Furthermore, livestock production may in fact provide indirectly an important benefit for wolf conservation - i.e. a positive externality, by maintaining relatively intact habitat on private lands. We analyzed some of the costs of livestock depredation by wolves to livestock producers relative to recent economic trends in the livestock production industry, specifically income generated from livestock production and trends in land and livestock value. Data were gathered from depredation investigations, from the livestock compensation program and on land and livestock price in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, U.S.A. from 1987 to 2003 - a period during which wolves had endangered species status. We found that instigation of attacks on livestock by wolves was determined by need for food, but wolves may kill sheep in excess of food needs. Excessive killing of livestock may contribute significantly to intolerance for wolves. Livestock killed by wolves cost producers approximately $11,076.49 per year between 1987 and 2003, although costs were increasing linearly (R-2 = 0.789, P<0.001). Each year such costs accounted for <0.01% of the annual gross income from livestock operations in the region. Thus, wolf depredation is a small economic cost to the industry, although it may be a significant cost to affected producers as these costs are not equitably distributed across the industry. Compensation for depredation was efficient when compared to other regions. Land prices increased steadily throughout the study period (R-2 = 0.966. P<0.001), while the price of cattle decreased (R-2 = 0.749, P<0.001). We maintain that conservation groups should consider the potential consequences of all of these economic trends. Specifically, declining cattle price and the steady increase in land price might induce conversion of agricultural land to rural-residential developments, which could negatively impact wolf conservation via large scale habitat change and increased human presence.

Yet, in a world of uncertainty this cannot be guaranteed. To therefore define strong sustainability under uncertainty in an operational manner we propose to use the concept of viability. Viability means that the different components and functions of a dynamic, stochastic system at any time remain in a domain where the future existence of these components and functions is guaranteed with sufficiently high probability. We develop a unifying and general ecological-economic concept of viability that encompasses the traditional ecological and economic notions of viability as special cases. It provides an operational criterion of strong sustainability under a mild form of uncertainty and for medium spatial and temporal scales. We illustrate this concept and demonstrate its usefulness by applying it to livestock grazing management in semi-arid rangelands. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Some economists contest this viewpoint, arguing that wealthier countries have the luxury of investing more heavily in efforts to conserve biodiversity. Under this assumption, we expect a U-shaped relationship between per capita wealth and proportion of species conserved. We test this environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) using estimates of per capita income and deforestation rates (index of biodiversity threat) for 35 tropical countries. A prior analysis [Dietz. S., Adger, W.N., 2003. Economic growth, biodiversity loss and conservation effort. Journal of Environmental Management, 68:23-35] using conventional regression techniques failed to provide any support for the parabolic relationship predicted by the EKC hypothesis. Here, we introduce the use of quantile regression and spatial filtering to reanalyze this data, addressing issues of heteroskedasticity and spatial autocorrelation. We note that preliminary analysis using these methods provides some initial evidence for an EKC. However, a series of panel analyses with country-specific dummy variables eliminated or even reversed much of this support. A closer examination of conservation practices and environmental indicators within the countries, particularly those countries that drove our initial support, suggests that wealth is not a reliable indicator of improved conservation practice. Our findings indicate that an EKC for biodiversity is overly simplistic and further exploration is required to fully understand the mechanisms by which income affects biodiversity.

As an attempt to fill this gap, we apply a hedonic property value analysis, the method commonly used to infer the value of clean air in developed countries, using the combination of data on housing rental prices and their characteristics from the Indonesian Family Life Survey, and data of the ambient level of six different pollutants in Jakarta, Indonesia. The result indicates that, in the cases of lead, total hydro carbon (THC), and SO2, air pollutants have a negative association with property value; i.e., housing rental price. The relationship is at 5% level of significance for lead and 10% level for THC and SO2. This paper estimates that per family value of clean air in Jakarta ranges from US$28 to US$85 per mu g/m(3).

An example is the understanding of the level-effect in marketing, where the effect of product attributes on utility is positively related to the number of levels present among choice alternatives. Knowing when consumers are sensitive to the competing levels of attributes is an important aspect of merchandising, selling and promotion. In this paper, we propose a model and a method for studying the level-effect in conjoint analysis. The model combines perceptual theories in psychology to arrive at a non-linear specification of hyper-parameters in a hierarchical model. The method applies an experimental design criterion for efficient estimation of hyper-parameters.

The framework is applied in the context of Mexico's Programme of Payments for Carbon, Biodiversity and Agro-forestry Services (PSA-CABSA), with an emphasis on its carbon component. The analysis shows that PSA-CABSA was promoted by civil society and its rules have been subject to continuous modifications over time. In the case of the carbon component, changes have been due to an original misunderstanding of how carbon projects should be designed, implemented, and carbon traded in actual markets. From a performance point of view, the paper shows that the programme has been well received by rural communities, and carbon payments have contributed to increase household income and to enhance forest management practices and organisational skills. The paper also highlights sources of institutional interplay with local institutions and international climate policy, and it reveals the importance of capacity and scale issues in securing an effective and fair implementation of PES. The conclusion provides some policy recommendations for the future development of PES initiatives in Mexico and elsewhere. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The argument is that grandfathering the rights will only reinforce existing global inequalities, while per capita distribution of the rights would lead to such huge transfers of wealth to the South as to be unacceptable to the North. However, a very simple general equilibrium model highlighting key elements of the global economy shows that this perception is incorrect under a plausible interpretation of the goal of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Instead of using an economic damage function to determine the optimal level of emissions reductions, the model's utility functions are calibrated to reflect scientific understanding of what would be required to stabilize the atmosphere at safe concentrations of greenhouse gases. Among policy options that would accomplish this, the United States has a preference for grandfathering the allocation of emissions rights over a per capita allocation, but this preference is not strong and could be offset by other geopolitical considerations.

The pineapple crop plays an important role in the economical and social area of this region, generating jobs and income for family agriculture. Aiming at evaluating the effect of nitrogen fertilization and types of planting material on the vegetative development and on sanitary and productive aspects of 'Perola' and 'Smooth Cayenne' pineapple crops, an experiment was set up in the municipality of Sao Francisco do Itabapoana, Rio de Janeiro. The experimental design was in randomized blocks with a factorial scheme 4 x 9. Four doses of N (4, 8, 12 and 16 g plant(-1) cycle(-1)) were studied, using urea as source, as well as nine types of planting material, being six of 'Smooth Cayenne' (crowns 250 to 400 g; slips 200 to 350 g; slips 350 to 500 g; suckers 300 to 450 g; suckers 450 to 600 g, and suckers 600 to 750 g) and three of 'Perola' (crowns 150 to 250 g; slips 200 to 350 g, and slips 350 to 500 g), with four replications. The evaluation of initial plant growth until 120 days after planting showed positive effects of the nitrogen fertilization. From 120 to 140 days after planting, there was a very intense attack of fruit borer larvae (Strymon megarus) on plants of all treatments studied. The highest losses were observed in the cv. 'Smooth Cayenne' for plants originated from suckers, especially those of 600 g to 750 g, and the lowest from crowns, with death rates of 74.5% and 25.5%, respectively. The same occurred for plants of cv. 'Perola' originated from 200 to 350 g slips and crowns, with death rates of 47.8% and 22.7%, respectively. It was shown that under certain circumstances the pineapple fruit borer may also be a severe pest for pineapple plants in their vegetative phase and that losses are higher for 'Smooth Cayenne' than 'Perola' cultivars and lower for crowns than suckers or slips.","[de Faria, D.

Family forest owners constitute a significant portion of the overall forestland in the U.S., but little is known about their preferences for participating in carbon sequestration programs. The goal of this research is to understand what motivates Massachusetts family forest owners to participate in carbon markets. The study estimates the probability these landowners would engage in carbon sequestration programs using data from a survey of 930 Massachusetts family forest owners. Results from a random effects ordered probit indicate that under a carbon scenario similar to the current voluntary scheme, very few of these landowners would be interested in participating. Supply analysis indicates these landowners are more influenced to participate by factors other than price. Regression analysis results suggest that survey respondents are concerned about early withdrawal penalties, additionality requirements, and contract length. Forest owner harvesting plans, opinions about forest usage, and beliefs about climate change all play a significant role in the decision to participate. The study suggests that policy makers should consider the reasons behind these low participation rates, because private forest owners could play a pivotal role in the carbon sequestration potential of forests.

Here, we show that two existing valuation methods, previously thought to be unrelated, are each a special case of a more general equation. We then present a new method, termed attributable net income, for valuing insect pollination of crops. The attributable net income method improves upon previous methods in three ways: (1) it subtracts the cost of inputs to crop production from the value of pollination, thereby not attributing the value of these inputs to pollinators; (2) it values only the pollination that would be utilized by the crop plant for fruit production, thereby not valuing pollen deposited in excess of the plants' requirements; and (3) it can attribute value separately to different pollinator taxa, for example to native vs. managed pollinators. We demonstrate all three methods using a data set on watermelon pollination by native bees and honey bees in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, USA. We discuss the reasons why different methods produce disparate values, and why the attributable net income method most accurately reflects the actual ecosystem service that is being valued, marketable fruit production.

Our main data source is an updated version of the list of steam engines erected in Britain during the eighteenth century originally compiled by Kanefsky and Robey (Technol Cult 21:161-186, 1980). Following a rather established approach for analysing the diffusion of new technologies we fit S-shaped growth functions to the data on the numbers of steam engines installed in each county. In this way, we are able to provide a comprehensive appraisal of the relative speed of the diffusion process in different counties. Second, in order to assess the relative importance of the variables shaping the diffusion of steam power technology, we study the relationship between the number of steam engines installed in each county and localization factors such as coal prices, availability of water sites, number of textile mills and number of blast furnaces.","[Nuvolari, Alessandro] St Anna Sch Adv Studies, LEM, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Verspagen, Bart] Maastricht Univ, Fac Econ, UNU Merit, Maastricht, Netherlands; [von Tunzelmann, Nick] Univ Sussex, Freeman Ctr, SPRU, Brighton BN1 9QE, E Sussex, England",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; Maastricht University; University of Sussex,"Nuvolari, A (通讯作者)，St Anna Sch Adv Studies, LEM, Piazza Martiri della Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.",alessandro.nuvolari@sssup.it; b.verspagen@maastrichtuniversity.nl; g.n.von-tunzelmann@sussex.ac.uk,"Verspagen, Bart/ABE-6732-2020; Nuvolari, Alessandro/F-3151-2011","Verspagen, Bart/0000-0001-6975-8141; Nuvolari, Alessandro/0000-0002-7275-4827",,,,,58,33,35,0,29,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,OCT,2011,5.0,3,,,,,291,321,,10.1007/s11698-011-0063-6,0.0,,,31,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,811MW,,"Green Submitted, hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000294216300004,0

The design of REDD is important as it may channel much of the international funding that will potentially be made available for future environmental problem-solving in developing countries. The most important multilateral environmental funding mechanism is the Global Environment Facility (GEF). With its basic structural similarity to the emerging REDD, it provides a good starting point for drawing lessons relevant to the design of REDD. In explaining GEF priorities and performance we discuss the role of key actors as well as the organizational and institutional structure of GEF. These factors do not encourage coalitions for addressing environmental problems in the poorest countries. The institutional setting of REDD in the Convention on Climate Change may further exacerbate this trend, as neither conservation nor socioeconomic concerns like the rights and well-being of indigenous peoples and local communities are addressed. Factors that favour utilizing a similar organization structure include scope for donor trust, for bringing in established competence and a comprehensive approach. REDD must be wary of catering solely to a Northern environmental agenda. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Rosendal, G.

The paper analyses the evolution of the terms of trade for agricultural and food products in the second half of the 20(th) century. We obtain sixty new real price indices for internationally traded agricultural products. We conclude, from a long-term perspective, that the deterioration in the terms of trade for agricultural and food products was strong and clear in the second half of the last century. In general, less processed products suffered a very heavy fall in their real prices. However, there was no continuous and persistent deterioration in the terms of trade either as a whole or for the great majority of the agricultural and food product groups (with the exception of natural rubber, textile fibres and other raw materials). Rather, this deterioration occurred in stages.","[Serrano, Raul] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Business Adm, Fac Econ & Business Studies, Zaragoza 50005, Spain; [Pinilla, Vicente] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Appl Econ & Econ Hist, Fac Econ & Business Studies, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",University of Zaragoza; University of Zaragoza,"Serrano, R (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Dept Business Adm, Fac Econ & Business Studies, Gran Via 4, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",raser@unizar.es; vpinilla@unizar.es,"Serrano, Raul/H-7441-2015; Pinilla, Vicente/H-4331-2015","Serrano Lazaro, Victor Raul/0000-0003-2911-8937; Pinilla, Vicente/0000-0003-2256-8898",,,,,65,14,14,1,23,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

This is done with reference to its use per ha thereby helping to proffer a solution to the persistent questions of farmers with regard to the use of inputs in an intensified manner or otherwise. With respect to this, a sample of 600 farms in the Meuse department was observed over a 12-year period. The analysis is essentially to assess cost efficiency dominance between technologies using non-parametric cost-functions which involves different levels of pesticide use per ha. Our empirical application shows that less intensive processes in terms of pesticide level per ha are a better option not only for the society but also for the producers who could significantly reduce their costs in 80% of cases.

Using employer level data from the 2000 to 2005 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Insurance Component, we examine the effect of premium growth on the likelihood that an employer offers insurance, eligibility rates among employees, continuous measures of employee premium contributions for both single and family coverage, and deductibles. We find that small, low-wage employers are less likely to offer health insurance in response to increased premium inflation, and if they do offer coverage they increase employee contributions and deductible levels. In contrast, larger, low-wage employers maintain their offers of coverage, but reduce eligibility for such coverage. They also increase employee contributions for single and family coverage, but not deductibles. Among high-wage employers, all but the largest increase deductibles in response to cost pressures.","[Vistnes, Jessica; Selden, Thomas] Agcy Healthcare Res & Qual, Ctr Financing Access & Cost Trends, Rockville, MD 20850 USA",Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality,"Vistnes, J (通讯作者)，Agcy Healthcare Res & Qual, Ctr Financing Access & Cost Trends, 540 Gaither Rd, Rockville, MD 20850 USA.",jvistnes@ahrq.gov,,,,,,,18,3,5,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

The national water footprint of rice production and consumption is estimated using international trade and domestic production data. The global water footprint of rice production is 784 km(3)/year with an average of 1325 m(3)/t which is 48% green, 44% blue, and 8% grey. There is also 1025 m(3)/t of percolation in rice production. The ratio of green to blue water varies greatly over time and space. In India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar and the Philippines, the green water fraction is substantially larger than the blue one, whereas in the USA and Pakistan the blue water footprint is 4 times more than the green component. The virtual water flows related to international rice trade was 31 km(3)/year. The consumption of rice products in the EU27 is responsible for the annual evaporation of 2279 Mm(3) of water and polluted return flows of 178 Mm(3) around the globe, mainly in India. Thailand, the USA and Pakistan. The water footprint of rice consumption creates relatively low stress on the water resources in India compared to that in the USA and Pakistan. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The system for measuring the soil cone penetrometer resistance is comprised of a load cell, connected to a rod, ending with a cone, and is mounted on a frame, fixed to the front part of a tractor. The system for measuring the draft force required to till the soil is comprised of a load cell, mounted on the hitch hook of a tool carrier, towed by the tractor. Moreover, in order to test the usefulness of the system with different types of linkage tractor-implement, two other load cells were mounted, respectively, on the top link and the right point of the three-point hitch of the tool carrier. The signals of the load cells and of a DGPS mobile receiver are acquired by a portable computer, by means of a Virtual Instrument developed in LabVIEW environment. The results of the first tests, carried out in a field in inland Sicily, showed that: the system is able to log data with a sampling frequency adjustable from 1 to 10 Hz; it is able to accurately measure and collect in real-time a large amount of data, which can be easily processed by means of a data sheet, a GIS or another software usable for measuring the within-field spatial variability of soil physical-mechanical parameters; the absolute value of the force measured on the hitch hook of the tool carrier is proportionally correlated to that measured on any point of the three-point hitch of the same one.","[Comparetti, Antonio; Febo, Pierluigi; Orlando, Santo] Univ Palermo, Dept Agr & Environm Syst, Palermo, Italy",University of Palermo,,antonio.comparetti@unipa.it,"Orlando, Santo/S-1028-2017; Comparetti, Antonio/A-1451-2012","Orlando, Santo/0000-0001-9403-4735; Comparetti, Antonio/0000-0002-6083-5515",,,,,7,0,0,0,5,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,1,,,,,319,323,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304706000051,0

One of moose population wintering area is Bukta forest, where moose population in winter is overstepping recommended density. This phenomenon causes a lot of damage to forest regeneration. Self natural regeneration in Bukta forest cannot develop without foresters interruption, because of too intensive moose damage. The aim of work was to evaluate moose damage dynamics to forest regeneration by stands and by separate tree species. The results of observation showed that forest regeneration in Bukta was damaged intensively. Mostly damaged tree species was aspen (Populus tremula) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior). Those are the most economically important tree species in Bukta forest.

Data on pine crown condition collected in Aukstaitija National Park for 19 years allowed analysing key factors responsible for changes in forest conditions on a regional scale in Lithuania. Our earlier investigation revealed that defoliation of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is closely related to air concentrations and wet deposition of acidifying compounds. In the present study we would like to check the hypothesis that meteorological parameters could reduce negative effect of acidifying compounds and improve pine condition under the rapid climate change condition. The obtained results revealed that spring and summer precipitation and mean winter temperature were shown to be the key factors affecting defoliation. High wind speed also deteriorated pine crown condition. Recent warmer winter and autumn seasons, increasing humidity of vegetation and decreasing wind speed over the dormant period should increase tolerance of pine trees to phytotocic affects of air pollutants including surface ozone and acid deposition in north-eastern part of Lithuania in the near future.","[Pociene, Lina; Augustaitis, Algirdas; Augustaitiene, Ingrida; Kliucius, Almantas; Pivoras, Gintaras] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Fac Forest & Ecol, LT-53362 Akademija, Kaunas Dstr, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Pociene, L (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Fac Forest & Ecol, LT-53362 Akademija, Kaunas Dstr, Lithuania.",lina.pociene@gmail.com; algirdas.augustaitis@asu.lt; i.augustaitiene@gmail.com; almantas.kliucius@asu.lt; gintaras.pivoras@gmail.com,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,1,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,2,,,,,111,116,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304698500020,0

To evaluate this impact, hydraulic parameters such as velocity, water depth, Froude Number (Fr) and fluctuation of flow regimes were measured and hydro biological conditions of water were estimated in 10 HPP cascade in the Virvyte river. Field experiment on the consequences of HPP turbines' operation was performed in natural, directly and indirectly impacted regimes. To determine the concentrations of suspended solids (SS), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), water samples were taken from each dam both upstream (reservoir) and downstream (river). To predict sedimentation and self-purification processes in the riverbed and in the flooded valley the mathematical-hydraulic modelling was used. It was established that all the HPP, where water flowed via the reservoirs and downstream through the HPP turbines, changed the natural regimes of SS. All the reservoirs trapped most SS including the finest ones. As a result, in the reservoir bed substrates the percentage of the particles with diameters <0.01 mm increased about threefold in comparison to that in the river bed. The direct correlation with the coefficients ranging from 0.35 to 0.94 was found between the reservoir capacities and the deposited amounts of these particles. The concentrations of SS were established to decrease due to water retention in the reservoirs. The TN and TP concentrations decreased some more than 10 % when the water stayed in the pond cascades. It was established, that even small dams and reservoirs of HPP may impact change in the environment through facility operations over a sustained period, because in pounded reaches nearby/above HPP dams in the Virvyte river low Fr number in habitats (0.04>Fr>0.0007) was determined. During the floods fine silt and clay particles rich in nutrients retention and self-purification of the rivers is more intensive when the HPP weirs are not high (H <= 4 m) and their ponds do not decrease the floodplain area.","[Vaikasas, Saulius; Palaima, Kestutis] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Water & Land Management, Water Res Inst, LT-58102 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Gjunsburgs, Boriss] Riga Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Water Engn & Technol Dept, LV-1048 Riga, Latvia",Vytautas Magnus University; Riga Technical University,"Vaikasas, S (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Water & Land Management, Water Res Inst, LT-58102 Kaunas, Lithuania.",s.vaikasas@delfi.lt; gjunsburgs@bf.rtu.lv,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,10,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,2,,,,,358,364,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304698500064,0

However, close examination of the interests at play in England's Atlantic world does not support the Whiggish view that the Glorious Revolution played a benign role in this story. In the decades after the Restoration, the cases of the Royal African Company and the Spanish slave trade in Jamaica are used to show that the competition between Crown and Parliament for control of regulation constrained interest groups on either side in their efforts to capture the profits of empire. Stuart 'tyranny' was not able to damage growth and relatively competitive (and peaceful) conditions underpinned very rapid increases in colonial output and trade. The resolution of the rules of the Atlantic game in 1689 allowed a consolidated state better to manipulate and manage the imperial economy in its own interests. More secure rent-seeking enterprises and expensive wars damaged growth and European rivals began a process of catch-up. The Glorious Revolution was not sufficient to permanently halt economic development but it was sufficient to slow progress towards industrial revolution.","Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Zahedieh, N (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland.",,,,,,,,116,28,32,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

A Cobb-Douglas cost function is employed to derive a learning curve model for wind power, thus illustrating how the investment costs for this technology are influenced by global learning-by-doing, scale effects, and a European R&D-based knowledge stock. We assume that public R&D expenses targeting wind power add to the above stock, and these R&D outlays are in turn hypothesized to be influenced by technology cost levels, the opportunity cost of public R&D as well as by government budget constraints. We estimate the learning and the R&D model, respectively, using a panel data set covering five European countries over the time period 1986-2002. The empirical results confirm the importance of both learning-by-doing and public R&D support in the cost reduction process, and governments' R&D expenses have declined in response to lowered investment costs. This is efficient in the sense that public funds are best targeted at technologies which are far from being commercial. The results also illustrate that governments in Europe have been sensitive to the opportunity cost of public R&D in the energy R&D budget process. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

With an increasing awareness of wetland ecosystem services, the extensive drainage is being questioned today. To guide policy-makers and landowners in their decision-making, we use a Choice Experiment to elicit the preferences of the general public for potential land use and activity changes in the Marais des Baux. These changes concern wetland restoration, the extent of tree hedges, recreational opportunities, mosquito control and biodiversity. Using a random parameter logit model, we take account of unobserved and observed preference heterogeneity, revealing that demand for a high level of biodiversity is conditional on respondents expressing a high level of environmental concern, and that parenthood raises the WTP for any future management alternative different from the current situation. Further, we find that mosquito control or attachment to the area is essential for support of large-scale wetland restoration. From the perspective of maximising the compensating surplus, the recommendation is to restore the wetland to one third of its original size in conjunction with biological control of mosquitoes, more tree hedgerows and recreational facilities, while increasing efforts to induce higher levels of biodiversity.

It focuses specifically on evaluating one form of environmental quality, distance from Environmental Protection Agency designated environmental hazards, via the single-family housing market in the Puget Sound region of Washington State. A spatial two-stage hedonic price analysis is used to: (i) estimate the marginal implicit price of distance from air release sites, hazardous waste generators, hazardous waste handlers, superfund sites, and toxic release sites; and (ii) estimate a series of implicit demand functions describing the relationship between the price of distance and the quantity consumed. The analysis, which represents an important step forward in the valuation of environmental quality, reveals that the information needed to identify second-stage demand functions is hidden right in plain sight-hanging in the aether of the regional housing market.","[Carruthers, John I.] US Dept Housing & Urban Dev, Washington, DC 20410 USA; [Clark, David E.] Marquette Univ, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",Marquette University,"Carruthers, JI (通讯作者)，US Dept Housing & Urban Dev, 451 7th St SW, Washington, DC 20410 USA.",john.i.carruthers@hud.gov; david.clark@marquette.edu,,,,,,,70,37,41,0,22,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-4146,,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

In order to design environmental taxes that are both efficient and acceptable to the public so that they can be politically feasible it is important to understand public attitudes towards environmental taxes. We conduct a focus group study in Norway to extend the current knowledge on this issue. We find less general resistance to taxation as a policy instrument, and seemingly more trust in government, than what has been reported in similar studies from other countries. The participants are, however, very skeptical and do not see the point of using the revenues from an environmental tax to reduce other taxes, such as the payroll tax. Instead they express a very strong preference for earmarking the revenues for environmental purposes. They also call for more information about environmental taxes, in particular on how the revenues are spent. Providing more information, including what the revenues are spent on irrespective of whether they are earmarked or not, would seem to provide a relatively cheap and possibly effective way to increase the public acceptability of new or increased environmental taxes.

We obtain measures of efficiency after allowing for environmental influences such as country macroeconomic conditions, accessibility of banking services and bank type. While these factors are assumed to directly influence the shape of the technology, we assume that country dummies and bank size directly influence technical inefficiency. The parameter estimates highlight that during the sample period, Islamic banking appears to be associated with higher input usage. Furthermore, by allowing for bank size and international differences in the underlying inefficiency distributions, we are also able to demonstrate statistically significant differences in inefficiency related to these factors even after controlling for specific environmental characteristics and Islamic banking. Thus, for example, our results suggest that Sudan and Yemen have relatively higher inefficiency while Bahrain and Bangladesh have lower estimated inefficiency. Except for Sudan, where banks exhibits relatively strong returns to scale, most sample banks exhibit very slight returns to scale, although Islamic banks are found to have moderately higher returns to scale than conventional banks. While this suggests that Islamic banks may benefit from increased scale, we would emphasize that our results suggest that identifying and overcoming the factors that cause Islamic banks to have relatively low potential outputs for given input usage levels will be the key challenge for Islamic banking in the coming decades.","[Saal, David S.] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Econ & Strategy Grp, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England; [Abdul-Majid, Mariani] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Sch Econ, Fac Econ & Business, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Battisti, Giuliana] Univ Nottingham, Ind Econ Div, Sch Business, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England",Aston University; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; University of Nottingham,"Saal, DS (通讯作者)，Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Econ & Strategy Grp, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England.",mariani@ukm.my; D.S.Saal@aston.ac.uk; Giuliana.Battisti@nottingham.ac.uk,"Abdul-Majid, Mariani/AAE-3801-2020","Abdul-Majid, Mariani/0000-0002-4730-332X; Saal, David/0000-0002-9542-9496",ESRC [ES/F03895X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F03895X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,65,96,102,2,46,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

A theoretical model of profit maximization by MA plans takes into account the tradeoffs of consumer preferences for annual premium versus outcomes of care in the hospital and other attributes of the plan. Hospital discharge databases for 13 states in 2006, maintained by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, are the main source of data. Risk-adjusted mortality rates are available for all non-maternity adult patients in each of 15 clinical categories in about 1,500 hospitals. All-adult postoperative safety event rates covering 9 categories of events are calculated for surgical cases in about 900 hospitals. Instrumental variables are used to address potential endogeneity of the choice of a MA plan. The key findings are these: enrollees in MA plans tend to be treated in hospitals with lower resource cost and higher risk-adjusted mortality compared to Fee-for-Service (FFS) enrollees. The risk-adjusted mortality measure is about 1.5 percentage points higher for MA plan enrollees than the overall mean of 4%. However, the rate of safety events in surgical patients favors MA plan enrollees-the rate is 1 percentage point below the average of 3.5%. These discrepant results are noteworthy and are plausibly due to greater discretion by the health plan in approving patients for elective surgery and as well as selecting hospitals for surgical patients. Emergency patients are generally excluded for the safety outcome measures. In addition, the current mortality measures may not adequately represent all surgical patients. Such caveats should be prominently highlighted when presenting comparative data. With that proviso, the study justifies informing Medicare beneficiaries about the mortality and safety outcome measures for hospitals being used by a MA plan compared to hospitals used by FFS enrollees.","[Friedman, Bernard; Jiang, H.

Because delegate votes on individual clauses at the Constitutional Convention were not publicly recorded, prior empirical analyses have been limited to inferred votes on a specific set of unrelated clauses. We extend this inquiry by inferring votes related to currency and debt issues which Beard put forth as the prime issues for those who owned personalty. Our analysis on these votes generates little support for a narrow version of the Beard thesis, which states that all personalty groups voted in a unified coalition at the Convention and supported the Constitution.

Aside from that, there has not been a strong connection between them. Previous books on post-Keynesian economics contain no chapter on environmental or ecological issues. This neglect has led leading ecological economists to criticize post-Keynesians for succumbing to the same growth paradigm as the neoclassical school. This paper argues that the two approaches are complementary in the sense that they each have different strong points. Ecological economics has correctly pointed out that the growth of the global economy may not be welfare-improving anymore, whereas post-Keynesians have gained valuable insights into the functioning of the capitalist growth process. To determine the feasibility of a synthesis between the two schools, the paper compares their approaches to the problems of production, consumption, and economic dynamics as well as the associated policy recommendations. It shows that on a theoretical level the two schools have much in common, but their policy conclusions differ with regard to the desirability of further growth. The paper concludes that a synthesis of both approaches may lead to a better understanding of how a capitalist economy operates in a natural environment with limits to growth and to better-informed policy advice.

An empirical measure for agricultural economic rent is used to quantify the desirability of a particular plot of land, which previous research proxies with variables such as distance to roads or urban areas, and simple climatic and edaphic variables. Results indicate that the measure for economic rent provides additional information and explanatory power to one of the most commonly used proxies, distance to roads. As predicted by economic theory, it is not simply access or variation in transportation costs that drives the spatial determinants of agricultural expansion, but the expected total returns from the venture. This suggests that spatially explicit rent models can be used to simulate the location and quantity of land-use change in an economically consistent framework. Such a framework lays the foundation for an enhanced methodology that can evaluate the ability of fiscal policy levers to influence the location of agricultural conversion with the ultimate aim of balancing economic and environmental goals.

There are use- and exchange-value concepts, as well as marginal and total measures, of energy quality. A factor augmentation or quality coefficients approach corresponds to the use-value definition while indicators based on distance functions and relative prices are exchange-value based definitions. These indicators are identical when the elasticity of substitution between fuels is infinity but diverge or cannot be computed for other interfuel elasticities of substitution. When the elasticity of substitution is zero only the quality coefficients approach is defined. I also show that 1) the ratio of an energy volume index to aggregate joules cannot be considered a complete indicator of aggregate energy quality as it does not account for quality changes in the component fuels 2) demand curve integrals do not provide information on relative use-values or fuel qualities when the elasticity of substitution is unity or less.

Most ecological economists will probably agree with this critique, because it is certainly true, when the welfare objective shifts from quantitative economic growth to preserving this planet as a life provisioning and enjoyable habitat for future generations So what constitutes and enhances ecologically sustainable welfare? To answer this question a number of scholars have highlighted the need for an alternative model of behaviour be it as a micro-foundation for a sustainability oriented welfare theory or as a normative guiding post to direct our concrete action and institutional change This article will show that Kenneth E Boulding developed such an alternative welfare approach, based on a communicative behavioural conception over about forty years of his academic career Founded on a communicative action his welfare theory is based on deliberative valuation (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved","Auckland Univ Technol, Fac Business, Auckland 1142, New Zealand",Auckland University of Technology,"Kesting, S (通讯作者)，Auckland Univ Technol, Fac Business, Private Bag 92006, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",,,,,,,,42,7,7,0,24,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

While we are gaining a greater understanding of the characteristics that are associated with successful institutions, we know less about why and how such institutions emerge and what role individual behaviors play in this process. The bottom-up emergence of institutions may depend on the patterns of heterogeneity in the cooperative behaviors of individual resource users. Likewise, the emerging institutions serve to constrain subsequent resource collection behaviors and alter those patterns. Because institutions both emerge from, and alter, the behaviors of individual resource users, it is useful to view the relationship between the two levels from a coevolutionary perspective. Here, I focus on the motivations for the adoption of conservation behavior and discuss how these behaviors can impact emerging institutions. This study is based on the harvest of a newly utilized, commercially valuable mushroom in two communities (geogs) in Bhutan. I examined which collectors exhibited each of two cooperative conservation behaviors, willingness to reduce one's harvest and punishment of noncompliant harvesting techniques and determined the traits associated with these behaviors. Using logistic regression I found that predictors from each of four domains, namely, economic factors, attitudes/values, knowledge/perceptions of resource scarcity, and social capital, are important for fostering conservation behavior. Other regarding values, high and low levels of wealth, perceptions of resource scarcity, and education are positively associated with a willingness to reduce ones harvest. Selfish values, high and low levels of wealth, and low levels of trust are associated with punishment. Changes in these individual characteristics may affect the frequency of cooperative acts and subsequently influence the success of the emerging institutions. As such, identifying the traits associated with the behaviors exhibited by individuals is an important step in understanding the dynamics of institutional evolution. Because this study captures perceptions and behaviors in the early stages of the harvest it can be used as the baseline for a longitudinal study exploring the coevolutionary dynamics between individual level behaviors and community level resource management institutions.

Our estimation results therefore strengthen the importance of the use of panel data and the incorporation of unobserved heterogeneity. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the sustainability assessment and selection process for the composition of the Dow Jones sustainability, indexes and thus factors that need not necessarily be directly connected to corporate environmental or social activities also have an influence.

Using three control and three treatment communities in a freshwater fishery, we tested whether participation in developing specific measures for community-based sustainable CPR management increased the willingness to contribute to the implementation of these measures. Each community was also exposed to information about their community leaders' advice about the proposed measures.

A regional overview on how these patterns influence the income of different types of milk producers was non-existent and would be a beneficial tool for targeting policies and development interventions. This paper examines the regionalized incomes derived from milk production by relating dry season length to milk production parameters for dairy farms. Cattle farms were assessed using two samples. Milk production in the dry and wet seasons was characterized by monthly net income from milk per cow.Sample A (97 farms) was classified according to a) herd size classes and b) performance in dry season milk production. Sample B (30 farms) assessed advanced farms that used more forage technologies than the others. The income from milk was related to environmental conditions by means of a countrywide map based on dry season length. The map was created by estimating the water balance for each month in a GIS. Yearly income from milk/cow was regionalized for the farm classifications and combined with agricultural census data. Results of the GIS analysis show a detailed zoning of dry season length and yearly income per cow from milk. Climate-income maps quantify the income ranges of the examined groups of farms. Climate change models predict temperature rise and decreasing precipitation for Honduras. In view of these trends the results can be used for an interpretation of farm vulnerability and resilience to climate change. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - Heavy users consuming chilli paste three to four times a week were recruited for consumer tests (n = 129). Two sessions of taste tests (with and without antioxidant information) were conducted for hedonic measurement of six ready-to-eat Thai chilli pastes. Antioxidant activity of the samples were analysed by DPPH and hydroxyl scavenging methods and reported relative to vitamin C. The four experimental and two commercial samples tested ranged between mild to medium hot levels classified by capsaicin quantity and were served using balanced first-order carry-over effect design. Principal component analysis and analysis of variance for split-plot design of the experiment were employed for data analysis. Findings - The key finding is that the antioxidant information had no significant effect on consumer liking (p > 0.05). Even though one of the research samples presented high antioxidant efficiency (1.63-1.80 times higher than commercial samples sold in market places), the sample received only low liking scores and liking was not increased when the antioxidant information was attached. An interaction effect occurred when commercial samples gained high liking scores and increased to even higher when antioxidant information was given with the samples. Research limitations/implications - The research was based on a target group of Thai consumers whose ages ranged between 18-40 years old and who were frequent consumers of the product. Also, the product tested in this research was not a principal meal item but was a condiment. Hence, caution must be exercised in generalising to other target groups or food products. Practical implications - Health benefit labelling by producers needs to take into account the usage context of the food. Health information provision may not boost consumer demand in all contexts. Originality/value - This is one of very few studies exploring the effect of health information provision on liking for a food that is not consumed as a main dish in large quantities, but rather as a condiment consumed in small quantities.","[Posri, Wilatsana; Toontom, Nitchara] Khon Kaen Univ, Fac Technol, Khon Kaen, Thailand; [Meenune, Mutita] Prince Songkla Univ, Fac Agroind, Hat Yai, Thailand",Khon Kaen University; Prince of Songkla University,"Posri, W (通讯作者)，Khon Kaen Univ, Fac Technol, Khon Kaen, Thailand.",wilatsana@yahoo.co.uk,"meenune, mutita/AAR-6402-2021",,,,,,40,5,5,0,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Findings - The findings indicate that nine types of attributes and six types of benefits as perceived by the consumers were found. The types of attributes were related to raw materials, taste, manner of baking, characteristics of the bread, outward appearance, quality, origin, package, and comparison with competing breads. The types of benefits were classified as functional, emotional, self-expressive, and social. Furthermore, two types of price benefits emerged (positive and negative). The targeted brand identity by the bakery and. the perceived image of the branded bread by the consumers were compatible. The brand image as perceived by the customers was varied. Practical implications - The bakery can utilize the findings in its marketing communication, advertising, campaigns, and when planning the assortment.

Design/methodology/approach - Cross-sectional data were collected through a pan-European consumer survey (a = 4,828) conducted in November and December 2007, with samples representative for gender, age and region, collected from six European countries: Spain, Italy, France, Belgium, Poland and Norway. First, information about the consumption of traditional food and the image of a typical TFC was provided through descriptive analysis. Next, the actual characteristics of TFC were assessed using partial least squares regression and these were discussed in the context of the theory of self-image congruity. Findings - Traditional food consumption patterns are stronger in the south than in the north of Europe. TFC across Europe are typically middle-aged to elderly, health-conscious, ethnocentric, food connoisseurs, who are attached to familiarity in their food choices and who very much enjoy cooking. Practical implications - The information about the profile, the image and the actual characteristics of TFC has practical implications for marketing and communicating about traditional foods, including their identification, differentiation, research and development and positioning in the European food market. Originality/value - Traditional food is currently undergoing a revival, with increased sales, consumer and regulatory interest. This paper provides cross-cultural results from a large pan-European consumer sample that provides highly relevant and useful information about the market potentials of the traditional food industry, which mostly consists of small-and medium-sized enterprises.

Adding violations to the indicators of measuring social responsibility on the basis of previous studies, collecting data on 683 listed companies, using multivariate statistical analysis, we prove that the enterprise fulfilling their social responsibility for all stakeholders (except the staff) has a positive effect on maximizing the benefits for shareholders. This is critical for better understanding of social responsibility, re-establishment of corporate values, and has significance for corporate to undertake social responsibilities voluntarily.","[Xu Wei; Liu Jiyi] Univ Jinan, Sch Management, Jinan 250022, Peoples R China",University of Jinan,,Sm_xuw@ujn.edu.cn; liujiyi123@yahoo.cn,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,5,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-1-921712-15-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,1278,1282,,,,,,5,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BYE76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298265500218,0

Despite its importance, most empirical studies do not impose monotonicity-probably because existing approaches are rather complex and laborious. Therefore, we propose a three-step procedure that is much simpler than existing approaches. We demonstrate how monotonicity of a translog function can be imposed regionally at a connected set (region) of input quantities. Our method can be applied not only to impose monotonicity on translog production frontiers but also to impose other restrictions on cost, distance, or profit frontiers.","[Henningsen, Arne; Henning, Christian H.

Employing a new disaggregated data set, it argues that bilateral treaties did not implement general free trade, but instead reduced tariffs unevenly through commodity-specific preferences, especially favoring manufactured goods. Gravity model estimates show that specific liberalizations increased exports of corresponding items, but not overall trade. Exporters from countries whose governments used bilateralism strategically to bring down partner tariffs benefitted most. Hence, the network in form and outcome is more properly identified with reciprocal liberalization practiced by the French than with British free-trade ideology.","Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Lampe, M (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Oster Farimagsgade 5,Bldg 26, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",ma.lampe@gmail.com,"LAMPE, MARKUS/A-3308-2012","LAMPE, MARKUS/0000-0002-0859-5091",,,,,48,32,34,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-0507,1471-6372,,J ECON HIST,J.

In PES schemes, payments can either be tied to indicators of actions for service provision or to indicators of the generated service itself Performance payments are synonymous for this second group, i.e. payments are completely contingent on the procurement of an environmental good or service. Such a focus raises several practical issues during implementation. We review and translate key aspects of the economic theory of incentives into the context of performance payment schemes with special attention paid to two practical issues: risks outside the individual's control and distortion in the measurement of environmental services. Four different incentive payment approaches are presented and the effects of risk and distortion on optimal incentives are discussed. The investigation of each payment approach is accompanied by a discussion of examples from the field. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The model uses the concepts of transition theory as a framework for assessing possible pathways by which a transition to a sustainable mobility society might happen. The modelling approach combines agent-based modelling techniques with a system dynamics structure. It is original in that there are two levels of agent. There are a small number of complex agents, which have an internal structure and are therefore subsystems within society, and a larger number of simple agents. Based on the UK data, the results show that Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles (FCVs) come to dominate, but only in the very long run (after 2030), while biofuels and ICE (Internal Combustion Engine)-electric hybrids are the main alternatives to the regime in the next 1030 years, because a) they are already developed and b) they fit better into current infrastructures. The model shows that technological transitions are most likely. Lifestyle change transitions require sustained pressure from the environment on society and behavioural change from consumers.

As a result, the market penetration of time-saving technologies for general household use is expected to affect both a household's (i) allocation of time across home production and leisure activities: and (ii) energy use. For example, with a household's adoption of a microwave ora dishwasher, cooking food and washing dishes will require less time, and therefore in-home meal preparation may increase. Households with microwaves or dishwashers may also opt to spend more time undertaking other production activities, inside or outside the home, or engage in more leisure (watching TV, reading, exercising). To the extent that time is reallocated from less to more energy-intensive activities in the home, residential energy use will increase as households adopt appliances that embody timesaving technology. Furthermore. an adoption of time-saving technologies for basic household chores, such as meal preparation and laundry, can impact energy use due to the fact that many time-saving technologies are more energy intensive than alternative technologies that require larger time commitments. In this paper, we use the Canadian Survey of Household Energy Use data from 2003 to examine the extent to which ownership of products that embody time-saving innovations affects time allocation and energy use at the household level.

As a result, losing a species could produce a cascading effect on other species. Fishery scientists advocate an ecosystem-based approach to fishery management to meet long-term sustainable goals. This paper models the complex interrelationships among species and the relationship between biomass growth and phenotypic diversity. We found that the equilibrium stock and catch/yield levels are overestimated when the diversity is not accounted for. Consequently, if species are diverse, fishery policy based on a single fishery management could overestimate catch potentials and potentially results in biological overfishing and stock collapse.

Eutrophication of coastal waters, for example, may be due to local urbanization and tourist development, but typically also stems from nutrient flows from agriculture away from coastal areas. To deal with this problem, catchment and coastal management need to be integrated. Management recommendations need to be supported by integrated analysis linking the geographically dispersed drivers of change from an appropriately interdisciplinary perspective. This paper presents an ecological-economic model that embeds existing food web models within fishery and tourism production functions. The aim is to identify optimal management strategies for catchments in which changes in nutrient loads have consequences for the relative abundance of economically important species. The model is calibrated on data for the Tonameca catchment, located on the coast of Oaxaca in Mexico. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Avila-Foucat, V.

Empirical evidence from appliance manufacturers in Germany,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Environmental innovation; Customer benefit; Environmental regulation; Environmental management; Green marketing; Electrical and electronic appliances,RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; MANAGEMENT; CORPORATE; POLICY; FIRMS,"Environmental product (EP) innovations and their determinants have received increasing attention from researchers during the past years. So far, empirical studies have shown inconsistent results, especially regarding the impact of regulation. In this paper, I seek to advance the understanding of EP-innovation by introducing and testing a novel research framework. First, a novel unit of analysis, the environmental issue level, is applied. EP-innovation is not studied in broad terms but specifically for four environmental issues that are relevant to the electrical and electronic appliances industry: energy efficiency, toxic substances, material efficiency, and electromagnetic fields. Second, the customer benefit, a concept from the green marketing literature, is included as an explanatory variable for EP-innovation for the first time. The argument is that green products which besides their public benefits have private environmental benefits for the customer (e.g., energy savings) will generate stronger consumer demand and can thus constitute the firm's motivation to implement those innovations in the first place. Third, EP-innovation is observed more comprehensively. measuring its extent and level of novelty. I apply this research framework to Study EP-innovations of German manufacturers of electrical and electronic appliances. My results support the issue level as unit of analysis. The impact of customer benefit and regulation on EP-innovation is analyzed with logit regression and the results clearly show that both Customer benefit and regulation play a key role for EP-innovation. They not only foster the implementation of EP-innovations but also their broad application and their level of novelty. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, the expansion and intensification of Canadian agriculture in the last century has significantly altered the structure and degraded the function of prairie ecosystems. This, combined with climate change, has put the ecological sustainability of the region at risk and raises questions about the region's ability to continue supporting millions of distant consumers. We use variants of two existing sustainability assessment tools, material flows analysis (MFA) and ecological footprint analysis (EFA) to estimate the terrestrial ecosystem area and other physical inputs used on the Canadian prairies to satisfy export demand and to link this production to documented processes of ecological degradation. We discuss the implications of this interregional framework for impact analysis and conclude that, in a globalizing, ecologically full-world, trade-dependence implies previously-ignored risks to both importers and exporters. The results underscore the importance for all countries to protect or restore their own natural capital assets and enhance their self-reliance. Citizens and their governments, particularly of countries that have become irreversibly import-dependent, have a direct interest in ensuring that the ecosystems that support them are sustainably managed, wherever in the world the latter may be located.

The results at the level of entire sectors suggest that the lack of information about energy consumption patterns and about energy efficiency measures, lack of staff time, priority setting within organizations, and - in particular - the investor/user dilemma are all relevant barriers. Allowing for sector-specific differences in the relevance of these individual barriers yields a more heterogeneous picture. The numbers and types of relevant barriers vary across sub-sectors, and the majority of sub-sectors are subject to relatively few barriers. The statistically most significant barriers are found for the sub-sector of public administrations. These findings are robust, independent of whether the definition of an organization's energy efficiency performance includes only measures that have actually been realized or also those that are being planned. For planned projects. however. organizations appear to underestimate internal priority setting as a barrier to energy efficiency. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Conventional adipic acid based on crude oil served as a benchmark. The work was carried out within the frame of the EU funded project BIOFOAM. The ecological aspects were addressed in the Life Cycle Perspective by performing a Life Cycle Assessment. The economic impacts were assessed by the application of the Life Cycle Costing under a 'total production cost' perspective. In this case, the addressee is interested in several steps of the value chain, but only of the steps that are related to the consortium as a single player in the value chain. The Life Cycle Working Environment method was used to assess the social impacts. Data sources were based on the project consortium, literature and statistics.

This study models a payment for environmental services intervention in an experimental field laboratory in Nyanza Province, Kenya. Upstream and downstream individuals are paired in a standard investment game, in which the upstream mover's investment represents land use decisions and the downstream mover responds with a choice of compensation payment. The experimental intervention introduces an enforcement treatment on the downstream movers' compensation decisions for a single round. Underlying social preferences and identity appear to shape individual transactions between upstream and downstream individuals. Upstream first movers are sensitive to the removal of the enforcement on their downstream partners in the second round, and make decisions consistent with crowding out of social preferences.

The focus is on two French cross-compliance measures (compulsory buffer strips along rivers and crop diversity). A farm-level bio-economic model incorporating yield uncertainty is built and adjusted to represent two typical arable farms in the Southwest of France. The model also combines agro-environmental indicators. The results indicate that a simple decoupling of direct payments, without cross-compliance measures, has no impact on allocations between different crops. If cross-compliance measures are imposed, a small reduction in the cultivated area of irrigated crops is observed. The penalty levied (1% of the total subsidy paid) when farmers do not comply with the buffer strips requirement is sufficient for both farm-types. Decoupling and modulation result in a fall in the total gross margin of around 3%, principally because of the 5% modulation rate, while the buffer strips requirement leads to a further decrease of around 1%. Moreover, this requirement improves the environmental indicators at the farm level. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We developed values for end of the year herbaceous standing crop and utihzation required to attain these management goals for rangeland in poor to excellent condition. Based on extensive field research conducted in this region over 5 decades, range condition in this model is programmed to decline in response to three factors: excessive grazing pressure, below average precipitation, and an increase in woody plants. Earning capacity is four times higher for range in excellent condition than that in poor condition. For all initial range condition (RC) values, simulated stocking rates that maintained RC resulted in simulated mean weaning weights 93-94% of maximum. Maximum short-term and long-term profit is attained at higher stocking rates than would maintain long-term range condition and at much higher levels than would increase range condition levels. When stocked for maximum profit, individual animal performance was 90% of maximum. The model predicts that low stocking rates allow range condition to improve. At these recovery stocking rates, total 30-year profits were found to be 78%-87% of the stocking rates that would maintain range condition, and only 67%-75% of stocking rates that would maximize profit. Predictions of the end of year standing crop to maintain range condition were in broad agreement with the 1000 kg ha(-1) advised for this region. To improve range condition, the model predicts that an end of year standing crop of 1500-2000 kg ha(-1) is required, compared to the generally advised level of 1200-1500 kg ha(-1). The predicted end of year forage standing crops for the maximum profit goal are well below the advised 800 kg ha(-1) threshold required to prevent degradation for all of the initial range conditions that were simulated. To ensure maintenance of range in excellent condition, our results concur with the advised utilization levels of 20-25%. However, for range in poorer than excellent condition, the model predicted much lower utilization levels were needed to maintain or improve range condition. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This article uses a new sample of frontier families linked between the 1860, 1870, and 1880 U.S. Censuses to study mobility and wealth accumulation. Using the incidence of Confederate guerilla warfare in frontier counties to generate exogenous migration, I find the effect of persistence on wealth accumulation is insignificant. Also, young, blue-collar, and landless families-those with the highest net benefits of migration-were the most likely to move. These findings reflect widespread economic opportunity on the frontier.","Energy Serv Div, Cadmus Grp, Portland, OR 97205 USA",,"Stewart, JI (通讯作者)，Energy Serv Div, Cadmus Grp, 720 SW Washington St,Suite 400, Portland, OR 97205 USA.",econjim@gmail.com,,,,,,,36,16,20,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-0507,1471-6372,,J ECON HIST,J.

We argue that differences in the potential productivity of a match (typically assumed to be known in the previous literature) generates a surplus between the minimum wage the worker is willing to accept and the maximum wage the firm is willing to offer for the job. Existence of this surplus leads to wage dispersion due to negotiating over the amounts extracted by each agent. Our objective is to estimate the surplus extracted by each firm-worker pair and the effect of the net extracted surplus on the wage, for each firm-worker pair using the two-tier stochastic frontier model. An empirical application finds that, on average, firms paid workers less than their expected productivity. More specifically, at the mean, the net effect of productivity uncertainty leads to equilibrium wages which are 3.33% below the expected productivity of matches.","[Kumbhakar, Subal C.] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Parmeter, Christopher F.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Kumbhakar, S (通讯作者)，SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",kkar@binghamton.edu; parms@vt.edu,,,,,,,52,61,74,3,51,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The CDM has been subject to extensive discussion in academic literature during the last few years, and this article reviews that literature in order to sum up its main themes. A common assessment is that the current structure of the CDM leads to a focus on cheap emissions reductions at the expense of sustainable development benefits for the host countries. Recently, the questionable additionality of many CDM projects has become a central issue. The article further argues that whereas a substantial body of work exists on the CDM, this work is mainly preoccupied with a 'fine-tuning' of the mechanism. As the CDM now becomes increasingly institutionalized, scholars should also take a step back and study the CDM in a more theoretically oriented way.","Lund Univ, Dept Polit Sci, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Paulsson, E (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Polit Sci, POB 52, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",emma.paulsson@svet.lu.se,,,,,,,87,107,117,0,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Critical natural capital represents a multidimensional concept, as it mirrors the different frameworks of various scientific disciplines and social groups in valuing nature. This article revisits the concept of critical natural capital and examines its relation to the concept of ecological resilience. I propose that ecological resilience can help a great deal in specifying the 'ecological criticality' of specific renewable parts of the natural capital. More specifically, I suggest that the degree of ecological resilience is inversely related to the degree of threat ecosystems are prone to. The concept of ecological resilience may complement other measures, such as integrity or vulnerability, in estimating the degree of threat specific ecosystems are exposed to. The empirical estimates of ecological resilience add a further criterion in order to build a comprehensive and clear conception of critical natural capital. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The continued growth of the maquila industry suggests that there may be significant production spillovers into the local environments. Dynamic modeling, using STELLA, provides a framework for quantifying the environmental impacts emanating from the growth of the maquila industry, focusing on wastewater treatment consequences and resulting infrastructural policy considerations. Such detailed modeling of industrial, infrastructural, and ecological linkages has not yet been a feature of research on this region, despite the potential for significant human health ramifications. An environmental model is therefore developed for two focal urban communities, Nogales and Mexicali, facing potential wastewater treatment concerns due to the growth of nearby maquila factories.

The exotic status of pineapple is gone and suppliers focus on differentiating their product to maintain a competitive edge in the market place, such as with Del Monte's MD-2 hybrid. A lucrative niche market has emerged for organic pineapple at national and international levels. There even exists a sustained demand for processed organic pineapple. The Pineapple Growers Association, Eastern Cape, RSA, requested the development of a certified organic pineapple production strategy that could be widely embraced by commercial producers. A producer friendly strategy, limiting the number of operations and utilising off-the-shelf certified inputs would be ideal. An observational trial to explore various approaches was initiated, commencing with a two year conditioning period to maximise soil aeration and drainage, manipulate soil mineral levels and balances toward the optimum and to stimulate the inherent soil biology levels. The natural plant crop harvest occurred in 2005/6 with organic fruit yields ranging between 71 and 104 t ha(-1) whilst standard inorganic production was 73 t ha(-1). The plant crop fruit cycle coincided with an extremely wet 2005 winter, resulting in high levels of plant root mortality.

Which bias in technical change can be observed? Is it more input-saving or pollution-reducing? For illustration purposes the proposed approach is used to analyze the performance of 14 countries of the European Union for the period 1995-2004. An average eco-productivity growth of 22% is observed. The estimated contribution of improved use of input is 20% and that of reduced relation of greenhouse gas emissions is 23%.

Extending the Capozza and Helsey model (1989) to the case of uncertainty in future land use zoning, a spatialized hedonic model is proposed to estimate such anticipation phenomena at a fine level (cadastral unit). Estimations use Mixed Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) techniques with a two-stage model that links agricultural and developable land markets. This allows for mapping varying spatial parameters that measure anticipation effects within the theoretical framework. Results confirm the influence of anticipation on agricultural land prices in the Provence region. Moreover, the level of data spatialization allows us to take into account intra-municipalities' heterogeneity of land use conversion anticipation.","[Geniaux, Ghislain; Napoleone, Claude] INRA Ecodev, F-84914 Avignon 9, France; [Ay, Jean-Sauveur] INRA, CESAER, UMR 1041, F-21079 Dijon, France",INRAE; INRAE; Institut Agro; AgroSup Dijon,"Geniaux, G (通讯作者)，INRA Ecodev, Domaine St Paul, F-84914 Avignon 9, France.",geniaux@avignon.inra.fr; jsay@dijon.inra.fr; cnapoleone@avignon.inra.fr,"NAPOLEONE, Claude/AAM-7079-2021; Ay, Jean-sauveur jsay/F-9868-2018","Napoleone, Claude/0000-0001-6847-0752",,,,,38,27,31,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Second, we analyse some of the determinants of productivity growth. We find that, on the one hand, there is a positive relationship between market concentration and technology adoption; on the other hand, both technology adoption and human capital promote productivity, whilst market concentration exerts a negative influence on it.

Here, we focus on farmer health impacts resulting from Bt-related changes in chemical pesticide use. Previous studies have documented that Bt cotton has reduced the problem of pesticide poisoning in developing countries, but they have failed to account for unobserved heterogeneity between technology adopters and non-adopters. We use unique panel survey data from India to estimate unbiased effects and their developments over time. Bt cotton has reduced pesticide applications by 50%, with the largest reductions of 70% occurring in the most toxic types of chemicals. Results of fixed-effects Poisson models confirm that Bt has notably reduced the incidence of acute pesticide poisoning among cotton growers. These effects have become more pronounced with increasing technology adoption rates. Bt cotton now helps to avoid several million cases of pesticide poisoning in India every year, which also entails sizeable health cost savings. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

One of the questions is how the decisions made by participants in rural communities are influenced by their experience. This paper presents the results of field experiments in Colombia and Thailand on fishery resources. Context information is derived from the communities via in-depth interviews, surveys and role playing exercises. The use of different methodological tools allowed to link decisions in field experiments with contextual variables for two fishery villages. Explanation of core variables in social dilemmas is given, the degree of cooperation levels, preferred rules, rule compliance and enforcement. Main findings include: i) fishermen made decisions in the field experiments that reflected their own experience and context, ii) agreements for rule crafting are possible only under specific conditions that guarantees livelihoods and sustainability, iii) the broader context determines cooperation levels at a local level, iv) inequalities in the sanctioning of rule breakers decrease the possibilities of reaching cooperation agreements, and v) high levels of trust among local fishermen is not a sufficient condition for resource sustainability, when trust in external rule makers and enforcers is low.

Several reports sponsored by the gas industry have estimated the economic effects of the shale gas extraction on incomes, employment, and tax revenues. None of these reports has been published in an economics journal and therefore have not been subjected to the peer review process. Yet these reports may be influential to the formation of public policy. This commentary provides written reviews of several studies purporting to estimate the economic impact of gas extraction from shale beds.

Its emergence is therefore not to be neglected in attempts to create a more sustainable society. The aim of this study is to generate insight into the culture and worldview of contemporary spirituality and explore its potentials and pitfalls for sustainable development. An investigation of the sociological literature on the so-called New Age phenomenon results in a delineation and overview of these and shows that this culture is both a potentially promising force, as well as a phenomenon posing specific risks. A structural-developmental understanding is introduced in order to be able to distinguish between regressive and progressive tendencies in this culture, and comprehend the deeper logic behind the observed potentials and pitfalls. This may serve to facilitate the actualization of the culture's potentials while mitigating its pitfalls, and in that way contribute to the timely challenge of creating a more sustainable society.

We examine the role and authority of a new type of actor that has recently emerged on the global stage-the social entrepreneur, who tackles social and ecological problems with entrepreneurial means. We consider them as agents that perform functions and provide services that have been considered to be the sole authority of states. For instance, the provision of water services has long been considered an exclusive task of the state. The water sector therefore serves as a good example to explore how these agents come up with their own missions and political agendas. Via an illustrative sample of social entrepreneurs from around the world, we explore their relation to water governance in general and the hydraulic mission in particular. We propose that their innovative potential serves as their main source of authority.

Unlike other studies of adaptation, this paper examines the differences between private irrigation and public irrigation schemes based on around 1400 farm surveys collected across seven countries in South America which recorded detailed water schemes. We analyze the choice of water schemes in the first stage and the land values for each scheme in the second stage. We find that public irrigations do not increase in response to a warmer climate, but private irrigations do. On the other hand, we find that public irrigation schemes are provided primarily as a response to water scarcity. Moreover, we find that private irrigations are taken gradually while public irrigations are provided as a lump sum, resulting in either too much or too little provision. Therefore, public adaptations to climate change will likely involve two inefficiencies. No provision of irrigation in a hotter climate may result from a lack of knowledge. Overprovision of irrigation in dry zones may result from a lump-sum provision of a public good. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Adequate handling requires the development of sound procedures for identification of uncertainty and ignorance (U&I), reduction of URA. decisions on how to treat irreducible U&I and monitoring of unexpected effects. The nature of U&I implies, however, that these procedures will be highly incomplete. Governance mechanisms that facilitate cooperative adaptation and communicative rationality are therefore needed. The three governance regimes (GRs) compared are: GMcrops are produced by private firms and these firms are made liable for harm (GR1); GM-crops are produced by private firms and the government decides whether the crops should be marketed (GR2); and GM-crops are produced and the government decides whether the crops should be marketed (GR3). The effect of bringing the civil society into the decision-making process is also analyzed. GR3 will be stronger in cooperative adaptation and communicative rationality than GR2. Public research organizations have fewer conflicts of interest with the government than private firms, and academic norms are important Difficulties in proving harm and identifying the responsible firm will make GR1 weak in cooperative adaptation and communicative rationality.

This paper aims to analyse the public perception of regional wines with designation of origins. Design/methodology/approach - A semi-structured questionnaire was administered to a sample of wine consumers in national wine shows in Rome and the provinces. The questionnaire aimed at testing consumers' knowledge and preferences toward wines with a designation of origin produced within the Lazio region. A multivariate analysis has clustered consumers according to their behaviors in relation to wines with a designation of origin. A perception analysis relative to the knowledge and meaning of designations of origins was further performed. The latter has made it possible to rank regional wines and to establish the market effect of designations of origin. Findings - With regard to behaviors toward wines with a designation of origin, the data suggest three ideal-types of customers: sensible (i.e. customers knowledgeable of the meaning of designations of origins); indifferent; and thrifty (i.e. customers who understand the importance of designation of origins but are also conscious of price). The conclusions indicate that a designation of origin is a necessary but not a sufficient factor for having a good market performance. Research limitations/implications - Implications in terms of marketing strategies are evident: wine production is characterized by different worlds of production and marketing strategies should be consequential. Originality/value - The enthusiasm towards designations of origin is not always justified: the proliferation of designations of origin can de-sensitize consumers with dramatic effects on rural territories whose economy rotates around the production of quality wines.

It has great importance and mainly addressed to agriculture and forestry. Fodder galega is relatively new legume species successfully cropped in Lithuanian agrophytocoenoses. This species mainly used as forage plant. As a new crop in the landscape, galega, which can attain a height of up to 1.4 m under Lithuania conditions, may have a significant visual impact, especially, when plants achieve flowering stage. Nonetheless, galega' alternative usage as energy source should be discussed. In this study was evaluated ability of galega to provide environmental sustainable and renewable energy source at different growth stages and during vegetation in total. Field trials carried out at the Research Station of Lithuanian University of Agriculture on a sandy moraine humic horizon of Calcary-Epihypogleyic Luvisol (LVg-p-w-cc). This plant has many valuable properties. Galega crop is notable for its longevity, high overwintering peculiarities and heavy yield. Fodder galega is high-productive plant and ensure 60 - 75 t ha(-1) green mass, 15 - 17 t ha(-1) hay, 14.79 t ha(-1) dray matter and 0.3 - 0.7 t ha(-1) seed. The species is among the earliest fodder plants in Lithuanian agrophytocoenoses. Its vegetation begins early (1-10 of April) and it achieves flowering stage in the end of May. Average duration of galega development to the seed maturity under conditions of Middle Lithuania is 98 - 102 days. Galega growing season lasts a long time, from early spring until late autumn. Depending on meteorological conditions its vegetation finishes in the end of October - beginning of November. Thus fodder galega is high valuable as suitable supplement for green conveyer. Galega production is characterized by low fertilizer and pesticide requirements making it a relatively benign crop environmentally. The productivity and chemical composition of fodder galega depend on development stage. Content of crude fibre and dry matter increases with the stages of plant development and the best energy value of green mass is received in case of galega' harvesting in the flowering stage. Maturation of the crop increase in crude fibre content up to 285 g kg(-1) DM, thus reducing their digestibility, but increasing energetic value output to 10.79 MJ kg(-1). Therefore long-term fodder galega can be used as energetic plant producing sufficient biomass yield with high energetic value. Three-cut system at plant flowering stage guaranteed to obtain a heavy biomass yield with higher energy content. Moreover, this undemanding plant can be linked to exploited in abandoned areas of biomass production and thereby protect these areas from forest overgrowth.","[Balezentiene, Ligita] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Environm, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,,ligita.balezentiene@asu.lt,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,1,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,1,,,,,303,307,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304706000048,0

Most of these large shocks can be explained by major recessions and World War II as well as by monetary policy for the interest rate data. We also find that some economic events seem to have the same effect (immediate, transitory or permanent) on a number of macroeconomic series.

Design/methodology/approach - The total polypheol content of 39 fresh and 159 commercial (100 percent and less than 50 percent) fruit juices was analyzed by the terbium sensitized fluorescence method. The ANOVA with Tukey post hoc test, and also an independent t-test, were used for statistical analyses. Findings - The mean polyphenol contents of fresh juices were significantly (p < 0.001) higher than those of 100 percent commercials (5.34 +/- 2.7 vs 3.28 +/- 0.86 mg/l).

For analysing the polyphenol contents, the newly developed terbium sensitized fluorescence method was used, and also the applicability of this new method was compared with the commonly used Folin-Ciocalteau method.","[Nikniaz, Zeinab] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Fac Hlth & Nutr, Tabriz, Iran; [Mahdavi, Reza; Jouyban, Abolghasem] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, DARC, Tabriz, Iran; [Rafraf, Maryam] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Nutr Res Ctr, Tabriz, Iran",Tabriz University of Medical Science; Tabriz University of Medical Science; Tabriz University of Medical Science,"Nikniaz, Z (通讯作者)，Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Fac Hlth & Nutr, Tabriz, Iran.",znikniaz@gmail.com,"nikniaz, zeinab/L-5912-2017; Jouyban, Abolghasem/ABB-7335-2020; Mahdavi, Reza/C-4773-2017","nikniaz, zeinab/0000-0001-6522-1048; Jouyban, Abolghasem/0000-0002-4670-2783; Mahdavi, Reza/0000-0002-5444-2395; rafraf, maryam/0000-0002-2593-1253",Drug Applied Research Center (DARC) in Tabriz University of Medical Sciences,Drug Applied Research Center (DARC) in Tabriz University of Medical Sciences,The authors wish to thank the Drug Applied Research Center (DARC) in Tabriz University of Medical Sciences for the financial support.,,36,10,11,1,50,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This is why studies have been published in which wages are compared with other living standard indicators. Following this line of research, our paper examines the evolution of welfare among Biscayan miners between 1876 and 1936 by contrasting real wages, Human Development Index and height. An additional contribution of the paper is that we relate the high morbi-mortality in the Biscayan working-class neighbourhoods with market failures derived from urbanisation, a connection not explicitly considered in the literature on living standards during the Industrial Revolution. These market failures were known by liberal politicians because the hygienists urged the intervention of the State to correct or, at least, ease them. However, the town councils in the Bilbao mining zone took more than 20 years to put into practice the measures proposed by the hygienists.","[Escudero, Antonio] Univ Alicante, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, E-03080 Alicante, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant,"Escudero, A (通讯作者)，Univ Alicante, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, Campus San Vicente, E-03080 Alicante, Spain.",escudero@aea.ua.es,,,,,,,96,23,23,1,21,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

There is a continuous struggle to allocate the earth's resources among users and uses. This article argues that distributional problems have two faces: access to basic resources or ecospace; and, the allocation of environmental resources, risks, burdens, and responsibilities for causing problems. Furthermore, addressing problems of access and allocation often requires access to social processes (science, movements and law). Analysts, however, have tended to take a narrow, disciplinary approach although an integrated conceptual approach may yield better answers. This article proposes a multi-disciplinary perspective to the problem of access and allocation and illustrates its application to water management and climate change.","[Gupta, Joyeeta] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Gupta, Joyeeta] UNESCO IHE Inst Water Educ, Delft, Netherlands; [Lebel, Louis] Chiang Mai Univ, Unit Social & Environm Res, Chiang Mai 50000, Thailand",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; Chiang Mai University,"Gupta, J (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",joyeeta.gupta@ivm.vu.nl,"Gupta, Joyeeta/L-8672-2013; Quinn, Patrick/B-5489-2010; Lebel, Louis/D-4130-2014","Gupta, Joyeeta/0000-0003-1424-2660; Lebel, Louis/0000-0001-6187-6418",,,,,89,55,58,1,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Ultimately, only owner and collective coworker discrimination can explain baseball's slow pace of integration.

Protecting habitat at both ends of its range has been identified as a high priority action. An estimated 90% of the species' global population overwinters on the island of Hispaniola, where ongoing habitat loss is a severe problem. Preventing further loss of Bicknell's thrush habitat on Hispaniola will require, among other efforts, establishing conservation areas on private lands, where success will depend on cooperation with landowners. This paper considers a voluntary incentive program to landowners in the Dominican Republic to yield a cost-effective network of protected habitat to sustain overwintering Bicknell's thrush populations. TAMARIN, a Geographic Information System (GIS) based model, evaluates the economic and ecological considerations for a voluntary bid scenario where landowners sell their property rights to a government agency or non-governmental organization. Results indicate that two scientific reserves in northeastern Dominican Republic could be connected under one viable forest fragment valued at US $5.5 x 10(6), increasing the total protected land by 87% to 19,357 ha. Incorporating the spatial variability of economic costs and biological benefits into a conservation program, such as the Bicknell's Thrush Habitat Protection Fund will help planners achieve habitat conservation at least cost.

J,"Stern, DI",,,,"Stern, David I.",,,Between estimates of the emissions-income elasticity,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Carbon; Sulfur; Environmental Kuznets curve; Between estimator,ENVIRONMENTAL KUZNETS CURVE; MONTE-CARLO; TESTS,Recent papers by Wagner and Vollebergh et al. point out some fundamental econometric problems with traditional methods of estimating the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) and propose alternative approaches that avoid these issues. Wagner notes that traditional methods do not take into account the presence of powers of unit root variables and cross-sectional dependence in the data while Vollebergh et al. point out that the time effects are not uniquely identified in the EKC model. The between estimator is a simple estimator that also addresses the concerns of these authors. It makes no a priori assumption about the nature of the time effects and is likely to provide consistent estimates of long-run relationships in real world data situations. I apply several common panel data estimators including the between estimator to OECD and global carbon and sulfur emissions datasets. The between estimates of the sulfur-income elasticity are 0.732 in the OECD and 1.067 in the global data set and the estimated carbon-income elasticity is 1.612 in the OECD and 1.509 globally.

This paper builds on this framework to obtain a sample selection correction for the stochastic frontier model. We first show a surprisingly simple way to estimate the familiar normal-half normal stochastic frontier model using maximum simulated likelihood. We then extend the technique to a stochastic frontier model with sample selection. In an application that seems superficially obvious, the method is used to revisit the World Health Organization data (WHO in The World Health Report, WHO, Geneva 2000; Tandon et al. in Measuring the overall health system performance for 191 countries, World Health Organization, 2000) where the sample partitioning is based on OECD membership. The original study pooled all 191 countries. The OECD members appear to be discretely different from the rest of the sample. We examine the difference in a sample selection framework.","NYU, Stern Sch Business, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA",New York University,"Greene, W (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, Dept Econ, 44 W 4th St,Rm 7-78, New York, NY 10012 USA.",wgreene@stern.nyu.edu,,,,,,,41,126,140,0,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,,,J PROD ANAL,J.

This study also conducts a comparative analysis of the efficiency across countries and between conventional and Islamic banks. Moreover, we examine the bank-specific variables that may explain the sources of inefficiency. The empirical results indicate that banks in the Gulf region are relatively more efficient at generating profits than at controlling costs. We also find that in terms of both cost and profit efficiency levels, the conventional banks on average are more efficient than Islamic banks. Furthermore, we observe a positive correlation of cost and profit efficiency with bank capitalization and profitability, and a negative one with operation cost. Higher loan activity increases the profit efficiency of banks, but it has a negative impact on cost efficiency.","King Saud Univ, Riyadh Community Coll, Riyadh 11437, Saudi Arabia",King Saud University,"Srairi, SA (通讯作者)，King Saud Univ, Riyadh Community Coll, POB 28095, Riyadh 11437, Saudi Arabia.",srairisamir3@gmail.com,,"srairi, samir/0000-0002-4244-3921",,,,,76,126,137,0,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

We use data from a large grocery retailer to match transactions that were recorded by the retailer (at the store) and by the Homescan panelist (at home). The matched data allow us to identify and document discrepancies between the two data sets in reported shopping trips, products, prices, and quantities. We find that the discrepancies are largest for the price variable, and show that they are due to two effects: the first seems like standard recording errors (by Nielsen or the panelists), while the second is likely due to the way Nielsen imputes prices. We present two simple applications to illustrate the impact of recording differences, and we use one of the applications to illustrate how the validation study can be used to adjust estimates obtained from Nielsen Homescan data. The results suggest that while recording discrepancies are clearly present and potentially impact results, corrections, like the one we employ, can be adopted by users of Homescan to investigate the robustness of their results to such potential recording differences.","[Nevo, Aviv] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Einav, Liran] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Einav, Liran; Nevo, Aviv] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Leibtag, Ephraim] USDA, ERS, Washington, DC 20250 USA",Northwestern University; Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Nevo, A (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",leinav@stanford.edu; eleibtag@ers.usda.gov; nevo@northwestern.edu,,,,,,,12,93,121,1,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

Within this context, the aim of this paper is to examine to what extent individuals express different preferences when adopting a personal or a social/citizen perspective. While this paper provides some support for the hypothesis that individuals express different preferences when adopting collective as opposed to personal choices, reported willingness to pay (WTP) was found to be insensitive to whether or not the respondents were asked the WIT question from a personal or social perspective.

One was affordability: the Northern schools had lower direct costs relative to income. The second was the greater autonomy of local governments. The third was the greater diffusion of voting power among the citizenry in much of the North, especially in rural communities. The distribution of local political voice appears to be a robust predictor of tax support and enrollments, both within and between regions.

The article investigates the period between the 1920s and the 1970s, and focuses on joint-stock companies. Using comparative data on the number of cases, we show that in Italy firms mainly used the procedure called fallimento (bankruptcy), consisting of the collection and subsequent liquidation of assets. Other procedures, such as deals with creditors or forms of receivership, able to give companies a further chance, were rarely used. On the basis of archival documents we maintain that this result was due to the strictness and complication of Italian procedures, as well as to their inability to select viable companies. The article also investigates the relation between the features of insolvency law and the nature of the Italian industrial system, specifically the peculiar small size and rapid turnover of joint-stock companies. We suggest that the pro-liquidation character Of the insolvency law might have been one of the causes of the peculiarity of Italian industrial capitalism, even if the opposite direction of causality cannot be excluded.","[Di Martino, Paolo] Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; Univ Siena, I-53100 Siena, Italy",University of Manchester; University of Siena,"Di Martino, P (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",,"vasta, michelangelo/ABC-5933-2021","vasta, michelangelo/0000-0002-8683-8095",,,,,35,7,7,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

We find that meaningful progress has been made in econometric and monocentric models extended to account for multiple sources of spatial heterogeneity and in the development of general equilibrium models with spatial dynamics. Despite these advances, more work is needed in developing models with greater realism. Most agent-based computational models of urban land use change currently lack economic fundamentals, but provide a flexible means of linking microlevel behavior and interactions with macrolevel land use dynamics. In combination with empirical methods to identify parameters, this framework provides a promising approach to modeling spatial land use dynamics and policy effects.","Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Irwin, EG (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, 2120 Fyffe Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",irwin.78@osu.edu,,"Irwin, Elena/0000-0001-7908-5964",,,,,110,94,113,4,95,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

This might have an effect on the fundamental character of such cities. Second, the effect of home owners' financial interests as landowners on their decisions about what regulations or investments in their communities to support may become stronger. Third, researchers may now be able to better use land prices to make inferences about urban demand. However, interpreting real estate prices still is tricky.","Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Sinai, T (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 1465 Steinberg Hall Dietrich Hall,3620 Locust Wal, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",sinai@wharton.upenn.edu,,,,,,,48,8,8,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

We develop spatially-explicit, dynamic optimal control strategies for a large class of invasion problems using linear-quadratic control. This approach allows us to produce new insights that help guide policy that could not have emerged from existing models. We assume adults are sedentary, and heterogeneous patches are connected via dispersal of offspring. We develop a generalized approach to optimally manage species across time and space and apply the framework to several examples, primarily based on Spartina alterniflora. General conclusions are drawn and we show that strong connectivity makes invasive control much more costly, demonstrating that reducing connectivity can be a cost-effective part of invasive species control.

I analyze this approach and draw on the functional ecology literature to offer an alternative emphasizing the role species play in their ecosystems. The aim is to create a working ecosystem on the Ark rather than a collection of charismatic and distinct species. To do so, I construct a new measure of a species' ecological importance and an ecological objective appropriate for cost-effective resource allocation. The ecological approach fundamentally changes the notion of species-value from a direct value based on a species' appearance or taxonomic difference to an indirect value based on a species' ecological role in its ecosystem. in the process, 'populations' of species become the fundamental unit of biodiversity rather than 'species', and abiotic processes also possess value. When compared to the economic approach, the ecological approach prioritizes different species for the Ark and achieves superior economic outcomes in all but the mythical Noah's Ark scenario where interactions are non-existent. The analysis challenges the approach of US endangered species legislation and I call for a reformulation based on endangered ecological interactions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - In total, 23 samples sold in international stores as Tarrazu coffee were bought. A cupper evaluated these samples using the international cupping procedures for the quality attributes aroma, fragrance, body and acidity. Of the 23 samples, five were used in a triangle test carried out by a panel of 12 non-expert consumers to determine if their discriminations matched the expert's judgment. Findings - Results from the cupper gave a high variability of the coffees evaluated. The results of the consumer panel demonstrated that discrimination between coffees by consumers was predicted by acidity differences assessed by the copper. The same held for body but not necessarily for fragrance and aroma. Originality/value - The paper revealed that discrimination between the coffees by the consumer panel matched the coffee copper's evaluation differences. The high consistency of the results obtained from the consumer panel underpins that the respondents did not have much difficulty in rating the coffees with the same scores as the professional coffee judge. Thus, differences in coffee quality, notably with respect to acidity, are important to consider in coffee production and marketing as consumers can perceive them and thus use this information when deciding whether or not to buy the product again.","[Linnemann, Anita R.] Wageningen Univ, Prod Design & Qual Management Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Arce Alvarado, Randall] Univ Nacl, Ctr Int Polit Econ CINPE, Heredia, Costa Rica",Wageningen University & Research; Universidad Nacional Costa Rica,"Linnemann, AR (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Prod Design & Qual Management Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",anita.linnemann@wur.nl,"Brain, Joshua/B-8769-2012; Linnemann, Anita/O-7509-2014","Linnemann, Anita/0000-0003-3201-3343; Arce Alvarado, Randall/0000-0001-7784-3944",,,,,21,15,14,1,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

A contrast was searched between controllable and non-controllable hazards. Design/methodology/approach The Perceived Food Risk Index developed by Fife-Schaw and Rowe, was administered to a sample of 666 subjects through a door to door interview using a random route walk procedure and following a quota sampling controlled for sex, age and location. Risk perception was evaluated over ten risk characteristics, for each of the hazards. Findings Through principal component analysis, two main components were identified: Knowledge and Dread. A perceptual map of the hazards was built over these two dimensions. A high level of worry and concern associated with fatty foods was found, clearly contradicting the expected attenuation of risk perception associated to greater perceived personal control. Contrarily to previous findings for other populations, GMOs yielded lower levels of both Knowledge and Dread. Based on risk perceptions, consumers were grouped in four segments: optimists, unconfident, fearless, and fearful.

Tannins are polyphenolic metabolites present in various plants and one of their effects is antioxidant activity that reduces lipoperoxidation, as is the case for vitamin E. This paper aims to assess the role of tannic acid and vitamin E in lipid peroxidation and in DNA damage in rats receiving ethanol. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 60 Wistar rats were divided into six groups: control + ethanol (0-24hs), tannic acid + ethanol (0-24 hs), and vitamin E + ethanol (0-24 hs). The animals were sacrificed immediately (0 hour) or 24 hours after a period of four weeks of ethanol administration and the following measurements were made: plasma vitamin E and liver glutathione, thiobarbituric acid resistant substances, and a-tocopherol. The comet test was also applied to hepatocytes. Findings - Ethanol administration led to an increase in DNA damage (148.67 +/- 15.45 versus 172.63 +/- 18.94) during a period of 24 hours which was not detected in the groups receiving tannic acid or vitamin E. Steatosis was lower in the groups receiving tannic acid. Originality/value - The paper highlights that antioxidant role of vitamin E and of tannic acid in biological systems submitted to oxidative stress should be reevaluated, especially regarding the protective role of tannic acid against hepatic steatosis.","[Jordao, Alceu Afonso; Lima Sanchez, Sheila Cristina; Portari, Guilherme Vannucchi; Domenici, Fernanda Aparecida; Vannucchi, Helio] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Med Ribeirao Preto, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Jordao, AA (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Med Ribeirao Preto, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.",alceu@fmrp.usp.br,"Domenici, Fernanda A/C-5070-2014; Vannucchi, Helio/B-8060-2013; Jordao, Alceu Afonso/D-7545-2014; Sanches, Sheila CL/K-9334-2015; Portari, Guilherme Vannucchi/IUN-5401-2023","Vannucchi, Helio/0000-0003-4161-3228; Portari, Guilherme Vannucchi/0000-0002-0299-9001; /0000-0003-1288-0802",,,,,24,1,1,2,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - A total 280 cheese samples (105 white cheese, 70 processed cheese, 45 dil cheese and 60 kasar cheese) purchased from supermarkets in six provinces of Turkey were collected at intervals between March 2007 and February 2008. Findings - The results showed that 1.9 percent of white cheese samples were contaminated with Salmonella spp, whereas the L monocytogenes prevalence was 4.8 percent in this type of cheese sample. The prevalence of L. monocytogenes in processed cheese and kasar cheese were found to be 1.4 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively. No Salmonella spp. was isolated from these cheese varieties. Neither Salmonella spp. nor L. monocytogenes were found in dil cheese samples examined. Originality/value - Cheese is a ready to eat product that with a low incidence of contamination may pose great public health concerns. Microbiological evaluation of different cheese samples produced with different manufacturing methods and the possible effects of manufacturing methods on the microbiological quality of these cheese samples are the originality criteria of the study. The cheeses were also sold in a very restricted area of Turkey. The results of this study indicate that white cheese has the highest rates of contamination due to the lack of standardized procedures of manufacturing and ripening.","[Kahraman, Tolga] Istanbul Univ, Fac Vet Med, Dept Food Hyg & Technol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Ozmen, Gursel; Ozinan, Basak] Food Control & Res Ctr, Gemlik, Turkey; [Goksoy, Ergun Omer] Adnan Menderes Univ, Fac Vet Med, Dept Food Hyg & Technol, Aydin, Turkey","Istanbul University; Ministry of Food, Agriculture & Livestock - Turkey; Adnan Menderes University","Kahraman, T (通讯作者)，Istanbul Univ, Fac Vet Med, Dept Food Hyg & Technol, Istanbul, Turkey.",tolgakah@istanbul.edu.tr,"Goksoy, Ergun/AAX-9668-2021; Goksoy, Ergun O/J-7267-2013; kahraman, Tolga/D-6391-2019","kahraman, Tolga/0000-0003-4877-6951",,,,,36,9,10,0,14,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Many studies have recommended that education is a key step in preventing food-borne illness in the domestic environment. However, few educational or psychosocial interventions have been designed and implemented to improve food safety knowledge, attitudes and behaviours. Even fewer of these studies have been subject to rigorous appraisal. The purpose of this paper is to conduct a systematic review of studies that described and evaluated a food safety intervention in a non-clinical adult sample. Design/methodology/approach - A total of ten studies met the criteria for inclusion in the systematic review. Outcomes of interest included food safety behaviour, behavioural intention, attitudes, knowledge, microbial transfer and the use of social cognition models. Findings - The evidence regarding the effectiveness of the reviewed interventions on these food safety outcomes was somewhat positive; however, many gaps remained. For example, of the five self-report behaviour change studies, all reported some significant improvement post-intervention. However, the percentage of specific behaviours that significantly changed within each study varied between 0.04 and 100 per cent. There were methodological flaws in many of the studies which complicated the interpretation of these results and indicate a need for more research. Research limitations/implications - Future research should include better defined outcomes, longer follow-up, more rigorous reporting of results and intervention design, the use of randomised controlled trial protocols and utilising health models to have a greater theoretical underpinning to the studies. Originality/value - This paper is the first systematic review examining the effect of psychosocial food safety interventions on behaviour, attitudes and knowledge.","[Milton, Alyssa; Mullan, Barbara] Univ Sydney, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Mullan, B (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",barbara@psych.usyd.edu.au,"Milton, Alyssa/AAE-1151-2021; Mullan, Barbara/E-2474-2019","Milton, Alyssa/0000-0002-4326-0123; Mullan, Barbara/0000-0002-0177-8899",,,,,55,43,53,0,49,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The aim of this paper is to provide some initial guidelines for the above-said purpose so as to have consumer friendly labeling policies. Design/methodology/approach - A structured questionnaire-based survey was used for the purpose of the study. A total of 100 respondents were considered for the study. Data were collected from two superstores located in New Delhi. Findings - Food labels are read by the consumers for brand comparisons and not for consulting nutritional information. Difficult terminology, small font size and inability to understand nutritional labels are the major problems encountered by the consumers. Television, friends, magazines are commonly used for assessing nutritional information. Labels are considered more consumer friendly when benchmarks regarding serving size are provided. Income level, size of household, number of children and age did not play a role in the usage of nutritional labels by the consumers. Consumers with special dietary needs used nutritional labels regularly. Research limitations/implications - A small sample size is the limitation of the study.

Product innovation may not always have the validity to the enterprise. Ignoring the limits of validity of product innovation and constantly stressing enterprise product innovation may lead to blindness of product innovation, which will increase the operation risk of business. Mathematical analysis indicates that innovation is not always the more the better to enterprise. When the increasing speed of an enterprise changing rate of product innovation is roughly the same with that of changing rate of customer recognition, then the customers are highly sensitive to the price of existing products, and the enterprises can easily lose the existing market. Enterprises have to increase product innovation to avoid the customers losing; when the increasing speed of an enterprise changing rate of product innovation is greater than that of changing rate of customer recognition then the customers are extremely insensitivity to the price of existing products, and the existing product market is more stable, and the Customers is not sensitive to the company's further investment or effort on the product innovation. Under this case, enterprise further innovation is not valid since it's hard to earn profits and even take an affect to the enterprise original profitability. So the speed of enterprise investment to product innovation should be controlled in a slightly higher level than that of the customer changing demand to products.","[Tong Yan] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Xian 710062, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Tong Yan; An Liren] Northwest Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xian 710069, Peoples R China",Shaanxi Normal University; Northwest University Xi'an,"Tong, Y (通讯作者)，Shaanxi Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Xian 710062, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-1-921712-15-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,621,+,,,,,,2,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BYE76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298265500108,0

This paper analyses the development of aboveground HANPP (aHANPP) in Spain for the period from 1955 to 2003. During this period, Spain's agriculture underwent a transition from a largely pre-industrial to a highly intensified production system. Changes in land use patterns include a reduction of cropland area and an expansion of forest area. Results show that aHANPP declined from 67% of potential aNPP in 1955 to 61% in 2003. Biomass harvest strongly increased from 68 million tons dry matter biomass per year (Mt/yr) to 106 Mt/yr, with nearly all of this increase occurring on cropland. Productivity losses due to human-induced land conversions dropped significantly from 112 Mt/yr to 63 Mt/yr, mainly as a result of the surge in cropland productivity and the increase in forest area. Despite its decrease during the last aHANPP in Spain is still at a remarkably high level in comparison with the global average or other decades, industrialized countries. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It treats product quality as a decision variable so that the degree of product substitution becomes endogenous rather than exogenous as in previous studies. We find that, with vertically differentiated firms, the changes in channel structure have asymmetric effects depending on whether they occur in the high-quality channel or in the low-quality channel. The product quality of the high-quality channel decreases when it decentralizes unilaterally. However, product quality of the low-quality channel would increase when it decentralizes. The high-quality manufacturer and its channel suffer more from decentralization in comparison with their low-quality counterparts, and the low-quality manufacturer actually receives greater profits when both channels are decentralized. An important driver behind these asymmetries is the interaction between firms' pricing incentives in integrated versus decentralized channels and what consumer segments they serve. Our analysis indicates that decentralization may reduce consumer welfare, but decentralization in the high-quality channel hurts consumers more than that in the low-quality channel. Therefore in a competitive environment where firms make both quality and price decisions, channel integration would have significant welfare enhancement effects through the elimination of double marginalization, especially if it happens in the high-quality channel. Moreover, we demonstrate that once quality is endogenized, integration is the only equilibrium of channel structure choices. This suggests that the private incentives of firms may actually benefit consumers but do not have to be in line with the general preference of industry regulation for decentralization.","[Liu, Yong] Univ Arizona, Eller Coll Management, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Zhao, Xuan] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada; [Atkins, Derek] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",University of Arizona; Wilfrid Laurier University; University of British Columbia,"Liu, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Eller Coll Management, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",xzhao@wlu.ca; derek.atkins@sauder.ubc.ca; yoliu@eller.arizona.edu,"ZHAO, XUAN/HJG-9164-2022","Zhao, Xuan/0000-0002-2498-8717",,,,,24,21,22,1,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

Goemer, Lietaer. and Gomez, 2009), we combined thermodynamic, network, and information theoretic measures with research on real-life ecosystems to create a generalized, quantitative measure of sustainability for any complex, matter/energy flow system. The current paper explores how this metric and its related concepts can be used to provide a new narrative for long-term economic health and sustainability. Based on a system's ability to maintain a crucial balance between two equally essential, but complementary factors. resilience and efficiency, this generic explanation of the network structure needed to maintain long-term robustness provides the missing theoretical explanation for what constitutes healthy development and the mathematical means to differentiate it quantitatively from mere growth. Matching long-standing observations of sustainable vitality in natural ecosystems and living organisms, the result is a much clearer, more accurate understanding of the conditions needed for free-enterprise networks to produce the kind of sustainable vitality everyone desires, one which enhances and reliably maintains the health and well-being of all levels of global civilization as well as the planet.

This embodiment model also assumes that once new units of capital are installed, it cannot be unbolted and sold on the second hand market. A significant difference between this Solow-Harper model and the traditional capital services model due to Jorgenson and his coworkers is that rising real wage rates will generally induce early retirement of assets; i.e., this model can provide an explanation for obsolescence. The paper studies how to aggregate over vintages and how to measure depreciation in the context of this embodiment model. These problems are more complicated than the corresponding problems in the traditional capital services model because the age of retirement of an asset is endogenous in the embodiment model. The paper uses duality theory to simplify the exposition.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Diewert, E (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada.",diewert@econ.ubc.ca,,,,,,,44,9,9,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,,,J PROD ANAL,J.

We use the directional output distance function to aggregate multiple environmental objectives into one measure of environmental performance. We apply this method to a set of watershed data and compare our results to the existing U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) index values. When modeling the same set of objectives, the directional output distance function and the existing EPA index yield similar measures of environmental performance. We discuss the mathematical properties of both indices using the axioms of economic index theory, and explore the possible advantages to our approach. The mathematical properties of the directional output distance function are well established and this approach provides a nonparametric way to aggregate individual characteristics. This advances the standard use of a priori-weighted summation, and circumvents the often contentious selection of index weights. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Variation in utilization and outcomes in Thailand,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE FINANCE & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Health insurance; Payment methods; Drug utilization; Access; Efficient healthcare treatment,PAYMENT,"Hospitals in Thailand operate in a multiple insurance payment environment. This paper examines (1) access to medicines and other medical technologies, (2) treatment outcomes, and (3) efficiency in resource use, among beneficiaries of the three government health insurance schemes in Thailand. Using 2003-2005 outpatient and inpatient data for patients with three tracer diseases from three government hospitals, we find that utilization of more expensive items differs between patients whose insurers pay on a closed- or open-ended basis. Where new vs. conventional drugs are both available, patients whose insurer pays on a fee-for-service basis tend to have greater access to new drugs, compared to patients whose insurer pays on a capitated or case basis. Similar patterns were found where there are options between originator versus generic drugs, drugs in different dosage forms, and more versus less advanced diagnostic technologies. Effects of insurance payment are more pronounced where price gaps among the medical technologies are significant. Efficiency results are mixed, depending on nature of the disease conditions and type of resources required for treatment.","[Hirunrassamee, Sanita] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Bangkok, Thailand; [Ratanawijitrasin, Sauwakon] Mahidol Univ, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Bangkok 10700, Thailand",Chulalongkorn University; Mahidol University,"Hirunrassamee, S (通讯作者)，Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Bangkok, Thailand.",sanita_h@yahoo.com,,,,,,,10,12,14,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

Community forestry programs can contain elements of several of those instruments. This paper considers the design of community forestry contracts in the Sumber Jaya area of Indonesia where community forestry contracts are agreements between the Forestry Department and community groups that provide group members with time-bound leasehold rights to protection forests, on the condition that farmers abide by specified land-use restrictions and pay any required fees. Farmers perceive that the contracts represent a bundle of restrictions and inducements, some of which are explicitly stated in the contract and others that are implied by the contract. Conjoint analysis was used to quantify farmers' tradeoffs among the explicit and implicit attributes of the contracts. The results of logit and ordered logit models show that farmers are most concerned about the length of the contract, and relatively unconcerned about requirements on tree density and species composition. An implicit attribute, greater access to forestry and agroforestry extension, emerges as an important implicit attribute. The results imply that farmers in this part of Indonesia would be willing to abide by fairly strict limitations on land use, provided that they can be assured of long-term rights to the planted trees.

This initiative mainly aims at improving the current regime's legitimacy. By increasing business involvement, decision VIII/17 can be viewed within the context of the current academic debate on the 'privatisation' of environmental governance, which refers to the growing importance of private actors in the formulation of environmental policies. Against this background, this article aims at: (1) assessing the extent to which decision VIII/17 might reverse the CBD's legitimacy crisis and (2) analysing the issues at stake when private sector actors are involved in environmental regimes. In order to do so, the article analyses the consequences of decision VIII/17 in terms of internal-representation and transparency-and external-institutional efficiency and implementation-legitimacy. The study is based on an extended empirical scrutiny of the negotiations linked to decision VIII/17. While adopting a general conceptualisation of legitimacy, the value added by the study is to broaden the usual understanding of business strategies towards environmental issues. In particular, this article shows how decision VIII/17 has generated several reactions-defensive as well as proactive-among the business community. At the practical level, the article proposes several recommendations to secure a constructive participation of all categories of business actors in biodiversity governance. At the theoretical level, it calls for a change in deterministic visions of economic actors' interests.","Sci Po Bordeaux, Polit Inst Bordeaux, SPIRIT Res Ctr Polit Sci Int Relat Terr, F-33607 Pessac, France",,"Bled, AJ (通讯作者)，Sci Po Bordeaux, Polit Inst Bordeaux, SPIRIT Res Ctr Polit Sci Int Relat Terr, 11 Allee Ausone Domaine Univ, F-33607 Pessac, France.",a.bled@sciencespobordeaux.fr,,"Orsini, Amandine/0000-0002-1453-9707",,,,,56,12,13,2,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

We develop an econometric approach, to study both the decision to harvest timber and the volume of timber sold, that corrects for limited access to loggers leading to possible selection bias, incomplete labor markets, and differences in property rights regimes that characterize the area. We find that, irrespective of distance to markets, smallholders, that have either been settled by INCRA or have access to credit are more likely to sell wood, but those with outside income sources are less likely to sell. Higher timber prices decrease the likelihood of timber sales. The results suggest that timber sales are viewed only as a means for smallholders to reduce immediate cash constraints. With some exceptions these results hold across property rights regimes.

The community values mapping method presented in this paper builds on the concept of natural capital and ecosystem services and the landscape values methodology to link local perception of place to a broader measure of environmental values at the landscape level. Based on in-depth interviews and a mapping task conducted with 56 natural resource management decision-makers and community representatives, we quantified and mapped values and threats to natural capital assets and ecosystem services in the South Australian Murray-Darling Basin region. GIS-based techniques were used to map the spatial distribution of natural capital and ecosystem service values and threats over the region and analyse the proportional differences at the sub-regional scale. Participants assigned the highest natural capital asset value to water and biota assets primarily for the production of cultural, regulating and provisioning services. The most highly valued ecosystem services were recreation and tourism, bequest, intrinsic and existence, fresh water provision, water regulation and food provision. Participants assigned the highest threat to regulating services associated with water and land assets. Natural capital asset and ecosystem service values varied at both sub-regional and place-specific scales. Respondents believed people were integral to the environment but also posed a high threat to natural capital and ecosystem services. The results have implications for the way values toward natural capital and ecosystem services may be integrated into planning for environmental management. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The results indicate that a severe drought such as the one that occurred in the crop year 1999-2000 imposes a direct cost of 1605 million USD, equivalent to 30.3% of the total value added of the cropping sector in Iran. This, in turn, leads to a 12.7% reduction in the value added of other agricultural sub-sectors (livestock, fisheries and forestry). In the rest of the economy, the manufacturing and service sectors experience value added declines of 7.8 and 3.7%, respectively. In addition, there is a substantial decrease in investment in the agricultural, manufacturing and service sectors. Thus, such a drought reduces overall GDP by about 4.4%, and it would also result in decreased non-oil exports, increased food imports, and a rise in inflation. The results of some drought mitigation simulations are reported in brief. Such estimates strengthen the case for increased attention to drought strategies and management in agriculture in Iran and elsewhere. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This results from an interaction of the market-access effect on consumers, the market-access effect on firms, the competition effect, and the urban-cost effect. Second, decreasing transport cost tends to let industries with lower transport costs disperse, although the shares of industries locating in the larger region are not in order of their transport costs.

Equity-weighted estimates of the (marginal) impact of greenhouse gas emissions reflect these differences. This paper analyses the impact of equity weighting on the marginal damage cost of carbon dioxide emissions, and reaches four main conclusions. First, equity-weighted estimates are substantially higher than estimates without equity-weights; equity-weights may even change the sign of the social cost estimates. Second, estimates differ by two orders of magnitude depending on the region to which the equity weights are normalised. Third, equity-weighted estimates are sensitive to the resolution of the impact estimates. Depending on the assumed intra-regional income distribution, estimates may be more than twice as high if national rather than regional impacts are aggregated. Fourth, variations in the assumed inequality aversion have different impacts in different scenarios, not only because different scenarios have different emissions and hence warming, but also because different scenarios have different income differences, different growth rates, and different vulnerabilities.

Thereafter, works related to germplasm characterization, cultivar evaluation, generation and evaluation of hybrids were carried out by the Empresa de Pesquisa Agropecuaria do Estado do Rio de Janeiro and by the Instituto Agronomico de Campinas from 1978 to 1997. The most complete program of pineapple genetic improvement in Brazil has been the one carried out by Embrapa Cassava & Tropical Fruits since 1978. The objective of this program has been to develop cultivars resistant to fusariosis disease, the main constraint of the pineapple crop in Brazil, with good fruit quality and spineless leaves. Some of the most relevant results obtained are the following: formation and maintenance of the Pineapple Active Germplasm Bank composed by 627 accessions under field conditions and 146 accessions under in vitro preservation; development of a technique for early evaluation of pineapple resistance to fusariosis based on artificial inoculation; identification of 122 sources of resistance to fusariosis; recommendation of the cultivars Primavera and Perolera, both resistant to fusariosis; creation of 60,537 hybrids; field evaluation of 30,462 hybrids that showed resistance to fusariosis; preliminary selection of 49 promising hybrids that are in several evaluation phases; recommendation of the hybrid cultivars Imperial and Vitoria with resistance to fusariosis and other superior attributes. The model of genetic herdability was determined and studies are underway to select molecular markers for identification of resistant genotypes at seedling stage. From the year 2002, backcrosses and crosses between selected hybrids have been performed and their progenies are under evaluation. Several self pollinated genotypes were obtained from the cultivars Perolera, Primavera, Roxo de Tefe and Smooth Cayenne that are under evaluation in order to be used as parental in crosses towards progenies with lower segregation level. In 2004 a specific breeding program for ornamental pineapples was started. 22 genotypes with promising ornamental qualities have been preliminarily selected and are being evaluated.","[Cabral, J. R.

The norm-activation-model by Schwartz is used to predict self-reported and observed purchase behaviour of organic milk. Design/methodology/approach - The paper reports the results of a field study with 63 customers of a German supermarket. A combination of covert observation and in-store interviews was applied to obtain reliable data on actual shopping behaviour and its predictors. Findings - The results show that the self-reported and the observed purchase of organic milk is predicted by personal ecological norms, social norms, and perceived behavioural control. Personal norms are activated by awareness of need, awareness of consequences, perceived behavioural control, and social norms. People with strong personal norms use organic production, the EU-BIO-Label and ingredients as additional criteria during their decision process. For people with strong ecological norms the price difference between organic and conventional milk, the lack of knowledge about organic milk, and convenience are less important constraints. Finally, people with strong personal norms react more sensitively to proposed norm-centred interventions. Practical implications - The study offers insight into the processes of motivating behaviour and can therefore be used to design intervention strategies. Suggestions are developed in the closing part of the paper. Originality/value - The study applies for the first time the norm-activation-model to the domain of purchasing organic milk and underlines the importance of normative influences for this decision.","[Klockner, Christian A.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, NTNU, Psykol Inst, RIPENSA, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway; [Ohms, Silvia] Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Environm Sci, Landau, Germany",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); University of Koblenz & Landau,"Klöckner, CA (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, NTNU, Psykol Inst, RIPENSA, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway.",Christian.Klockner@svt.ntnu.no,,"Klockner, Christian A./0000-0003-4510-1748",,,,,28,57,64,1,39,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

It aims to investigate the effectiveness of common sources of recommendation in influencing wine purchase decisions fear typical customers and consider the value of each recommendation in different store-contexts. Design/methodology/approach - An exploratory survey is conducted, examining the weighting customers give each recommendation source, followed by a laboratory experiment designed to test the influence of recommendation sources in two different store-contexts - supermarket and specialist wine retailer. Statistical analysis was conducted to determine the most effective sources for each retail context. Findings - Insights from the survey suggest that specialist wine retailer customers value personal staff-, staff choice-, and award-based recommendations, whereas supermarket shoppers value awards and bestseller recommendations. The laboratory experiment highlights the distinction between staff credibility and peer group credibility, with the specialist retailer benefiting from staff and award-based recommendations and the supermarket benefiting from bestseller and award-based recommendations. Research limitations/implications - This research demonstrates a need for researchers to consider recommendation sources when building models of consumer choice, and also to consider the store-context in which those recommendations are received. It also appears worthwhile to investigate further the relationship between bestseller lists, peer group credibility, and shopper behaviour when customers are shopping for premium foods. Practical implications - Wine sellers need to be aware of the value of recommendations. Staff recommendations should be encouraged when selling through a specialist wine retailer, whereas peer-group recommendation should be encouraged for supermarket sales. Awards are shown to be a valuable asset in either context. Originality/value - The comparative effectiveness of staff, award, and bestseller-based recommendations in influencing shopper choices for wine is revealed for the first time in this research, allowing researchers and practitioners to appreciate their value in decisions. Furthermore, the impact of the store-context on recommendation value is shown.","[Parsons, Andrew G.; Thompson, Ann-Marie] Auckland Univ Technol, AUT Business Sch, Auckland, New Zealand",Auckland University of Technology,"Parsons, AG (通讯作者)，Auckland Univ Technol, AUT Business Sch, Auckland, New Zealand.",andrew.parsons@aut.ac.nz,,"Kennedy, Ann-Marie/0000-0001-6207-7757",,,,,52,10,11,0,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper is a review of the pork supply chain literature, and the main objective is to describe and analyze the complexity of the pork production industry from a holistic perspective. An extensive review of the relevant literature was done together with discussions and reflexions carried out with pork sector researchers. Findings - The paper highlights the complexity involved in the pork supply chain in order to obtain quality products and demonstrates that, by looking at pork production as a chain instead of as individual steps made by different companies, the meat sector can more easily meet the challenge of accurately responding to changing customer demands. Research limitations/implications - The contribution describes the main factors and attributes found along the pork supply chain, which are relevant to the quality of the final product as perceived by the consumer. Further research could be done on the effects of the interactions between the factors on pork chain analysis and consumer satisfaction. Practical implications - The main lesson to be learned from this work is the opportunity supply-chain agents get from collaboration, which allows them to become more competitive than if they stay isolated and without a global perspective of the whole chain. The findings contribute to further research on the pork sector from a Supply chain perspective. Originality/value - The paper provides a holistic perspective of the pork supply chain and can be useful for researchers and practitioners involved in the management of pork product quality and new product development.","[Perez, Catalina; de Castro, Rodolfo] Univ Girona, Girona, Spain; [Font i Furnols, Maria] IRTA Food Technol, Girona, Spain",Universitat de Girona; IRTA,"de Castro, R (通讯作者)，Univ Girona, Girona, Spain.",rudi.castro@udg.edu,"Furnols, Maria Font i/AAF-7027-2021; Font i Furnols, Maria/L-1411-2017; De Castro, Rudi/A-4871-2012","Font i Furnols, Maria/0000-0002-2979-5113; De Castro, Rudi/0000-0002-8099-8493",,,,,81,31,34,2,38,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Different ways to control soil born parasites are under investigation and the research on the tolerance or resistance of varieties to nematodes is one of them. In Martinique a screening method is being developed based on greenhouse cultivation in tanks. The behavior of different varieties from CIRAD germplasm was studied after infestation with the nematode Rotylenchulus reniformis. Growth characteristics and nematode populations were observed during six months covering the classical two flushes of root development observed in our tropical conditions. 'D' leaves weight and length as well as plant opening were measured every month, the plant shoot and root system were analyzed six months after planting. Preliminary results indicate that plants of the cultivar Smooth Cayenne show a susceptible pattern with strong vegetative growth reduction, meanwhile MD-2 plants show a tolerance pattern with a high multiplication of nematodes, but a relatively reduced effect on growth. Among Ananassoides sp., one variety shows a strong resistance pattern with little impact on vegetative growth. CIRAD hybrids show different resistance patterns from high susceptibility to good tolerance. This method will be used to detect potential parents for the breeding program, to evaluate new hybrids and to identify highly contrasting behaviors in order to study resistance/tolerance mechanisms to nematodes in pineapple.","[Soler, A.; Marie-Alphonsine, P.

Using a comprehensive new database, we argue that external and internal threat environments had significant implications for the demand for military strength, which in turn had important ramifications for fiscal policy and the likelihood of constitutional reform and related improvements in the provision of nonmilitary public services. Our analytic narrative complements recent theoretical and econometric works about state capacity. By emphasizing public finances, we also uncover novel insights about the forces underlying state formation in Italy.","[Dincecco, Mark; Vindigni, Andrea] IMT Lucca Inst Adv Studies, I-55100 Lucca, Italy; [Federico, Giovanni] European Univ Inst, I-50133 Florence, Italy",IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca; European University Institute,"Dincecco, M (通讯作者)，IMT Lucca Inst Adv Studies, Piazza San Ponziano 6, I-55100 Lucca, Italy.",m.dincecco@imtlucca.it; giovanni.federico@eui.eu; a.vindigni@imtlucca.it,"; Federico, Giovanni/J-5310-2014","Dincecco, Mark/0000-0003-2860-7069; Federico, Giovanni/0000-0002-2683-683X",,,,,83,51,55,0,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-0507,1471-6372,,J ECON HIST,J.

Based on estimated parsimonious spatial hedonic growth regressions, strong demand for high-amenity areas continued in the 1990s, but the converging of population growth across the top tiers appeared related to capitalization of amenity differences among the tiers into factor prices. Yet, evidence obtained from controlling for spatial effects suggests that the relative quality of life in the top two tiers had deteriorated.","[Rickman, Dan S.; Rickman, Shane D.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Econ & Legal Studies, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Rickman, DS (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Econ & Legal Studies, 338 Business Bldg, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",dan.rickman@okstate.edu; shane.rickman@okstate.edu,,"Rickman, Dan/0000-0003-1233-7420",,,,,56,46,58,0,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

The conventional approach is to use a two-stage method where the efficiency estimates are regressed on contextual variables representing the operational conditions. The main problem of the two-stage approach is that it ignores the correlations between inputs and contextual variables. To address this shortcoming, we build on the recently developed regression interpretation of data envelopment analysis (DEA) to develop a new one-stage semi-nonparametric estimator that combines the nonparametric DEA-style frontier with a regression model of the contextual variables. The new method is referred to as stochastic semi-nonparametric envelopment of z variables data (StoNEZD). The StoNEZD estimator for the contextual variables is shown to be statistically consistent under less restrictive assumptions than those required by the two-stage DEA estimator. Further, the StoNEZD estimator is shown to be unbiased, asymptotically efficient, asymptotically normally distributed, and converge at the standard parametric rate of order n (-1/2). Therefore, the conventional methods of statistical testing and confidence intervals apply for asymptotic inference. Finite sample performance of the proposed estimators is examined through Monte Carlo simulations.","[Johnson, Andrew L.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Zachry Engn Ctr 237K, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Kuosmanen, Timo] Aalto Univ, Sch Econ, Helsinki 00101, Finland",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Aalto University,"Johnson, AL (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Zachry Engn Ctr 237K, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",ajohnson@tamu.edu; timo.kuosmanen@aalto.fi,"Kuosmanen, Timo/B-5532-2008; Johnson, Andrew/B-7226-2012","Kuosmanen, Timo/0000-0001-9232-5387; Johnson, Andrew/0000-0003-3848-6977",,,,,29,66,71,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

This suggestion has been operationalized in three aspects that can be used to better understand such processes: legality, moral justifications, and consent/acceptance. These aspects are based on different theoretical traditions and are applied in an analysis of the process of creating legitimacy of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). This empirical research reveals the characteristics of the legitimization process of the RSPO and shows the value of a multi-dimensional approach. The three perspectives complement each other and deepen our insights in legitimization processes by revealing tensions and trade-offs in the different ways in which non-state market driven governance arrangements can create legitimacy.

Our panel data analysis shows that countries where timber harvesting is more important tend to experience larger deforestation rates than others, giving the intuition that forest harvesting is generally not sustainable.

However, social psychology and behavioural research suggest that there is a wide variety of approaches that individuals use to make such choices. We explore this heterogeneity against the backdrop of so-called dual process models', analysing participants' responses in a survey of public beliefs about and preferences for climate change adaptation policies. We find that the postulate of two different types of decision-making, the systematic-analytical and the heuristic-holistic, does indeed help us to understand patterns in respondent behaviour that are, in turn, underpinned by respondents' motivation and ability to process information. Participants who were motivated and able to process the information provided were more likely to express preferences in line with their beliefs about adaptation policies, whereas those less motivated and more confused were more likely to use generalised rules-of-thumb that were not specific to the policy issue at hand. Depending on the theoretical framework of a study, such heterogeneity in response consistency and use of generic rules-of-thumb might have implications for the usefulness of survey outcomes. We discuss the implications of our findings, and draw conclusions for survey-based environmental research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We then define dimensionless quantities in both the cardinal stock-flow space and the ordinal fund-flux space. This leads to analytic definitions of natural capital and natural income in the fund-flux space. We show that a stock-fund representation of the economy-ecosystem interaction problem helps investigate aggregation properties of biophysical metrics. In particular, we show how a metric that is dimensionally consistent in the stock-flow space can have dimensional problems in the fund-flux space. Ecological footprint is used as an illustrative example. Finally, we argue that dimensionally consistent metrics are keys to further the development of biophysical assessments as a tool for practical environmental policy. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We find that increasing uncertainty (both uncertainty embedded in the natural system and uncertainty of the decisionmaker about the location of the threshold) can lead to nonmonotonic changes in precaution: a reduction in uncertainty can first increase and then decrease optimal precautionary activity. This nonmonotonicity can help to explain why regulators often give conflicting arguments about optimal abatement policies in the face of uncertainty. For example, some regulators argue for an immediate reduction in pollutant loading until uncertainty about the underlying process is reduced while others call for no costly reductions in pollutant loading until the same uncertainty is reduced. These statements can be consistent even if both sides agree on both economic objectives and the system dynamics, but have different priors on the uncertainty involved. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis was carried out using the data of overall Population and Housing Census of the Lithuanian Republic in 2003 and 2010, as well as Crop Declaration and Land Fund data. The aim of the study was to analyse land use changes in unfavourable for farming areas. Analysing unfavourable for farming areas it was found that the number of farms has been decreasing in all districts. In unfavourable for farming areas average size of a farm is smaller than the average in Lithuania, in 2003 it was 6.5 ha. According to the Registry data of 2010, average size of a farm in unfavourable for farming areas comprised 9.2 ha. In the analysed period the area of unused agricultural land decreased.

While implementing restructurization of country economy it is important to apply preventive measures that would help to improve the quality of all surface and subterranean waters including quality of water of all rivers because it significantly influences the condition of the Baltic Sea and Curonian Lagoon. Drainage of agricultural fields is not only a modern measure of removing the surplus of water but also a fair constituent part of water balance of open water bodies. Rainfall or water from melting precipitation percolate into the soil and leak to trenches and little rivers through drainage system. Dissolved chemical elements and residues of chemical plant protection substances in drainage water influence the quality of basin water. At atmospheric nutrition of soil the formation of drainage run-off depends not only on atmospheric conditions (amount of precipitation, their distribution, and regime of air temperature) and hydrological characteristics of soil, but also on technologies and terms of tillage. During the period of research from 2005 to 2010 the average annual height of drainage run-off in the field of reduced tillage fluctuated from 3.18 to 31.6 mm (run-off coefficient a fluctuated in the range from 0.047 to 0.64). The largest amount of water leaks through the drainage in winter (31.5%), while 27.2% of water leaks in autumn; 26.9% in spring and 14.4% in summer.

Design/methodology/approach - A Dutch survey study was carried out among a representative sample of the Dutch population (n = 492). Respondents filled out a questionnaire on: perceptions of fresh fruit and vegetables; interest in, knowledge of, and trust in, antioxidants and fresh fruit and vegetables; domain-specific innovativeness and social identification; means of communication; and information-seeking and buying behaviour. Findings - Based on consumption patterns, respondents were divided into non-, light and heavy organic food users. Results show that there are significant differences between the three consumer groups on domain specific innovativeness, social identification and attitudes towards antioxidants in fresh fruit and vegetables. Practical implications - Non-users of organic food are difficult to reach with communication regarding nutrients and organic produce, in contrast to light and heavy users. Light users could be triggered by more peripheral message cues, while heavy users are more sensitive to the content of the message. Differentiated strategies for light and heavy users of organic food should be developed in order to effectively communicate the added value of nutrients in fresh fruit and vegetables. Originality/value - This study is the first to examine the role of domain specific innovativeness and social identification in attitudes towards antioxidants in fresh fruit and vegetables. The empirical findings from this study are expected to benefit the continued development on health communication messages.","[Bartels, Jos; van den Berg, Isabelle] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Agr Econ Res Inst LEI, The Hague, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Bartels, J (通讯作者)，Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Agr Econ Res Inst LEI, The Hague, Netherlands.",jos.bartels@wur.nl,"Bartels, Jos/AAB-7283-2019; Bartels, Jos/J-3016-2012","Bartels, Jos/0000-0003-1557-6187;",,,,,49,18,20,2,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The first portion was kept fresh while the second one was placed in plastic bags and cooked by immersion in a water bath at 70 degrees C for 90 minutes. Both samples were freeze-dried, and then ground to a homogeneous mass to be used for chemical analyses. Findings - Cooked samples had significantly <0.05) higher dry matter by 27.7 per cent, protein. by 31.1 per cent and fat by 22.2 per cent, but lower ash content by 8.3 per cent than the raw ones. Cooking had no significant effect on amino acid and fatty acid composition of the meat. The components of camel meat most significantly affected by cooking were macro- and micro-minerals, which ranged between 13.1 and 52.5 per cent, respectively. Cooking resulted in a significant decrease in total, heme and non-heme iron contents by 4.3, 8.7 and 4.0 per cent, respectively. Research limitations/implications - The research is restricted to camel meat but it is an exploratory study. The issue of research outcome as only longissimus thoracic muscle is another limitation. Further investigation is needed to include different muscles, temperatures, durations and cooking methods. Practical implications - Amino acids and fatty acids of camel meat are not affected by cooking, while heating accelerated total and heme iron oxidation suggest camel meat to be a rich source of heme iron. Originality/value - The paper is original in its findings and useful for both researchers and academics in the field of meat science.","[Kadim, I. T.; Al-Maqbaly, R. S.; Mahgoub, O.; Johnson, E.

The study was aimed to determine the peculiarities of the technology of weed thermal control by wet saturated steam in the crop stand above the emerging seed. During thermal weed control, a high-temperature environment of 100 degrees C is created in the plant environment seeking to heat plant tissue to a temperature of above 58 degrees C. In such temperature, changes occur in the biological processes in plant tissue resulting in lethal outcome. Thermal weed control process using wet saturated steam (WSS) significantly differs from the flaming by gas. During the steam condensation, the high-temperature environment intensively heats not only plants but also soil surface. Consequently, in the technology of thermal weed control with water steam it is necessary to find solutions to the issues of emerging seed and seedling destruction in the soil. Experimental evidence suggests that irrespective of the WSS treatment duration, soil surface temperature is close to that of water steam and is 94.7-95.5 degrees C. Water steam condensation process occurs on the soil surface, therefore a temperature of 58 degrees C, which is lethal to plants, reaches deeper soil layers. The experimental findings indicate that application of WSS technology for weed control (with a thermal treatment duration of 1-3 s), destroys plants and seedlings present not only on the surface of the soil but also in the surface soil layer up to 1.5 mm depth. Simulation of temperature fields in the surface soil layer enabled us to identify the effects of soil bulk density and thermal treatment duration on the formation of temperature exceeding 58 degrees C. With increasing soil bulk density the marginal temperature field of 58 degrees C in the surface soil layer declines. When soil bulk density increases by 100 kg/m(3), 58 degrees C temperature field in the soil surface layer becomes thinner by 0.025 mm at 1 s thermal treatment duration, by 0.045 mm at 2 s thermal treatment, and by 0.065 mm at 3 s treatment.","[Kerpauskas, Paulius; Nadzeikiene, Jurate; Cekanauskas, Sigitas; Cingiene, Rasa; Uksas, Tomas] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Dept Heat & Biotechnol Engn, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Kerpauskas, P (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Dept Heat & Biotechnol Engn, Kaunas, Lithuania.",Paulius.Kerpauskas@asu.lt; jurate.nadzeikiene@asu.lt; sigitas.cekanauskas@asu.lt; rasa.cingiene@asu.lt; acikuraci@gmail.com,,"Uksas, Tomas/0000-0003-1915-5830",,,,,14,0,0,1,3,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,1,,,,,340,346,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304706000055,0

In the observed boreholes samples of the groundwater were taken and water level was measured twice a year: in spring, before the fertilization, and in autumn, at the end of the fertilization period. The following indices were determined in the water samples: NH4+, NO3-, NO2-, PO42-, K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3-, SO42-, Cl-. The unified water quality investigation methods, approved by the ministry of Environment, were used to conduct chemical analysis of the water samples. As the groundwater was mowing towards southeast, south and southwest from the fertilized field, the boreholes in the lowest place of relief (borehole 1 and borehole 4) had the highest water mineralization and irregularly distributed concentration of the most important anions: HCO3->Cl->SO42->NO3-. Besides, the highest groundwater mineralization was determined in the borehole 4, which was installed in the soil with a peat layer. No influence of water level fluctuations and the amount of the nutrients comming with slurry on the concentrations of chemical elements was determined, as the obtained results of correlation analysis were not statistically significant. At the increasing total water hardness, mineralization also increased, while the increasing mineralization gave rise to the amount of chlorides and sulphates in the water. According to the investigation data, in the period of observation the areas watered with slurry had an insignificant influence on the groundwater quality: formation of hydrocarbonate, slightly mineralized and hard water.","[Miseviciene, Stefanija] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Neilands, Romans] Riga Tech Univ, Riga, Latvia",Vytautas Magnus University; Riga Technical University,"Miseviciene, S (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania.",Stefanija.Miseviciene@asu.lt; Romans.Neilands@rtu.lv,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,2,,,,,320,325,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304698500057,0

For the testing the usefulness of the method 37 rapeseed samples from Lithuania and 12 samples from Austria, Hungary and Croatia were analysed and compared. The chemical composition and the suitability for the edible rapeseed oil production of 5 rapeseed cultivars grown in Lithuania was also determined. It was testified that the oil from Sunday, Landmark, Ural, Heros and Kasimir cultivars are of high quality - because of traces (0.05-0.11%) of erucic fatty acid which in Lithuania are limited to 2%. The chemical oil composition is appropriate to low erucic rapeseed oil - 6.92% of SFA, 65.62% of MUFA and 27.28% of PUFA. The study of total content of phenolic compounds and the oxidative stability was also part of this work. The oleic fatty acid is one of the main factors that describes the oxidative stability of the oil (r = 0.83). The best kind of rapeseed was Ural, which had the highest content of MUFA (69.12%) and was the most stabile (IP = 6.16 h). The mass fraction of Cr, Fe, Ni, Cu, Se, Sr, Ba Pb and U in Lithuanian rapeseed was determined to be in average 0.052, 4.95, 0.20, 0.26, 0.17, 17.9, 1.72, 0.015 and 0.38 mg/kg, respectively. The average mass fraction of iron and copper in Lithuanian rapeseed is 4.95 and 0.256 mg/kg, respectively, were not higher than permissible (5 and 0.4 mg/kg, respectively). The lowest copper mass fraction was discovered in seeds from an ecological farm of Lazdijai in Lithuania, where the cold pressed rapeseed oil is produced 0.2 mg/kg respectively). The mass fraction of lead in Lithuania, Austria, Hungary and Croatia were 50-100 times lower (0.015, 0.021, 0.010, 0.021 mg/kg, respectively) than permissible (1 mg/kg). The REE patterns of the rapeseed sampled from different regions of Lithuania, are very similar, due to the homogeneous soil composition.

It focuses on lessons about total factor productivity (TFP) from growth accounting and on aspects of social capability that are conducive to the effective assimilation of new technology. Key messages are that when TFP growth is very rapid this typically involves reductions in inefficiency not just technological advance and that even really important new technologies have small initial effects on aggregate productivity. Incentive structures matter greatly for the adoption of new technology, but social capability is not independent of the technological epoch as the information and communications technology (ICT) era has emphasized to Europeans.","Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Crafts, N (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",n.crafts@warwick.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021248/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H021248/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,95,10,13,1,43,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

The objective of this study is to analyze the socioeconomic and demographic factors that are related to the willingness to pay (WTP) for cancer prevention. Data from an experimental module in the 2002 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) were used to identify WTP differences across different population subgroups. Respondents were asked whether they were willing and able to pay different dollar amounts per month for a new cancer prevention drug. Years of age were negatively related to WTP whereas income and the probability of developing cancer were positively related to WTP. Risk-relevant numeracy skills were positively related to self-assessed cancer risk, which may suggest that adults with poor numeracy skills underestimate their cancer risk. This has consequences not only on the relative perceived value of different cancer treatments across different population subgroups but also on perceived value as captured by WTP.","[Milligan, Michael A.] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Global Studies, Busan Metropolitan City 609735, South Korea; [Milligan, Michael A.; Bohara, Alok K.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Pagan, Jose A.] Univ N Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Management & Policy, Ft Worth, TX 76107 USA; [Pagan, Jose A.] Univ Penn, Leonard Davis Inst Hlth Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Pusan National University; University of New Mexico; University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Health Science Center; University of Pennsylvania,"Milligan, MA (通讯作者)，Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Global Studies, 30 Jangjeon Dong, Busan Metropolitan City 609735, South Korea.",M.Milligan@live.com,,,,,,,26,14,18,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

Forestation measures to offset carbon emissions have already entered the Kyoto Protocol. Other carbon offset options like ocean iron fertilization or chemically enhanced weathering are currently being analyzed. The analysis and comparison of such options requires determination of the amount of carbon credits generated that can be used for compliance. In our analysis we assess the impact of various accounting methods applied to large-scale sink enhancement projects, taking into account the partly temporary storage characteristics arising from such projects. We apply the various accounting methods to hypothetical large-scale Southern Ocean iron fertilization projects for different durations. From an economic perspective, issuing temporary carbon credits would provide the largest number of carbon credits at an early stage. This is equivalent to the existing tCER regulation under the Kyoto Protocol. Issuing temporary carbon credits for short-term ocean iron fertilization would also benefit the environment, as all credits would have to be replaced in the next commitment period. As some carbon will be stored permanently, this reduces atmospheric carbon concentration. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We then apply our test to purchases of ketchup and diapers and find: (1) quality signaling is the dominant mechanism behind reference price effects in both categories; (2) consistent with the quality-signaling theory, reference price effects diminish as various measures of consumer experience increase; but (3) in both categories there are many individuals for whom price-prediction effects dominate quality-signaling effects.","[Erdem, Tuelin] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Katz, Michael L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sun, Baohong] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Management, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",New York University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Carnegie Mellon University,"Erdem, T (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, 40 W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA.",terdem@stern.nyu.edu; katz@haas.berkeley.edu; bsun@andrew.cmu.edu,"Erdem, Tulin/ABH-6648-2020",,,,,,30,20,25,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

Its starting hypothesis is that the persistent, constantly changing and expanding crises that weigh so heavily on modern societies - above all the ecological crisis and the crisis of reproductive work - have their common origin in the separation of production from reproduction constitutive for industrial modernity. A reformulation of the category of (re)productivity - the idea of the unity of and at the same time the distinction between production and reproduction in the economic process - could set the stage for us to review today's crisis phenomena, relocalize problems, and in this way to develop new solutions for them.

However, senior environmental officials expressed doubt that this system was improving the environment and, in 1996, they began to place greater reliance on mill closure as the penalty for poor environmental performance. Since then, managers have found means of subverting many of the intended mill closures, and this causes us to return to the question of the abatement efficiency and effectiveness of the levies. This paper uses production evidence from 34 papermills in two representative provinces to examine the abatement efficiency and effectiveness of the levies. The paper industry is an important industry for this question because it is the largest polluter of China's rural environment. We use a distance function to determine individual output-based and revenue-based shadow prices for each mill during the years that the levies were the main environmental incentive. The output-based shadow prices for pollutants display no recognizable trends over time and they are very different for firms in different locations. The revenue-based shadow prices are widely variable between mills and locations as well. These findings indicate that the marginal opportunity costs of abatement were also widely divergent and that there was no trend toward improved abatement efficiency. The way to correct this is to improve the performance of the market-not to reject the market altogether as the more recent reliance on mill closures does. This observation suggests that a system of tradable permits would be an improvement on relatively less successful administrative measures such as forced mill closures.","[Xu, Jintao; Hyde, William F.; Ji, Yongjie] Peking Univ, Environm Econ Program China, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Hyde, WF (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Environm Econ Program China, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",wfhyde@aol.com,,"Xu, Jintao/0000-0001-5588-2942",,,,,26,5,6,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

This method allows us to account for a multiplicity of economic, social and environmental indicators, but especially for a particular form of benefits, termed as Ordinal Benefits. These Benefits can never be reduced to a monetary value, nonetheless they can be estimated in Emergy terms, albeit such estimations only represent simple ciphers of their real values. On the basis of the FSDOB Method we evaluate all the various forms of benefits provided by the introduction of hydrogen fuel cell buses. The case-study shows that our benefit-oriented approach tends to favor the adoption of environment-friendly technologies, as a consequence of the huge amount of social and environmental benefits they provide. The same solutions would result as non profitable from a traditional financial point of view. In such a perspective, they would never be realized, by loosing, in actual fact, the opportunity of taking advantage of all the associated benefits. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Through destruction or distress sales of productive assets, a hurricane or another natural hazard could induce people with relatively remunerative livelihoods to choose more defensive strategies which allow them to survive, but at a permanently lower welfare level than before. Using panel data from before and after hurricane Mitch, we find that livelihood strategies can be grouped into three welfare categories. Annual farming and farm employment generate low incomes, whereas nonfarm wage employment and livestock farming result in relatively high incomes. Perennial farming, nonfarm self-employment and annual cropping with nonfarm employment take an intermediate position. High welfare strategies were associated with high levels of capital, and the number of people involved was very similar between different years, suggesting that households following low-welfare strategies were trapped in poverty. However, many households moved actively between strategies of different welfare levels. This indicates that there was no absolute poverty threshold, but also that being able to initiate a relatively profitable livelihood strategy was no guarantee that this strategy could be maintained. There is no evidence that hurricane Mitch affected livelihood strategy transitions: livelihood mobility was similar for households inside and outside Mitch-affected areas. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Alonso, AD",,,,"Alonso, Abel Duarte",,,Marron farming in Western Australia: scope and constraints,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Agricultural and fishing industries; Hospitality services; Tourism; Australia,AQUACULTURE; CULTURE; FISH,"Purpose - Marron farming in Western Australia has existed for decades. However, to what extent do marron growers see potential in this industry in ways that include expanding into hospitality and tourism? The purpose of this paper is to examine this dimension from a group of 26 marron growers. Design/methodology/approach - The limited knowledge on marron farming from an academic, industry, as well as from operators' perspective is a critical factor in choosing a qualitative approach in this paper in the form of telephone and face-to-face interviews. Findings - Overall, there is an agreement among respondents about the significant commercial potential of marron farming. However, the dilemma of satisfying increasing demand for marron is acknowledged, as well as resulting problems, for instance, in the form of greed and lack of unity among some growers. Research limitations/implications - While the low number of respondents may not be sufficient to make generalisations of the marron farming industry, this paper proposes an overview into an unexplored industry, and provides useful insights into a niche market. Practical implications - Increased demand for marron in both national and international markets presents opportunities for local operators and the future of macron farming. At the same time, a balance must be maintained in order to preserve natural resources and the industry's sustainability. Originality/value - Despite its demand and potential, to date very limited research has been conducted on marron farming, particularly studying the links between marron, hospitality and tourism, as well as marron growers' points of views on this industry. This exploratory paper contributes to narrowing the existing knowledge gap on these dimensions.","Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Mkt Tourism & Leisure, Joondalup, Australia",Edith Cowan University,"Alonso, AD (通讯作者)，Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Mkt Tourism & Leisure, Joondalup, Australia.",a.alonso@ecu.edu.au,,,,,,,36,1,1,0,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Total lipid content was extracted and methyl esters of fatty acids (FAMEs) were prepared and analyzed by gas chromatography. Findings Gas-liquid chromatography shows that saturated fatty acids (SFA) are the major forms of fatty acids, followed by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). The most abundant PUFA are linolenic acid (18:3n-3), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA 20:5n-3), linoleic acid (18:2n-6), and arachidonic acid (ARA 20:4n-6), the MUFA 16:1 (n-7), and the SFA 16:0, 14:0, 18:0 and 20:0. The sum of EPA and DHA is 8.04 per cent. The n-3/n-6 fatty acids ratio approximately (2:1) is within the range of marine molluscs. The principle differences in the fatty acid composition of Turbo coronatus than most marine molluscs is their low DHA (0.23 +/- 0.01 per cent), low PUFA (40.92 per cent), and high SFA contents (49.25 per cent). The principle differences in the fatty acid composition of Turbo coronatus from most marine molluscs is their low DHA (0.23 0.01 per cent), low PUFA (40.92 per cent), and high SFA contents (49.25 per cent). Research limitations/implications - The Turbo coronatus samples were collected from Shaikh Ebrahim Island; however, further studies regarding the fatty acid composition of Turbo coronatus from other locations are required. Practical implications - The results suggest that Turbo coronatus feeds on bacteria-enriched detritic matter as well as phytoplankton and algae. The low concentration of PUFA in relation to SFA in Turbo coronatus can be attributed to warm water, high salinity, and food availability. Originality/value - The paper provides valuable information about the fatty acid contents in Turbo coronatus, and its feeding habits, and nutritional values.","[Freije, Afnan Mahmood; Awadh, Maysoon Nedham] Univ Bahrain, Coll Sci, Dept Biol, Sakhir, Bahrain",University of Bahrain,"Freije, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Bahrain, Coll Sci, Dept Biol, Sakhir, Bahrain.",afrije@sci.uob.bh,,"Freije, Afnan/0000-0001-5005-7388",,,,,39,3,3,0,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Leaves from plants growing near Kumasi were milled to a fine powder, dried to constant weight in a vacuum desiccator, and analyzed for their content of the afore-mentioned nutrients. The plants were: Hibiscus sabdarija, Hibiscus cannabinus, Amaranthus cruentus, Corchorus oliforius, Solanum macrocarpon, Xanthomosa sagittifolium and Vigna unguiculatus. Findings - All seven ILVs contained a large amount of protein (15.5-22.8 percent), which compared favorably to the essential amino acid pattern of a WHO standard. They all contained nutritionally useful amounts of alpha-linolenic acid and had an omega-6/omega-3 ratio of 0.1-0.9. The seven ILVs contained quantities of calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum and zinc that could contribute significantly to satisfying an individual's need for these elements. Research limitations/implications - The presence of relatively large amounts of various nutritionally essential macro- and micronutrients in these seven ILVs does not necessarily mean these nutrients are bioavailable. Future research is required to determine the amounts of anti-nutrients (e.g. protease inhibitors, chelators) in these vegetables, and the extent to which their protein, lipid and mineral constituents are digested and/or absorbed. Originality/value - Since malnutrition (e.g. iron-deficiency anemia, rickets, zinc deficiency, protein-calorie malnutrition) is common in sub-Saharan Africa, the information which is provided should increase awareness among agricultural and public health officials of the nutritional value of seven underappreciated and underutilized ILVs that are indigenous to Ghana and many other parts of Africa.","[Glew, R.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper integrates desk research literature study and a qualitative survey of food industry companies. An extensive literature review about inter-organizational trust lays a foundation for designing a draft typology based on previous studies, with special attention paid to the influence of culture. Fine-tuning and validation of the typology is achieved through an exploratory field study based on 18 qualitative in-depth interviews with key informants in five EU countries, involving practitioners from the fresh fruit and vegetable, grain, meat and olive supply chains. Findings - A detailed typology of trust is developed. Although it is highly specific to the food industry, it is designed to be neutral to culture and sector, thus allowing the identification of differences in culture when dealing with trust building elements in different sectors in the food supply chain. Research limitations/implications - Since the buyer's perspective is adopted in this paper, further research is needed to validate the typology on the seller side. The typology developed here must also be tested in practice, for instance within a descriptive research quantitative study, aimed at quantifying the relative importance of the different trust elements. Practical implications - The typology stimulates the consideration of cross-cultural or cross-sector differences in the salience of trust attributes and its construction process confirms that reputation management is an extremely important determinant of success or failure. It can serve as a checklist for any company that is interested in improving its relationships with suppliers or buyers. Originality/value - The paper adds to the body of knowledge about inter-organizational trust, providing researchers with a useful tool for conducting experimental research on trust creation mechanisms.","[Canavari, Maurizio] Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dept Agr Econ & Engn DEIAgra, Bologna, Italy; [Hofstede, Gert Jan] Wageningen Univ, Social Sci Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Fritz, Melanie] Univ Bonn, Dept Food & Resource Econ, D-5300 Bonn, Germany; [Oosterkamp, Elsje] Wageningen UR, Agr Econ Res Inst LEI, Wageningen, Netherlands; [van Sprundel, Gert-jan] WU Informat Technol Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",University of Bologna; Wageningen University & Research; University of Bonn; Wageningen University & Research,"Canavari, M (通讯作者)，Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dept Agr Econ & Engn DEIAgra, Bologna, Italy.",maurizio.canavari@unibo.it,"Canavari, Maurizio/A-7247-2008; Fritz, Melanie/C-3437-2014; Hofstede, Gert Jan/G-3805-2011","Canavari, Maurizio/0000-0003-0573-7880; Hofstede, Gert Jan/0000-0001-6100-4660",EU [FP6-043056],EU(European Union (EU)),"The work presented in this paper was performed in the framework of the research project e-Trust: building trust for quality assurance in emerging markets in food chains, funded by the EU 6th Framework Programme Contract No. FP6-043056 (www.etrustproject.eu).

A proposal of a methodological procedure for assessing municipal expenditure efficiency is presented next. It uses multi-criteria assessment, where a dominant criterion of performance is C/E. This procedure is applied to a file of environmental expenditure data from the representative sample of municipalities in selected areas of environmental protection that were used in a project of the Ministry of Environment of the Czech Republic SP/4i1/54/08 Analysis of municipal budgets efficiency in relation to the environmental protection.

Design/methodology/approach - The methodology employs quantitative content analysis performed on a number of different canned food labels (n = 9). Findings - Findings indicate the amount of available space on labels devoted to mandatory information ranged between 17 and 31 per cent, whilst the amount allocated to commercial information ranged between 18 and 45 per cent. Unoccupied space varies between 32 and 54 per cent. This indicates there is an imbalance between mandatory and commercial information, with the weighting in favour of the latter. Research limitations/implications - The small sample size precludes generalization. Practical implications - An extended version of this research could influence government and corporate policy in establishing a balance between the prominence given to different categories of label information, favouring that which is more health positive. Alternately, information could be presented in a larger format, thereby assisting a wider range of consumers to make healthy and informed dietary choices: both outcomes have positive health implications for the population. Another outcome is the formal classification of label information elements thereby enabling clearer comparisons to be made between consumers' food label interactions. Originality/value - This is the first time content analysis has been conducted on food labels. The paper is also unique in proposing a formal taxonomy for food label information. It has value for those working on policy issues.","Univ Ottawa, Fac Hlth Sci, Sch Human Kinet, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Stuart, SA (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Fac Hlth Sci, Sch Human Kinet, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",sstuart@uottawa.ca,,,,,,,33,8,9,0,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Our results proved a heavy-tailed pattern of operational risk data as documented by many researchers. Additionally, our research showed that the PWM is quite consistent when the data is limited as it was able to provide reasonable and consistent capital estimates.

Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on cross-sectional data collected through a questionnaire survey with personal interviews. Respondents' reasons for purchasing floral products are examined. A principal component analysis with varimax rotation was applied in order to provide a more manageable set of variables relating to purchasing. The socio-economic factors of these reasons were used for estimating the significant relation that exists between them. Findings - People purchase cut flowers and pot plants as part of quality of life, as a convenient gift to other people, for religious and social occasions. Significant differences were revealed only in terms of gender and education level of the respondents with a proportion of females and educated people being higher during purchasing floral products. Practical implications - The findings can improve the marketing mix strategy for floral products. Such information is important for the market bodies involved in the floral market and the results of this study are unique and can assist researchers and marketers with an understanding of significant reasons for purchasing floral products. Comparative insights are also provided in terms of the similarities being present between the purchasing of both floral and food products.

The pressure on ecosystems resulting from the production of traded biomass, however, is highly variable between regions and products. We use the concept of embodied human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP) to map the spatial disconnect between net-producing and net-consuming regions. Embodied HANPP comprises total biomass withdrawals and land use induced changes in productivity resulting from the provision of biomass products. International net transfers of embodied HANPP are of global significance, amounting to 1.7 PgC/year. Sparsely populated regions are mainly net producers, densely populated regions net consumers, independent of development status. Biomass consumption and trade are expected to surge over the next decades, suggesting a need to sustainably manage supply and demand of products of ecosystems on a global level.

Interwar demand for new furniture witnessed particularly rapid growth-mainly owing to the extension of the market to lower-income groups. A number of innovative national retailers developed liberal hire purchase (HP) facilities in order to bring furniture within the economic reach of these groups, while sophisticated national advertising campaigns were used both to legitimize the buying of furniture on HP and to project the idea that furnishing by this means was key to achieving the type of aspirational lifestyles being promulgated in the popular media.","Univ Reading, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Scott, P (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England.",,,"Scott, Peter/0000-0003-1230-9040",,,,,39,14,14,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Amidst animated debate on the issue of global warming, this study attempts to explore the determinants Of CO2 emissions in China using aggregate data for more than half a century. Adopting an analytical framework that combines the environmental literature with modem endogenous growth theories, the results indicate that CO2 emissions in China are negatively related to research intensity, technology transfer and the absorptive capacity of the economy to assimilate foreign technology. Our findings also indicate that more energy use, higher income and greater trade openness tend to cause more CO2 emissions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The incommensurability of values and the essentially multi-dimensional and dynamic nature of sustainability challenge the use of composite measurement indices. This determined the choice of MCDA methods. Austria was chosen as a case study, due to the wide availability of data, especially on indicators of strong sustainability. The structure of the multi-criteria problem comprised the evolution of different sustainability dimensions over time. The process for selecting criteria included a critical assessment of institutional sustainability agendas (UN, EU and Austrian Government) and theoretical recommendations. After an assessment of MCDA methods, the NAIADE method demonstrated the most suitable properties for sustainability assessment. The application of this outranking approach was undertaken in three separate settings: long-term from 1960 to 2003. medium-term. 1970-1995, and short-term, 1995-2003 with varying numbers of criteria. The response of results to the addition of evaluating criteria and periods was tested. The degree of credibility for accepting preference relations was also employed for sensitivity analysis. According to the results of long-term and medium-term assessments, especially in the weak sustainability setting, sustainable progress is taking place in Austria. In the short term, in the stronger sustainability setting and, especially as the number of criteria increases, more incomparable periods appear and trends are less determined. Moreover, it is shown how results crucially depend on the methodological choices. This is one of the first applications of the multi-criteria tools to the dynamic analysis of sustainability at the macro scale.

There is ongoing debate about the validity of the willingness-to-pay statements this method elicits particularly then when ethically or morally 'charged' public goods are assessed. It has been assumed that a considerable portion of the public holds deontological stances toward and applies analytical moral reasoning to such goods, which distort willingness-to-pay statements and subsequent cost-benefit analyses based on stated economic values. Results from studies in developmental and moral psychology, however. indicate that the majority of people base moral choice. and subsequently trade-offs, on social norms, affective reactions, and moral intuition rather than on analytical moral reasoning. This article presents a small focus-group study of people in the UK (n= 18), exploring whether their responses supports the idea that a considerable percentage of the public holds deontological stances towards the environment that influence their willingness to pay for environmental goods. The article contributes to the discourse on the validity of willingness-to-pay statements. From a broader perspective. it scrutinizes the importance of analytical moral reasoning and suggests that affective judgments and intuition are relevant to environmental valuation.

Approaches like cost benefit analysis/contingent valuation, multicriteria analysis and deliberative methods are based on very different assumptions concerning the characteristics of environmental resources, the capacities of the individuals involved and the role the methods play in framing the process. The present paper views environmental appraisal methods as institutional structures. They are seen as rules concerning a) who should participate and in which capacity, b) what is considered data and which form data should take, and c) rules about how a conclusion is reached. Specifically, the choice of method defines the logic of the appraisal process and next influences the output. While cost benefit analysis is based on the assumption of individual rationality, deliberative methods assume that individuals can act according to social rationality. The first part of the paper is devoted to clarifying what institutions are and their role in the valuation process. Second, the main features of environmental or ecosystem services and the demands they raise for decision-making are described. A general framework for evaluating appraisal methods is then developed. Finally, this structure is elaborated in more detail as a basis for deciding over the choices of methods in the case of evaluating ecosystem services. A set of unresolved issues are identified - especially related to how the choice of appraisal methods themselves should be instituted. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The data sets that result from these national assessments typically serve as the basis for Footprint calculations at smaller scales, including those for regions, cities, businesses, and individuals. Global Footprint Network's National Footprint Accounts, supported and used by more than 70 major organizations worldwide, contain the most widely used national accounting methodology today. The National Footprint Accounts calculations are undergoing continuous improvement as better data becomes available and new methodologies are developed. In this paper, a community of active Ecological Footprint practitioners and users propose key research priorities for improving national Ecological Footprint accounting. For each of the proposed improvements, we briefly review relevant literature, summarize the current state of debate, and suggest approaches for further development. The research agenda will serve as a reference for a large scale, international research program devoted to furthering the development of national Ecological Footprint accounting methodology.

With his social macro theory Habermas has provided an alternative, critical justification for social theory that can be distinguished from economic libertarianism and from political liberalism. implicitly, most flow approaches draw from these theoretical traditions rather than from discourse theory. There are several types of material and energy flow analyses. While these concepts basically share a system theoretical view, they lack a specific interdisciplinary perspective that ties the fundamental insight of flows to disciplinary scientific development. Instead of simply expanding micro-models to the social macro-dimension social theory suggests infusing the very notion of flows to the progress of disciplines. With regard to the functional integration of society, material and energy flow analyses can rely on the paradigm of ecological economics and at the same time progress the debate between strong and weak sustainability within the paradigm. However, placing economics at the Centre of their functional analyses may still ignore the broader social integration of society, depending on their pre-analytic outline of research and the methods used.

Biosecurity policies aim to either prevent invasions before they occur or to eradicate and/or effectively manage the invasive species and diseases once an invasion has occurred. Such policies have traditionally been directed towards professional producers in natural resource based sectors, including agriculture. Given the wide scope of issues threatened by invasive species and diseases, it is important to account for several types of stakeholders that are involved. We investigate the problem of an invasive insect pest feeding on an agricultural crop with heterogeneous producers: profit-oriented professional farmers and utility-oriented hobby farmers. We start from an ecological-economic model conceptually similar to the one developed by Eiswerth and Johnson [Eiswerth, M.E. and Johnson, W.S., 2002. Managing nonindigenous invasive species: insights from dynamic analysis. Environmental and Resource Economics 23, 319-342.] and extend it in three ways. First, we make explicit the relationship between the invaded state carrying capacity and farmers' planting decisions. Second, we add another producer type into the framework and hence account for the existence of both professional and hobby fanners. Third, we provide a theoretical contribution by discussing two alternative types of equilibria. We also apply the model to an empirical case to extract a number of stylised facts and in particular to assess: a) under which circumstances the invasion is likely to be not controllable; and b) how extending control policies to hobby farmers could affect both types of producers.

Pragmatics (in terms of illocutionary acts) and semiotics (the understanding of signs) and its own branch of pragmatics, connect at an important junction in relation to textual entities, providing a means to undertake a contextual discovery of web services. Furthermore, norms based upon shared beliefs and specifics relating to a business organisation, affect what a human agent may achieve during the web service discovery process. A preliminary web service discovery mechanism, using the theory behind semiotics, pragmatics, speech acts and deontic logic, is defined in this paper to aid human agents during the web service discovery process.

The former studies how the technical and social contexts shape meaning, but it does not answer questions such as why interpreters note some signs but not others, which norms are used in particular circumstances, or bow interpreters influence each other. The latter focuses on cognitive processes and complements organisational semiotics. Together, the two theories offer superior understanding of how technical, social and individual factors shape meaning in organisations. The framework posits that meaning is the result of both the meaning vehicle and the meaning process. Different agents react differently to a sign because they focus on distinct sign attributes due to cognitive filters, or as a result of the agents' affordances, the norms guiding their behaviour or the assimilation / accommodation and filtering processes.","[Canhoto, Ana Isabel] Henley Business Sch, Henley On Thames RG9 3AU, England",University of Reading,,ana.canhoto@henley.reading.ac.uk,"Canhoto, Ana Isabel/M-1980-2017","Canhoto, Ana Isabel/0000-0002-1623-611X",,,,,35,0,0,0,0,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9806057-2-3,,,,2009,,,,,,,63,70,,,,,,8,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BKK53,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268388300009,0

Various processing treatments are known to destroy heat labile toxic compounds and other enzyme inhibitors, hence, to improve the texture, palatability and nutritive value of pulses. This paper, therefore, aims to focus on improving the digestibility and availability of nutrients of green gram (Vigna radiata L.) through processing treatments. Design/nnethodology/approach - The present study was undertaken to see the effect of common processing and cooking treatments on newly released green gram cultivars. To achieve this objective, green gram seeds were soaked in plain water (1:4 w/v) for 12 hours at 37 degrees C. One portion of the soaked seeds was dried at 55 degrees C and left-over soaked seeds were divided into three portions. One portion of the soaked seeds was dehulled manually. The second portion of the soaked seeds was ordinary and pressure-cooked (water two times the weight of soaked seeds) for 35 minutes at 95-100 degrees C and at 1.05 kg/cm(2) pressure for 15 minutes, respectively. The third portion of the soaked seeds was sprouted for 24 hours at 37 degrees C. All the processed seeds were dried at 55 degrees C in a hot air oven and then ground in a cyclone sample mill and stored for estimation of nutritional parameters using standard methods. Findings - Soaking and cooking treatments had no significant effect on proximate composition, whereas sugar contents increased and starch contents decreased significantly. Soaking and cooking treatments also improved in vitro starch digestibility significantly. De-hulling of soaked seeds further improved starch digestibility and also caused significant change in protein, fat, ash, crude fibre and sugar contents. Germination decreased starch, thereby raising the level of the soluble sugars and improved starch digestibility by 49 and 48 percent, respectively, in both cultivars. Similarly, pressure-cooking also increased starch digestibility by about 44 and 49 percent, respectively, in both cultivars. Cooking may gelatinize starch and germination may mobilize starch, resulting in improved digestibility of starch by alpha-amylase. Practical implications - Evolving high-yielding crop varieties is one of the most important strategies to fill the gap between demand and supply of food legumes and also to improve the nutritional status of the population consuming such foods. Hence, it is imperative to judge their chemical composition and improve them through inexpensive processing techniques. Originality/value - The paper gives an overall view of nutritive values of new and traditional varieties of vegetables and will be of value to those who supply the consumer.","[Grewal, Antu; Jood, Sudesh] Haryana Agr Univ, CCS, Dept Food & Nutr, Hisar 125004, Haryana, India",CCS Haryana Agricultural University,"Jood, S (通讯作者)，Haryana Agr Univ, CCS, Dept Food & Nutr, Hisar 125004, Haryana, India.",ramjood@rediffmail.com,,,,,,,23,6,6,0,36,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Selfing produced few seeds, and very few viable seedlings. The paternal backcross and several half-sib combinations exhibited minimal effects on seed development or early growth and in some cases were similar to the outcross. Sibcrosses were generally unsuccessful. The highest inbreeding coefficient that was not associated with severe inbreeding depression was approximately 0.25.

In turn, some ES affect agricultural productivity. Managing agricultural lands to provide more ES and higher quality ES may be essential for the long-term sustainability of agricultural ecosystems. Most agricultural lands, however, are managed for the short-term production of food, fiber, and fuel, often at the expense of other ES. Proposed solutions to the underprovision of ES often involve government regulation or market incentives. A growing number of scholars, however, recognize the potential for a third approach-cooperative solutions. One important element in determining if an ES is a suitable candidate for cooperative solutions is its resource characteristics. Accordingly, this paper: 1.) provides a framework for determining an ES's suitability for collective management based on its resource characteristics, 2.) provides an in-depth analysis of three agricultural-based ES to show how the framework differentiates between ES and 3.) uses the framework to analyze fourteen agricultural-based ES for their suitability for collective management. Ten out of the fourteen ES analyzed may be well suited (e.g. pollination), suited (e.g. flood control), or moderately suited (e.g. nature recreation) for collective management under current incentive systems in agricultural ecosystems.

Such an undertaking is deemed imperative following the negative for the EU turn of events at the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit. There is sufficient literature to be found on the link between the Union's unique and complex organizational structure and its inability to act cohesively and purposefully. This study seeks to add to this corpus by looking at the extent to which the EU has been able to learn from its mistakes and incorporate timely remedial action. Even though important, the EU's failures as a global actor cannot be explained by only looking at its ineffective institutional architecture. A more systematic understanding of the reasons behind EU's failures in climate talks is in fact needed. By using Underdal's theory of 'negotiation failure', this study tries to explore the extent to which negotiation theory could help with better comprehending the obstacles that prevented the Union from getting more out of the climate negotiation process.","Keele Univ, Keele, Staffs, England",Keele University,"Afionis, S (通讯作者)，Keele Univ, Keele, Staffs, England.",afionis@gmail.com,"Afionis, Stavros/AES-5062-2022","Afionis, Stavros/0000-0002-0434-5108",,,,,53,17,19,4,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

This article presents five core features of the climate policy problem, five principles demanding respect when designing policy, and a particular specification of the four general criteria: efficacy, efficiency, equity, and institutional feasibility. The central policy problem of climate change is the phasing out of non-sustainable energy use by orchestrating trillions of decisions by billions of people. Principles like universality, realism, and transparency are important, but when balancing a global agreement, taking into account diversity and sovereignty are outstanding. For addressing the climate change challenges, the equity criterion should be taken more seriously by the negotiating countries than at present. In a diverse world, equity conflicts are likely to be further exacerbated by attempts to impose uniform approaches like global carbon trading or a harmonized global carbon tax rate. The uniform approaches, lauded by economists and policy makers as superior, are also criticized here as not being so effective and efficient as pretended.","Univ Antwerp, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"Verbruggen, A (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",aviel.verbruggen@ua.ac.be,,,,,,,87,9,11,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

While existing new economic geography (NEG) models could not explicitly analyze the relationship due to their assumptions, I construct a new NEG-type model allowing for different location dynamics of firms and skilled labor for this objective. The main results are as follows. First, a relatively large pool of skilled labor attracts firms when trade costs are small, while it might repel firms when trade costs are sufficiently large. Second, assuming that skilled workers are mobile between regions, the model shows that skilled workers agglomerate faster than firms with decreasing trade costs. Third, the model supports the hypothesis that firms follow skilled labor rather than the reverse. These results are consistent to Indian and Chinese experiences, and some creative-class or skilled-city stories.","Kagawa Univ, Grad Sch Management, Kagawa 7608523, Japan",Kagawa University,"Takatsuka, H (通讯作者)，Kagawa Univ, Grad Sch Management, Saiwai Cho 2-1, Kagawa 7608523, Japan.",takatsuka@gsm.kagawa-u.ac.jp,"Takatsuka, Hajime/AAG-7683-2019; Takatsuka, Hajime/A-8656-2013","Takatsuka, Hajime/0000-0003-4958-2665",,,,,38,4,8,5,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

However, most analysis of this reduction uses national and regional poverty statistics. In contrast, we employ poverty mapping methodologies to find heterogeneity in the effectiveness of transfers across counties. To better understand this variation, we explore the roles of characteristics of the local population, structural features of the county, and geography. The greatest reductions in poverty occur in rural households, yet population characteristics and geography are also important. These findings suggest that targeting at low levels of aggregation can deliver further reductions in poverty.","[Agostini, Claudio A.] Ilades Univ Alberto Hurtado, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Brown, Philip H.] Colby Coll, Dept Econ, Waterville, ME 04901 USA",Universidad Alberto Hurtado; Colby College,"Agostini, CA (通讯作者)，Ilades Univ Alberto Hurtado, Dept Econ, Erasmo Escala 1835, Santiago, Chile.",agostini@uahurtado.cl; phbrown@colby.edu,"Agostini, Claudio A./HLG-7336-2023; Stahlmann-Brown, Philip/B-4948-2016","Agostini, Claudio A./0000-0002-3916-1501; Stahlmann-Brown, Philip/0000-0003-4310-1103",,,,,31,15,20,1,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

On average, projects have 150 jobs and each job diverted costs 27,500 pound (1995 prices). It also finds that the size of the area designated for grants has a positive location effect. The effect is small in relation to the overall scale of FDI, which may explain the weak grant effect found in recent plant-based location studies.","[Wren, Colin; Jones, Jonathan] Newcastle Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Business, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Wren, C (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Business, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",c.m.wren@ncl.ac.uk; jonathan.jones@ncl.ac.uk,,"Jones, Jonathan/0000-0003-3619-0777",ESRC [ES/G005966/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G005966/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,59,17,19,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Contrary to predictions from non-cooperative game theory, participants are sometimes willing to restrain voluntarily from over extracting resources and use costly punishment to sanction other participants. Something as simple as face-to-face communication has been shown to increase average earnings significantly. In the next generation of experiments, both in the laboratory and in the field, we need to extract more information that provides insight concerning why people make the decisions they make. More information is needed concerning attributes of individuals as well as the social and social-ecological context in which they interact that may give rise to such deviations from theoretical predictions. In the process of extracting more information from participants and the contexts in which they interact, we face several methodological and ethical challenges which we address in this paper.

As part of two related research projects that focus on how subtle social and environmental contextual variables affect the evolution and performance of institutional rules, several sets of experiments have been performed in laboratory settings at Arizona State University and in field settings in rural villages in Thailand and Colombia. In these experiments, participants make both a decision about how much to invest in public infrastructure and how much to extract from the resources generated by that public infrastructure. With both studies we find that head-enders act as stationary bandits. They do take unequal shares of the common-pool resource but if their share is very large relative to downstream participants' shares, the latter will revolt. Therefore for groups to be successful, head-enders must restrain themselves in their use of their privileged access to the common-pool resource. The comparative approach shows that this result is robust across different social and ecological contexts. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A survey questionnaire has been sent to 1286 fruit-growers and vegetable producers located in the French areas of Alpes de Haute Provence, Hautes-Alpes and Vaucluse. Analysis of individual responses (N=243) shows that, although economic concerns play a strong role, a significant number of respondents give high importance to moral and social ones. We also examine how these considerations matter according to different crop protection strategies, that is, conventional farming, IP and OF. Using a multinomial logistic regression, we find that (1) social concerns (e.g., showing to others one's environmental commitment) drive both IP and OF adoption, (2) moral concerns (e.g., do not feel guilty about one's choices) increase the probability of organic farming adoption only, and (3) farmers who give high importance to economic concerns (e.g., cutting production costs) are less likely to adopt OF.

In particular, we evaluate RTS assumptions in a Free Disposal Hull model, which accounts for uncertainty and heterogeneity in the sample. Additionally, we provide a three-step framework to empirically analyze the existence and extent of RTS in real world applications. In a first step, the presence of scale (and scope) economies is verified. Secondly, RTS for individual observations are examined while in a third step we derive the optimal scale for a sector as a whole.

As a result, it is important to account for species diversity to ensure sustainable management. In addition, recent research published in the marine sciences literature has provided unequivocal evidence that fishing activities destroy habitats and inhibit production of planktons. This paper illustrates that if a conventional bioeconomic model is employed, an optimum effort policy as opposed to quota appears to result in sustainable management even if fishing impacts carrying capacity. However, the so-called optimum effort may collapse the stock if species diversity is not accounted for. Conversely, if species diversity and the impact of fishing on carrying capacity are considered, neither the equilibrium quota nor effort may guarantee sustainable yield. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The approach in this study was to consider natural forest, forest plantation, pasture, and cropland simultaneously to investigate how an optimized land-use distribution may reduce the amount of compensation necessary to avoid C emissions from forest loss. The financial compensations derived were as high as US$ 176 per hectare per year when comparing natural forests only with the most profitable alternative (croplands). However, compensation decreased to US$ 124 for risk-neutral decision-makers, who would strive for optimized land-use allocation, and to only US$ 47 per hectare per year for risk-avoiders, who would look to maximize the reward-to-variability ratio. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the compensation under risk-aversion increased much less than under risk-ignoring when increased productivity of agricultural land-use or growing demand for agricultural products was simulated. It was concluded that considering appropriate diversification strategies and the well documented human behavior to avoid risks is an important step in developing cost-effective compensation policies.

At the same time, CDM projects are meant to contribute to sustainable development in the host country, as defined by this country. The CDM is often taken to illustrate a broader contemporary turn in environmental policymaking toward market liberalism, flexibility, and pluralism, where the governance of the CDM involves 'agency beyond the state' at different political levels and across various jurisdictions. While such an image of the CDM certainly identifies important aspects, it also downplays the ways in which states govern the CDM, not at the international level but at the domestic level through the host country prerogative to define its sustainable development priorities. Early on in the scholarly debate on the CDM, fears were raised about a 'race to the bottom' with regard to sustainable development requirements on CDM projects. Our research on Chile confirms that hypothesis, with the important addition, that the 'race' is not simply a structural feature of the CDM, but a deliberate strategy. We argue that Chile has actively chosen to put only marginal emphasis on securing the CDM's contribution to sustainable development, and instead uses the CDM primarily as a tool to attract foreign investments, treating carbon credits as just another export product.","[Rindefjall, Teresia; Lund, Emma; Stripple, Johannes] Lund Univ, Dept Polit Sci, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Lund, E (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Box 52, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",emma.lund@svet.lu.se; johannes.stripple@svet.lu.se,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [0810837] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,59,17,17,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Most current methods to calculate optimal budgets for such advertising campaigns consider customers in isolation and ignore word-of-mouth communication (WOM). When the customer base forms a network (as is the case in telecom or social network databases) ignoring WOM clearly leads to suboptimal advertising budgets. This paper develops a model to help address this challenge. We assume that firms know the network structure formed by customers but do not know (or are not allowed to use) data on individuals' connections. Under this scenario, we compare the optimal campaign of a monopolist to that of firms competing in simultaneous-move or sequential-move games. The analysis provides two key insights: (i) we show that ignoring the existence of WOM leads to significant profit loss for firms and this is more so under competition. In particular, knowing the density of consumer connections is crucial for the design of optimal campaigns. (ii) Competition in direct advertising exhibits strong first-mover advantages and, even in a simultaneous-move game between identical firms, highly asymmetric outcomes are possible. The paper also explores two extensions. First, we study the nature of the trade-off between increasing network size versus increasing the connectivity between existing network members. Second, we investigate how firms' advertising activity may endogenously grow the membership base.","[Zubcsek, Peter Pal] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Sarvary, Miklos] INSEAD, F-77305 Fontainebleau, France",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; INSEAD Business School,"Zubcsek, PP (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",pzubcsek@ufl.edu; miklos.sarvary@insead.edu,,,,,,,33,28,37,0,37,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

This article argues that low wages were due to surplus labour in agriculture. Low wages allowed the persistence of managerial inefficiencies and resulted in low productivity and work effort. It uses firm-level data from all the textile producing regions in India to examine the relationship between unions and labour productivity. The findings show that fewer workers were employed per machine in the unionized mills in Bombay and Ahmedabad, compared to the mills in less unionized regions.

J,"Alonso, AD",,,,"Alonso, Abel Duarte",,,The red-headed stepchild of wine? Marketing muscadine wines in the Southern USA,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Muscadines; Muscadine wine; Winery operators; Consumer snobbery; Lack of knowledge; Southern states; Wines; Consumers,CONSUMER ETHNOCENTRISM; CONSUMPTION; DIMENSIONS; IMPACT,"Purpose - Muscadine (Villa Rotundifolia Michx.) is a native vine that grows wild and that is also cultivated in the Southern USA. Today, many wineries located in this region produce and sell wines made of muscadine grapes. While much of contemporary research focuses on the many health properties of muscadine grapes, very little is known of muscadine wines from an entrepreneurial or operational perspective, including muscadine wines' marketing potential. This paper aims to investigate these areas, examining some of the challenges that Southern winery operators face in successfully marketing muscadine wines. Design/methodology/approach - Using telephone interviews (29), coupled with two face-to-face interviews, data were collected among 31 winery owners located in different Southern states. Findings - More than one-third of respondents (11) considered dealing with consumer snobbery as the main challenge their wineries faced. Operators of this group argued that there appears to be a stigma attached to muscadine wines, particularly among many consumers who consider muscadine wines as inferior to Vitis Vinifera wines. In addition, eight participants mentioned consumers' lack of knowledge of muscadine wines as their main challenge. The prevalence of these two main challenges clearly suggests the need for consumer education if any images of inferiority in muscadine wines are to be dispelled. Research limitations/implications - The number of this study's participants (33) is limited and may not allow for making generalisations about muscadine winery operators. Practical implications - The study explores a distinctive sector, namely, that of grapes and wines native to the Southern region. With growing interest in local products that, as in the case of muscadine grapes, also have a close association to healthy components (e.g. resveratrol, nutraceutical products), the study's findings may have important implications for the future marketing of muscadine wines and grapes. Originality/value - To date muscadine wine entrepreneurship has received almost no attention from academic research, particularly as it relates to the areas of marketing, hospitality and tourism.","[Alonso, Abel Duarte] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Mkt Tourism & Leisure, Perth, WA, Australia; [Alonso, Abel Duarte] Univ Western Sydney, Sch Management, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Edith Cowan University; Western Sydney University,"Alonso, AD (通讯作者)，Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Mkt Tourism & Leisure, Perth, WA, Australia.",a.alonso@ecu.edu.au,,,,,,,52,4,5,0,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

First, the paper seeks to present principles of crisis management, and crisis preparation and recovery. Second, it aims to narrate the 2008 events to give context for this case study. Third, it seeks to present a conceptual framework for food industry crisis management in the context of food recalls. Finally, it sets out to present conclusions concerning the food recall, managerial changes, limitations, and future research directions. Design/methodology/approach - The paper chose an exploratory case-study design to guide the study, based on Yin's argument that case studies are the preferred strategy when how or why questions are being posed, and when the focus is on a modern phenomenon within a real-life context. Such a design is particularly appropriate for understanding the details and complexity of a phenomenon. A survey study was focused on formal interviews onsite and at the Toronto plant where the recall occurred. Findings - Differences in institutional and relational rules and subsequent management actions during the food recall are linked to the four axes represented in this study. Based on the findings, values played a key role in crisis management at Premiere Quality Foods during the recall. Research limitations/implications - The incident reported in this paper was not compared with any other recalls. The survey also had a limited number of respondents. Several areas of crisis management in the context of a food recall are opened to researchers who have developed a particular interest in the subject. Scholars could explore the conditions that enable or inhibit an organization in effectively detecting and interpreting early crisis warning signals that often lead to a food recall. Originality/value - The mechanics of crisis management and food recalls are a dangerously under-developed field. This paper proposes a way of identifying relevant principles for crisis management and discusses a communication problem that is prevalent in food recalls. The paper considers both internal and external causal factors of crisis management related to food recalls. Today's concepts of crisis and food recalls are no longer mainly externally oriented; they are systemic in nature.","Univ Regina, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada",University of Regina,"Charlebois, S (通讯作者)，Univ Regina, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada.",sylvain.charlebois@uoguelph.ca,,"Charlebois, Sylvain/0000-0002-9400-0153",,,,,53,15,17,1,29,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

To diminish the effect of slaughterhouses pollutants on the enviroment, different techniques to treat wastewater are used. In JSV ,Agaras to treat wastewater from slaughterhouses a two stage treating facility with constructed wetlands was installed. Industrial wastewater treated in a natural system and untreated surface wastewater from the area of production are disharged into the Jupodupe river. This study looks into the effect of wastewater from JSV Agaras on the water quality in the Juodupe river during the period of 2007-2010. It has been determined that pollution of surface wastewater form production areas of slaugterhouse does not exceed limit vlaues and can be disharged into the Juodupe river without further treating. The quality of treated wastewater did not deteriorate under the main indexes of pollution during the period of investigation and therefore conformed to the environmental requirements. This demonstrates that wastewater treatment facility with two-stage filters of sand-reed horizontal filtration works effectively. Investigation did not determine any negative effect of wastewater from slaughterhouses on the quality of the Juodupe river in the period of investigation. In 2010 the quality of water in the Juodupe river above and below the production area did not conform to the criteria of good class of environmental state according to nitrates and general nitrogen. River pollution is more often influenced by intensive agricultural activity carried out in the river catchment than it is by wastewater water discharged from slaugterhouses, as water below the slaughterhouse in separate cases was better than above the slaughterhouse.","[Dapkiene, Midona; Cesoniene, Laima; Radzevicius, Algirdas; Kazakeviciene, Jurgita] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,,,,"Dapkiene, Midona/0000-0003-0612-6520",,,,,12,0,0,0,0,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,2,,,,,274,279,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304698500049,0

Design/methodology/approach - Adulterant-specific DNA fragments (red beet pulp specific Beet 01 and Z nummularia specific Ziz 01) identified by random amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR) analysis were cloned and sequenced for SCAR marker development. Red beet pulp specific SCAR primer pair, B1, and Z nummularia specific SCAR primer pair, Z1, were designed from the corresponding RAPD marker sequences to amplify SCAR markers of 320 bp and 389 bp, respectively. The utility of the SCAR markers for adulterant detection was verified in model blends of chilli powder with the adulterants. Six commercial samples of ground chilli powder were analysed using the SCAR markers. Findings - SCAR markers could detect the adulterants at a concentration as low as 10 g adulterant kg(-1) blended sample. The Z. nummularia SCAR marker could detect the presence of Z nummularia fruit adulteration in one of the commercial samples. All the market samples tested were free from red beet pulp adulteration. Practical implications - The PCR-based method developed in the study is simple, rapid, and sensitive and has the potential to be developed into a quantitative analytical method and for commercial PCR kits for the large-scale screening of ground chilli to detect and prevent plant-based adulterants. The work has public health significance too, as ground chilli is one of the major spices consumed worldwide. Originality/value - The study is the first report on the development of SCAR markers for adulterant detection in ground chilli. This work has relevance, as adulteration is a major concern of the sanitary and phytosanitary issues of the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement.","[Dhanya, K.; Syamkumar, S.; Siju, S.; Sasikumar, B.] Indian Inst Spices Res, Crop Improvement & Biotechnol Div, Calicut, Kerala, India",Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Indian Institute of Spices Research,"Dhanya, K (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Spices Res, Crop Improvement & Biotechnol Div, Calicut, Kerala, India.",dhanyabiotech@gmail.com,"Kizhakayil, Dhanya/AAU-5890-2020; SENAN, SIJU/G-6629-2012; siv pillai, syamkumar/L-7324-2016","Senan, Siju/0000-0002-0479-9062; siv pillai, syamkumar/0000-0002-9187-703X","Department of Biotechnology, Government of India","Department of Biotechnology, Government of India(Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India)","This work was supported by a research grant from the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India.

Design/methodology/approach - A range of published (1995-2008) articles on food safety is explored that lists the motives for and the barriers to the implementation of the Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Point plan in descending order of frequency of occurrences. The barriers and motives in this study are referred to as critical factors of effective implementation (CFEIs). In addition, the Pareto analysis quality tool was used to sort and arrange the above-mentioned barriers to and motives for CFEIs of the HACCP system implementation according to their order of criticality. Findings - The examination and analysis of 31 studies resulted in the identification of 32 factors that affect HACCP implementation. Difficulties exist in managing such a large number of factors in organisations; hence a few vital CFEIs are identified and reported herein, such as the most significant for the HACCP implementation. Practical implications - The present study will direct researchers in selecting a more reliable and critical set of CFEIs that will be used in further empirical studies and may help to develop models which measure and sustain the level of performance on safety systems in industries. Industries can also benefit by adopting the results of this study, resulting in a more effective implementation of food safety and quality systems. Originality/value - This paper highlights and prioritises the difficulties hitherto faced by food companies in the effective implementation of food safety systems. The results of this study will help in a smoother and more effective penetration of food safety and quality systems in food organisations.","[Fotopoulos, Christos; Kafetzopoulos, Dimitrios] Univ Ioannina, Dept Business Adm Food & Agr Enterprises, Agrinion, Greece; [Gotzamani, Katerina] Univ Macedonia, Dept Business Adm, Thessaloniki, Greece",University of Ioannina; University of Macedonia,"Fotopoulos, C (通讯作者)，Univ Ioannina, Dept Business Adm Food & Agr Enterprises, Agrinion, Greece.",chfotopu@cc.uol.gr,"GOTZAMANI, KATERINA/AAN-7624-2021","GOTZAMANI, KATERINA/0000-0002-4083-7353",,,,,54,53,62,2,34,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

First, we construct estimates of permanent and transitory income and then estimate saving functions consistent with intertemporal optimization. The saving behaviour of Japanese worker households is in turn compared with that of American worker households before World War I, a time when they too lacked access to general social services. The estimated marginal propensities to save out of permanent and transitory incomes were quite similar for Japanese and American worker households, but the Japanese ones saved more at a given level of income. The economic environment facing Japanese workers, however, seemed to be no riskier than that facing American workers. We attribute instead this result primarily to the widespread postal savings banks in Japan which increased the convenience and decreased the risk of saving.","[James, John A.] Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Suto, Isao] Meiji Univ, Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Tokyo 101, Japan",University of Virginia; Meiji University,"James, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, POB 400182, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",jaj8y@virginia.edu,,,,,,,60,5,5,0,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,JAN,2011,5.0,1,,,,,1,25,,10.1007/s11698-010-0051-2,0.0,,,25,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,756BV,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000289987600001,0

Design/methodology/approach - The paper begins with a discussion of the growing awareness of the role that retailers, and more particularly food retailers, can play in promoting sustainable consumption. This is followed by a short literature review of current thinking on sustainable consumption. Information obtained from two simple walk through/visual observation and information collection surveys conducted within the largest store operated by each of the top ten food retailers within the towns of Cheltenham and Gloucester, UK, provided the empirical material for the case study. The paper concludes with some reflections on how sustainable consumption fits into the large food retailers' business models. Findings - The survey revealed that, while the UK's top ten food retailers were providing customers with some information on sustainable consumption, the dominant thrust of marketing communication within stores was designed to encourage consumption. More generally, the paper concludes that, at best, the UK's leading food retailers are pursuing a weak model of sustainable consumption and that their definitions of, and engagement with, sustainable consumption is driven as much by commercial imperatives as by commitments to sustainability. Originality/value - This paper provides an accessible review of the extent to which the UK's leading food retailers are communicating sustainable consumption agendas to their customers within stores and as such it will be of value to academics, practitioners, consumer organisations and policy makers interested in the role retailers can play in promoting sustainable consumption.","[Jones, Peter; Comfort, Daphne] Univ Gloucestershire, Sch Business, Cheltenham, Glos, England; [Hillier, David] Univ Glamorgan, Ctr Police Sci, Pontypridd CF37 1DL, M Glam, Wales",University of Gloucestershire; University of South Wales,"Jones, P (通讯作者)，Univ Gloucestershire, Sch Business, Cheltenham, Glos, England.",pjones@glos.ac.uk,,"Jones, Peter/0000-0002-9566-9393",,,,,44,48,50,5,65,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed in this study to determine the effects of MTG, MD and SPI on firmness of SCC. Findings - The second-order model generated via RSM was significant with only a 9.76 per cent variation not explained by the model. The coefficient of regression revealed that MTG, MD and SPI showed significant linear effects (P < 0.0001) on the firmness of SCC, while MTG and SPI showed significant quadratic effects. The model successfully predicted and developed a SCC model with similar firmness as that of DCC; via the combination of 2.57 per cent (w/w) of MTG, 19.69 per cent (w/w) of SPI and 19.69 per cent (w/w) of MD. Physicochemical analyses revealed that SCC possessed lower fat content, reduced saturated fatty acid and zero trans fat. Further rheological measurements revealed that SCC was more solid-like at room temperature, but less elastic at refrigerated temperature compared to DCC. SEM and SDS-PAGE analyses affirmed that the textural changes of SCC were attributed to MTG-induced cross-linking. Originality/value - The research demonstrated that a non-dairy cream cheese could be developed using soy. In addition, the SCC also contained better nutritional properties compared to its dairy counterpart.","[Lim, Ting-Jin; Easa, Azhar-Mat; Karim, Abdul-Alias; Bhat, Rajeev; Liong, Min-Tze] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Ind Technol, George Town, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Liong, MT (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Ind Technol, George Town, Malaysia.",mintze.liong@usm.my,"Liong, Min-Tze/GVT-7267-2022; Bhat, Rajeev/G-4863-2010; Liong, Min Tze/F-4726-2010; Easa, Azhar Mat/F-6367-2010; Alias, Abd Karim/B-7550-2009","Liong, Min-Tze/0000-0002-4471-8271; Bhat, Rajeev/0000-0003-3391-6624; Alias, Abd Karim/0000-0002-0082-4785; MAT EASA, AZHAR/0000-0002-1545-2419",Research University-Universiti Sains Malaysia [1001/PTEKIND/ 815056]; USM,Research University-Universiti Sains Malaysia; USM,This work was supported by the Research University-Universiti Sains Malaysia grant (1001/PTEKIND/ 815056) and the USM fellowship.,,61,19,20,4,51,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This study uses longitudinal data from 1985 to 2001 to empirically assess the impact of distance from place of residence to bars on alcohol consumption in four large U.S. cities from 1985 to 2001. Density of bars within 0.5 km of a person's residence is associated with small increases in alcohol consumption as measured by: daily alcohol consumption (ml) drinks per week, and weekly consumption of beer, wine, and liquor. When person-specific fixed effects are included, the relationship between alcohol consumption and the number of bars within a 0.5 km radius of the person's place of residence disappears. Tests for endogeneity of the number of bars within the immediate vicinity of respondents' homes fail to reject the null hypothesis that the number of bars is exogenous.

Many reserve site selection problems are analyzed in mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models due to the mathematical solvers available for this model type. Ideally, such reserve site selection models take into consideration the possibility that species use reserve sites, even small ones, as stepping stones to move from one site to another. This consideration, however, is difficult to include in MILP models. This paper demonstrates and evaluates three alternative MILP models that include species' mobility and habitat area requirements. All models include the possible stepping stone function of reserve sites to some extent, although none does so perfectly. The models demonstrated find spatial reserve networks at lower costs than a non-spatial reserve site selection model. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The consequences of this coming population aging for environmental preferences and environmental quality are ambiguous. This paper uses data on life satisfaction to investigate how preferences and willingness to pay for air quality depend on the age composition of the population. Our estimation results on a panel of 25 OECD countries, spanning the period from 1990 to 2004, indicate that preferences for air quality are U-shaped in age, consistent with epidemiological evidence on the age-specific health consequences of air pollution.

The study revealed environmental amenities, including proximity to lakes, national forests, Glacier National Park and golf courses, have large positive effects on property values in northwest Montana. However, proximity to and view of wildfire burned areas has had large and persistent negative effects on home values. The analysis supports an argument that homebuyers may correlate proximity to and view of a wildfire burned area with increased wildfire risk. Indeed, when a burned area is not visible from a home, wildfire risk appears to be out of sight and out of mind for homebuyers.

After all, it successfully led to the phase-out of almost 95% of all chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) use. A critical review of the Protocol's history, however, suggests that its successes are deeply entrenched in the economic opportunities that were made available to phase out CFCs. The Montreal Protocol, in other words, was a best-case scenario for CFC producers. This may be problematic for policymakers, ecological modernization practitioners, and other scholars who look to the Montreal Protocol for guidance in phasing out other global environmentally harmful substances and practices that are not as economically efficient. The shift to delay the phasing out of methyl bromide (MeBr) in the Protocol, an ozone-depleting substance used to this day primarily in strawberry and tomato production, demonstrates how even this most successful of international environmental agreements can become subject to significant setbacks when economic gains and scientific evidence are not obvious to the global powers. Furthermore, changes in what constitutes a viable exemption to the phase-out of CFCs versus MeBr marks a shift away from concern for the general functioning/welfare of society, and toward concern for the market performance of specific individuals. This shift runs parallel to a lack in economic incentives to phase out MeBr in the United States. The article demonstrates how civil society representation in ozone politics is largely dominated by industry interests, especially when scientific uncertainty is high.","Boston Coll, Dept Sociol, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA",Boston College,"Gareau, BJ (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Dept Sociol, McGuinn Hall 426,140 Commonwealth Ave, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",gareau@bc.edu,,"Gareau, Brian/0000-0002-0529-3389",,,,,74,30,33,0,49,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Despite the potential to alleviate poverty by improving indigenous chicken breeds, smallholders' participation in the implementation of breeding programmes is weak. Participation could be improved with greater understanding of the many functions of chickens to smallholders. The objectives of this study are (1) to evaluate chicken traits including market and non-market values, and (2) to assess factors that influence the conservation of indigenous breeds. Choice modelling, a multi-attribute preference elicitation technique, was applied across 300 households in two districts in Benin. The results revealed that many of the preferred traits are expressed in indigenous chickens, whose conservation should be supported through village chicken breeding programmes and that preferences differed greatly between farmers in the two districts. However, from an economic point of view, the aim of conserving culturally significant and disease resistant indigenous breeds is contrary to the objective of increasing chicken productivity. A preference for white plumage, most common among exotic breeds, could further hinder conservation of indigenous breeds, which are mostly brown or black. The lack of knowledge about chicken characterization and flock management were identified as further severe constraints to village conservation programmes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Williamson. That article presented real wage comparisons of unskilled urban workers for seventeen countries. Sweden, along with the rest of Scandinavia, is found to be an influential case in accounting for much of the alleged factor price convergence taking place. This paper takes a closer look at all the three steps that have to be taken in order to establish real wage comparisons, focusing on Sweden in relation to the US and the UK. The most important findings are twofold. First, that the US-Sweden wage gap is considerably smaller for manufacturing than for building workers, and second, that the rate at which Sweden's real wages approached the American and the British has been grossly overestimated. Swedish real wages did grow rapidly, but not as rapidly as Williamson's comparison will have us to believe, because his real wage series does not constitute a representative account of the Swedish unskilled real wage experience. It is argued that, as we suffer from a serious paucity of data for narrow and comparable samples of late nineteenth century unskilled workers, resorting to more encompassing wage measures is a more viable option. That also implies a questioning of the American unskilled wage series, which makes considerably slower progress than the wage series for manufacturing workers.","Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Prado, S (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.",svante.prado@econhist.gu.se,"Prado, Svante/AAS-9306-2020","Prado, Svante/0000-0002-5046-3340",,,,,86,10,10,0,13,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,JUN,2010,4.0,2,,,,,171,205,,10.1007/s11698-009-0040-5,0.0,,,35,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,618KW,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279352800003,0

The paper calculates the revenues from the UK fuel duty escalator (FDE) (an above-inflation increase in fuel duty implemented from 1993 to 1999), and compares these with the revenues lost from the cuts in income tax in 1995 and 1996, and again in 2001. The paper finds that the lost revenue was roughly the same as the revenue from the FDE. In effect the governments concerned had implemented an ETR without in any way drawing attention to the fact. The FDE was discontinued in 1999 when the oil price rose and, in the face of protests at the level of fuel duty the following year, real revenues from fuel duty subsequently declined. It is at least arguable that, had the fact that FDE had facilitated income tax cuts been established by the government at the time, the FDE and fuel duty generally would have been less unpopular.

If the demand curve were certain, then setting price and setting quantity would be equivalent ways to frame the seller's problem of choosing a profit-maximizing point on its demand curve. With uncertain demand, these become distinct sales mechanisms. We distinguish between uncertainty about the market size and uncertainty about the consumers' valuations. Our main results are that (i) for a given marginal cost, an increase in uncertainty about valuations favors setting quantity whereas an increase in uncertainty about market size favors setting price; (ii) keeping demand uncertainty fixed, there is a nonmonotonic relationship between marginal costs and the optimal selling mechanism (setting price or quantity); and (iii) in a bilateral monopoly channel setting, coordination occurs except for a conflict zone in which the retailer's choice of a selling mechanism deviates from the coordinated channel selling mechanism.","[Padmanabhan, V.; Tsetlin, Ilia] INSEAD, Singapore 138676, Singapore; [Van Zandt, Timothy] INSEAD, F-77305 Fontainebleau, France",INSEAD Business School; INSEAD Business School,"Padmanabhan, V (通讯作者)，INSEAD, 1 Ayer Rajah Ave, Singapore 138676, Singapore.",paddy.padmanabhan@insead.edu; ilia.tsetlin@insead.edu; timothy.van-zandt@insead.edu,"Tsetlin, Ilia/B-3725-2010; Van Zandt, Timothy/B-3876-2010","Padmanabhan, Vineet/0000-0002-5571-839X",,,,,18,3,3,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

For the estimation, the research relies on forest inventory data together with other socio-economic and resources use data collected from forest users in three sites of Nepal Himalaya. The paper estimates the incremental carbon from forest enhancement on a yearly basis over a five-year period using the value of $ 1 and $ 5 per tCO(2) for conservative analysis. The results based on the three sites indicate that community forest management may be one of the least cost ways to abate carbon with a break-even price under Scenario 2 which ranges from $ 0.55 to $ 3.70 per tCO(2). However, bringing community forests into the carbon market may entail high opportunity costs as forests provide numerous non-monetary benefits to the local population, who regard these as the main incentive for conservation and management. An important finding of the research is that if forest resources use by local communities is not permitted, then carbon trading will not be attractive to them as revenue from carbon will not cover the cost foregone by not harvesting forest resources.

The presence of separation of cash flow rights and control rights contributes to agency problem between controlling shareholders and minority interest that lead to the expropriation of minority interest. A way of doing it is via debt as debt is one of vulnerable tools use to expropriate minority interest. Thus, this study examines the relationship of separation of cash flow rights and control rights and debt policy of Malaysian listed family firms for three years of 2006, 2007 and 2008. The relationship will indicate whether expropriation of minority interest exists in Malaysian listed family firms. The results of the study reveals that the relationship of separation of cash flow rights and control rights is positive related to debt ratio. This indicates that the separation of cash flow rights and control rights does not lead to the increase of debt policy among Malaysian listed family firms. However, the results are not conclusive due to data constraints of unlisted firms and existence of 100% ownership in two-tier pyramid structure.","[Abdullah, Norhidayah; Pok, Wee Ching] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Accountancy, Shah Alam, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA,,weeching_pok@salam.uitm.edu.my,"Pok, Wee Ching/IXW-6121-2023","Pok, Wee Ching/0000-0002-4792-8792",,,,,31,0,0,0,2,WORLD ACAD UNION-WORLD ACAD PRESS,LIVERPOOL,"113, ACADEMIC HOUSE, MILL LANE, WAVERTREE TECHNOLOGY PARK, LIVERPOOL, L13 4 AH, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84626-026-1,,,,2010,,,,,,,307,313,,,,,,7,"Business; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BSB91,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284085200061,0

Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual model for predicting consumer food health information seeking is proposed. The predicting constructs are general food health involvement, general food health competency, product-specific health involvement, and product-specific food health competency. The relationships between construct are estimated using structural equation modelling. Data were collected in a nationally representative consumer-panel among 504 Danish consumers using a questionnaire. Findings - The results suggest that improving consumers' general food health involvement may only lead to increased product-specific health information seeking if consumers at the same time are involved in the specific product category. The results also revealed that women are generally more food health involved than men but did not support previous research suggesting that women also are more knowledgeable. about healthy food and that they more often seek product-specific food health-related information. Research limitations/implications - This research concentrated on analysing one food product, salad dressing. A large cross-section of products ought to be studied to improve the generalizability of the obtained result and thus future research may wish to incorporate a wider range of food products. Practical implications - The results suggest that food authorities and/or food marketers seeking to promote a healthy life-style should consider providing examples of healthy product categories (food authorities) and/or particular products (food marketers) along with their general health information. Originality/value - This paper empirically investigates gender along with a number of mental constructs for the purpose of understanding consumers' food health information seeking. Also, the paper explores age and educational level as possible moderating variables of the consumer food health information seeking process.","[Hansen, Torben; Boye, Heidi; Thomsen, Thyra Uth] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Mkt, Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Hansen, T (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Mkt, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",th.marktg@cbs.dk,,"Thomsen, Thyra Uth/0000-0001-5711-7777",Danish Council for Strategic Research; Programme Commission on Food and Health,Danish Council for Strategic Research(Danske Strategiske Forskningsrad (DSF)); Programme Commission on Food and Health,"This research was supported by a research grant from the Danish Council for Strategic Research, Programme Commission on Food and Health.",,43,13,13,1,28,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Furthermore, ex ante cost-benefit analyses (CBAs) of adopting new traceability systems are conducted for two firms, operating at different steps of the seafood supply chains, to obtain preliminary knowledge on the net benefits of the project and on how costs and benefits are distributed among the actors. Design/methodology/approach - This is a case-based study. Findings - The surveyed companies perceive improving supply chain management as the most important benefit of traceability. Other benefits are increase of the ability to retain existing customers; product quality improvement; product differentiation; and reduction of customer complaints. However, the quantifiable benefits are perceived differently by the actors at different steps in the supply chains, e.g. implementing radio frequency identification (RFID) tags on pallets in the seafood trading company case study shows tangibly quantifiable benefits. Originality/value - The paper is useful for both practitioners and academics regarding perceived benefits of traceability in fish supply chains. The research provides initial insight into seafood companies' perspectives on the benefits of adopting RFID-based traceability solutions. The paper suggests that the financial burden of implementing traceability may be borne by the processing firms, while gains are reaped by firms in the distribution business closer to the end consumer. This could provide a partial explanation as to why traceability has been slow to gain ground as a visible value-adding marketing tool, and is mainly being driven by food safety regulations.","[Mai, Nga; Bogason, Sigurdur Gretar; Arason, Sigurjon; Arnason, Sveinn Vikingur; Matthiasson, Thorolfur Geir] Univ Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland; [Mai, Nga] Univ Nha Trang, Nha Trang, Vietnam; [Bogason, Sigurdur Gretar; Arnason, Sveinn Vikingur] MarkMar Ehf, Reykjavik, Iceland; [Arason, Sigurjon] Matis Ohf, Reykjavik, Iceland",University of Iceland; Nha Trang University,"Mai, N (通讯作者)，Univ Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.",mtt2@hi.is,"Matthiasson, Thorolfur/S-3024-2019; Bogason, Sigurdur Grétar/HMP-5662-2023","Matthiasson, Thorolfur/0000-0003-3312-386X; Mai, Nga/0000-0003-0829-5547; Bogason, Sigurdur/0000-0002-9315-3940",EC [FP6016333-2],EC(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"The majority of the research described in this paper is part of a sixth framework EC-funded project named Developing and integrating novel technologies to improve safety, transparency and quality assurance of the chilled/frozen food supply chain test case fish and poultry acronym CHILL-ON (Project No. FP6016333-2).

Many studies juxtapose consumer emissions (carbon footprint) and producer (territorial) emissions of greenhouse gases in order to demonstrate the effects of trade on the national emission budget. To this end, a respectable number of studies have been undertaken worldwide in order to estimate emissions embedded in international trade of numerous countries and world regions. Input-output approaches, and increasingly multi-region input-output (MRIO) models, are commonly chosen as they provide an appropriate methodological framework for complete carbon footprint estimates at the national and supra-national level. With increasing processing capabilities of computers and a wider availability of economic accounts, environmental accounts and trade data such models are now being implemented on a wide scale. After a brief overview of salient single-region input-output studies I provide an in-depth review of the most recent multi-region input-output models used for the purpose of consumption-based environmental accounting. The main methodological features and important results are described for around twenty studies covering the years 2007 to 2009. This is followed by a detailed review of studies dealing with uncertainty in MRIO analysis, an area which has not received a lot of attention so far. I conclude that further research is mainly needed in two areas, a) improvements in data availability and quality and b) improvements in the accuracy of MRIO modelling. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Online carbon calculators can help consumers prioritize among dietary behaviors to minimize personal carbon footprints, leveraging against emissions-intensive industry practices. We reviewed the fitness of selected carbon calculators for measuring and communicating indirect GHG emissions from food consumption. Calculators were evaluated based on the scope of user behaviors accounted for, data sources, transparency of methods, consistency with prior data and effectiveness of communication. We found food consumption was under-represented (25%) among general environmental impact calculators (n=83). We identified eight carbon calculators that accounted for food consumption and included U.S. users among the target audience. Among these, meat and dairy consumption was appropriately highlighted as the primary diet-related contributor to emissions. Opportunities exist to improve upon these tools, including: expanding the scope of behaviors included under calculations; improving communication, in part by emphasizing the ecological and public health co-benefits of less emissions-intensive diets; and adopting more robust, transparent methodologies, particularly where calculators produce questionable emissions estimates. Further, all calculators could benefit from more comprehensive data on the U.S. food system. These advancements may better equip these tools for effectively guiding audiences toward ecologically responsible dietary choices. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This strategy included the formation of several climate agreements directed at technology development, including the 2005 Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate (APP). The APP provides a model for international climate change policy directed at voluntary national greenhouse gas intensity targets, technology development through sectoral public-private partnerships and technology diffusion through trade. This article situates the APP within these US and Australian inspired climate agreements formed outside the UN negotiations. Backstrand and Lovbrand's (in M. Pettenger (ed.) The social construction of climate change: power knowledge norms discourses, 2007) discourse analysis in relation to the international climate negotiations is used to explore differences between the APP and UN climate treaties. We find the APP embodies a discourse of what we call 'deregulatory ecological modernisation' that promotes limited public funding to ease informational failures in markets for cleaner technologies and management practices. The deregulatory ecological modernisation discourse is a deeply intensive market liberal approach to international climate change policy, which contests binding emission reduction targets and the development of a global carbon market. The USA, Australia, Japan and Canada represented a core group of countries that used the APP to promote the deregulatory ecological modernisation discourse and thereby contest any deepening of developed nations' emission reduction targets for the post-2012 period. However, with changes of leadership and new parties in power in the USA and Australia, it appears that the deregulatory ecological modernisation discourse has lost ground compared to a reengagement with discourses supportive of developed country emission reduction targets and equity-based adaptation and technology transfer assistance for developing nations.","[McGee, Jeffrey] Univ Newcastle, Sch Law, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [McGee, Jeffrey] Macquarie Univ, Grad Sch Environm, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Taplin, Ros] Mirvac Sch Sustainable Dev, Gold Coast, Qld 4229, Australia",University of Newcastle; Macquarie University,"McGee, J (通讯作者)，Univ Newcastle, Sch Law, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",Jeffrey.McGee@newcastle.edu.au; rtaplin@bond.edu.au,"McGee, Jeffrey/K-7322-2015","McGee, Jeffrey/0000-0002-2093-5896",,,,,72,38,45,2,40,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

In this paper we use a verbal protocol approach to investigate the use of alternative decision rules in discrete choice experiments. The main interest is to identify some of the determinants of the context that play a role in the choice of a specific strategy or decision rule. Our results show that emotions can partially explain this choice among compensatory and simpler non-compensatory decision rules. We also find that the number of years of education - and not personal income - are positively correlated with the probability of choosing a non-compensatory decision rules. Finally, by manipulating alternative specific emotions (sadness, disgust) we find that emotions of the same valence can have opposing causal effects on the decision rule choice.

This model, named wastewater treatment input-output model (WWIO), can be regarded as an extension of the waste input-output model (WIO) (Nakamura, S. and Kondo, Y., 2002. Input-output analysis of waste management. Journal of Industry Ecology, 6(1): 39-63.). As an application, I compiled the Tokyo Metropolitan WWIO table for 2000, which comprises 482 economic sectors, 11 wastewater treatment sectors, 12 types of wastewater-related waste and 6 types of environmental load. The model was applied to different scenarios to compare alternative wastewater treatment systems. The results indicate that replacing the simple treatment with the high-class treatment improves the quality of treated water while increasing CO2-equivalent emissions. Meanwhile, when the dewatered sludge is incinerated instead of landfilling, both CO2-equivalent emissions and landfill volume decrease. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The design of such policies is currently hampered by the limited understanding of socioeconomic drivers of and pressures on biodiversity as well as by lacking data, indicators and models. In order to improve understanding of these issues we here propose a conceptual model of socioeconomic biodiversity drivers and pressures. The model is based on the drivers-pressures-impacts-states-responses (DPSIR) scheme and on the socioeconomic metabolism approach. The aim of the model is to guide research aimed at improving our understanding of socioeconomic biodiversity pressures and drivers and to serve as a basis for the development of formal, quantitative models in that field. Based on three European long-term socio-ecological research (LTSER) platforms, we analyze the model's applicability and suitability as well as data availability and research needs. These platforms are the Danube Delta Wetland System in Romania, the Donana in Spain and the Eisenwurzen in Austria. An empirical analysis of the relationship between the human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP) and breeding bird richness in the Eisenwurzen demonstrates the ability of HANPP to provide a link between socioeconomic pressures/drivers and biodiversity. The analysis of the case studies underlines the potential utility of the conceptual model to guide future research into socioeconomic biodiversity drivers and pressures. However, considerable investments in monitoring and reconstruction of past trajectories as well as in model development will be required before mathematical (computer) models of the interrelation processes between society and ecosystems can be successfully deployed.

Previous theoretical analyses suggest that the performance of ambient-based tax mechanisms does not depend on firm characteristics, such as size, whilst policy discussions advocate that such mechanisms are best suited for regulating relatively homogeneous firms. Using controlled laboratory experiments, we provide empirical evidence that the distribution of firm sizes does have a significant impact on observed group decision making and further that heterogeneity has the potential to generate both some relatively desirable outcomes as well as some outcomes that are not attractive. These results suggest that richer theoretical models that capture important strategic interactions and social preferences are needed to better describe laboratory behavior and, by extension, behavior in potential policy settings.

Thus international and inter-temporal P allocations greatly impact food security which requires increased food production for a growing world population. As high quality phosphorus mines are being depleted, recycling gains importance and developed countries explore new technologies for P recycling. We analyse the effects of P recycling in developed countries on global extraction of rock phosphates and the imports of developing countries. We build a resource extraction model for a competitive fertilizer market that reflects the fact that most developed countries have P-saturated soils while soils in many developing countries are P-deficient. Our model extends a simple cake eating problem. We consider two types of countries that differ in demand and recycling options. We find that P recycling in developed countries does not only prolong the resource life-time, but it also increases the developing counties' share of the resource. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Challenges remain in effectively engaging the large populations covered by these bodies, especially with these bodies expected to assume responsibilities that risk them becoming perceived as extensions of government and favoring particular stakeholders. In this article, I examine whether polycentric systems of collaborative community-based governance can help address these challenges. The examination involves double-censored regression analyses of data from postal surveys of farmers in three regions. The findings suggest that community-based approaches are capable under the regional delivery model of motivating greater voluntary cooperation from farmers than otherwise possible. They highlight the importance of farmers coming to adopt reciprocity strategies in their key institutional relationships under this model. It seems subregional bodies have an advantage over regional bodies in motivating such behavior from farmers because the former are better positioned to engage them sufficiently to turn around norms of free-riding or opposition entrenched by earlier paternalistic approaches to agri-environmental conservation. This indicates the value of a polycentric approach to community-based NRM wherein responsibilities are devolved to the lowest possible governance level consistent with the principle of subsidiarity. The economic dividend from increased voluntary adoption of conservation practices under this approach arises from the reduced transaction, political and other opportunity costs of achieving the same result entirely through coercion or financial inducements.

It investigates how the issue of such a limit was addressed in the negotiations of the Linking Directive, and how it has been dealt with in the later implementation of this directive. The article applies two explanatory approaches: one based on intergovernmentalist theory, assuming that the cap reflected the preferences of the EU Member States; and one based on the multi-level governance model, assuming that the cap expressed the preferences of EU institutions rather than Member States. What is found is a two-stage development: during the negotiations of the Linking Directive, Member States managed to secure a no-cap solution allowing extensive use of the project credits. In the later implementation phase, however, when the emissions trading scheme was up and running and a certain legitimacy for the system had been established, the Commission managed to 'regain control' by bringing back a cap. Thus, the project credit cap-and by that, the very nature of the EU emissions trading scheme-has been the subject of a continuing power struggle within the EU-and different theoretical perspectives explain different stages of this process.","Fridtjof Nansen Inst Polhogda, N-1326 Lysaker, Norway",,"Flåm, KH (通讯作者)，Fridtjof Nansen Inst Polhogda, Box 326, N-1326 Lysaker, Norway.",Karoline.flam@gmail.com,,,,,,,45,7,7,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Going beyond the conventional approach to consumer behavior, our work builds on recent insights in motivational psychology about the ways in which people may approach matches or avoid mismatches to the desired end-state of getting enough nourishment by eating the right food. Consumers who tend to approach matches are often focused on choosing the best alternatives from their choice set (chronic promotion focus). Consumers who tend to avoid mismatches are often focused on rejecting unacceptable alternatives from their choice set (chronic prevention focus). Distinguishing these two motivational orientations provides a scientific basis for the aim to foster more sustainable food consumption and production patterns. Our approach involves a systematic analysis of consumers' goal orientations regarding meat choices. We examined how a sample of Dutch consumers (n = 939) described their chronic motivational orientations regarding food, their own meat choices and, about two weeks later, their promotion- and prevention-oriented associations favoring either small portions of meat and free-range meat or their opposites. Largely in line with our hypotheses we found that consumers with a chronic prevention orientation avoided the mismatch of large portions. Also, those of them who paid the premium price of free-range meat considered eating meat produced by intensive farming a mismatch. Conversely, if consumers with a chronic promotion orientation paid the premium price of free-range meat, they considered this the best alternative from their choice set. Accordingly, choosing a small portion of meat was often approached with a prevention orientation and choosing free-range meat with either a prevention or a promotion orientation. These differences in motivational orientation underline that the pursuit of sustainability requires careful consideration of not just undesirable but also of desirable alternatives.

The REDD mechanism, still in discussion, would be in charge of distilling the right incentives and promoting the right policies for fostering forest conservation. The estimation of reduced emissions induced by the mechanism has been raised as an issue, either for issuing the proper amount of carbon credits or for providing appropriate compensations of foregone revenues and other costs to host countries. This estimation would be based on the gap between observed deforestation and a counterfactual value. Although any prediction of deforestation rates (i.e. business-as-usual scenarios) is challenging, and any negotiated target is subject to obvious political influence, these two ways have been prioritirized so far to determine the counterfactual value. In other words proposals focused on a results-based approach, the relevance of which is questionable because estimations of avoided deforestation are hardly reliable. With this approach, issuance of carbon credits and distribution of financial compensations could threaten respectively environmental integrity of the scheme and equity outcomes. Rather than considering overall deforestation (predicted and observed), we argue that a REDD mechanism would gain from linking distribution of carbon finance to real efforts (opposed to results) that developing countries implement for slowing deforestation rates. This would provide strong incentives to design and enforce suitable policies and measures. The methodology we present to measure these efforts (labeled Compensated Successful Efforts) is based on the rationale that overall deforestation is partly due to structural factors, and to domestic policies and measures. This typology differs from others presented in the literature such as proximate/underlying causes, or economic/institutional factors. Using an econometric model, our approach estimates efforts that are (i) independent of structural factors (economic development, population, initial forest area, agricultural export prices), (ii) estimated ex post at the end of the crediting period, and (iii) relative to other countries. In order to illustrate the methodology we apply the model to a panel of 48 countries (Asia, Latin America, Africa) and four periods between 1970 and 2005. We conclude on the feasibility to estimate avoided deforestation using the Compensated Successful Efforts approach. In addition to being conservative from an environmental perspective, this approach tends to guarantee fairness by accounting for dramatic changes during the commitment period. Last, such estimations of avoided deforestation could provide guidance for decisions on further financing of national programs to curb deforestation, as it would help to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful policies.

Except for S, all deficiencies reduced fruit weight and diameter. Nitrogen deficiency reduced fruit weight with crown by 58.6% and without crown by 65.7% and fruit length by 44.4%. Potassium deficiency reduced the peduncle diameter by 23.4% and boron deficiency by 35.0%. Sulfur deficiency reduced fruit crown length. Fruit peel thickness was not affected by the deficiencies studied. Leaf nutrients concentration was significantly lower in their deficiency treatments in relation to the treatment with complete nutrient solution, for all four sampling dates studied.","[Ramos, M. J.

Design/methodology/approach - A survey of 263 Austrian consumers was carried out to investigate pre-knowledge, attitude and attitude change as a result of affective communication about wood-based food additives. Findings - About 14 per cent of the sample had pre-knowledge concerning wood-based food additives. In general the attitudes towards wood-based additives were significantly better than those towards food additives in general. The results indicate a connection between pre-knowledge and attitude. Respondents who had knowledge about wood-based food additives evaluated them better, especially in contrast to those who had wrong ideas about them. Furthermore, it proved possible to improve the evaluations of those respondents who did not know about wood-based additives by providing basic information. Practical implications - The provision of additional information would improve the marketing potential of wood-based additives, especially in contrast to additives in general. If the topic is ignored, there is a risk that public discussion could be based on non-knowledge-based conceptions by some consumers. The provision of early impact information is suggested in this regard. Originality/value - Although the use of wood as a raw material in the food industry is common, it has not been a subject of public or scientific discussion to date.","[Stern, Tobias] Kompetenzzentrum Holz Wood K Plus, Vienna, Austria; [Haas, Rainer; Meixner, Oliver] Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci, Inst Mkt & Innovat, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Stern, T (通讯作者)，Kompetenzzentrum Holz Wood K Plus, Vienna, Austria.",t.stern@kplus-wood.at,"Stern, Tobias/V-9665-2017; Meixner, Oliver/AAD-6219-2021; Haas, Rainer/A-1571-2013","Haas, Rainer/0000-0002-7854-8960; Stern, Tobias/0000-0003-2336-5910; Meixner, Oliver/0000-0002-8505-3130",,,,,36,26,29,0,23,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

If designed properly, it could also help significantly to promote renewable energy. Using a multi-sector, multi-country computable general equilibrium model this study investigates under what circumstances a carbon tax would help stimulate penetration of biofuels into the energy supply mix for road transportation in various countries and regions around the world. This study shows that a carbon tax cum biofuel subsidy policy, where a carbon tax is introduced to fossil fuels and part of the tax revenue is used to finance the biofuel subsidy, would significantly help stimulate market penetration of biofuels. On the other hand, a carbon tax alone policy, where the entire tax revenue is recycled to households through a lump-sum transfer, does not help stimulate biofuels significantly even at higher tax rates. Although the carbon tax cum subsidy policy would cause higher loss in economic output at the global level as compared to the carbon tax alone policy, the incremental loss is relatively small. The key policy insight drawn from the study is that if a carbon tax were to be implemented in an economy for the purpose of climate change mitigation, recycling part of its revenue to finance biofuel subsidies would significantly help stimulate biofuels.

If quantity information on nonmarket outputs is available, then the first two methods of price valuation rely on either purchaser based valuations or on cost based valuations. If little or no information on the quantity of nonmarket outputs produced is available, then the method recommended in the System of National Accounts 1993 must be used, where aggregate output growth is set equal to aggregate input growth.

An interdependent chain of equations including the propensity to invest, R&D investment and productivity are estimated in a multi-step procedure accounting for selectivity and simultaneity biases. Using Korean firm level panel data of listed firms from 1986 to 2002, we find four main empirical results. First, there is a two-way causal relationship between R&D investment and productivity for Korean listed firms. Second, Chaebol firms were associated with lower R&D growth as well as lower labor productivity growth in comparison to non-Chaebol firms. Third, there was a substantial reduction in growth rates both in R&D investment and labor productivity in 1997-1998, immediately following the Asian financial crisis. Fourth, considering the positive feedback effect from productivity growth to R&D growth, a decrease in R&D investment growth after the Asian financial crisis should have been harmful by further decreasing productivity growth.","[Heshmati, Almas] Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Coll Life Sci & Biotechnol, Seoul 136701, South Korea; [Kim, Hyesung] Univ Rochester, Dept Polit Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",Korea University; University of Rochester,"Heshmati, A (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Coll Life Sci & Biotechnol, East Bldg,Room 217, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",heshmati@korea.ac.kr; kim.hyesung@gmail.com,,,,,,,46,25,27,0,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

As the environmental performance, our study considers the two different environmental issues of waste and greenhouse gas emissions in capturing the effects of corporate environmental management on financial performance. In addition, to clarify how each financial performance responds to a firm's effort in dealing with different environmental issues, we utilize many financial performance indices reflecting various market evaluations. Our estimation results show the different effects of each environmental performance on financial performance. Waste emissions do not generally have significant effects on financial performance. On the other hand, greenhouse gas reduction leads to an increase in financial performance in the whole sample and clean industries, although it does not have significant effects on financial performance in dirty industries. Furthermore, as the firm growth rate increases, the partial effects of waste emissions on financial performance decrease, whereas the partial effects of greenhouse gas emissions on financial performance increase.

The originality of the approach is to combine statistical data and expert knowledge to describe low-input alternative techniques at the national level. These data are used in a mathematical programming model to simulate the effect on land use, production and farmers' income of achieving different levels of pesticide reduction. The results show that reducing pesticide use by 30% could be possible without reducing farmers' income.

In theory, the economic value of the service flows that can be captured privately is capitalized into land prices. This study proposes an integrative framework to characterize the ecosystem services associated with agricultural lands. Using that framework, we demonstrate how hedonic analysis of agricultural land prices can be used to estimate the private values of land-based ES. The model is estimated with data from southwestern Michigan, USA. Results suggest that ES values are associated with lakes, rivers, wetlands, forests and conservation lands in rural landscapes. Ecosystem services that support direct use values, such as recreational and aesthetic services, are likely to be perceived by land owners and capitalized in land prices. Some regulating services that provide indirect use values may be partially capitalized in a land parcel's relationship to natural resources and landscapes. Other ES from the land parcel and its surroundings are unlikely to be capitalized due to lack of private incentives, unawareness, or small perceived value. The private ES values measured in this study highlight opportunities to design cost-effective public policies that factor in the value of private benefits from agricultural lands.

This article explores the role that the significant rise in net exports-which accounted for nearly 4 percent of GDP in 1946 and 1947-played in helping the United States avoid a postwar unemployment problem. Using an input-output analysis, we find that the export surplus directly accounted for 1.33 million jobs in 1946 and 1.97 million jobs in 1947.

The model features interactions between permanent urban residents and migrants and exhibits a distinctive equilibrium pattern. The theoretical model is tested empirically, using recent Chinese city-level data. The empirical findings indicate that market forces now play an important role in urban expansion and land price formation, while various forms of government planning are still influential.

For many invaders, eradication of the main population is an untenable goal, yet it may be possible to treat and eradicate emerging sub-populations once these sub-populations are detected. We embed a dynamically optimal post-detection management plan of sub-populations into a model of optimal detection effort determination and find that optimal detection effort depends, in part, on the distance from the main front: locations closer to the front with shorter management horizons enjoy lower reductions in overall cost from intervention. The uninfested landscape is divided into two zones, characterized by different dynamically optimal management plans: a suppression zone and an eradication zone. In the suppression zone, optimal detection effort increases with distance from the front. At the distance where the suppression zone yields to the eradication zone, optimal detection effort plateaus at its maximum level. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The present study aimed to detect sensitivity of beech tree growth not only to meteorological conditions but also one of the most phytotoxic pollutants - surface ozone in Lithuania by using dendrochronological method. Data set since 1980 of surface ozone was available from Preila EMEP station, and enables to analyze integrated effect meteorology and surface ozone on beech growth variation over the last 30 year period. The obtained results revealed that hot summers, dry and cold dormant and first half of vegetation periods resulted in beech tree growth reduction. However, due to climate changes warmer dormant periods and rather stable temperatures of summers should increase the tolerance of beech trees to unfavorable lack of humidity in the first half of vegetation. Surface ozone having negative effect on beech tree growth due to stabilization in its concentration should not decrease beech tree stem increment. If changes in the considered parameters continue following the last 10 year period scenarios, the intensity of Beech tree growth in Lithuania should increase.","[Augustaitis, Algirdas] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Forest Monitoring Lab, Inst Environm, Studentu 13, LT-53362 Akademija, Kaunas Dstr, Lithuania; [Augustaitis, Algirdas; Kliucius, Almantas] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Forest & Ecol, Dept Forest Management, LT-53362 Akademija, Kaunas Dstr, Lithuania; [Marozas, Vitas] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Forest & Ecol, Dept Ecol, LT-53362 Akademija, Kaunas Dstr, Lithuania; [Vitas, Adomas] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Fac Nat Sci, Environm Res Ctr, Grp Dendroclimatol & Radiometr, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Beniusis, Eurelijus; Pilkauskas, Mantas] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Forest & Ecol, LT-53362 Akademija, Kaunas Dstr, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University; Vytautas Magnus University; Vytautas Magnus University; Vytautas Magnus University; Vytautas Magnus University,"Augustaitis, A (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Forest Monitoring Lab, Inst Environm, Studentu 13, LT-53362 Akademija, Kaunas Dstr, Lithuania.",algirdas.augustaitis@asu.lt; almantas.kliucius@asu.lt; vitas.marozas@asu.lt; eurelijus.beniusis@gail.com; m.pilkauskas@gmail.com; a.vitas@gmf.vdu.lt; Rasele.Girgzdiene@vgtu.lt,"Vitas, Adomas/H-3752-2016",,Research Council of Lithuania [LEK-19/2010],Research Council of Lithuania(Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT)),This research was funded by a grant (No. LEK-19/2010) from the Research Council of Lithuania.,,31,0,0,1,13,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,2,,,,,21,25,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304698500003,0

Design/methodology/approach - There is much extant research that investigates the organic certification and its market development in the developed world. However, little emphasis is given to China, the highest growing organic market. This research aims to narrow this gap in the literature by reviewing organic certification and the market in China. Findings - China's organic products are mainly exported to developed countries, but the growing affluence of Chinese consumers and expanding foreign expatiate community in China is developing a domestic market for organic food. Organic products are increasingly being imported. Organic standards and certification system in China have been established and under the implementation, with all stages of the organic marketing chain regulated by law and guaranteed. The lack of an equivalent or compliant system forces Chinese organic exports to enter the international market through multi-certification, and foreign organic imports to the China market possibly through certification by a CNAS-ACB. Originality/value - This paper provides a unique insight into a wide range of China organic certification systems and the mechanism for organic exports from and imports to China.","[Biao Xie; Li Tingyou] Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Qian Yi] Nanjing Normal Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Nanjing Normal University; Nanjing Normal University,"Biao, X (通讯作者)，Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",biaox@hotmail.com,"zhang, hao/JOJ-7093-2023",,,,,,44,18,19,1,37,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Different methods of efficiency ranking were applied but none of them proved itself to be totally acceptable one. The profound analysis of state forestry performance is on demand and the process of adaptation of modern-day conditions should be realized in state forestry throughout the future challenges. This paper addresses the Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) approach to score the state forest enterprises concerning performance evaluation. Two systems of indicators describing state forest enterprises (SFE) performance were applied in SAW evaluation. The first (detailed) system contained 34 indicators (SAW34) and the second one was based on 12 aggregated indicators (SAW12). In both the cases the selected indicators were defined as inputs (resources to be saved) and outputs (products and services to be maximized). Each of indicators has been given a weight. It was identified that the differences of SFE scores within SAW34 and SAW12 were impacted by the amount of indices and/or given weights. The multi regression analysis revealed that the most heavy impact on the performance of SFE in both SAW34 (non standardized regression coefficient (B) = 0.69) and SAW12 (B=1.44) systems had the forest land area of SFE. Herewith, it was indicated that the performance analysis should be based on a system with a strictly limited amount of indicators. The higher scores in both evaluations got mostly the smaller SFE due to application of rational indicators (inputs and outputs per unit).","[Kavaliauskas, Marius; Deltuvas, Romualdas; Cinga, Gintautas] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Forestry & Ecol, Dept Forest Management, LT-53362 Akademija, Kaunas R, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,,marius.kavaliauskas@asu.lt; romualdas.deltuvas@asu.lt; gintautas.cinga@asu.lt,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,1,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,2,,,,,34,40,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304698500006,0

Driving forces behind the promotion of fish welfare are demands from retailers and consumers. Given this background, it is the main objective of this paper in a Danish setting to investigate the willingness of consumers to pay for farmed rainbow trout with a quality label certifying good fish welfare. It also aims to describe consumers' perception and consumption of farmed fish and their beliefs about fish welfare. Design/methodology/approach - A contingent valuation approach was used to evaluate consumers' willingness to pay for fish welfare, using an open-ended elicitation technique. To determine the factors that may influence consumers' willingness to pay for fish welfare the binomial logit model was used. Data were collected from an online survey of Danish consumers in the spring of 2009, sample size 1,000. Findings - Of the sample, 48 percent were on average willing to pay 25 percent extra for welfare rainbow trout. Primarily women with a longer education, belonging to higher income households are willing to pay extra, also older consumers are more willing to pay more than younger consumers. Consumers who emphasize eco-friendly production of welfare fish, freshness, and animal welfare also tend to be willing to pay extra. Originality/value - While much literature has addressed animal welfare and willingness to pay for it, only a few studies have specifically considered consumers' perception of fish welfare and their willingness to pay for welfare fish.","[Solgaard, Hans Stubbe; Yang, Yingkui] Univ So Denmark, Dept Environm & Business Econ, Esbjerg, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Solgaard, HS (通讯作者)，Univ So Denmark, Dept Environm & Business Econ, Esbjerg, Denmark.",hso@sam.sdu.dk,"Yang, Yingkui/A-4644-2015","Yang, Yingkui/0000-0002-7806-2442",,,,,29,56,57,6,50,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

In particular the investigation seeks to gain new insights about differences among companies in their internationalization patterns. These differences are examined in a framework which tries to relate three company-level dimensions (market, technology and space) to internationalization patterns. The three dimensions are derived from the constructs developed by Storper and Salais, and Straete. Design/methodology/approach - Two research questions (RQs) are formulated: Is there a relationship between the internationalization pace of speciality food SMEs and their technology, market, and space dimensions? Is there a relationship between the internationalization modes of speciality food SMEs and their technology, market, and space dimensions? A qualitative approach was adopted and cases from a broad dataset were used. The present research is an explorative research: it is intended to provide insights from which hypotheses might be developed. Findings - This paper provides an empirical and conceptual contribution to the food internationalization debate. On the empirical side, it provides new evidence on speciality food internationalization, showing a rather diversified set of internationalization patterns, both in terms of pace and modes. On the conceptual side, it shows that the three dimensions of technology, market and space may help to enrich the comprehension of internationalization phenomena. While data collected seem not to provide insights from which hypotheses might be developed concerning RQ1, they seem on the contrary to provide useful insights concerning RQ2. Research limitations/implications - Limitations of the research generally relate to the use of a small sample. Future research should strive to obtain larger samples, develop a set of relevant finer-grained hypotheses and test those using appropriate statistical techniques Practical implications - Identifying the impact that the three dimensions might have on internationalization patterns and vice versa may help to focus on these specific elements when companies make their internationalization decisions. On the same line, public policy agencies could benefit from these first results for better clustering companies targeting their internationalization supporting initiatives. Originality/value - The findings add to the limited body of knowledge on the key influences on internationalization patterns within the food sector.","Univ Genoa, Dept Commun Comp & Syst Sci, I-16145 Genoa, Italy",University of Genoa,"Testa, S (通讯作者)，Univ Genoa, Dept Commun Comp & Syst Sci, I-16145 Genoa, Italy.",stefania.testa@unige.it,"testa, stefania/ISU-1321-2023","testa, stefania/0000-0002-4067-8110","Italian Ministry for Education, University and Research","Italian Ministry for Education, University and Research(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","The author is grateful to Marco Mutinelli for his stimulating seminar on internationalization at the University of Genoa, winter 2009.

Design/methodology/approach - The literary review is related to the concepts of public procurements and, subsequently, interrelated regulations are introduced. Moreover, the municipal catering services are illustrated. Empirical data were collected in the spring of 2009 from the Finnish public procurement journal and from HILMA internet websites concerning the contract notices and the contract award notices between 1 January 2007 and 14 May 2009. The objects of the contract, thresholds, contract award procedures, sectors of contract awards, as well as both the selection and the award criteria were analysed in the contract notices. A total of 34 contract notices were discovered, out of which 24 could be utilised. Findings - The contract award procedures could be divided into either open procedures or restricted procedures. Maximum budgets in the contract notices consisted of both the types exceeding the EU thresholds or those remaining below it. Concerning the award criteria, the relative weightings (median) concerning the price amounted to 60 per cent, whereas the quality measured 40 per cent. Practical implications - The results can be utilised when exploring the competitive tendering in catering services using larger data, and as a guidebook when public catering services are put out to tender. Originality/value - The dimensions of quality found offer new ideas for procurement authorities as the award criteria.","[Tikkanen, Irma] Univ Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland; [Tikkanen, Irma; Kaleva, Hanna] Laurea Univ Appl Sci, Espoo, Finland",University of Eastern Finland; Laurea University of Applied Sciences,"Tikkanen, I (通讯作者)，Univ Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.",irma.tikkanen@taloverkot.fi,,,,,,,20,5,5,1,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This article uses the case of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to show how its constituency of environmental and development NGOs has responded to perceived representation and participation deficits in global climate policy-making. It discusses three types of NGO responses, which could potentially help to bring the voices of affected but marginalized communities to the relevant levels of climate policy-making: firstly, NGO proposals designed to remedy representation inequities among governments; secondly, NGO demands for strengthening opportunities for participation by societal stakeholders at all levels of climate policy-making; and finally, representative practices (based on authorization and accountability) reflected in the NGOs' own decision-making processes and governance structures. With regard to the first two types of responses, the article finds that the NGOs tend to support broadly similar standards of participation and representation in the climate convention. The analysis of the decision-making processes and governance structure of the Climate Action Network, the constituency focal point for the environment and development NGOs in the climate convention, highlights a number of ways through which the network can legitimately claim to represent a wider constituency. At the same time, however, it is important for NGOs not to underestimate the potential costs of high standards of inclusiveness and representativeness.","London Sch Econ, Dept Int Relat, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Dombrowski, K (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Int Relat, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",k.dombrowski@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,53,38,45,2,72,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

While Kuosmanen and Kuosmanen (2009b) critically question its validity introducing productive efficiency theory, Figge and Hahn (2009) put forward that the implementation of productive efficiency theory severely conflicts with the original financial economics perspective of the Sustainable Value approach. We argue that the debate is very confusing because the original Sustainable Value approach presents two largely incompatible objectives. Nevertheless, we maintain that both ways of benchmarking could provide useful and moreover complementary insights. If one intends to present the overall resource efficiency of the firm from the investor's viewpoint, we recommend the original benchmarking methodology. If one on the other hand aspires to create a prescriptive tool setting up some sort of reallocation scheme, we advocate implementation of the productive efficiency theory. Although the discussion on benchmark application is certainly substantial, we should avoid the debate to become accordingly narrowed. Next to the benchmark concern, we see several other challenges considering the development of the Sustainable Value approach: (1) a more systematic resource selection, (2) the inclusion of the value chain and (3) additional analyses related to policy in order to increase interpretative power.

Like carbon dioxide emissions, methane emissions are a known contributor to climate change. Results of cross-national fixed effects panel regression analyses indicate that population size, economic development, the production of cereals, cattle, natural gas and oil, and a reliance on food exports all contribute to methane emissions from 1990 to 2005. Most notably, additional findings suggest that the magnitude of the effects of multiple predictors modestly decreased during the period of investigation, while the impact of other predictors remained very stable in magnitude.

This paper assesses the value of impacts of IAS on biodiversity, natural resources and the national economy, using the principles of total economic value (TEV). The contingent valuation method was used to obtain a willingness to pay (WTP) estimate for a policy to protect important biodiversity from IAS. Tourists indicated a mean WTP of US$52-US $58 on top of their usual expenditures to fund conservation policy. At present approximately US$0.25 million per year is spent on IAS control while the economic damage associated with 4 key IAS is approximately US $21 million per year. Comparing the benefits from eradication with the costs involved gives a benefit-cost ratio greater than unity, indicating that the policy of eradicating IAS is economically justified.

We estimate green net national income (GNNI) and genuine saving (GS) for Portugal, for the years 1990 to 2005, accounting for the disamenity of air pollution emissions, the depreciation of commercial forests and the value of time, discussing the implications of the assumptions underlying the inclusion of these terms in the green accounting model. The influence of short-run cycles is analyzed by estimating GNNI excluding business cycles. Our results suggest that business cycles affect the sustainability message of GNNI. We find that potential GNNI is growing and GS is positive in the analyzed period, thereby not indicating a weak sustainability problem in Portugal, although both depict a trend towards unsustainability. Excluding technological progress there is a contradiction in the sustainability message of GNNI and GS. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We use agricultural emissions and the corresponding prices collected from 21 studies that have assessed abatement potentials and costs using various modeling approaches and assumptions. We first highlight the implications of the modeling approach for marginal abatement costs. Harmonized abatement rates for three emission prices (10, 20 and 50(sic)(2005)/tCO(2)eq) are regressed on variables that reflect various modeling assumptions and study characteristics. In a second step, the emission price is introduced as an explanatory variable. When controlling for a few key characteristics of the studies, the models explain an important share of the observed variability in abatement rates. The type of modeling approach is found to have a significant effect. In particular, we find that equilibrium models lead to higher abatement rates for a given price. The flexibility in nitrogen use and its effect on crop yields also plays a significant role in lowering marginal abatement costs. The results of the second step indicate that the price elasticity of the abatement rate is about 0.6. This estimate is found to be robust to several specifications and consistent with previous assessments covering other economic sectors. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, the term of water conservation is described as a comprehensive regulation of forests on water resources through various hydrological processes, and grouped into three services, i.e., rainfall interception, soil water storage and fresh water provision. On the basis of Beijing's forest resource survey data and mathematical simulations, the function and the economic value of water conservation was estimated. The result showed that, the forest ecosystems of Beijing could intercept approximately 1.43 billion cubic meters of rainfall and 277.82 million cubic meters of soil water under ideal conditions, and supply 286.67 million cubic meters of fresh water, their economic values were estimated to be about 2.77 billion RMB(Chinese Currency, 8.28RMB=US$1), 2.15 billion RMB, and 315.33 million RMB, respectively. The total economic value of water conservation provided by Beijing's forests was 5.23 billion RMB, and the economic benefit per hectare was equal to 5704 RMB. Furthermore, the spatial variation of water conservation functions and the monetary values of the main forest ecosystems in different locations in Beijing were analyzed, and the effects of water conservation provided by the forest ecosystem on the development of society and economy in Beijing were discussed. This work contributes to the realization and preservation of forest resources in Beijing. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It is thus critical for the economy's long-term growth that large cities operate efficiently. In this paper, we briefly review the sources of productivity growth in cities. We then discuss the costs and benefits of political decentralization in large MSAs. After documenting the interdependence of the suburbs and central cities in large MSA, we develop a model that embodies many of the empirically verified aspects, including agglomeration economies and public goods. After calibrating the model to actual outcomes in a representative city, we simulate the effects of various kinds of fiscal redistributions.

This study employs recent Singaporean tourism survey data, the updated Singaporean input-output table, and the Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model to gauge the effects of a decrease in tourism demand on the Singaporean economy. The CGE simulation results demonstrate that a decrease in tourism demand tends to have negative effects on Singapore's economy. At the macro level, although almost all variables are negatively affected, exports benefits greatly. At the industry level, a negative tourism shock impacts severely on the tourism-related sectors, only slightly on sectors weakly linked to tourism, but the tourism-competing sectors expand.

Design/methodology/approach Collection and detailed characterization is carried out from a sample of Portuguese consumers, of packages used at home during a seven-day period. Findings The daily intake of domestically consumed, packaged food ranged from 5 to 50 g/kgbw. The average intake value for children below 12 years old was 26 g/kgbw. Considering all packaging materials, package usage ranged from 0.1dm2/day.kgbw to 0.6dm2/day.kgbw. Packaging usage factors and food-type distribution factors for each packaging material were estimated. Research limitations/implications The period of packaging collection and the size of the sample limit the degree of generalized conclusions that can be drawn. Practical implications The data collected are the base for the development of a framework and could make an important contribution to the assessment of consumer exposure to substances migrating from packages into food, in this case of the Portuguese consumer.

However, critics raised that a number of business process reengineering initiatives have failed and such failures have raised a range of challenging questions about the effectiveness of reengineering. This paper has tried to find out a successful way of objective oriented implication of reengineering, regarding production process. It discusses current research and development about the term reengineering and suggests the factors to be considered at the time of implying reengineering in the production process. This is an extension of previous research and probably it is the first attempt to deal with the object orientation.","[Rajib, Md Salah Uddin; Alam, Md Shariful] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Arefin, Md Shamsul] South East Univ, Dhaka, Bangladesh",Wuhan University of Technology,"Rajib, MSU (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.",,"Alam, Sharif/AAW-7847-2020; Arefin, Md.

It also describes an application of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) that can help an organisation to determine its benchmarking criteria. It presents a structured hierarchy for assessing the key capabilities using the AHP. The hierarchy is illustrated using the four main criteria that manufacturing companies consider when carrying out benchmarking. AHP and benchmarking techniques make the implementation and analysis studies more effective, easy and applicable to companies. Further, AHP is used to calculate the relative weights of each criterion, sub-criterion and specific sub-criterion, to prioritise them, and finally to select the important benchmarking criterion within each of the three companies investigated.","[Salem, Mohamed S.

For the immune parameters assays, total haemocyte count (THC), apoptosis percentage, respiratory burst activity, and phagocytic activity were used as indicators. P. vannamei following 48 h exposure to 1.0 mg l(-1) Cu2+ did not affect its THC, but decreased significantly its THC following 12 h exposure to 8 mg l(-1) Cu2+. P. vannamei following 24h exposure to Cu2+ at 16mg l(-1) significantly stimulated the production of superoxide anion. Phagocytic activity decreased in P. vannamei following 24h exposure to 1, 4, 8 and 16 mg l(-1) Cu2+. The cell apoptosis study showed that the following 48 h exposure to 4-16 mg l(-1) Cu2+ can significantly induce the haemocyte apoptosis. This study for the first time led to an analysis of acute effects of copper sulfate on hemocyte defence functions of the penaeid shrimp with the FCM. It is suggested that acute exposure to lethal levels of copper may be one of the factors responsible for the decline of shrimp stocks in the Pearl River estuary and other coastal waters of southern China.","[Sun Jingfeng; Wang Anli; Xian Jian'an] South China Normal Univ, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Hlth & Safe Aquaculture, Coll Life Sci, Guangzhou 510631, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Sun Jingfeng; Chen Chengxun] Tianjin Agr Univ, Tianjin Key Lab Aqua Ecol & Aquaculture, Dept Fisheries Sci, Tianjin 300384, Peoples R China",South China Normal University; Tianjin Agricultural University,"Sun, JF (通讯作者)，South China Normal Univ, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Hlth & Safe Aquaculture, Coll Life Sci, Guangzhou 510631, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",sun_jf@163.com,"wang, anli/D-2073-2012",,Scientific Program of Tianjin City [08JCYBJC27800]; Chinese Ministry of Education [209006]; NSFC [30671628],"Scientific Program of Tianjin City; Chinese Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, China); NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This study was partially supported by the Scientific Program of Tianjin City (No.08JCYBJC27800), the Key Project of Chinese Ministry of Education (No.209006) and NSFC (No. 30671628).",,23,0,0,0,3,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-1-921712-17-3,,,,2010,,,,,,,317,+,,,,,,3,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BYF00,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298334500049,0

The total water footprint of the Netherlands is estimated to be about 2300 m(3)/year/cap. of which 67% relates to the consumption of agricultural goods, 31% to the consumption of industrial goods. and 2% to domestic water use. The Dutch water footprint related to the consumption of agricultural goods, is composed as follows: 46% related to livestock products: 17% oil crops and oil from oil crops: 12% coffee, tea, cocoa and tobacco; 8% cereals and beer; 6% cotton products; 5% fruits; and 6% other agricultural products. About 11% of the water footprint of the Netherlands is internal and 89% is external. Only 44% of virtual-water import relates to products consumed in the Netherlands, thus constituting the external water footprint. For agricultural products this is 40% and for industrial products this is 60%. The remaining 56% of the virtual-water import to the Netherlands is re-exported. The impact of the external water footprint of Dutch consumers is highest in countries that experience serious water scarcity. Based on indicators for water scarcity the following eight countries have been identified as most seriously affected: China; India; Spain; Turkey: Pakistan; Sudan; South Africa: and Mexico. This study shows that Dutch consumption implies the use of water resources throughout the world, with significant impacts in water-scarce regions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Studying the results of organic management is crucial for evaluating the advantages of Fair Trade because approximately half of all Fair Trade coffee is also organically certified. A wide range of farmers, representatives of cooperatives and export companies in Nicaragua were interviewed during seven months of field work between 2005 and 2008. Fair Trade organic production raises farmer income when low-intensity organic farming is an alternative to low-intensity conventional farming. However, low-intensity farming produces very little coffee in the case of the most marginalized farmers, keeping these farmers in poverty. With higher intensities of management, the economic advantages of Fair Trade organic production largely depend on prices in the mainstream market. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The approach highlights the use of GIS to collect data, perform spatial analysis, and map economic values of ecosystem services. Three key steps of spatial valuation for agricultural products, forest products, and tourism services were illustrated in the GIS-based technical framework. We applied this approach to the Tiantai County (1423.8 km(2)) in Zhejiang province of southeast China. Selected components of natural products and tourism services in the case area were mapped as data layers in GIS, with each layer containing monetary values for every 25 m. cell. The total direct use value of ecosystem services was estimated in RMB to be approximately 538 million Yuan in 2005 (Chinese currency, 8.2 Yuan=US$1), of which agricultural products, forest products and tourism services accounted for 65%, 30% and 5%, respectively. The critical areas for management purpose were identified depending on the heterogeneity of direct use services learned from the case study. The spatially explicit measures provide a mechanism for incorporating spatial context into ecosystem services evaluation. Based on the present GIS-based approach and case study, the suggestions and implications for local resources protection and eco-environmental management were extensively discussed. The work was expected to highlight research avenues to advance the ecosystem services framework as an operational basis for regional ecosystem-based management. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It took decades for these countries to settle their debts and even longer for them to access new loans. We argue that a major factor influencing the pattern of debt service was the incidence of war. War created incentives for governments to channel scarce resources to emergency spending and domestic debt service, rather than to the repayment of the foreign debt. Interestingly, we detect an asymmetry between countries long in good standing with creditors and those that had only recently settled. Countries that had established a longer record of continuous debt service were far less likely to default in times of war. We also find that international wars were responsible for the largest effects.","[Sicotte, Richard; Vizcarra, Catalina] Univ Vermont, Dept Econ, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",University of Vermont,"Sicotte, R (通讯作者)，Univ Vermont, Dept Econ, 239 Old Mill,94 Univ Pl, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",Richard.Sicotte@uvm.edu; Catalina.Vizcarra@uvm.edu,,,,,,,53,5,7,0,6,UNIV CARLOS III MADRID,GETAFE,"INST HIST ECONOMICA, C MADRID, 126, GETAFE, MADRID 28903, SPAIN",0212-6109,,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

A simple dynamic model of an open economy shows that appropriate adjustment of conventional income accounts includes flow and stock components, but excludes explicit entrance of pollution. Calculations are made for Swedish regions and for two types of ecosystem services - pollution sequestration and recreational services - provided by three types of ecosystems: forests, agricultural landscape and wetlands. When comparing the adjusted and non-adjusted regional income accounts it is shown that the two measurements generate significantly different pictures of regional income and growth: regions that are traditionally considered as relatively less growth promoting are shown to hold important sources of wealth from natural capital, while counties that are rich in conventional accounts fall behind when adjusting for values of changes in natural capital.

The five large universal banks rescued in the systemic crisis of 1930-1 jointly accounted for one-third of the total assets of the banking system. What made Italian leading banks so prone to crises? This article suggests that their fragility was ultimately caused by governance failures, both public and private, that enhanced excess risk-taking. Empirical evidence is consistent with theoretical insights according to which the potential for moral hazard and conflict of interest, endemic in universal banking, can be magnified when banks enter into long-run relationships with firms and base their growth strategy on the pursuance of monopolistic rents. Interwar Italy emerges as a case in which an insider system devoid of the disciplinary devices provided by sound governance institutions created perverse incentives and weakened the resilience of the banking system to adverse macroeconomic shocks.","Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Battilossi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",,"Battilossi, Stefano/AAV-4094-2020","Battilossi, Stefano/0000-0003-3799-2683",,,,,77,15,15,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

In order to discuss these issues, it also provides an outline of key national priorities and explains the nature of China's involvement in both the UN track and the APP. It suggests that the APP is a complement to the UN process, not a competitor, in the case of China. APP participation represents a win-win situation in terms of the transfer of technology and know-how for solving challenges related to energy security and greenhouse gas emissions. For the Chinese leadership, this seems preferable to taking on UN commitments which it fears would impede economic development. The APP's projects also seem to complement the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism project in China. This article argues that there is little indication that China would make less of an effort under the UN track.","[Heggelund, Gorild M.; Buan, Inga Fritzen] Fridtjof Nansen Inst Polhogda, N-1326 Lysaker, Norway",,"Buan, IF (通讯作者)，Fridtjof Nansen Inst Polhogda, Fridtjof Nansens Vei 17, N-1326 Lysaker, Norway.",goerild.heggelund@fni.no; ifb@fni.no,,,,,,,62,17,17,1,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

The state and progress of GPP has earlier been measured by questionnaires and interviews, both methods being based on the assessment by the purchaser, and questionnaires having low response rates. Recently, a new method was developed, analyzing the existence of environmental criteria in the calls for tenders. However, the studies have dealt neither with the progress in GPP, nor the statistical evidence of differences between countries. Our aim was to analyze more thoroughly whether the differences in the proportions of 'green' calls for tenders between the three Nordic countries, Denmark, Finland and Sweden, in 2003 and 2005 were real, and whether there had occurred any progress between the years concerned. The paper also presents the 'GPP-record' method, which enables more valid measurement of the environmental soundness of public purchasing. The statistical analyses were done using logit models with country, year and product group as the explanatory factors. It proved to be relevant to take into account the variation that occurred from the random existence of product groups in the samples of calls for tender. There were less environmental criteria in the calls for tenders in Finland than in Denmark and Sweden in 2003, but in 2005 no significant difference between Finland and Denmark was observed.

I examine two explanations: public funds may be a means for decisive voters to transfer wealth to themselves or voters may subsidize the education of others to raise social education levels and realize external benefits. I test these theories in the 1800s, when full tax support of primary schools emerged. States where median and mean wealth was closer together had higher fractions of education revenue from public sources. Attendance rates rose when the public share of education funding rose, especially for poor children. These facts are consistent with a model with external benefits of education.","Montana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Econ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA",Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman,"Stoddard, C (通讯作者)，Montana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Econ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",cstoddard@montana.edu,,,,,,,47,10,17,2,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-0507,,,J ECON HIST,J.

Both pollutants accumulate at different rates to stocks which damage the natural environment. This acts as a dynamic driving force for the economy. Our analysis shows that along the optimal time path (i) the time scale of economic dynamics is mainly determined by the lifetime of pollutants, their instantaneous harmfulness and the discount rate; (ii) economic scale and structure, as well as resulting welfare, may be non-monotonic, and (iii) environmental damage may exhibit an inverted U-shape form. These results raise important questions about the optimal design of environmental policies in a multi-pollution economy. We suggest a system of dynamic Pigouvian emission taxes, each of which should be levied specifically on one particular pollutant. We show that the optimal time path of each tax level is determined by the characteristics not only of that particular pollutant but also of all other pollutants. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In many cases, unsolved border issues are still pending, keeping a high conflict potential. Under these conditions, the role of the international initiatives - and in particular, the activities carried out within various multilateral agreements - prove to be powerful tools to reconcile part of these tensions. A specific example is represented by the UNESCO designated sites, namely, the World Heritage Sites and the Biosphere Reserves. In both cases, their international visibility and respective governance mechanisms guarantee to foster the multilateral cooperation. The various existing sites in SEE and, most of all, the ones to be designated next, represent very important opportunities to 'ground' the trans-boundary cooperation and to potentially catalyze the broad range of current 'green diplomacy' activities in the region, fostering the overall environment security.","[Andrian, Giorgio] UNESCO Venice Off, Reg Bur Sci & Culture Europe BRESCE, Venice, Italy; [Gaudry, Karl-Heinz] Univ Freiburg, Inst Landscape Management, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Andrian, G (通讯作者)，UNESCO Venice Off, Reg Bur Sci & Culture Europe BRESCE, Venice, Italy.",g.andrian@unesco.org; karl-heinz.gaudry@landespflege.uni-freiburg.de,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1871-4668,,978-94-007-0227-1,NATO SCI PEACE SECUR,NATO Sci.

The objective of this research was to measure operational performance of distribution centres for agricultural perishables in terms of through-put and space utilization. Findings - The inefficient utilization of storage space within cold rooms has been identified and quantified accurately, whilst the quality control task has been recognized as the most time-consuming task and a critical cause for hindering product flow. Practical implications - Despite their importance, distribution centres for fresh fruit and vegetables have received little attention in the distribution and performance management literature. Given the lack of robust performance measurement systems reported, the measurement of operational performance in distribution centres for agricultural products was a challenge. Originality/value - The measurement and improvement of the operational performance in each linkage of the fresh produce supply chain - such as a distribution centre - can lead in achieving higher levels of service at Substantially reduced costs. A small number of publications are found in the literature providing information on physical distribution of agricultural perishables, and how the key features of perishability and voluminosity of the produce affect the distribution efficiency. In this research, a step towards the improvement of the fresh produce distribution industry operational performance has been attempted, by evaluating the current operational status of a leading multiple produce distribution centre in the UK.","[Manikas, Ioannis] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Agr Sci, GR-54006 Thessaloniki, Greece; [Terry, Leon A.] Cranfield Univ, Inst BioSci & Technol, Plant Sci Lab, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Cranfield University,"Manikas, I (通讯作者)，Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Agr Sci, GR-54006 Thessaloniki, Greece.",imanikas@agro.auth.gr,"Manikas, Ioannis/B-9754-2018","Manikas, Ioannis/0000-0002-4084-1651; Terry, Leon/0000-0001-5677-023X",,,,,31,11,12,2,35,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Three important criteria revenue effort, deficit financing and distance criterion are considered to estimate the weight assigned to these criteria. The comparison of actual state own revenue and expenditure policies with the optimum policy reveals that states are spending more than estimated optimum level and collecting revenues less than the optimum level.

The existing methods for supplier selection, such as data envelopment analysis (DEA) and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) can automatically perform selection of competitive suppliers and further decide winning supplier(s).

Design/methodology/approach - Overall, eight theoretical views on school meals are briefly illustrated. Empirical data were collected in 2007 from four comprehensive schools, where the school kitchen types were either a preparing kitchen or a heating kitchen. A total of 168 6th-9th graders returned the questionnaire. The data were analysed by using factor and cluster analyses, one-way Anova and F-tests. Findings - A total of six factors illustrating the dimensions of self-reported school meal diet behaviour were found. They were titled as learning, energy, economy, health, opposition to school meals, and finally impact of social-ecological environment. Based on the factor scores, the following two clusters emerged: Pupils having a positive attitude towards school meals and learning and Impressionable pupils having a negative attitude towards school meals. Practical implications - The findings indicate that information on healthy eating habits and nutritional information - including the plate model - should be targeted, both to the pupils and the parents. Also, the pupils' favourite dishes could be served more often.

The economic forces behind these changes simultaneously enabled collaborative relationships that replaced command-control coordination. While such change has been widespread, the food industry serves as an example of an industry where such strategies have been incompletely pursued. This paper aims to provide a microeconomic explanation of three bases for the emergence of collaboration and network formation: transaction costs, interdependence in value creation processes, and shared resources. Design/methodology/approach - Within a setting of the food industry, a microeconomic theory of firm level choice of transactions is presented and extended to consider market level equilibrium in where persistent relationships are defined to compose an integrated economic network. Findings - The paper presents a framework for identification of the optimal pattern of relationships across firms to compose networks that could enhance the competitive advantage and the economic performance of the food sector. Originality/value - While performance of the food system has been the target of extensive public policy, that policy has typically viewed food enterprises as autonomous units operating through competitive markets. This paper provides a framework that highlights an economic rationale for collaboration across food enterprises that offers enhanced performance while maintaining essential aspects of competition.","Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Weaver, RD (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",R2W@psu.edu,,"Weaver, Robert D./0000-0002-4968-7224",,,,,39,9,10,1,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Building on a capability view the paper argues that firms can engender sustainable competitive advantage by enabling firms to build and leverage inter-organizational relationships to generate relational rents by: fostering close working relationships with a limited number of suppliers; building effective network structures, and developing a long term orientation. Using PLS path modelling, the paper empirically tests a number of hypothesized relationships based on a sample of 176 Dutch firms. Findings - The results demonstrate that inter-firm network capability significantly and substantially affects supplier performance as well as buyer performance, thereby providing evidence of the predictive validity of the inter-firm network capability construct. Originality/value - The study contributes to a more complete understanding of a firm's collaborative capabilities in developing and leveraging inter-organizational relationships and enhances the knowledge of the drivers of rent generating capabilities that contribute to the firm's performance.","[Ziggers, G.

Notwithstanding these reforms, out-of-pocket payments which create a barrier to access health services contribute almost half of total health are financing in Iran. This study aimed to provide a greater understanding about the inequality and determinants of the out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) and the related catastrophic expenditure (CE) for hospital services in Iran using a nationwide survey data, the 2003 Utilisation of Health Services Survey (UHSS). The concentration index and the Heckman selection model were used to assess inequality and factors associated with these expenditures. Inequality analysis suggests that the CE is concentrated among households in lower socioeconomic levels. The results of the Heckman selection model indicate that factors such as length of stay, admission to a hospital owned by private sector or Ministry of Health and Medical Education, and living in remote areas are positively associated with higher OOPE. Results of the ordered-probit selection model demonstrate that length of stay, lower household wealth index, and admission to a private hospital are major factors contributing to the increase in the probability of CE. Also, we find that households living in East Azarbaijan, Kordestan and Sistan and Balochestan face a higher level of CE. Based on our findings, the current employer-sponsored health insurance system does not offer equal protection against hospital expenditure in Iran. It seems that a single universal health insurance scheme that covers health services for all Iranian-regardless of their employment status-can better protect households from catastrophic health spending.","[Hajizadeh, Mohammad] Univ Queensland, Australian Ctr Econ Res Hlth ACERH, Royal Brisbane & Womens Hosp, Herston, Qld 4029, Australia; [Hajizadeh, Mohammad] Univ Queensland, Royal Brisbane & Womens Hosp, Sch Econ, Herston, Qld 4029, Australia; [Nghiem, Hong Son] Univ Queensland, Ctr Natl Res Disabil & Rehabil Med CONROD, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Royal Brisbane & Women's Hospital; University of Queensland; Royal Brisbane & Women's Hospital; University of Queensland; University of Queensland,"Hajizadeh, M (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Australian Ctr Econ Res Hlth ACERH, Royal Brisbane & Womens Hosp, Edith Cavell Bldg, Herston, Qld 4029, Australia.",mohammad.hajizadeh@uqconnect.edu.au; h.nghiem@uq.edu.au,"Nghiem, Hong Son/S-9974-2019; Nghiem, Hong Son/F-6263-2010","Hajizadeh, Mohammad/0000-0002-4591-8531; Nghiem, Hong Son/0000-0002-2451-5290",,,,,40,42,47,1,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

A GP may accept new patients or close the practice to new patients. We model GPs as partially altruistic, and compete for patients. We show that a GP operating in a more competitive market has a higher referral rate. To compete for patients and to retain them, a GP satisfies patients' requests for referrals. Furthermore, a GP who faces a patient shortage will refer more often than a GP who does not.

Three hundred and fifteen cases of predominantly urban storage were recorded for 97 communities for the products of agriculture purchased by the purveyors, mostly threshed grains. When these 315 cases were analysed using an Excel database, it was found that, in contrast to the often magnificent barns on monastic and other lordly estates, this storage was much smaller and informal, often indistinguishable, it seems, from the domestic storage for families themselves. As modest as it was, however, it likely played an important role in the increasing commercialization of medieval England, even perhaps to the extent of making society at the time more susceptible to subsistence crises.","[Claridge, Jordan; Langdon, John] Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2M7, Canada",University of Alberta,"Claridge, J (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2M7, Canada.",,,,,,,,27,15,17,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

It argues that secondary poverty was a central component of Rowntree's first survey of York, carried out in 1899, and in his lectures and writing in the Edwardian period. Moreover, secondary poverty remained an important feature of Rowntree's analysis during the interwar years and after the Second World War, and was adopted by other researchers in various ways. Although secondary poverty was not seriously examined in the published version of Rowntree's 1936 York survey, there is evidence that it was originally intended to feature, and it is clear that impressionistic evidence of poverty was gathered by Rowntree's investigators, as had been the case in 1899. Moreover, although it was completely expunged from the third survey of York, carried out by Rowntree and Lavers in 1950, a separate inquiry into secondary poverty was carried out in the early 1950s, with a number of prominent supporters. Subsequently, dissatisfaction with income-based definitions and measurements of poverty allowed the concept of secondary poverty to continue to exercise an influence on the study of poverty in the postwar period.","Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Freeman, M (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",,,,,,,,51,1,1,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

In the literature, only two statistical models have been proposed in which second-stage regressions are well-defined and meaningful. In the model considered by Simar and Wilson (J Prod Anal 13:49-78, 2007), truncated regression provides consistent estimation in the second stage, where as in the model proposed by Banker and Natarajan (Oper Res 56: 48-58, 2008a), ordinary least squares (OLS) provides consistent estimation. This paper examines, compares, and contrasts the very different assumptions underlying these two models, and makes clear that second-stage OLS estimation is consistent only under very peculiar and unusual assumptions on the data-generating process that limit its applicability. In addition, we show that in either case, bootstrap methods provide the only feasible means for inference in the second stage. We also comment on ad hoc specifications of second-stage regression equations that ignore the part of the data-generating process that yields data used to obtain the initial DEA estimates.","[Wilson, Paul W.] Clemson Univ, John E Walker Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Simar, Leopold] Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Stat Biostat & Sci Actuarielles, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium",Clemson University; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Wilson, PW (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, John E Walker Dept Econ, 222 Sirrine Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",leopold.simar@uclouvain.be; pww@clemson.edu,,"Wilson, Paul W/0000-0002-9865-033X",,,,,38,171,191,3,80,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Two main options have been put forward to tackle these concerns: border adjustments and output-based allocation, i.e. allocation of free allowances in proportion to current production. We compare various configurations of these two options, as well as a scenario with full auctioning and no border adjustment. Against this background, we develop a model of the main sectors covered by the EU ETS: electricity, steel, cement and aluminium. We conclude that the most efficient way to tackle leakage is auctioning with border adjustment, which generally induces a negative leakage (a spillover). This holds even if the border adjustment does not include indirect emissions, if it is based on EU (rather than foreign) specific emissions, or (for some values of the parameters) if it covers only imports. Another relatively efficient policy is to combine auctioning in the electricity sector and output-based allocation in exposed industries, especially if free allowances are given both for direct and indirect emissions, i.e. those generated by the generation of the electricity consumed. Although output-based allocation is generally less effective than border adjustment to tackle leakage, it is more effective to mitigate production losses in the sectors affected by the ETS, which may ease climate policy adoption.

Earmarking of revenues has been widely reported to increase public support for taxes, but earmarking is generally not the most efficient use of the revenues. This trade-off between efficiency and political feasibility is the motivation for our primary research objective: to quantify the effect of earmarking on support for fuel tax rises. Our secondary research objective is to investigate why earmarking increases support. Using data from a representative sample of the Norwegian voter population (N = 1147), we estimate models of voter preferences for fuel taxes using logistic regression models. Our results show that, in the absence of earmarking, the majority of voters would like to reduce fuel taxes, but earmarking the revenues for environmental measures has a substantial effect on voter support for fuel tax increases, garnering a majority for increases of up to 15% above present levels. Further analysis indicates that a prime reason why earmarking for environmental measures is popular is that it increases the perceived environmental effectiveness of the tax, and hence its legitimacy as an environmental rather than a fiscal policy instrument.

The model is built on agency theory, and solved using numerical dynamic programming techniques. The model is flexible enough to handle quotas and bonuses, output-based commission schemes, as well as ratcheting of compensation based on past performance, all of which are ubiquitous in actual contracts. The model explicitly incorporates the dynamics induced by these aspects in agent behavior. We apply the model to a rich dataset that comprises the complete details of sales and compensation plans for the firm's US sales-force. We use the model to evaluate profit-improving, theoretically-preferred changes to the extant compensation scheme. These recommendations were then implemented at the focal firm. Agent behavior and output under the new compensation plan is found to change as predicted. The new plan resulted in a 9% improvement in overall revenues, which translates to about $12 million incremental revenues annually, indicating the success of the field-implementation. The results bear out the face validity of dynamic agency theory for real-world compensation design. More generally, our results fit into a growing literature that illustrates that dynamic programming-based solutions, when combined with structural empirical specifications of behavior, can help significantly improve marketing decision-making, and firms' profitability.","[Nair, Harikesh S.] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Misra, Sanjog] Univ Rochester, Simon Sch Business Adm, Rochester, NY USA",Stanford University; University of Rochester,"Nair, HS (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",sanjog.misra@simon.rochester.edu; harikesh.nair@stanford.edu,"Nair, Harikesh S/A-3999-2012",,,,,,50,80,99,1,34,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

Average height and health can be related to infant mortality through a positive selection effect and a negative scarring effect. Examining town-level panel data on the heights of school children, no evidence is found for the selection effect, but there is some support for the scarring effect. The results suggest that the improvement in the disease environment, as reflected by the decline in infant mortality, increased average height by about half a centimetre per decade in the first half of the twentieth century.","[Hatton, Timothy J.] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Hatton, Timothy J.] Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",Australian National University; University of Essex,"Hatton, TJ (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,,,,,,,74,39,42,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

This allows us to test whether people's preferences for effort-sharing rules depend on the framing of the problem. We find that the ranking of the rules and the strength of the preferences are not significantly different between the two treatments, and hence we find no evidence of ingroup bias in preferences for effort-sharing rules.

To examine this question, this paper develops a decision model of a regulator choosing emission controls within a net cost minimizing framework. An empirical application of the model using air toxic emission data for Escambia and Santa Rosa Counties in Florida estimates the emission standards and spatial distribution of risks at a coarse and a finer spatial resolutions. Implications for EJ are analyzed by combining the simulated spatial risk distributions at the two resolutions with the demographic data. Results indicate that different measures of EJ point to different conclusions regarding the question of whether finer resolution regulation alleviates EJ concerns.

It argues that economic stakeholders (user groups) generally do well in identifying these services and assigning prices to them. These prices arise spontaneously in and serve to coordinate market activity related to the environment. The relevant ecological information which markets gather and apply tends to be dispersed, contingent, particular, local, transitory, and embedded in institutions and practices. Ecologists and other scientists, in contrast, often seek to understand how ecosystems work and which populations and processes provide ecosystem services. The knowledge science seeks, unlike the information markets gather, tends to be centralized, collaborative, collective, and consensus-based; science pursues concepts and principles that are timeless and general rather than ephemeral and site-specific. The paper contrasts the dispersed and decentralized information organized by markets with the collective and centralized knowledge characteristic of science. The paper argues that the conceptual distance between market-based and science-based methods of assembling information and applying knowledge defeats efforts to determine the value of ecosystem services in any integrated sense.

J,"Alonso, AD",,,,"Alonso, Abel Duarte",,,Farmers' involvement in value-added produce: the case of Alabama growers,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Value added; Arable farming; Agricutlure; United States of America; Cost effectiveness; Food products,AFRICA; ASIA,"Purpose - For many farmers across the USA the opportunity to sell their produce directly to the public in different ways allows them to avoid middle-men and often reap higher benefits that are vital for their survival. However, to what extent do they fully maximise their produce? For instance, do farmers consider developing value-added products when they have fruit or vegetable leftovers, or those with blemishes? The present paper aims to explore involvement in value-added food production from the growers' standpoint. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected via telephone and face-to-face interviews among 30 farm owners located in the state of Alabama. Findings - While the large majority of participating farmers (93.3 per cent) are involved in selling produce directly to the public, only 33.3 per cent are currently maximising their produce left-overs, or unsalable produce by developing and marketing value-added products such as jellies, jams and ice-creams. Almost one fourth of farmers (23.3 per cent) would consider developing value-added products. However, the lack of a commercial kitchen, a potentially considerable investment, is one significant barrier preventing the development of value-added products. Research limitations/implications - Choosing only farmers that are already involved in retailing their own produce, and their low number (30) are limitations that may not allow for making generalisations of the study's findings. Practical implications - In times where the threat of food crises is latent, the ability for food growers to maximise their harvests becomes critical. Because farm operators play a significant role in providing food for society at: large, they should be accordingly supported to maximise their produce, including through the development of value-added products. Originality/value - The study provides a different view of value-added produce, investigating this dimension from the farmers' viewpoint.","[Alonso, Abel Duarte] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Mkt Tourism & Leisure, Joondalup, Australia; [Alonso, Abel Duarte] Univ Western Sydney, Sch Management, Penrith, Australia",Edith Cowan University; Western Sydney University,"Alonso, AD (通讯作者)，Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Mkt Tourism & Leisure, Joondalup, Australia.",a.alonso@ecu.edu.au,,,,,,,48,20,22,1,15,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Consumer survey was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire on a sample of 1,035 young consumers aged between 14 and 30 years. Research questions focused on knowledge about functional food, attitudes and buying behaviour regarding functional food. Data were analysed using univariate statistics, bivariate correlations and factor analysis. Findings - About 40 per cent of young consumers are familiar with the concept of functional food, and 27 per cent of them are regular buyers. The usual place where functional food is acquired is supermarkets and most commonly bought are functional dairy products. The most important functional food attributes are taste and price/quality ratio. Consumers are satisfied with functional food health enhancing characteristics and less satisfied with its appearance and durability. Three factors that explain young consumers' attitudes towards functional food are health awareness and confidence, lack of trust for functional food and its price and quality. More than half of respondents are willing to buy functional food in the future (51.8 per cent). Female consumers aged between 19 and 30, living in smaller households with higher income are more likely to be functional food consumers in the future. Research limitations/implications - A limitation of this study is the sample including only young consumers. Further research is needed to analyse other consumer groups, and to determine which segments are most appropriate for functional food products marketing. Practical implications - Research results indicate a need to increase consumer familiarity with functional food and improyements in some of its characteristics. Overall positive attitudes toward functional food should be reinforced and young consumers can be influenced through targeted advertising. Originality/value - This paper gives the first account of young consumers' perception of functional food in Croatia. The results of this research can be used to plan further marketing activities.","[Markovina, Jerko; Kovacic, Damir] Univ Zagreb, Dept Agr Mkt, Fac Agr, Zagreb 41000, Croatia; [Cacic, Jasna] Minist Agr Fisheries & Rural Dev, Wine & Spirits Dept, Direct Food Ind, Zagreb, Croatia; [Kljusuric, Jasenka Gajdos] Univ Zagreb, Fac Food Technol & Biotechnol, Lab Measurement Regulat & Automatisat, Dept Proc Engn, Zagreb 41000, Croatia",University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb,"Markovina, J (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Dept Agr Mkt, Fac Agr, Zagreb 41000, Croatia.",jmarkovina@agr.hr,"Kljusuric, Jasenka Gajdos/AAD-2935-2021; Markovina, Jerko/T-9976-2019","Kljusuric, Jasenka Gajdos/0000-0001-6657-7337; Markovina, Jerko/0000-0003-1776-3832",,,,,26,40,42,1,57,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper summarises the findings from research on organic food-purchasing behaviour and discusses how this can be applied to the new field of carbon labelling of food. Two consumer behaviour studies specifically examining carbon labelling are also reviewed. Findings - Although consumers have positive attitudes to preserving the environment, sales of organic products are low for several reasons: perceived high price, strong habits governing food purchases, perceived low availability, lack of marketing and information, lack of trust in the labelling system, and low perceived customer effectiveness. All these obstacles apply to the purchase of carbon labelled products and several are even greater for carbon-labelled products, since these do not bring any personal benefits to the consumer, unlike the perceived case for organic products. Practical implications - A carbon labelling scheme must be introduced carefully to avoid confusing the consumer. The goal of the carbon labelling system must be defined, and the label and labelling system designed and managed to meet that goal. Originality/value - Lessons learned from the abundant research on purchasing behaviour regarding organic food are applied to the new field of carbon labelling for the first time. Fields in need of further research for the successful introduction of carbon labelling schemes are identified.","[Roos, Elin] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Energy & Technol, Uppsala, Sweden; [Tjarnemo, Helene] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Work Sci Business Econ & Environm Psychol, Alnarp, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Röös, E (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Energy & Technol, Uppsala, Sweden.",elin.roos@et.slu.se,,"Roos, Elin/0000-0002-3482-2286",,,,,50,84,84,7,108,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The extent to which these relationships are actually simultaneously determined, however, remains largely unobserved. This paper estimates panel data vector autoregressions for different sectors of the economy to test for bidirectional causality between productivity and both localization and urbanization economies. The aim is to address some key questions that will help to identify the extent of the endogeneity problem. Can we actually observe bidirectionality in the data? Does it feature more for some industries than for others? Is it more prevalent for localization or urbanization economies? The results show that agglomeration economies are not strictly unidirectional and that higher levels of productivity can induce growth in the scale of local urban and industrial environments. The paper discusses the difficulties that these issues pose for the estimation of agglomeration economies.","[Graham, Daniel J.; Melo, Patricia S.; Jiwattanakulpaisarn, Piyapong] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Transport Studies, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Noland, Robert B.] Rutgers State Univ, Edward J Bloustein Sch Planning & Publ Policy, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA",Imperial College London; University of London; University College London; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Graham, DJ (通讯作者)，Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Transport Studies, London SW7 2AZ, England.",d.j.graham@imperial.ac.uk; patricia.melo05@imperial.ac.uk; piyapong.j03@imperial.ac.uk; rnoland@rutgers.edu,"Graham, Daniel/AAA-6157-2021; Noland, Robert B/C-7806-2009; Melo, Patricia/G-9132-2017","Graham, Daniel/0000-0002-6971-8737; Melo, Patricia/0000-0001-6722-1914; Noland, Robert/0000-0003-0775-0624",,,,,39,63,65,2,26,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-4146,,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Shift-share analyses provide evidence on the drivers of environmental efficiency and on sector specificity. Our evidence shows that although the region around Rome has achieved higher environmental performance compared to Italy mainly thank to its being less industry based, some critical points in the energy sector and in some services should be taken into account in shaping the future development of the region. In addition, the use of regional NAMEA for econometric investigations of emission efficiency drivers at national level shows that though north south disparities favour northern and richer regions, in accordance with development oriented dynamics, environmental hot spots driven by specialisation and efficiency related issues also appear in some northern industrial regions. Further, the role of public ad private R&D is of main relevance in enhancing emission on economic value ratios. Environmental, industrial and sector-oriented policy making may derive valuable information from the evidence provided by our study, that highlights how analytical exploitation of NAMEA offers rich array of insights for regional policy making.

To estimate numeracy, the age-heaping method is used for the 18(th) to early 20(th) centuries. Testing the hypothesis that globalization might have increased the inequality of education, we find evidence that 19(th) century globalization actually increased inequality in Latin America, but 20(th) century globalization had positive effects by reducing educational inequality in a broader sample of developing countries. Moreover, we find strong evidence for Kuznets's inverted U hypothesis, that is, rising educational inequality with GDP per capita in the period until 1913 and the opposite after 1945.","[Baten, Joerg; Mumme, Christina] Univ Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany; [Baten, Joerg] CESifo, Dept Econ, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Ifo Institut,"Baten, J (通讯作者)，Univ Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.",joerg.baten@uni-tuebingen.de; mumme@gmx.net,,", Joerg/0000-0001-5029-501X",,,,,49,5,6,1,18,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

The results indicate that individuals who are Hispanic, black, or of another race or ethnicity, over the age of 74, not married, in poor health, fall into the low- to middle-income brackets, and have less than a high school degree are more likely to be covered through a public program, more likely to be uninsured for prescription medicine outlays, and less likely to have private prescription drug coverage. The paper concludes that there is cause for considerable concern for low income citizens who have significant prescription drug outlays, and, therefore, the greatest need because their prescription drug costs may not be covered beyond a certain limit unless they reach catastrophic proportions. This continues to raise equity in access concerns among elderly patients.","[Kanavos, Panos; Gemmill-Toyama, Marin] London Sch Econ, LSE Hlth, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Kanavos, P (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, LSE Hlth, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",p.g.kanavos@lse.ac.uk; m.c.gemmill@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,31,4,5,1,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

The main objective of this review is to introduce the findings of the various valuation studies, and explore the challenges that emerged in these studies. This paper shows that ecosystem services research in China went through four stages covering all the main ecosystem types and multi-scales. These studies have raised public awareness of the value of ecological and bio-resource issues, and promoted the establishment of eco-compensation mechanisms in China. However, there are still many controversies and challenges that have emerged from current ecosystem services research. We propose that future ecosystem services research focuses on i) the corresponding definition and classification systems for all ecosystems; ii) the observation and establishment of the relationship between ecosystem structures and corresponding functions; iii) the improvement and normalization of valuation methods; and iv) the exploration and analysis of the spatial and temporal variations of ecosystem services. Furthermore, it is important to improve the accessibility of ecosystem services valuation in environmental decision-making. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

An alternative is to optimize abatement programmes towards a stationary state, where the concentrations of greenhouse gases are stabilized and shadow prices, including the rate of discount, are determined endogenously. This paper examines the properties of optimized stabilization. It turns out that the implications for the evaluation of climate policy are substantial if compared with evaluations of the present value of costs and benefits based on exogenously chosen shadow prices. Comparisons of discounted costs and benefits tend to exaggerate the importance of the choice of discount rate. while ignoring the importance of future abatement costs, which turns out to be essential for the optimal abatement path. Numerical examples suggest that early action may be more beneficial than indicated by comparisons of costs and benefits discounted by a rate chosen on the basis of current observations.

Maintaining the role of the frontrunner, the European Parliament and the Council established on 13 October 2003 a scheme of GHG emission allowance trading within the Community, the so-called Emission Trading System (ETS). Greece, as a Member State of the European Union, takes action in the field of the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions. According to the Directive 2003/87/EC, the Greek government includes in National Allocation Plans (NAPs) the biggest polluters from each one of the energy demand sectors. More specifically, the Directive covers electricity industries, other industrial combustion installations, refineries, metal ore roasting and cindering installations, pig iron and steel production installations, cement clinker production installations, lime production installations, glass manufacture installations, ceramic production installations and pulp and paper production installations. The objective of this paper is to examine the impact of the Emission Trading System on the profitability of Greek companies included in the NAPs. On this basis, the quantities of carbon dioxide that every participant has emitted during each year of the period 2005-2008 are compared respectively to the quantity of emission allowances issued. The balance indicates whether the tradable allowances are responsible for the participants' financial results (of their balance sheets). Financial indicators are used to present the impact of the acquisition or sale of allowances on the total turnover and the profit before tax of the participating companies. An additional goal of this paper is to identify the causes that resulted in a surplus or shortage of allowances, taking into consideration financial, as well as environmental, parameters. Consequently, some useful conclusions are drawn concerning the management of allowances that are granted for free to the participating companies.","[Aravossis, K.; Garoufi, G.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Mech Engn, Sector Ind Management & Operat Res, Athens, Greece",National Technical University of Athens,,,"ARAVOSSIS, KONSTANTINOS/IQW-5394-2023","ARAVOSSIS, KONSTANTINOS/0000-0001-8962-9195",,,,,8,1,1,0,11,WIT PRESS,SOUTHAMPTON,"ASHURST LODGE, SOUTHAMPTON SO40 7AA, ASHURST, ENGLAND",1743-3541,,978-1-84564-436-9,WIT TRANS ECOL ENVIR,,,2010,131.0,,,,,,3,15,,10.2495/EEIA100011,0.0,,,13,Ecology; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Business & Economics,BQH16,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280992200001,0

However, for certain foods these processes modify the valuable nutritional content and organoleptic properties. In recent years, a number of emerging food preservation processes have been developed to fill a market niche in which the consumer prefers to pay more to obtain processed foods with their natural properties. The paper seeks to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach In this study a review of the available scientific data in relation to high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) and pulsed electric fields (PEF) are presented, highlighting the quality advantages, industrial application and safety risks in their use. Findings Nowadays, more than 100 industrial applications are marketed. and several companies design process equipments. Damage to cell membranes, enzymes or DNA is the most commonly cause of microorganisms' death by these technologies. In addition, within a population of microorganisms, some bacteria are killed, others survive, and a proportion is damaged. The latter is the concern population as the damage may be repaired and the microorganism maybe viable during the product shelf life. Acquisition of new or modified characteristics such as higher treatment resistance could also occur. Another potential risk has to do with the death pattern of microorganisms showing deviations from the traditional log-linear kinetic model (shoulders, tails and sigmoidal shape). Therefore the developing of simple mathematical models, which can adequately interpret this behaviour, is necessary. Originality/value In summary, PEF and HHP technologies need to be evaluated by industries and regulatory authorities and more affordable equipments should be marketed to expand their use at industrial level.","[Martinez, Antonio] CSIC, Inst Agroquim & Tecnol Alimentos, Dept Ing Alimentos & Equipamiento Agr, E-46010 Valencia, Spain; [Rodrigo, Dolores; Sampedro, Fernando; Silva, A.; Palop, Alfredo] CSIC, Inst Agroquim & Tecnol Alimentos, Burjassot, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Instituto de Agroquimica y Tecnologia de los Alimentos (IATA); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Instituto de Agroquimica y Tecnologia de los Alimentos (IATA),"Martínez, A (通讯作者)，CSIC, Inst Agroquim & Tecnol Alimentos, Dept Ing Alimentos & Equipamiento Agr, Jaime Roig 11, E-46010 Valencia, Spain.",conaml@iata.csic.es,"Sampedro, Fernando/AAH-8332-2020; Palop, Alfredo/L-4049-2017; Martinez, Antonio/H-4094-2012; Rodrigo, Dolores/H-6083-2012","Sampedro, Fernando/0000-0003-1155-2751; Palop, Alfredo/0000-0002-6617-3276; Martinez, Antonio/0000-0002-2323-8463; Rodrigo, Dolores/0000-0001-9854-111X",,,,,32,12,13,0,37,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The authors have organized most of the existing databases in the island's archives and have also incorporated quantitative and qualitative material from their own research and that of other colleagues. Due to their quality and regularity, the data are among the richest known for pre-industrial Europe. These sources lead to some conclusions which link with recent debates in European economic history concerning the calculation of economic growth in economies for periods before statistics were kept. The text presents a methodological analysis covering almost 80 per cent of agricultural production of the island of Majorca and leaves conclusions to be supplemented by further studies of the manufacturing and service sectors.","[Jover Avella, Gabriel] Univ Girona, Girona, Spain; [Manera Erbina, Carles] Univ Illes Balears, Palma de Mallorca, Spain",Universitat de Girona; Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Avellà, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Girona, Girona, Spain.",cmanera@cgovern.caib.es,"Manera, Carles/AAB-2945-2021","MANERA, CARLES/0000-0002-0259-4207",,,,,77,2,2,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

In this paper, we explore locational equilibria in a competitive broadband market under several situations: with and without customer loyalty and under different initial market conditions. To do this, we propose a competitive broadband location model based on probabilistic patronage behavior, explicitly considering the characteristics of the broadband market and competitive structures. Also, we suggest iterative algorithms to identify spatial equilibria. We show that competing location strategies may lead to a stable spatial configuration of market share.","[Lee, Gunhak] Korea Natl Stat Off, Stat Res Inst, Taejon, South Korea; [O'Kelly, Morton E.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Geog, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Lee, G (通讯作者)，Korea Natl Stat Off, Stat Res Inst, 949 Dunsan Dong, Taejon, South Korea.",gunhlee@gmail.com; okelly.1@osu.edu,,"O'Kelly, Morton/0000-0002-8967-9771",,,,,59,3,3,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

The sources of this long-run growth are investigated here for the first time. Broad capital accumulation and efficiency-term growth. Factor accumulation gains appear as complementary in Spain's long dominated long-run growth up to 1950, while total factor productivity (TFP) led thereafter and, especially, during periods of growth acceleration. The main spurts in TFP and capital coincide with the impact of the railroads (1850s-1880), the electrification (the 1920s and 1950s), and to the adoption of new vintage technology during the Golden Age.","[Prados de la Escosura, Leandro; Roses, Joan R.] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Inst Figuerola, Madrid 28903, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"de la Escosura, LP (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Inst Figuerola, Econ Hist & Inst Calle Madrid 126, Madrid 28903, Spain.",leandro.prados.delaescosura@uc3m.es; jroses@clio.uc3m.es,"Roses, Joan/K-5475-2013; de la Escosura, Leandro Prados/H-9476-2015","Roses, Joan/0000-0003-0661-3134; de la Escosura, Leandro Prados/0000-0002-2362-4305",,,,,83,48,48,0,25,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-0507,1471-6372,,J ECON HIST,J.
