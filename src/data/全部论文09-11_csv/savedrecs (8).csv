This survey contrasts the predominant transformational approach (West comprehensively saves Africa) to occasional swings to a marginal approach (West takes one small step at a time to help individual Africans). Evaluation of one step at a time initiatives is generally easier than that of transformational ones either through controlled experiments (although these have been oversold) or simple case studies where it is easier to attribute outcomes to actions. We see two themes emerge from the literature survey: (1) escalation-as each successive Western transformational effort. has yielded disappointing results (as judged at least by stylized facts, since again, the econometrics are shaky), the response has been to try an, even more, ambitious effort and (2) the cycle of ideas-rather than a progressive testing and discarding of failed ideas, we see a cycle in aid ideas in many areas in Africa, with ideas going out of fashion, only to come back again later after some lapse long enough to forget the previous disappointing experience. Both escalation and cyclicality of ideas are symptomatic of the lack of learning that seems to be characteristic of the transformational approach. In, contrast, the marginal approach has had sonic successes in improving the well-being of individual Africans, such as the dramatic fall in mortality.","[Easterly, William] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Easterly, William] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",New York University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Easterly, W (通讯作者)，NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,,,,,,,254,100,128,0,55,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

Boundary reforms can provide economic benefits, but may also give rise to costs driven by Opportunistic political behavior. This study uses a Swedish compulsory reform to test for such behavior. The reform gives a local government the incentive to accumulate debt before a merger takes place, since the taxpayers in the new locality will share the cost. The strength of the incentive to free ride is determined by the population size of the initial locality relative to that of the new locality. I find an economically large and statistically significant free riding effect. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We found that Chinese agents spent much less time than their titles would suggest on providing agricultural extension services, and that agents whose base salaries were funded fully or partially by commercial activities spent substantially less time serving farmers. The institutional incentives associated with the source of funding have a much larger effect on agent time allocation than do the levels of funding. We conclude that the recent government policy to separate commercial activities from extension services is a step in the right direction and should be expanded. The results also suggest that, at least for agricultural extension, the goal of many national governments and international donors to develop locally financing institutions to sustain development projects may be misguided.

We investigate the impact of child, parental, household and community characteristics on children's height and on the probability of stunting. Descriptive and econometric analysis, augmented by policy simulations, is employed to achieve the objectives of the study. In estimation, we control for sample design and possible heterogeneity arising from unobserved community characteristics correlated with children's nutritional status and its determinants. The key findings are that boys suffer more malnutrition than girls, and children of multiple births are more likely to be malnourished than singletons. The results further indicate that maternal education is a more important determinant of children's nutritional status than paternal education. Household assets are also important determinants of children's nutritional status but nutrition improves at a decreasing rate with assets. The use of public health services, more-so modern contraceptives, is also found to be an important determinant of child nutritional status. Policy simulations affirm the potential role of parental, household and community characteristics in reducing long-term malnutrition in Kenya and suggest that the correct policy mix would make a substantial reduction in the current high levels of malnutrition. Our findings suggest that, if Kenya is to achieve her strategic health objectives and millennium development target of reducing the prevalence of malnutrition, strategies for poverty alleviation, promotion of post secondary education for women and provision of basic preventive health care are critical concerns that need to be addressed.","[Kabubo-Mariara, Jane] Univ Nairobi, Sch Econ, Nairobi, Kenya; [Ndenge, Godfrey K.] Kenya Natl Bur Stat, Nairobi, Kenya; [Mwabu, Domisiano K.] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Nairobi; CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT),"Kabubo-Mariara, J (通讯作者)，Univ Nairobi, Sch Econ, Nairobi, Kenya.",jkmariara@yahoo.com,,,,,,,19,95,109,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The global financial turmoil that erupted in 2008 underscores the importance of this issue once again. This article maps out some of the key factors that contribute to this challenge, and then uses this map to develop a possible taxonomy for the array of proposed (and some already existing) policy instruments designed to respond to them. By relating each instrument to the particular aspect(s) of the broader policy challenge, the taxonomy helps to clarify some of the differences, similarities, as well as the potential value-added of these instruments. The analysis herein suggests that instruments that could help increase the efficiency of risk management strategies (such as growth- or GDP-indexed bonds) and enhance the effectiveness of debt management, growth and development policies (such as a stability and social investment facility or SIF) deserve further consideration in order to promote more sustained financial stability and enhanced debt tolerance in the emerging markets.","UNDP, ODS, New York, NY 10017 USA",,"Mendoza, RU (通讯作者)，UNDP, ODS, New York, NY 10017 USA.",ronmendoza@post.harvard.edu,"Mendoza, Ronald U./ABH-2837-2020",,,,,,106,3,3,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1610-241X,1612-7501,,CESIFO ECON STUD,CESifo Econ.

This mechanism has a significant information advantage: the regulator only needs to observe total costs, prices and output of all firms. The MYC mechanism can ensure a socially optimal outcome when allowing for spatial and second degree price discrimination. We also introduce regulatory lags to the model. In addition, we compare the two approaches for the case of unobserved firm heterogeneity, and provide numerical estimations of the effects. The MYC mechanism fares better in the case of unobserved heterogeneity, and may thus be a useful extension of Shleifer's yardstick mechanism.","[von Hirschhausen, Christian] DIW Berlin, Dept Int Econ, German Inst Econ Res, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [von Hirschhausen, Christian] Tech Univ Dresden, D-8027 Dresden, Germany; [Meran, Georg] Berlin Univ Technol, Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Technische Universitat Dresden; Technical University of Berlin,"von Hirschhausen, C (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, Dept Int Econ, German Inst Econ Res, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",gmeran@diw.de; cvh@mailbox.tu-dresden.de,,,,,,,25,6,6,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

We discuss these findings in relation to what many, including ourselves, perceive to be a problem in the economics profession, namely, an undue focus on the policy status quo.

Our model shows that differences regarding fuel prices will now depend on the proportions of alcohol, gasoline and flex cars in the total stock. Conversely, the demand for each type of car will also depend on the expected future prices of alcohol and gasoline (in addition to the car prices). The model reflects our findings that energy prices are tied in the long run and that causality runs stronger from gasoline to alcohol. The estimated error correction parameter is stable, implying that the speed of adjustment towards equilibrium remains unchanged. The latter result is probably due to a still small fraction of flex cars in the total stock (approx. 5%), despite the fact that its sales nearly reached 100% in 2006. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The payoff of the contingent claim is a sum of the contributing hourly payoffs. As there is no forward market for specific hours, the fundamental problem is to find a reasonable hedge using exchange-traded forward contracts, e.g. average-based monthly contracts. The main result is a simple dynamic hedging strategy that reduces a significant part of the variance. The idea is to decompose the contingent claim into mathematically tractable components and to use empirical estimations to derive hedging deltas. Two benefits of the method are that the technique easily extends to more complex power derivatives and that only a few parameters need to be estimated. The hedging strategy based on the decomposition technique is compared with dynamic delta hedging strategies based on local minimum variance hedging, using a correlated traded asset.

The SNE minimizes appropriate distances between non-parametric conditional (or joint) densities estimated from sample data and non-parametric conditional (or joint) densities estimated from data simulated out of the model of interest. Sample data and model-simulated data are smoothed with the same kernel, which considerably simplifies bandwidth selection for the purpose of implementing the estimator. Furthermore, the SNE displays the same asymptotic efficiency properties as the maximum-likelihood estimator as soon as the model is Markov in the observable variables. The methods introduced in this paper are fairly simple to implement, and possess finite sample properties that are well approximated by the asymptotic theory. We illustrate these features within typical estimation problems that arise in financial economics.","[Mele, Antonio] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,,,,,,,,,56,14,15,1,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

We examine this issue by considering the case of Lombardy, a highly developed manufacturing area the industrial activities of which are experiencing a pervasive transformation towards higher knowledge content, demanding stronger and more pervasive support by advanced services. Drawing on an original survey-based firm-level dataset, we analyze innovation patterns across KIBS, evaluating the explanatory power of traditional classifications of the service sector, as well as the heterogeneity driven by firm and market specific characteristics. Our findings highlight four profiles of KIBS: interactive innovation mode, product innovation mode, conservative innovation mode and techno-organizational innovation mode. When examining in more depth the variables that are associated with cluster membership, we find that firm strategy is the most significant determinant, with size, customer location, and training also playing a role in defining cluster specificities.","[Corrocher, Nicoletta; Cusmano, Lucia; Morrison, Andrea] Bocconi Univ, CESPRI, I-20236 Milan, Italy; [Corrocher, Nicoletta] Univ Tromso, NFH, Dept Econ, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Cusmano, Lucia] Insubria Univ, I-21100 Varese, Italy; [Morrison, Andrea] Univ Utrecht, Dept Econ Geog, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Bocconi University; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; University of Insubria; Utrecht University,"Corrocher, N (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, CESPRI, Via Sarfatti 25, I-20236 Milan, Italy.",nicoletta.corrocher@unibocconi.it,,"Morrison, Andrea/0000-0002-1878-6780; Corrocher, Nicoletta/0000-0003-2642-8227",,,,,42,90,102,1,59,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

The model takes into account a key feature of the policy-making process, namely, that the decision-maker faces time and budget constraints that prevent him from addressing all of the issues that are on the agenda. We show that this feature creates a rationale for a policy-motivated decision-maker to manipulate his policy choice in order to influence which issues will be salient in the next election. We identify three motivations for the decision-maker to manipulate his policy choice for salience purposes. One is to make salient an issue on which he has an electoral advantage. A second motivation is to defuse the salience of an issue on which he is electorally weak, which is accomplished by either implicitly committing to a policy outcome or triggering a change of salient issue for the challenger. A third motivation is to induce the opposition party to nominate a candidate who, if elected, will implement a policy that the incumbent decision maker finds more palatable.","[Dellis, Arnaud] Univ Laval, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Dellis, Arnaud] GIRPEE, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada",Laval University,"Dellis, A (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, 1025 Ave Sci Humaines,Local 2174, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",arnaud.dellis@ecn.ulaval.ca,,,,,,,44,14,17,0,9,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Managers can signal their altruistic feelings towards their employees in two ways: by offering a generous wage and by giving attention. Contrary to the traditional gift-exchange hypothesis, we show that altruistic managers may offer lower wages and nevertheless build up better social-exchange relationships with their employees than egoistic managers do. In such equilibria, a low wage signals to employees that the manager has something else to offer-namely, attention-which will induce the employee to stay at the firm and work hard. Our predictions are well in line with some recent empirical findings about gift exchange in the field.

A survey of British employees in 2001 rich in questions regarding the job post enables us to separate the contribution of working conditions, job attributes and individual characteristics to the process of wage determination. Standard wage equations reveal that covariates such as having repetitive job and using generic skills such as literacy or customer handling skills are associated with significant premiums and penalties. Quantile regressions confirm the presence of penalties to poor working conditions, such as working to tight deadlines, that are significant in the middle section of the earnings distribution and robust to the inclusion of a wide range of controls for person, firm and other job characteristics. Counterfactual decompositions at quantiles show that, despite the apparent penalty, there are pecuniary compensations to poor working conditions around the first quartile and the median of the earnings distribution.

The model takes into account distortionary taxation on labor and capital income and on consumption, while expenditures are broken down into purchases of goods and services, compensation of public employees and transfers to households. A newly computed quarterly data set of fiscal variables is used. Our results point to the prevalence of mild Keynesian effects of public expenditures. in particular, although innovations in fiscal policy variables tend to be rather persistent, government purchases of goods and services and compensations for public employees have small and short-lived expansionary effects on private consumption, while innovations in transfers to households show a slightly more sizeable and lasting effect. The effects are more significant on the revenue side: decreases in labor income and consumption tax rates have sizeable effects on consumption and output, while a reduction in capital income tax favors investment and output in the medium run. Finally our estimates suggest that fiscal policy variables contribute little to the cyclical variability of the main macro variables. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

By incorporating binary variables in the model to represent firms' decisions as to whether or not to install new control equipment, the results show that when the unit air pollution fee rate is higher than the firms' abatement costs, the design of banking causes many firms to install new control equipment that results in an over-reduction of emissions. If no air pollution fee is imposed, the trading ratio plays a more important role than the reservation rate for banking in determining the firms' emission reduction strategies under a pure permit trading scheme. While the conclusion from this study that uses a non-uniformly mixed pollutant as an example may hold only when certain conditions are met, the framework can be applied to other uniformly mixed pollutants through parameter changes without any limitation. In addition, the modeling technique presented here offers policy-makers a very convenient approach to empirical analysis.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Econ, Tainan 70101, Taiwan",National Cheng Kung University,"Liao, CN (通讯作者)，Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Econ, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.",cnliao@mail.ncku.edu.tw,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Each market contains different GARCH models, which fit well. From the estimation, we find that the volatility of the return and the jump probability were significantly higher after 27 November 2001. The model introducing GARCH jump effect with normal and Student t-distribution assumption can better fit the volatility characteristics.

However, surprisingly there are not many analyses dealing with the Czech housing market (besides e.g. very brief Financial Stability Report published by the Czech National Bank in 2008) and with the possible housing bubble burst. The first standard bubble indicators like P/I ratio are used to identify the bubble possibility on the Czech housing market. As the second step a regression analysis (VAR model) is being used for deeper analysis of the situation. The whole analysis is complicated by a lack of relevant data and quite short-time series.","[Cadil, Jan] Unicorn Coll, Prague, Czech Republic; [Cadil, Jan] Univ Econ, Prague AS, Prague, Czech Republic; [Cadil, Jan] Soc Gen, Paris, France",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Cadil, J (通讯作者)，Unicorn Coll, Prague, Czech Republic.",,,,,,,,16,20,20,1,8,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

We improve on earlier studies on this topic by addressing the problem of the endogenous aid allocation using GDP levels of donor countries as instruments. A more structural addition to the literature is that we efficiently control for unobserved country specific effects in typical conflict onset and conflict continuation models by first differencing. The literature often overlooks the dynamic nature of these types of models, thereby forcing unlikely i.i.d. structures on the error terms implicitly.(1) As a consequence, malfunctioning institutions, deep-rooted political grievances, or any other obvious, yet unobserved and time persistent determinants of war ate simply assumed away. We find a statistically significant and economically important negative effect of foreign aid such that flows on the probability of ongoing civil conflicts to continue (the continuation probability), increasing aid flows tends to decrease civil conflict duration. We do not find a significant relationship between aid flows and the probability of civil conflicts to start (the onset probability). (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It investigates the extent to which market proximity can explain the evolution of wages, and through which channels. We construct a complete indicator of market access at the provincial level from data on domestic and international trade flows; this is introduced in a simultaneous-equations system to identify the direct and indirect effect of market access on wages. The estimation results for 29 Chinese provinces over 1995-2002 suggest that access to sources of demand is indeed an important factor shaping regional wage dynamics in China. We investigate three channels through which market access might influence wages beside direct transport-cost savings: export performance, and human and physical capital accumulation. A fair share of benefits seems to come from enhanced export performance and greater accumulation of physical capital. The main source of influence of market access remains direct transport costs.

Firms are asked both how many permanent workers they would have hired and how many they would have terminated if labor regulations were made more flexible. I find that making labor regulations more flexible would lead to an average net increase of 2.08 percent in total employment. Firms with fewer than 20 employees would benefit the most, with average gains in net employment of 4.27 percent. Countries with more regulated labor markets would experience larger gains in total employment. These larger gains in total employment, however, would be achieved through higher rates of hiring and higher rates of termination. These results may explain why there is substantial opposition to labor reforms despite the predicted gains in efficiency and total employment. Journal of Comparative Economics 37 (1) (2009) 91-105.

The measure is based on the possibilities of making use of skills on the labour market, which depends on the number of jobs where any particular skill is required. The assumption is that the specificity of human capital depends on the specificity of skills. In order to calculate the levels of specificity of different skills empirically, data from the skill requirements of vacant jobs are used. The validity of this measure is tested by using it as an estimator of the probability that on-the-job training is offered to employees. This article also investigates differences in the specificity of required human capital between different industries and occupations. The proposed job specificity measure can be used for planning public sector support to on-the-job training as companies' decisions to pay for training depend on the specificity of human capital required.","Univ Tartu, Parnu Coll, EE-80010 Parnu, Estonia",University of Tartu,"Leping, KO (通讯作者)，Univ Tartu, Parnu Coll, 35 Ringi, EE-80010 Parnu, Estonia.",leping@pc.ut.ee,,,,,,,22,4,5,1,10,EUROBALTIC CENTRES EXCELLENCE,RIGA,"RAINA BLVD 19, RIGA, LV-1586, LATVIA",,,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

Additionally, a conventional random-variance framework, the MVGARCH (multivariate GARCH) model, in which a time-varying technique is involved is employed and subjected to comparative analysis. The empirical results are consistent with the following notions: First, as being consistent with a study conducted by Ramchand and Susmel the US-EM market correlations are higher when the US market is more volatile. However, this study further indicates that the US-EM market correlations increase relatively more when both the US and EM markets simultaneously experience a high variance condition. Moreover, the situation of both the US and EM stock markets at a high volatility state is associated with a minimum risk reduction benefit and a maximum cross-market correlation. Second, the state-varying portfolio loadings established by the MVSWARCH model could effectively enhance asset allocation effectiveness; however, this benefit arises more as a result of risk reduction than an increase in mean returns.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Grad Inst Finance & Banking, Tainan 70101, Taiwan",National Cheng Kung University,"Li, MYL (通讯作者)，Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Grad Inst Finance & Banking, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.",lmyleon@mail.ncku.edu.tw,"Li, Leon/H-9013-2016","Li, Leon/0000-0002-2865-6568",,,,,38,5,5,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

We find no asymmetric volatility relative to world markets in China. Contrary to the global trend of increasing cross-country correlations, we find stationary correlations for China.

The inflow amounted to 11% of the Slovak GDP, the outflow from the Czech Lands represented 4% of their GDP. The Slovak GDP per capita reached around three quarters of the Czech one in 1992. After the split of Czechoslovakia, the economic policy adjusted to the changed conditions by sinking real wages and depreciation of Slovak koruna, so that the Slovak ULC are the lowest among the Central European countries now. The cost competitiveness, accompanied by an abundant inflow of FDI and economic reforms after the EU accession helped to speed the real convergence. As a result, the Slovak GDP per capita reached 84% of the Czech one in 2007. The balance of costs and benefits of the euro adoption varies due to different conditions in the succession states and to a certain extent justifies the more rapid advancement to the single currency in Slovakia.

Starting from a theoretically well-founded general-equilibrium framework, where specialization depends on relative factor endowments and technological differences, we study the possible additional effect of labor unions. Using country-year panel data, we obtain that they are an important determinant of relative economic performance for a sample of manufacturing sectors. In particular low wages-labor-intensive industries turn out to be relatively disadvantaged, while high wages-capital-intensive sectors are relatively advantaged by stronger labor unions. We also allow for different institutional scenarios, letting unionization patterns interact with different regimes of bargaining coordination and social security systems.

The evolution of the social protection concept in Europe, the reforms implemented in the most important domains of social protection: pensions, health and employment are analyzed. A common philosophy clearly appears. The welfare State is receding, calling more and more upon market mechanisms. Furthermore, the traditional binary typology is changing and countries are becoming more similar in their financing methods. We can thus say that a process of social convergence seems well and truly underway in the European Union.","[Attia, Nicole; Berenger, Valerie] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, CEMAFI, Ctr Etudes Macroecon & Finance Int, Nice, France",Universite Cote d'Azur,"Attia, N (通讯作者)，Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, CEMAFI, Ctr Etudes Macroecon & Finance Int, Nice, France.",attia@unice.fr; berenger@unice.fr,,,,,,,21,8,8,0,7,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2009,56.0,1,,,,,3,19,,10.2298/PAN0901003A,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,434CQ,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000265253200001,0

Empirical evidence suggests that tips are hardly affected by service quality. Nevertheless, rankings of service quality by customers are very high; the co-existence of these two findings is denoted 'the tipping - service puzzle,' and several possible explanations for it are offered.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Business Adm, Guilford Glazer Sch Business & Management, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben Gurion University,"Azar, OH (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Business Adm, Guilford Glazer Sch Business & Management, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",azar@som.bgu.ac.il,"AZAR, OFER H/F-1666-2012","AZAR, OFER H/0000-0003-0154-327X",,,,,52,29,36,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this way, Spain infrastructure policy provides a useful policymaking field to test hypothesis about the behaviour of policy makers.

The completion time and project cost are analyzed in most cases. Additionally, the risk related to the criteria has to be taken into account as well. Thus, project planning problem can be defined as a multicriteria decision problem under risk. In this paper, a project scheduling problem including time-cost trade-offs is analyzed. We assume that various resource allocations can be considered. A new technique based on computer simulation and interactive approach is proposed. In the first step, simulation experiments are performed to evaluate decision alternatives with respect to the criteria. An interactive technique INSDECM is employed for generating the final solution of the problem. The procedure uses stochastic dominance rules for comparing decision alternatives with respect to the criteria. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the applicability of the technique.","[Blaszczyk, Tomasz; Nowak, Maciej] Karol Adamiecki Univ Econ, Dept Operat Res, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Nowak, M (通讯作者)，Karol Adamiecki Univ Econ, Dept Operat Res, Ul 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",nomac@ae.katowice.pl,,,,,,,27,20,22,0,5,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The focus of the analysis is on the effect of a wide variety of game-day promotions on attendance on a game-by-game basis, rather than aggregate attendance during the season. The Ordinary Least Square (OLS) results imply that attendance is positively a function of per capita income in the city or county hosting the team, runs scored by the home team, Friday and Saturday games, and promotions that provide cost-reduced food or beverages, low- and high-value merchandise and post-game fireworks. Attendance is negatively a function of home team errors, Monday games and possibly rainy conditions during the game. An unusual finding with respect to minor league baseball is that team performance variables affect attendance. However, home team runs scored and home team errors contribute to the overall entertainment experience for the home team fans, and thus yield plausible effects on attendance.","[Cebula, Richard J.; Toma, Michael; Carmichael, Jay] Armstrong Atlantic State Univ, Dept Econ, Savannah, GA 31419 USA",University System of Georgia; Armstrong Atlantic State University,"Toma, M (通讯作者)，Armstrong Atlantic State Univ, Dept Econ, Savannah, GA 31419 USA.",michael.toma@armstrong.edu,"Cebula, Richard J/P-7535-2018",,,,,,17,21,27,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We show that dynastic prevalence in the Congress of the U.S. is high compared to that in other occupations and that political dynasties do not merely reflect permanent differences in family characteristics.

The economic, financial and social activity carried on under crisis or economic growth conditions registered year by year a development of the products and instruments in use. The complexity of the economic area may be simplified through techniques of multi-dimensional analysis. Such a method is the analysis of the principal components which allows the decreasing of the initial causal space dimension generated by the functional links which are established among the initial explanatory variables. The dimension of this space is determined by the number of explanatory variables identified as causes of the economic phenomenon and the higher their number, the more difficult it is to analyze the initial causal space because the information volume, the complexity of calculations, the risk not to identify the contribution of each variable to the creation of the initial causal space variability and the decrease in the initial variables significance in case they would be inter-correlated grow. The simplification of the initial causal space means the determination of a change which consists in transition from a space with a large number of variables to another one of fewer dimensions, equivalent but on the conditions of keeping maximum information from the initial space and maximizing the variability of the new space (called principal space). Variables from the principal space represent the principal components, they are un-correlated and the vectors which define them have a unitary length.","[Dedu, Vasile; Armeanu, Daniel; Enciu, Adrian] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dedu, V (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",,"Armeanu, Dan/N-9365-2018",,,,,,8,2,2,0,7,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Basically, this is the question that by means of a personal survey structured as a budget game has been asked to a sample of 519 people around all the Spanish territory in order to infer their expenditure priorities. The Welfare Projects (in Spanish, Obra Social) is the main distinctive feature of the Spanish savings banks with respect to the rest of financial entities. That is why, it is so important analyzing to what extent the expenditure carried out by those entities in WP matches social preferences. First of all, from the results of the survey we infer a very intense demand for all those expenditure categories within the area so-called social and health assistance, followed by those related with research and education. Regarding this, by means of a simple econometric analysis, we have been able to show that the savings banks have internalized that social demand and so adjust their expenditure policy at the same speed that the citizenship demands. Second, the database obtained from the survey has permitted us carrying out a regression analysis in order to determine the patterns of social demand with respect to the WP. The results of the analysis show that variables like being customer of a savings bank, age, education level, income or the geographical area of residence have a significant impact on the social preferences expressed by the surveyed population.","[Esteller-More, Alejandro] Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Esteller-Moré, A (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain.",aesteller@ub.edu,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,2,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,2386-4176,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2009,,191,,,,,43,72,,,,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,V17YO,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000207972700004,0

A drawback is that devolved public spending may be subject to irresistible upward pressure, as illustrated by 'formula drift' of the United Kingdom devolved administrations. By crowding out the private sector such public spending can exacerbate the problem it was originally intended to alleviate. When taxpayers do not value increases in government output at least as highly as the private goods and services they must forgo to finance them, then the public sector is too large. This article estimates a three sector Hecksher-Ohlin model of the economy with the greatest relative rise of the public spending ratio in the United Kingdom, Wales. Simulation of the model shows a net gain in employment from a 1% cut in income tax matched by a corresponding reduction in government spending.

It is based on the assumption that consumers belong to the same network if they buy products exhibiting close characteristics. Thus, the network has two characteristics: its intensity and its selectivity. The higher the network intensity, the more positively affected the consumer is by the network size. The network selectivity corresponds to how close the products' characteristics should be to be perceived by consumers as compatible. The closer two compatible products are in the product space, the more selective the network. We analyze the strategic behavior in terms of prices and qualities of two firms: an incumbent and a potential entrant. By choosing its quality the entrant chooses at the same time to be compatible or not. We show that if the network intensity is moderate, it is always profitable for the entrant to enter the market. In this case the entrant is compatible with the incumbent when the network is not very selective and is incompatible when the network is selective. If the network intensity is strong, we prove that it acts as a barrier to entry under incompatibility. The equilibrium outcomes in this case are either no entry or compatible.","[Ghazzai, Hend] Univ Qatar, Qatar, Iraq; [Lahmandi-Ayed, Rim] ESSAI & LEGI Ecole Polytech Tunisie, La Marsa, Tunisia",,"Ghazzai, H (通讯作者)，Univ Qatar, Qatar, Iraq.",hend.ghazzai@qu.edu.qa; rim_lahmandi@yahoo.com,"Lahmandi-Ayed, Rim/J-7482-2019","Lahmandi-Ayed, Rim/0000-0002-6427-4778",,,,,16,3,3,0,4,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

The FOREX market will be efficient if fully reflects all available information. If this holds, the actual exchange rate will not deviate significantly from its equilibrium rate. Moreover, the spot rate should deviate from its equilibrium rate by only transitory components (i.e. it should follow a white noise process). This test is applied to three Central and Eastern European Countries - members of the EU. Considering an LSTAR model we find no evidence of nonlinear adjustment in the misalignment series. So, linear unit root tests imply that the Poland/Euro FOREX market is efficient, the Czech/Euro FOREX market is not, while the Slovak/Euro FOREX market is quasi-efficient. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The strength of the connections between the system's elements and their groups is not uniform. In some cases, we can observe the links very clearly, in other cases, we assume that they exist, while, sometimes, we are not even aware Of their existence. The existence of the connections of various strength shows that the particular elements are of different nature and possess some specific features and capacity allowing them to interact with others and form the particular structures when the same goal is pursued These structures differ from others and make the systems of a particular level. Therefore, the elements relevant for the considered problem should be identified (or formed if an artificial system is considered). In other words, we should identify or form a system for solving an arising problem. Another important aspect of investigating an existing or specially formed system is associated with its reflection. To change or to manage a social economic system, for example, the state of an enterprise should be measured. This may be achieved only if all major aspects of its performance are described by the particular criteria. The values of the criteria allow us to plan the measures to be taken for improving enterprise performance. The analysis of the literature shows that we can hardly find a generally accepted concept and definition of the word 'system'. However, a lot of various definitions are suggested This may be explained by the fact that either various features of the system are emphasized, or not all relevant features are considered In some cases, a definition includes too many features, often duplicating each other. Some researchers base themselves on a very wide 'system's' definition, while others prefer a short one, embracing its essential features. Various approaches depend on the research objective, 'system's' perception, and, finally, the researcher's ability to see the essential features and understand the nature of the considered phenomenon. In terms of the research objective, investigators usually search for a versatile 'system's' definition, while others prefer a short one, embracing its essential features. Various approaches depend on the research objective, 'system's' perception, and, finally, on the researcher's ability to see the essential features and understand the nature of the considered phenomenon. In terms of the research objective, investigators usually search for a versatile system's definition suitable for studying any phenomenon at any investigation level. However, they also may try to find a multifunctional approach, giving the priority to general features of the system, rather than to its basic, principal characteristics, thereby restricting themselves to a 'narrow' definition suitable for solving a particular problem and achieving a particular goal. The latter approach makes sense only if it does not contradict a universal system's concept and definition. This means that a universal concept and definition of the word 'system', which could be used as a basis for possible interpretations should be developed The analysis of the available 'system's' definitions allows us to suggest the following basic definition - a system is the structured whole of interacting elements. A basic category of the theory of systems is structure, which marks the beginning of system's stabilization. However, we can see that a generally accepted definition of the concept 'structure' is also lacking. On the other hand, all definitions emphasize the same, probably, most essential, structure's feature - the connections between the elements. In addition, the existence of the system and structure representing it is closely connected to the aim (purpose). of the system. It is the structure that orients the system to pursuing a particular aim. In mathematical terms, the establishing of invariable relations between the elements is necessary but insufficient for system formation. These relations should be properly directed, i.e. oriented to achieving the system's aim. This may be obtained only by establishing hierarchical relations between the interacting elements, i.e. by structuring the elements according to the type of their subordination. It is the process of structuring of a set of interacting elements that gives them a particular orientation and turns them into a system. The analysis of various 'structure's' definitions allows us to define it as a whole of constant relations between the elements oriented to achieving the system's aim. Now, when the concepts of system and structure are clear, it is possible to investigate them. Classification, i.e. their subdivision into separate groups, is an efficient tool in this process. The analysis of the literature on the problem shows that, in various system's classifications, various attributes are considered For the case investigated in the present paper, system's classification into actual (material) and theoretical (abstract) systems is relevant. The first class embraces the systems of organic and inorganic nature, while the second includes hypotheses, theories, formalized models, etc. In fact, the latter maybe deduced from the former. Therefore, they are aimed at reflecting actual (material) systems. Thus, it may be stated that theoretical (abstract) systems are the models of actual (material) systems. The following steps may be identified in the process of reflecting actual (material) systems by theoretical (abstract) models. First, the problem situation associated with the actual (material) system is described, then, the problem and the aim of its solution are stated The existence of the reflected system's problem situation, the problem and the aim of its solution determine the problem situation, the problem and the aim of the reflecting model.","Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Ginevicius, R (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Av 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",romualdas.ginevicius@adm.vgtu.lt,,,,,,,44,5,5,0,5,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

To solve such complicated problems, multicriteria evaluation methods have been recently used, which could take into consideration the major aspects of economic and social development of the regions, including the environmental problems, as well as multidimensional character of the criteria, different directions of their changing and significances. Quantitative evaluation of social and economic region's development allows us to determine the changes, taking place in this development.

The exact cause of economic bubbles has been analyzed by many economists. The article discusses with different theories explaining the causes of bubbles formation and presents the possibilities to apply Logistic function for prediction of bubbles enabling to take preventive measures against bubbles creation. Some economists think that bubbles are related to inflation and therefore believe that the factors causing inflation could also be the same factors that cause bubbles to occur. Other economists think that there is a basic fundamental value to every asset and the bubbles represent an increase or rise over that fundamental value. There are also chaotic theories regarding the formation of bubbles. These theories argue that bubbles come from certain critical states on the market that originate from the communication of economic players. The aim of the article is to present a new theory explaining formation of economic bubbles based on Logistic growth models encountering the limited (financial, natural, physical, human etc.) capital resources.","[Girdzijauskas, Stasys; Streimikiene, Dalia; Moskaliova, Vera; Jurkonyte, Edita; Mackevicius, Ramunas] Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Cepinskis, Jonas] Vytautas Magnus Univ, LT-44248 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vilnius University; Vytautas Magnus University,"Moskaliova, V (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Muitines G 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",vera.moskaliova@vukhf.lt,"Streimikiene, Dalia/AAF-2180-2020; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020","Streimikiene, Dalia/0000-0002-3247-9912;",,,,,23,23,28,0,18,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Both periods I and II indicate that the spot prices in general are higher than futures prices as was well-known in the literature. Only period-III (2001/9/11-2007/4/30) displays a reverse phenomenon: futures prices, in general, exceed spot prices. When the absolute value of a basis (futures-spot) is greater than the threshold value in the arbitrage area (regime 1 and 3), at least one of the error correction coefficients, representing adjustment towards equilibrium, is statistically significant. That is, there exists a tendency in the oil market in which prices move toward equilibrium. With respect to the short-run dynamic interaction between spot price change (Delta s(t)) and futures price change (Delta f(t)), our results indicate that when the spot price is higher than futures price, and the basis is less than certain threshold value (regime 3), there exists at least one causal relationship between Delta s(t) and Delta f(t). Conversely, when the futures price is higher than spot price and the basis is higher than certain threshold value (regime 1), there exists at least one causal relationship between Delta s(t) and Delta f(t). Finally, we use the method suggested by Diebold and Mariano [Diebold, Francis X., Mariano, Roberto S., 1995. Comparing predictive accuracy. journal of Business and Economic Statistics 13 (3), 253-263] to compare the predictive power between the linear and nonlinear models.

Information disseminates efficiently among the four markets concerned. The U.S. futures market dominates as the center for price discovery. The U.K. futures market comes as the second. The spot markets in the U.S. and U.K. are less efficient than their corresponding futures market, where the U.K. spot market contributes the least and almost zero to the price discovery process. Asymmetric volatility spillovers are found in three of the four markets. Volatility in the U.S. futures market increases with positive returns which illustrates the inverse leverage effect in most of the commodity market.

In contrast to the extant literature, these simulations show that estimated generalized least squares with first- and second-order autoregressive structures do not offer material improvement over ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. A first-order moving average structure also does not offer material improvement. These simulations also show that test statistics that are robust with regard to cross-sectional heteroskedasticity are essential for testing the hypothesis that the cross-sectional mean cumulative abnormal log turnover is zero.","Univ N Texas, Denton, TX 76203 USA",University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton,"Karafiath, I (通讯作者)，Univ N Texas, POB 305339, Denton, TX 76203 USA.",karafiat@unt.edu,,,,,,,18,7,9,2,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The second model suggests that institutions governing the public sector should be emphasized.

Agents use simple forecasting rules based on a restricted information set. They learn about the parameters and performance of different models and can switch between forecasting rules. We compute the implied US-UK post-Bretton Woods exchange rate and show that the excess volatility of the exchange rate return can be reproduced with low values of the learning gain. Both assumptions, misspecification and learning, are necessary to generate this result. However, the implied correlations with the fundamentals are higher than in the data.

Ultimately, its scope is to offer support for the rationale behind of an idea: GARCH is the most appropriate model to use when one has to evaluate the volatility of the returns of groups of stocks with large amounts (thousands) of observations. The appropriateness of the model is seen through a unidirectional perspective of the quality of volatility forecast provided by GARCH when compared to any other alternative model, without considering any cost component.","[Matei, Marius] ESADE Business Sch, Dept Finance, Barcelona, Spain; [Matei, Marius] Romanian Acad, Natl Inst Econ Res, Bucharest, Romania",Universitat Ramon Llull; Escuela Superior de Administracion y Direccion de Empresas (ESADE); Romanian Academy of Sciences; National Institute for Economic Research Costin C.

The relationship between FDI and the privatisation process is complex.

Following the portfolio model proposed by Baum et al.

The econometric results confirm that macroeconomic uncertainty is a significant determinant of banks' investment decisions, also after controlling for other factors. In periods of increasing turmoil, banks' ability to accurately forecast future returns is hindered and herding behaviour tends to emerge, as witnessed by the reduction of the cross-sectional variance of the share of loans held in portfolio.","Banca d'Italia, Banking & Financial Supervis, Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Quagliariello, M (通讯作者)，Banca d'Italia, Banking & Financial Supervis, Rome, Italy.",mario.quagliariello@bancaditalia.it,,,,,,,29,26,29,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This study uses the hedonic technique to measure the amenity value of the climate to German households. Evidence suggests that the amenity value of climate variables is capitalized mainly into hedonic house price differentials. Overall, German households appear to prefer warmer winters with less rainfall. Combining estimates of amenity values with the predicted changes in climate associated with the IPCCs A2 emissions scenario we find that the overall impact of climate change on German households, whilst negative, is typically not statistically different from zero. This occurs in part because the prediction is for warmer but wetter winters and also because the amenity value of some climate variables cannot be measured with sufficient precision.","[Rehdanz, Katrin; Maddison, David] Univ Hamburg, Res Unit Sustainabil & Global Change, Hamburg, Germany; [Rehdanz, Katrin; Maddison, David] Ctr Marine & Atmospher Sci, Hamburg, Germany; [Maddison, David] Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Hamburg; University of Birmingham,"Rehdanz, K (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Res Unit Sustainabil & Global Change, Hamburg, Germany.",d.j.maddison@bham.ac.uk,,"Rehdanz, Katrin/0000-0002-5336-0582",,,,,33,25,28,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Recognizing the intersectoral linkages in the economy, the competitive general equilibrium prices are computed; these signal the productivities. Our model synthesizes frontier analysis with the general equilibrium approach to generate shadow prices. The formal activities are found to be more productive than the informal. However, the informal services sector is as efficient as the formal one. There would be an overall productivity gain of 22% to the economy if factors were allocated to productive activities.

In the first place, we concentrate on the recent strategy of systematic undervaluation of one's own currency-figuring prominently among big players such as China- and the most likely implications of such a strategy for domestic allocation, distribution and stabilization goals. On the background of Germany's experiences in 1969, almost on the eve of the Bretton Woods' system collapse, we secondly model a speculative attack on an undervalued currency in the vein of the Flood-Garber seminal paper from 1984. Now, however, the country in concern possesses strong rather than weak fundamentals. We finally propose a sequence of reforms/policies which should be implemented in China on its still long way to an autonomous monetary and a flexible exchange rate with little if any capital controls.

While the wealth effects are quite strong-between 4 and 6 cents-in countries with more developed mortgage markets and in market-based, Anglo-Saxon and non euro area economies, consumption only barely reacts to wealth elsewhere. The effect of housing wealth is somewhat smaller than that of financial wealth for most countries, but not for the U.S. and the UK.

Using data on book purchases collected from an Internet-based survey of two university towns in Northern California, we develop a latent class model with two segments (final N=373). Age turns out to be the only observed determinant of class membership, and in the intention model, the mostly-younger segment is more cost-sensitive and the mostly-older segment appears to be more convenience-sensitive. The results clearly demonstrate the effects on purchase intention of channel-specific perceptions, purchase experience, context and sociodemographics. Comparing the LCM to the unsegmented model and to models deterministically segmented on age indicates that the LCM is slightly better from the statistical perspective, but arguably weaker from the conceptual perspective. However, a model that interacts age with the explanatory variables in the conventional unsegmented model outperforms all the others (though not overwhelmingly so), including the LCM. Thus, our results suggest that using LCM as an initial stage in model exploration allows us to more intelligently specify a model where the taste heterogeneity is (potentially) specified deterministically in the end, which often yields a more parsimonious model, and may in fact fit the data better.","[Tang, Wei (Laura); Mokhtarian, Patricia L.] Univ Calif Davis, Inst Transportat Studies, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Tang, W (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Inst Transportat Studies, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",wtang@ucdavis.edu; plmokhtarian@ucdavis.edu,"Mokhtarian, Patricia/B-3374-2011","Mokhtarian, Patricia/0000-0001-7104-499X",University of California Transportation Center - UC Davis Sustainable Transportation Center,University of California Transportation Center - UC Davis Sustainable Transportation Center,"Data collection was funded by the University of California Transportation Center; the present analysis is funded by the UC Davis Sustainable Transportation Center.

We detail the conditions under which aggregate demand is consistently estimated when heterogeneity in product assortment is ignored. The required assumptions are quite strict and likely violated in many empirical applications. Even when they hold, however, a problem of inference arises. One cannot tell whether a lack of interaction between two products is due to limited substitution in those stores where both are available or because many stores do not carry both products.

Contrary to existing conventional wisdom, the results indicate a conflict between the two policy objectives: the choice of no stabilisation, associated with maximum growth, is also associated with minimum welfare.

The core of EIOA is an input-output table (IOT) and national accounting matrix including environmental accounts (NAMEA) for a fixed base-year. We evaluate the uncertainty in EIOA using a time series of current-price IOT and NAMEA for 13 years from 1990 to 2002. We find annual variations in the current-price IOT and NAMEA, which may represent either realistic changes in production or measurement error. We assume the changes are errors and apply a regression analysis to remove the trends from the underlying data and estimate the uncertainty in the raw IOT. We then calculate the emissions for various final users and sectors to estimate the uncertainties from typical EIOA investigations. Using Monte Carlo analysis, we then investigate how well the variations in the current-price IOT and NAMEA over time may represent uncertainties. The results of this work have several implications for both statistical offices and the analyst. Statistical offices can provide details on data sources, methodologies, and estimates of annual variations. Analysts can incorporate this uncertainty information to understand the implications of uncertainty on their calculations and ultimately the policy recommendations derived from their studies.","[Peters, Glen P.] CICERO, Oslo, Norway; [Yamakawa, Asuka] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ind Ecol Programme, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Peters, GP (通讯作者)，CICERO, Oslo, Norway.",glen.peters@cicero.uio.no,"Peters, Glen P/B-1012-2008","Peters, Glen P/0000-0001-7889-8568",,,,,18,13,13,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

It first combines the literature on economic transition of the urban labour market with Chinese experience of systemic transformation to contribute to a conceptual understanding of informal urbanisation. It demonstrates that it is both the legacy and new configurations of the Chinese reformed socialist system that have created the 'exclusive' and therefore informal feature of urbanisation under the economic and systemic transitions. On that basis, the article explores the extent of China's informal urbanisation, which is decomposed into demographic, employment and habitat dimensions. This shows that informality represents a constituent part of urbanisation in China. By systematically exploring the special features of China's informal urbanisation, the article also contributes to the growing body of research that emphasises the Chinese urbanisation as a unique process in studying space-economy.","Fudan Univ, Sch Social Dev & Publ Policy, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Fudan University,"Zhang, L (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Sch Social Dev & Publ Policy, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",lizhangfudan@gmail.com,"Zhang, Li/IQU-9135-2023","Zhang, Li/0000-0002-3109-2257",,,,,73,7,8,1,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2009,21.0,2,,,,,203,225,PII 911729179,10.1080/14631370902778583,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,494DQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000269790300006,0

To this end, we use administrative data on earnings for every male Norwegian over the period 1967-2000. We find that the substantial rise in earnings inequality over the 1980s and into the early 1990s, is to some extent driven by the fact that the large baby boom cohorts are approaching the peak of the age-earnings profile. We further demonstrate that the impact of age-adjustments on the trend in inequality during the period 1993-2000 is highly sensitive to the method used: While the most widely used age-adjusted inequality measure indicates little change in inequality over this period, a new and improved age-adjusted measure suggests a decline in inequality.","[Almas, Ingvild] Norwegian Sch Econ & Business Adm, N-5035 Bergen, Norway; [Havnes, Tarjei] Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, Oslo, Norway; [Mogstad, Magne] Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); University of Oslo; Statistics Norway,"Almås, I (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ & Business Adm, N-5035 Bergen, Norway.",ingvild.almas@nhh.no; tarjei.havnes@econ.uio.no; magne.mogstad@ssb.no,,,,,,,28,10,11,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

Surprisingly, even if the government is benevolent towards natives only, it is optimal to keep borders open. Indeed, in the long run, patient natives hold the whole stock of capital, while impatient immigrants work. Moreover, since capital intensity is stationary, capital per native, consumption and the public good increase with the number of (immigrant) workers. This positive effect offsets the disutility deriving from the congestion of the public good. However, when we account for the costs associated with cultural heterogeneity, we find that it is optimal to regulate immigration inflows.

First, we find that wages in all non-agricultural sectors, wages of migrant workers, and wages of hired workers in the agricultural sector have increased dramatically since 2003. Second, through comparing wage differentials between migrant and urban resident workers and between heterogeneous education groups within migrant workers, and by investigating the changes in the contribution of the returns to education to wage differentials, we find that the wages of unskilled and skilled workers have converged. Both the increasing wage trends and wage convergence are interpreted as evidence supporting the hypothesis that China has passed what can be called the Lewis turning point in the industrial sector.

The effect of current return of Shanghai on New York also becomes significantly positive and increasing after 2002.

This ordinal approach borrows recent ideas on the way to compare opportunity sets, that is, to rank matrices giving, for example, the distribution of individuals by level of education of their parents and the standard of living (income) of the group to which they belong. Such comparisons are based on the use of the concepts of rank and Generalized Lorenz Dominance. The empirical illustration is based on the data of the 2006 Latinobarometro survey which covered 18 Latin American countries and the standard of living of individuals (children) was derived from an algorithm allowing one to compute the order of acquisition of durable goods and access to services.","[Deutsch, Joseph; Silber, Jacques] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel",Bar Ilan University,"Silber, J (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel.",jdeutsch@biu.ac.il; jsilber_2000@yahoo.com,,,,,,,40,1,1,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

For estimation we utilize a reasonably new class of models, smooth coefficient models, taking advantage of their flexibility to allow the response of high-tech job growth to be nonlinear with respect to the level of natural amenities. Our results show that amenities are not an important driver for high-technology employment growth.

The conditions for real determinacy are examined for two measures of inflation that central banks' can target in open economies: domestic vs consumer price inflation. In stark contrast to previous studies, in the presence of investment activity monetary policy that targets domestic price inflation is more susceptible to self-fulfilling fluctuations than monetary policy rules that target consumer price inflation. However, the problem of indeterminacy identified under domestic price inflation can be ameliorated provided the policy rule also responds to either the exchange rate or to output.","Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudios Econ, Mexico City 10740, DF, Mexico",Colegio de Mexico,"McKnight, S (通讯作者)，Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudios Econ, Camino Ajusco 20, Mexico City 10740, DF, Mexico.",smckni@hotmail.com,"McKnight, Stephen/AAH-1560-2020","McKnight, Stephen/0000-0003-0669-1511",,,,,33,4,4,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

First, we expect that increasing the number of police will reduce crime, regardless of its type (i.e. whether referring to total crime, violent crime or larceny). Second, crime rates are generally lower in prefectures where a low-skilled individual can find a job more easily. Third, the effects of wages for low-skilled workers on crime, especially larceny, are significantly negative, whereas average wages in a prefecture do not appear to affect crime. Fourth, the prefectures with lower educational standards are expected to suffer more crime than other prefectures.

The case of the sloping land conversion program in China,CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,General trust; Kinship trust; Land property right; Public goods; Land conversion; China,ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; POLICY,"Trust and property rights are generally considered to influence farmers' behavior regarding resource use and environmental management. Previous studies show that higher trust levels may enhance contributions to public goods. This paper investigates how trust and (land) property rights security influence the provision of one concrete public good: land protection through the Sloping Land Conservation Program in China. The analysis is based on household survey data from Ningxia Autonomous Region in China. From our questionnaire two trust factors are derived and distinguished, using factor analysis: general trust and kinship trust. Farm households are less likely to contribute to public goods when they perceive more secure land rights, but trust has mixed effects on public goods. The results show that general trust and kinship trust may rely on two opposite effects for influencing public goods provision. On the one hand, high levels of general trust may directly enhance people's willingness to provide contributions to public goods (by reduced likelihood to reconvert forest land) when farmers are aware of the positive environmental effects of the program, that's the public goods effect. On the other hand, general trust may also make it more likely that people invest more in their own private goods to pursue their own welfare (a more likely reconversion of forest land to arable land), that's the private goods effect. The final outcome depends on the size and direction of both effects. Compared to general trust, kinship trust is more inward-looking and self- or group-interested compared to more reciprocal general trust. Thus, unlike general trust, kinship trust may have no significant public goods effect on the provisioning of public goods. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The adverse or beneficial effects of internal migration, for sending as well as receiving areas, and the definition of optimal migration policies, have remained much discussed issues since the seminal works of Harris and Todaro (1970). This debate is especially acute in China where the household registration system (hukou) acts as a strong constraint on individual migration. This paper aims to assess the consequences of hukou through a simple model of a developing dual economy with overlapping generations. Contrary to existing studies focused on the contemporaneous allocation of economic resources, it deals with the dynamic consequences of migration flows and migration policies. It shows that, in fairly general circumstances, hukou-related migration constraints can actually hasten development, understood as the transfer of the labor force to the modern sector, driven by capital accumulation. The hukou system could thus be one of the causes of the extremely high Chinese saving rate and of the high pace of Chinese development. Insights from the model are confronted with stylized facts from the Chinese development, and theoretical results are especially consistent with the effects of the 2001 towns and small cities reform.

J,"Wang, XL; Woo, WT",,,,"Wang, Xiaolu; Woo, Wing Thye",,,The Size and Distribution of Hidden Household Income in China,ASIAN ECONOMIC PAPERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Official Chinese data on urban household income are seriously flawed because of significant underreporting of income by respondents and non-participation by the high income groups in official household surveys. We collected urban household income and expenditure data in a way that increased their reliability and the coverage of the wealthy. We utilized the well-known relationship between Engel's coefficient and income level through two different approaches to deduce the true level of household income for each of the seven Chinese income categories (lowest income, low income, lower middle income, middle income, upper middle income, high income, and highest income). We found that the ratio of our estimated income to official income increased from 1.12 for the lowest income group to 3.19 for the highest income group. Total household disposable income in 2008 is RMB 14.0 trillion according to the official data but RMB 23.2 trillion according to our estimate; and 63 percent of the unreported income went to the wealthiest 10 percent of urban households. The income of the wealthiest 10 percent of Chinese households is really 65 times that of the poorest 10 percent instead of the 23 times reported in the official data. The Gini coefficient is clearly much higher than the usually reported figure of 0.47. In one of the estimations, we had to drop the 76 wealthiest households (1.8 percent of our sample) from the analysis because there were no super-rich in the official data for us to match characteristics with. We therefore still understate the income of the highest income households. As the amount of unreported income indicates the degree of corruption, it is troubling that it grew 91 percent in 2005-08 compared to the 71 percent growth in gross national income. Serious institutional reforms must be enacted if corruption is not to derail economic development and social harmony.","[Wang, Xiaolu] China Reform Fdn, Natl Econ Res Inst, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China; [Woo, Wing Thye] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Woo, Wing Thye] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of California System; University of California Davis; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Wang, XL (通讯作者)，China Reform Fdn, Natl Econ Res Inst, C510 Guo Hong Bldg,A-11 Muxidi Beili, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China.",wangxiaolu@neri.org.cn; wtwoo@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,12,43,49,0,11,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

It shows that a conversion of an import-quota into an equivalent voluntary export restraint raises wage-inequality in the country importing the unskilled-labor intensive good and lowers the wage-inequality in its trading partner. This result does not depend on whether the unskilled-labor intensive good or the skilled-labor intensive good was initially subject to an import quota.

All credit allocations make the same contribution to demand, sales and profit flows, and, consequently to the pace of accumulation. Production credit uniquely contributes to investment by borrowers. Consumption credit thus effects a form of leveraging of social capital, boosting profitability while strengthening productive constraints and financial risks bearing on credit relations. Systems with higher allocations of consumption credit experience lower scopes for growth-enhancing credit extension, and face higher aggregate levels of credit risk than comparable economies.","Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Econ, London WC1H 0XG, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"dos Santos, PL (通讯作者)，Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Econ, Thornhaugh St, London WC1H 0XG, England.",ps45@soas.ac.uk,,,,,,,16,13,16,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,NOV,2011,62.0,4,,,,,729,758,,10.1111/j.1467-999X.2011.04139.x,0.0,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,836SR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000296132000011,0

Using a Hotelling framework, this paper analyses the effect of heterogeneous objectives of hospitals on quality differentiation, profits and overall welfare in a price-regulated duopoly with exogenous symmetric locations. In contrast to other studies on mixed duopolies, this paper shows that, in this framework, privatization of the public hospital may increase overall welfare. This holds if the public hospital is similar to the private hospital or less efficient and competition is low. The main driving force is the single-regulated price which induces under-provision (over-provision) of quality of the more (less) efficient hospital compared with the first best. However, if the public hospital is sufficiently more efficient and competition is fierce, a mixed duopoly outperforms both a private and a public duopoly due to an equilibrium price below (above) the price of the private (public) duopoly. This medium price discourages over-provision of quality of the less efficient hospital and - together with the non-profit objective - encourages an increase in quality of the more efficient public hospital.","[Herr, Annika] Univ Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf Inst Competit Econ, Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Herr, Annika] Ruhr Grad Sch Econ, Dortmund, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf,"Herr, A (通讯作者)，Univ Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf Inst Competit Econ, Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Univ Str 1, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.",annika.herr@dice.uni-duesseldorf.de,,"Herr, Annika/0000-0001-5479-0093",,,,,38,25,32,3,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

Forecasts are conducted using a state-space oil market model, in which global real economic activity and real oil prices share a common stochastic trend. Changes in unanticipated fluctuations and changes in the forecasted long-term average of discounted real oil prices sum to real oil price changes. We find that these two components have distinctly different relationships with future real GDP growth. Positive and negative changes in the unanticipated fluctuations of real oil prices correlate with asymmetric responses of future real GDP growth. In comparison, changes in the forecasted long-term average are smaller in magnitude but are more influential on real GDP. Persistent upward revisions of forecasts in the 2000s had a substantial negative impact on real GDP growth, according to our estimates.","[Miller, J.

An application to Scandinavian countries shows that poverty lines based on non-correlation between the income sources imply serious risks of underestimation of the contribution levels of the different components of the global poverty growth. The main contribution of our paper is to pay particular attention to the poverty growth and its source components in order to avoid underestimation of poverty growth. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The implications of these policies for optimal investment behavior are investigated through an extension of the real options framework that allows for the consideration of volatility in both revenue and cost components, as well as the correlation between them. The effects of policy affecting plant revenues dominate the effects of those policies affecting production costs. In the absence of these policies, much of the recent expansionary periods would have not existed and market conditions in the late-1990s would have led to some plant closures. We also show that, regardless of plant size, U.S. ethanol policy has narrowed the distance between the optimal entry and exit curves, implying a more narrow range of inactivity and indicative of a more volatile evolution for the industry than would have existed otherwise.

It uses as a proxy of historical inequality the distribution of land at the time of the Agrarian Reform, and as a proxy for current distribution the number of cattle held by individuals. Possible hypotheses of factors affecting the distribution are pre-colonial population densities, differing eligibility rules through the course of the Agrarian Reform, and geography. Decomposition of the inequality measures shows that land inequality is much higher between than within ejidos, with the opposite being true for cattle inequality. Higher pre-colonial population densities are shown to decrease the average amount of private land and of cattle held by ejido members, and to decrease within ejido-land inequality while they increase within-ejido cattle inequality. Ejidos formed during the early period of the reform have significantly larger land endowments, and much greater inequality within them currently. Finally, geography is an important determinant of both land and cattle distribution within and between ejidos, even while controlling for other factors. This suggests roles for both geography and institutions in the determination of the distribution of assets in rural Mexico.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Alix-Garcia, J (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",alixgarcia@wisc.edu,"Alix-Garcia, Jennifer/W-1762-2019","Alix-Garcia, Jennifer/0000-0003-0200-0496",,,,,23,3,4,0,8,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC ECONOMIA",MEXICO,"CIRCUITO INTERIOR S-N EDIFICIO B, PRIMER PISO, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO, DISTRITO FEDERAL 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

Moreover, we wonder what can be gained by invoking the abstract principles of Generalized Darwinism given that they do not suffice to substantiate an explanation of actual evolutionary processes. To that end, specific hypotheses are required. They neither follow from the suggested abstract principles, nor are they more easily found on that basis.

Our economy features heterogeneous households who differ in their preferences and permanent labor productivities, but it does not have idiosyncratic risk. We find that increases in the progressivity of the tax schedule are associated with long-run distributions with greater aggregate income, wealth, and labor input. Average hours generally declines as the tax schedule becomes more progressive implying that the economy substitutes away from less-productive workers toward more-productive workers. Finally, as progressivity increases, income inequality is reduced and wealth inequality rises. Many of these results are qualitatively different than those found in models with idiosyncratic risk, and therefore suggest closer attention should be paid to modeling the insurance opportunities of households.

This paper shows that, compared with many uncertainty proxies produced by time series models, the use of real-time data with fixed-sample recursive estimation of an asymmetric bivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model yields inflation uncertainty estimates which resemble the survey measure. There is, however, overwhelming evidence that many of the time series measures of growth uncertainty exceed the level of uncertainty obtained from survey measure.

One hypothesized cause of peer group effects is social interaction effects: an individual's utility from an action is enhanced by others taking the same action. We employ a series of controlled laboratory experiments to study the causes of peer effects in choice under uncertainty. We find strong peer group effects in the laboratory. Our design allows us to rule out social learning, social norms, group affiliation, and complementarities as possible causes for the observed peer group effects, leaving social interaction effects as the likely cause. We use a combination of theory and empirical analysis to show that preferences including social regret are more consistent with the data than preferences including a taste for conformity. We observe spillover effects, as observing another's choice of one risky gamble makes all risky gambles more likely to be chosen. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Unique features of China's processing trade cause both identification of imported inputs and their allocation across sectors to vary by trade regime. This paper estimates the VS of Chinese merchandise exports, addressing these two challenges. A new method to identify Chinese imported inputs is developed, and used to calculate VS by sector and destination. VS estimates based on the official Chinese input-output table are contrasted with those based on a split table, capturing processing and normal exports separately. Last, the paper tests whether Chinese export sophistication can be explained by VS.","[Dean, Judith M.] Brandeis Univ, Waltham, MA 02153 USA; [Fung, K.

The tradeoff between increasing returns in the provision of public goods and the costs of greater cultural heterogeneity mediates agents' preferences over different geographical configurations, thus determining the likelihood of secessions and unions. After calibrating the model to Europe, we identify the regions prone to secession and the countries most likely to merge. We then estimate the implied monetary gains from EU membership. As a test of the theory, we show that the model can account for the breakup of Yugoslavia and the dynamics of its disintegration. We find that economic differences between the Yugoslav republics determined the order of disintegration, but cultural differences, though small, were key to the country's instability.

The results show that countries that announce a fixed exchange rate regime face lower spreads than countries that announce a floating regime or intermediate flexibility. When the actual exchange rate behavior is considered, this relationship persists between intermediate flexibility and pegs but countries that allow their exchange rates to freely float do not face higher spreads. The difference between the results is due to the fact that many countries deviate from their declared exchange rate policy. The countries that announce a floating regime do not face higher spreads than pegs when they actually allow a high degree of flexibility as they announced. However, intermediate flexibility leads to higher spreads independently of whether this is the announced policy or the actual behavior.","Sabanci Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, TR-34956 Istanbul, Turkey",Sabanci University,"Gumus, I (通讯作者)，Sabanci Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, TR-34956 Istanbul, Turkey.",incigumus@sabanciuniv.edu,"Gumus, Inci/AAY-8597-2020","Gumus, Inci/0000-0003-4667-0109",,,,,22,9,9,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

The development of water sector in Malaysia in terms of coverage has been fairly uneven. Some states have privatized their water supply sector while others have not. The overall finding of this study is that the impact of privatization on access and affordability in the Malaysian water supply sector is ambiguous. Privatization does not seem to have improved access to treated water from network in Malaysia. A likely explanation of this is the role played by the government in the sector in terms of tariff regulation and universal service provision. Furthermore, privatization does not seem to have adversely affected affordability in the sector. In addition to political intervention in tariff regulation, this could be due to the government maintaining a significant stake in privatized water companies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Near-zero US short-term interest rates launch massive hot money outflows into emerging markets (EM) in Asia and Latin America. Each EM central bank buys dollars to prevent its currency from appreciating but loses monetary control. Despite some appreciation, average inflation in EMs is now much higher than in the old industrial economies and world commodity prices are bid up sharply. This inflation on the dollar's periphery only registers in the US CPI with a long lag. However, the more immediate effect of the Fed's zero interest rate is to upset the process of bank intermediation within the American economy. Bank credit continues to decline while employment languishes. Therefore, constructive international monetary reform calls for the Fed to abandon its zero-interest rate policy, which is best done in cooperation with the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Bank of England also abandoning their ultra low interest rates.","[McKinnon, Ronald] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"McKinnon, R (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",mckinnon@stanford.edu,,,,,,,10,1,1,0,22,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,SEP-OCT,2011,19.0,5,,,,,1,16,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2011.01255.x,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,829YZ,,Green Published,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000295624500001,0

The relative price changes in India have tended to be inequality and poverty reducing as confirmed by formal statistical tests. The result is robust to expenditure dependent equivalence scales.

It encompasses an effort to tailor a system of damage and probability (i.e. risk intensity) assessment used by other authors to risk analysis. The analysis performed by using this methodology shows the existence of at least two major energy security risks of intolerable intensity for the Baltic States: dependency on a single energy resources supplier and a wrong (in the terms of transparency, competence and knowledge) decision making process. Neutralization of these two risks or mitigation of the negative consequences caused by these should become the energy security priorities for Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.","Vytautas Magnus Univ, Fac Polit Sci & Diplomacy, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Molis, A (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, Fac Polit Sci & Diplomacy, Gedimino 44, Kaunas, Lithuania.",arunas.molis@gmail.com,,,,,,,30,3,4,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1406-099X,2334-4385,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

The long-memory parameter is estimated using methods based on wavelets, which have gained prominence in recent years. Evidence of long memory in fixed-income return volatility is conclusively demonstrated across a variety of volatility measures and wavelet forms. This finding suggests a pattern of time dependence, which may potentially be exploited to generate improved volatility forecasting performance especially over long horizons. This paper further extends the extant literature by comparing the predictive power of long-memory forecasts with those obtained from a standard (short-memory) generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) process. The results of this exercise suggest that the information content of long-memory models does not lead to improved forecast accuracy. The GARCH(1,1) model is shown to provide the best forecasts across most horizons (i.e. daily, weekly and monthly). Forecast performance is further revealed to be sensitive to the choice of volatility proxy used. Finally, the derived volatility forecasts are generally very close, and in some cases, almost indistinguishable.

Before the 1950s, research in finance was essentially taxonomic and descriptive. It was assumed that finance as an area of study was supposed to describe practical phenomena (stocks, bonds, credit arrangements, etc.). By the 1950s, however, constructs of questionable value replaced the practical wisdom that had developed earlier, and these constructs put blinders on the discipline. The root cause was the reaction to the Gordon and Howell Report and the Pearson Report on business school education, which concluded that finance and business subjects generally were backwater areas of study with little intellectual content. The result was a major change in business school curricula and research methodology. In finance, the consequence has been the development of a facade that has fooled practitioners and helped produce various financial collapses, including the recent collapse of 2008-9.","Rice Univ, Houston, TX 77251 USA",Rice University,"Williams, EE (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Houston, TX 77251 USA.",,,,,,,,27,0,1,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

I then use the framework to reassess the relationship between inequality and redistribution. The model shows that, even though each contribution has a negligible impact, the interaction between contributions and voting leads to an endogenous wealth bias in the political process, as the advantage of wealthier individuals in providing contributions encourages parties to move their platforms closer to those individuals' preferred positions. This mechanism can in turn explain why the standard median-voter-based prediction, that more inequality produces more redistribution, has received little empirical support: higher inequality endogenously shifts the political system further in favor of the rich. In equilibrium, there is a non-monotonic relationship in which redistribution is initially increasing but eventually decreasing in inequality. I present some empirical evidence supporting the framework, using data on campaign contributions from US presidential elections. In particular, inequality increases contributions to Republicans, but not to Democrats, as predicted by the model. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The asset price dynamics are then postulated as the diffusion limit of the corresponding discrete-time error-correction model of cointegrated time series. The problem is completely solved in the sense that solutions of the continuous-time portfolio policy and the efficient frontier are obtained as explicit and closed-form formulas. The analytical results are applied to pairs trading using cointegration techniques. Numerical examples show that identifying a cointegrated pair with a high mean-reversion rate can generate significant statistical arbitrage profits once the current state of the economy sufficiently departs from the long-term equilibrium. We propose an index to simultaneously measure the departure level of a cointegrated pair from equilibrium and the mean-reversion speed based on the mean-variance paradigm. An empirical example is given to illustrate the use of the theory in practice. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

When products are distinguished by a vertical characteristic, those with higher values of that characteristic will command higher prices. We investigate whether, holding the value of the characteristic constant, there is an additional price premium for products on the industry and/or the firm frontier, that is, for the products with the highest value of the characteristic in the market or in a firm's product line. We also investigate the existence of price premia for lower-ranked products and other product line pricing questions. Using personal computer price data, we show that prices decline with the distance from the industry and firmfrontiers, even after holding absolute quality constant. We find evidence that consumer tastes for brands is stronger for the consumers of frontier products (and thus competition between firms weaker in the top end of the market). There is also evidence that a product's price is higher if a firm offers products with the immediately faster and immediately slower computer chip (holding the total number of a firm's offerings constant), possibly as an attempt to reduce cannibalization. Finally, a product's price declines with the time it is offered by a firm, suggesting intertemporal price discrimination.

Self-reported tenure security has been a poor predictor of investment outcomes. Second, I test for a relationship between land tenure and agricultural investment in nine data sets from West Africa.

This fundamental reform has improved the Chinese stock market efficiency.","[Li, Xindan; Zhang, Bing] Nanjing Univ, Sch Management & Engn, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China",Nanjing University,"Zhang, B (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Sch Management & Engn, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China.",zhangbing@nju.edu.cn,"ZHU, BIN/IYJ-3847-2023",,,,,,6,7,8,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

A genuine real-time data set for the euro area is used, including vintages of several sets of euro area output gap estimates available from 1999 to 2010. It turns out that real-time estimates of the output gap tend to be characterised by a high degree of uncertainty, much higher than that resulting from model and estimation uncertainty only. In particular, the evidence indicates that both the magnitude and the sign of the real-time estimates of the euro area output gap are very uncertain. The uncertainty is mostly due to parameter instability and model uncertainty, while data revisions seem to play a minor role. Some euro area real-time measures, based on multivariate components models and capacity utilisation, are relatively less uncertain, but do not appear to be fully reliable along some dimensions. To benchmark our results, we repeat the analysis for the US over the same sample. It turns out that US real-time estimates tend to be revised to a lesser extent than euro area estimates. However, euro area real-time output gap estimates tend to display a higher correlation with the final estimates and the sign of the level of US real-time estimates tends to be revised more often compared to the corresponding euro area estimates. In addition, the data revision component of the revision error is larger for US estimates than for the euro area. Overall, the unreliability in real-time of the US output gap measures detected in earlier studies is confirmed in the more recent period. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The main result of the model is that economies that are more open are associated with a smaller productive public sector. The lower risk associated with more open economies due to risk diversification implies that the government is less inclined to increase the scale of its activity to maximize welfare when productive spending is also volatility-reducing. The empirical evidence based on a sample of 16 OECD countries for the period 1970-2004 broadly supports the main results of the model, even though some results are mixed.","Univ Deusto, Fac CC EE & Empresariales ESTE, Dept Econ, Donostia San Sebastian 20012, Spain",University of Deusto,"Erauskin, I (通讯作者)，Univ Deusto, Fac CC EE & Empresariales ESTE, Dept Econ, Mundaiz S-N, Donostia San Sebastian 20012, Spain.",inaki.erauskin@deusto.es,"Erauskin, Iñaki/P-2475-2019","Erauskin, Iñaki/0000-0002-3449-7372",,,,,36,5,6,0,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

Using forecasts for the short-term interest rate, the inflation rate, and output growth for 10 emerging markets in Latin-America, central and eastern Europe, we estimate expected (ex-ante) Taylor-type rules. We find evidence for significant differences in the expectation formation process in the sense that the well-known Taylor principle fairly holds for only some countries, while for the other countries it does not.

Not more than the position of the Samara umma between the two rival poles of Ufa and Kazan, the presence of these new Muslims has not upset the institutional equilibrium established after 1991 around the regional religious leadership (RDUM-SO). After a short historical account, questions are raised about this situation. The personalization of the mufti's power and the reinforcement of ties with the umma in Russia have maintained a relative unity in the community. In the city of Samara, the ostensible display of the Muslim faith stems from a feeling of a revival of one's sense of identity. Combinations of ethnic and religious references form as a function both of the constraints imposed by the religious policy conducted by federal and regional authorities and of the ability of Muslim communities to adapt to the new context of religious freedom.

The central objective of this paper is to investigate whether exports to the PRC has a significant and positive effect on the GDP of eight developing Asian countries.

When bidders are risk averse, then theoretically a buy price can raise seller revenue when values are private (but not when values are common). We report the results of laboratory experiments designed to determine whether in practice a buy price is advantageous to the seller. We find that a suitably chosen buy price yields a substantial increase in seller revenue when values are private, and a small (but statistically insignificant) increase in revenue when values are common. In both cases a buy price reduces the variance of seller revenue. A behavioral model which incorporates the winner's curse and the overweighting by bidders of their own signal explains the common value auction data better than the rational model.

I discuss, what I call, the Production-Approach to recovering markups. In contrast to the most popular approach in empirical IO, which relies on demand estimation, this approach requires standard production data while allowing for various price-setting models and puts no restrictions on underlying consumer demand. Using production data together with standard cost minimization allows a researcher to obtain markups in a flexible way. After presenting a brief and selective overview of the literature I contrast the production approach to that of the more popular demand estimation approach. This discussion makes it clear that both approaches face important trade-offs and at a minimum empirical economist should have both techniques as part of their toolbox. The hope is that the use of both methods will only depend on the data at hand and the relevant institutional knowledge, paired with the actual research question we are trying to answer.

Colonial currency board systems and non-interventionist government characterised finance in pre-World War II Southeast Asia. There was decisive change after independence to a variety of state-directed, or indeed socialist, attempts to overcome unfavourable pre-war development legacies. Despite these departures, the article finds that throughout Southeast Asian history, finance rarely, if ever, led development. Today, indigenous entrepreneurship, explored for Malaysia, is generally either bolstered by political patrons or even entirely substituted for by state finance. More positively, market-aware state initiatives in microfinance may offer a realistic institutional alternative to rural Southeast Asia's historic reliance on informal finance.","Univ Oxford, Pembroke Coll, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Huff, G (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Pembroke Coll, Oxford, England.",,,,ESRC [ES/G005389/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G005389/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,124,5,5,0,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

Subjects choose between a selfish action, a costly surplus creating action (altruistic behavior) and a costly surplus destroying action (spiteful behavior). While costly surplus creating actions are the most frequent under role uncertainty (64%), selfish actions become the most frequent without role uncertainty (69%). Also, the frequency of surplus destroying choices is negligible with role uncertainty (1%) but not so without it (11%). A classification of subjects into four different types of interdependent preferences (Selfish, Social Welfare maximizing, Inequity Averse and Competitive) shows that the use of role uncertainty overestimates the prevalence of Social Welfare maximizing preferences in the subject population (from 74% with role uncertainty to 21% without it) and underestimates Selfish and Inequity Averse preferences. An additional treatment, in which subjects undertake an understanding test before participating in the experiment with role uncertainty, shows that the vast majority of subjects (93%) correctly understand the payoff mechanism with role uncertainty, but yet surplus creating actions were most frequent. Our results warn against the use of role uncertainty in experiments that aim to measure the prevalence of interdependent preferences.","[Rey-Biel, Pedro] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ & Hist Econ, Bellaterra 08193, Barcelona, Spain; [Iriberri, Nagore] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Empresa, Barcelona 08005, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Pompeu Fabra University,"Rey-Biel, P (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ & Hist Econ, Bellaterra 08193, Barcelona, Spain.",nagore.iriberri@upf.edu; pedro.rey@uab.es,"Iriberri, Nagore/H-5069-2015; Rey-Biel, Pedro/H-6213-2015","Iriberri, Nagore/0000-0002-0317-0115; Rey-Biel, Pedro/0000-0002-1606-2631",,,,,22,46,48,1,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

In this paper, we argue that a failure to recognize the potential significant wedges among the two variables - even in the long run - can be misleading. By applying both time series and panel cointegration techniques on data on 19 OECD countries, we fail to reject the hypothesis of the absence of a long run common stochastic trend among the two variables in the period 1980-2005. Furthermore, we apply a simple decomposition of GDP growth into five variables, including some related to the supply-side and demographics, so to verify the single contributions to income growth and variance over our period of interest. We conclude that variables that have been so far absent in the growth literature indeed have a non-negligible role in explaining the dynamics of long run per capita GDP growth. In particular, these forgotten factors (that we identify with the employment and the activity rates and a demographic ratio) matter more in better performing economies, where we also highlight that productivity has been less important in determining GDP growth than in relatively bad performers.

The employment (rather than wage) response to immigration by skill in a state reveals the production substitutability-complementarity between native and immigrant labor. This, in turn, reveals the degree to which immigrants stimulate or depress the demand for native labor. To estimate this elasticity, I use a novel instrument based on demographic characteristics of total Central American migrants or of the Mexican Population to predict immigration by skill level within California. Looking at immigration to California between 1960 and 2005 these estimates support the assumption of a nationally integrated labor market by skill and they support the hypothesis that natives and immigrants in the same education-experience group are not perfectly substitutable. This explains the counter-intuitive fact that there is a zero correlation between immigration and wage and employment outcomes of natives in the state. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The rapid expansion of the banking system following its privatization in the early 2000s is explained, as well as the inherent fragility due to the size of the banking system relative to the domestic economy and the central bank's reserves, market manipulation enabling bank capital to expand rapidly and the weak and understaffed public institutions. Most of Iceland's banking system was traditionally in state hands but was privatized and sold to politically favoured entities at the turn of the century, with laws and regulations subsequently changed to facilitate the expansion of the banking system. Political connections and the tacit support of the authorities enabled senior bank managers and key shareholders to extract significant private benefits while shifting risk to domestic and foreign taxpayers and foreign creditors. These problems were exacerbated by symptoms of what the paper terms the small country syndrome. The size of the banking sector made the central bank incapable of serving as the lender of last resort. The domestic supervisor, the central bank and the ministries in charge of economic affairs were understaffed and lacking in experience in how to manage a large financial sector. The rapid growth was also ultimately unsustainable due to high levels of leverage and a weak capital base due to both the rapid expansion of balance sheets and lending to finance investment in own shares. The episode demonstrates the importance of closely monitoring rapidly growing financial institutions and even possibly slowing growth when institutions are systemically important. One lesson to be drawn from the crisis relates to the role of politics in a financial crisis. The Icelandic authorities as a matter of policy encouraged the creation of an international banking centre. This involved the privatization and deregulation of the banking system, rules and regulations being relaxed and the neglect of financial supervision. Another lesson is that floating exchange rates can be hazardous in the presence of large capital flows. The central bank raised interest rates during the boom years in order to meet an inflation target. This created an interest rate differential with other countries that encourages a large volume of carry trades and incentivized domestic agents to borrow in foreign currency. Both conspired to create an asset price bubble, excessive currency appreciation and - counter-intuitively - high inflation. The result was that monetary policy as conducted was ineffective at curbing domestic demand. The eventual large depreciation of the currency made a large section of the economy insolvent. Finally, there are lessons about the European passport system in financial services and the common market. The Icelandic banks had the right to set up branches in the European Union by means of the passport on the explicit assumption that home regulators were exercising adequate controls. The collapse of the banks left the United Kingdom and the Netherlands with significant costs, demonstrating the inherent weakness in the passport when one member country can undercut the supervisory standards of other member countries. For the passport system to work, the home supervisor must be trustworthy. - Sigridur Benediktsdottir, Jon Danielsson and Gylfi Zoega.","[Benediktsdottir, Sigridur] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; London Sch Econ, London, England; Univ Iceland, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; Birkbeck Coll, London, England",Yale University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Iceland; University of London; Birkbeck University London,"Benediktsdottir, S (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",,"zoega, gylfi/M-3622-2015",,,,,,29,63,66,1,104,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

The unconditional distribution is also provided. The conditional moments of the CV are obtained as a one-dimensional integral of the transition choice probabilities. This framework allows us to derive a stochastic version of Shephard's lemma, which relates the expected conditional CV and the transition choice probabilities. We compute the CV for a simple binary linear in income choice model and show that the information on the transitions leads to better estimates of the CV than those obtained when only ex-ante or ex-post information on individual choices is used. For the additive in income logit, we compute the conditional distribution of CV, which generalizes the logsum formula. Finally, we derive a new welfare formula for the disaggregated version of the representative consumer CES model.","[Kilani, Karim] Conservatoire Natl Arts & Metiers, F-75003 Paris, France; [de Palma, Andre] Ecole Normale Super, F-94230 Cachan, France; [de Palma, Andre] Ecole Polytech, Palaiseau, France; [de Palma, Andre] Inst Univ France, Paris, France",heSam Universite; Conservatoire National Arts & Metiers (CNAM); Universite Paris Saclay; Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Institut Universitaire de France,"Kilani, K (通讯作者)，Conservatoire Natl Arts & Metiers, F-75003 Paris, France.",andre.depalma@ens-cachan.fr; karim.kilani@cnam.fr,,,,,,,16,11,11,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

We find that the savings glut hypothesis is insufficient for explaining all aspects of the boom in the US. Relatively strong TFP growth and expansionary monetary policy are also not able to explain fully the volatility of corporate and in particular residential investment. We identify bubbles in the stock and housing market as crucial. Concerning the downturn in 2008/2009, the fall in house prices and residential investment only plays a minor role. Mortgage defaults have more explanatory power, especially in a specification of the model with a segregated equity market. Finally, the bursting of the stock market bubble was at least as important in this recession as in 2001. Because of various negative shocks hitting the economy at the same time in 2008/2009 and continued positive technology growth, not only the real interest rate declined but inflation fell rapidly and left insufficient room for monetary policy to play a similar stabilising role as in previous recessions.

Top incomes represent a small share of the population but a very significant share of total income and total taxes paid. Hence, aggregate economic growth per capita and Gini inequality indexes are sensitive to excluding or including top incomes. We discuss the estimation methods and issues that arise when constructing top income share series, including income definition and comparability over time and across countries, tax avoidance, and tax evasion. We provide a summary of the key empirical findings. Most countries experience a dramatic drop in top income shares in the first part of the twentieth century in general due to shocks to top capital incomes during the wars and depression shocks. Top income shares do not recover in the immediate postwar decades. However, over the last thirty years, top income shares have increased substantially in English speaking countries and in India and China but not in continental European countries or Japan. This increase is due in part to an unprecedented surge in top wage incomes. As a result, wage income comprises a larger fraction of top incomes than in the past. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and empirical models that have been proposed to account for the facts and the main questions that remain open.

We find that subjects tend to overpay to enter both auction formats. In particular, if the subjects believe they will be bidding against bidders following the risk-neutral Nash strategy, their WTE is greater than the optimal risk-neutral amount 97% of the time for first-price auctions (FPA) and 90% for second-price auctions (SPA). If they believe that they are bidding against subjects who bid as do the other subjects, they submit a WIT that is too high 92% of the time for FPA and 69% of the time for SPA. We also find, in line with previous studies, significant overbidding in both the FPA and SPA. We then investigate whether introducing risk aversion (RA) or joy of winning (JOY) can explain the joint observation of over-entry and overbidding. In particular, using bid data alone, we structurally estimate three models, one allowing RA only, one allowing for JOY only and one allowing for both RA and JOY. While a model with JOY alone overestimates WTE, we find that RA alone can explain 38% of WTE but a model with both RA and JOY (where RA is estimated using FPA bids, and JOY is estimated using SPA bids) can explain 65% of WTE. Moreover, JOY appears to explain nearly all of the male WTE but only 44% of the female WTE. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The main objective is to examine the long run equilibrium relationship between financial development and environmental pollution. The results of the analysis reveal a negative sign for the coefficient of financial development, suggesting that financial development in China has not taken place at the expense of environmental pollution. On the contrary, it is found that financial development has led to a decrease in environmental pollution. It is concluded that carbon emissions are mainly determined by income, energy consumption and trade openness in the long run. Moreover, the findings confirm the existence of an Environmental Kuznets Curve in the case of China. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

More than 10% of these low-skilled immigrants are self-employed. Utilizing longitudinal data from the 1996, 2001 and 2004 Survey of Income and Program Participation panels, this paper analyzes the returns to self-employment among low-skilled immigrants. We find that the returns to low-skilled self-employment among immigrants is higher than it is among natives but also that wage/salary employment is a more financially rewarding option for most low-skilled immigrants. In analyses of earnings differences, we find that most of the 20% male native-immigrant earnings gap among low-skilled business owners can be explained primarily by differences in the ethnic composition. Low-skilled female foreign born entrepreneurs are found to have earnings roughly equal to otherwise observationally similar self-employed native born women.","[Lofstrom, Magnus] PPIC, San Francisco, CA 94111 USA; [Lofstrom, Magnus] IZA, San Francisco, CA 94111 USA",,"Lofstrom, M (通讯作者)，PPIC, 500 Washington St,Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94111 USA.",lofstrom@ppic.org,,,,,,,15,18,25,5,39,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

We find that, under both types of contracts (linear and two-part tariffs), only three distribution networks are stable for particular values of the degree of product differentiation and link costs: the non-exclusive distribution and non-exclusive dealing network, the exclusive distribution and exclusive dealing network, and a mixed distribution network in which both exclusive and non-exclusive relations are observed. Moreover, the stability of the first two networks is robust to the case of manufacturers with no bargaining power and the case of differentiated retailers who compete in prices. We show that, under both types of contracts, the distribution networks that maximize social welfare are not necessarily stable. Thus, a conflict between stability and social welfare is likely to occur, even more if the degree of product differentiation is low enough. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We use the local variation in regulation to determine the effects of entry barriers on sectoral performance. We address the endogeneity of entry barriers through local fixed effects and using political variables as instruments. We also control for differences in trends and for area-wide shocks. We find that entry barriers are associated with substantially larger profit margins and lower productivity of incumbent firms. Liberalising entry has a positive effect on investment in ICT, increases employment and compresses labour costs in large shops. In areas with more stringent entry regulation, lower productivity coupled with larger margins results in higher consumer prices.","[Schivardi, Fabiano] Univ Cagliari, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy",University of Cagliari,"Schivardi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Cagliari, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy.",,,"SCHIVARDI, FABIANO/0000-0001-7708-1011",,,,,34,48,53,1,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

In contrast to previous studies the disaggregation is at the level of type of service delivered and not at the level of source of expenditure. Our results show that the subcomponents of health expenditure exhibit different patterns of behaviour at both cointegration and unit root stages once policy shifts or structural breaks are allowed in the empirical analysis. When the possibility of structural break is allowed we find a significant long-run relationship between subcomponents of aggregate health expenditure and GDP that is not observed when break is not allowed.

However, this is not reflected in health care. Firstly, Canada implemented the principle of universal coverage much earlier than the United States. Secondly, U.S. health care continues to rely much more on private funding and private managing, while Canadian health care relies more on cost containing public funding and governmental budgeting. These differences can be explained, among other things, by their different paths of development since the American Revolutionary War: the United States followed an independent path while Canada was oriented on Europe (for a long period of time).

First, there exists a positive relation between the intensity of religious beliefs (the main 'output' of the religious production process) and income - beliefs about the afterlife affect production and savings decisions today. Second, and perhaps more surprising, we find an inverted U-shaped relation between religious 'inputs' (time and money spent in the temple) and income. While it is possible to use too much resources as religious inputs, we find that the great majority of the respondents is on the upward sloping part of the curve linking economic performance to religious inputs.

It shows that the VAR approach arises from a fusion of the Cowles Commission tradition and time series statistical methods, catalysed by the rational expectations (RE) movement, that the approach offers a systematic solution to the issue of 'model choice' bypassed by Cowles researchers, hence essentially inheriting and enhancing the Cowles legacy rather than abandoning or opposing it. By tackling model choice, however, the VAR approach helps reform econometrics by shifting the research focus from measurement of given theories to identification/verification of data-coherent theories.","Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, London WC1E 7HU, England",University of London,"Qin, D (通讯作者)，Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, London WC1E 7HU, England.",,,,,,,,94,26,27,1,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

We use this natural experiment to identify the causal effect of student debt on employment outcomes. In the standard life-cycle model, young people make optimal educational investment decisions if they are able to finance these investments by borrowing against future earnings; the presence of debt has only income effects on investment decisions. We find that debt causes graduates to choose substantially higher-salary jobs and reduces the probability that students choose low-paid public interest jobs. We also find some evidence that debt affects students' academic decisions during college. Our estimates suggest that recent college graduates are not life-cycle agents. Two potential explanations are that young workers are credit constrained or that they are averse to holding debt. We find suggestive evidence that debt reduces students' donations to the institution in the years after they graduate and increases the likelihood that a graduate will default on a pledge made during her senior year; we argue this result is more likely consistent with credit constraints than with debt aversion.

We test if taxes on sellers are more popular than taxes on consumers, i.e. on voters themselves, even if taxes on sellers are inefficiently high. Taxes on sellers are more popular if voters underestimate the extent of tax-shifting in the market. We show that inexperienced voters are prone to such a tax-shifting bias, that experience is an effective de-biasing mechanism, but that pre-vote deliberation about tax regimes makes initially held opinions more extreme rather than correct. Our results suggest that voting on taxes is prone to bias and that easy-to-interpret facts are needed to de-bias voters. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, it remains to be explored whether the current microcredit schemes are more successful than earlier formal small scale lending in identifying successful borrowers. We studied shrimp farming in a rural region in Bangladesh where formal microlending is well established, but where more expensive informal microlending coexists with the formal schemes. Farmers - both those who exclusively use formal loans and those who also use informal loans - remain credit-constrained; both types overutilize labour in order to reduce the need for working capital. However, the credit constraint is actually milder for the informal borrowers: the implicit shadow price of working capital is substantially higher in the group that only takes formal loans than in the group that also uses informal loans. These results suggest that informal lenders - with their closer ties to the individual farmers - remain more successful in identifying those smallholder farmers that are most likely to use the borrowed funds successfully. Informal lenders have an information advantage that formal microlenders lack: the latter need to find routes to access this information in order for formal microcredit schemes to succeed.","[Stage, Jesper] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Andersson, Camilla; Holmgren, Erik] Umea Univ, Dept Econ, Umea, Sweden; [MacGregor, James] Int Inst Environm & Dev, London, England",University of Gothenburg; Umea University,"Stage, J (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden.",jesper.stage@economics.gu.se,"Stage, Jesper/B-6718-2009","Stage, Jesper/0000-0001-7206-6568",,,,,30,6,6,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We find that school completion of children is positively and significantly affected by the mean grade completion of other children in the neighbourhood. We then present three pieces of evidence that suggest that the social effect offers a valid explanation. Firstly, the evidence we find of inter-household externalities is not driven out by control for a host of neighbourood and household attributes. Secondly, the result remains robust to neighbourhood composition effects: it is unchanged as we purge our main sample of the households within the neighbourhood that are potentially linked in terms of their recent history of partition. Thirdly, a similar peer effect is found for adults who completed schooling before the introduction of existing educational reforms in rural areas suggesting that the observed effect of growing up in educated neighbourhood does not merely capture the influence of common exposure to various government educational interventions. As a by-product, the article also provides evidence of intra-household externality in children's schooling, net of neighbourood externalities.

This development is carried out in conditions of tough competition on domestic and foreign markets. Companies have to combine material, financial and intellectual resources in order to fulfill tasks related to managing business activity. Realization of a competitive strategy must secure growth of the company's market value in a long run. This increase should be secured in the first place by means of realizing innovative projects related to creating and using different objects of intellectual property. Companies implement different managerial techniques to increase their business activity efficiency. Just in Time Production and the lean production concept may serve as examples of such techniques. The paper analyzes influence of the lean production concept on forming the market value of a company. The role of this concept as a strategic management tool has been evaluated. Advantages of the lean production concept in revealing sources and areas of hidden losses emergence and also their identification and elimination are demonstrated. It is substantiated that presence of such innovative managerial techniques within enterprises gives an opportunity to increase efficiency and performance of economic activities and also enables to secure market value growth. The paper demonstrates a structure of business valuation with due regard for influence of the lean production concept on formation of the value of the company. This structure systematizes key indicators and methods of company valuation that use intangible assets in its activity. The authors have suggested an approach to market valuation of the lean production concept The method for valuating efficiency of creating and using an unidentifiable intangible asset which is based on the lean production concept has been developed.","[Zaytsev, Andrey] Russian Presidential Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm, Inst Business Studies, Moscow 119571, Russia; [Zaytsev, Alexander] Moscow State Text Univ AN Kosygin, Anal Lab, Moscow 119071, Russia",Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy & Public Administration; Kosygin State University of Russia,"Zaytsev, A (通讯作者)，Russian Presidential Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm, Inst Business Studies, Moscow 119571, Russia.",zayand12@yandex.ru; az-inform@mail.ru,"Baranov, Vyacheslav/HLH-2557-2023; Zaytsev, Andrey/A-1772-2014",,,,,,17,2,2,0,10,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-755-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,43,+,,,,,,3,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT98,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300261200005,0

We show that such an analysis can reverse the conclusions reached within a standard one-shot game framework. We first examine a one shot game and show that the benefits from an increase in economic activity due to free trade outweigh the extra cost of free trade associated with larger environmental damage. We then consider the infinite repetition of the one-shot game where countries can use trigger strategies and show that there exist circumstances where an IEA is sustainable under autarky but not under free trade. This aggravates the environmental damages caused by free trade and leads to the possibility that welfare may be smaller under free trade than under autarky. This conclusion remains valid even when (i) countries adopt the most cooperative environmental policy when the fully cooperative environmental policy is not sustainable or (ii) we consider intermediate tariff reductions.,"[Benchekroun, Hassan] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, CIREQ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Yildiz, Halis Murat] Ryerson Univ, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON, Canada",Universite de Montreal; McGill University; Toronto Metropolitan University,"Benchekroun, H (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Econ, CIREQ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",hassan.benchekroun@mcgill.ca; hyildiz@economics.ryerson.ca,,"Yildiz, Halis Murat/0000-0002-1964-0978",,,,,26,3,3,1,16,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

When firing costs are zero and a time gap exists between production and its associated revenues, firing allows firms to hold on to their liquid assets by saving on wages, and thus, allows firms to cope better with liquidity shocks when external financing is too costly or unavailable. I refer to this feature as labor's liquidity service. Higher firing costs reduces the value of labor's liquidity service, and thus, increases firms' incentive for hoarding liquidity and reduces firms' demand for production inputs. In addition to this negative effect at the creation margin of production, firing costs have a relatively higher positive effect on the destruction margin of production of financially restricted firms. This paper presents a model that develops these ideas and shows that the presence of firing costs has a stronger negative effect on the output of firms facing liquidity constraints. Regression analysis, based on country-industry panel data sets, provides empirical evidence consistent with the liquidity service effect of firing costs. I find a relatively stronger negative effect of firing costs on the output of industries with higher liquidity requirements and a relatively stronger negative effect of firing costs on the output of small, and more likely financially constrained, firms.

Specifically, we exploit heterogeneity across auctioned objects to establish semiparametric identification under a conditional quantile restriction of the bidders' private value distribution and a parameterization of the bidders' utility function. We develop a multistep semiparametric method and we show that our semiparametric estimator of the utility function parameter(s) converges at the optimal rate, which is slower than the parametric one but independent of the dimension of the exogenous variables thereby avoiding the curse of dimensionality. We then consider various extensions including a binding reserve price, affiliation among private values, and asymmetric bidders.

There is a discrepancy between company's interests - polluter and society's interests therefore it is necessary to regulate this problem with the aid of environmental tools, which are made within the scope of a state policy and its environmental protection. The main aim of environmental regulation is at least partial internalization of negative externality into private company's costs - polluter. State has a vast variety of environmental tools for realization policy of environmental protection. There are widely represented normative tools but economic tools are growing as well. With the beginning of a new millennium the tax systems of each state are accepted as a potential tools for the environmental protection. The concept of ecological tax reform which was defined by developed European countries was shown up into EU policy and then also into politics of each member states. The Czech Republic as the rightful member of European Union accepted this concept and in 2008 implemented it in the framework of relevant legislation. The main idea of ecologically tax reform is tax neutrality which should be fulfilled in the area of the Czech Republic. The state decides which combination of potential tools is efficient and suitable for its environmental policy. It is necessary to evaluate specific criteria for a rational choice of environmental tools mix. However there is not examined economic efficiency or environmental effectiveness of particular tools only, the transaction costs or the policy acceptance of implemented arrangement are also very important","[Cernikova, Martina] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,,martina.cernikova@tul.cz,,,,,,,23,1,1,0,3,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-755-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,82,89,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT98,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300261200009,0

Our empirical findings provide strong evidence that overall globalization and its social dimension are cointegrated with RGDP, and most of the structural break points are discovered during the period of the oil crisis (the mid-1970s) and the process of European Union integration. In addition, in evaluating whether or not the structural breaks affect the RGDP through globalization, we discover that both the overall globalization index and the social globalization index have a directly positive impact on RGDP but indirectly exhibit negative impacts on real output via the channel of social globalization.","[Lee, Chien-Chiang] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; [Chang, Chun-Ping] Shih Chien Univ, Dept Mkt Management, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Hsieh, Meng-Chi] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Inst China & Asia Pacific Studies, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan",National Sun Yat Sen University; Shih Chien University; National Sun Yat Sen University,"Lee, CC (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.",cclee@cm.nsysu.edu.tw,"Lee, Chien-Chiang/AAZ-9983-2020","Lee, Chien-Chiang/0000-0003-0037-4347",,,,,51,23,24,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

It hypothesizes that the reduction in fatal automobile accidents operates through both the quantity of driving and changes in behaviors associated with driving. Using state-by-quarter fixed effects models, the study shows that unemployment rate increases significantly reduce fatal accidents. Decomposing the fatal accident rate into accidents per mile traveled and miles traveled per capita reveals that higher unemployment is significantly associated with fewer accidents per mile, and also reveals that fatal accidents associated with alcohol are more responsive to unemployment rate changes than are accidents overall. These results suggest that the recession's lost fatal accidents occurred in areas hit harder by the recession and were in the form of fewer alcohol-related accidents per mile traveled rather than fewer miles traveled overall.","[Cotti, Chad] Univ Wisconsin Oshkosh, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA; [Tefft, Nathan] Bates Coll, Lewiston, ME 04240 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Oshkosh,"Cotti, C (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin Oshkosh, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA.",cottic@uwosh.edu; ntefft@bates.edu,,"Tefft, Nathan/0000-0002-2758-8700",,,,,36,15,20,0,12,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We show that over the first 10 years of labour market experience job mobility accounts for up to 30% of total log wage growth for men and only 8.3% for women, and that this difference is mainly due to differences in returns to mobility. The gender mobility gap is robust to the inclusion of individual, job and firm characteristics, to different ways of accounting for individual unobserved heterogeneity, and is mainly found for voluntary job moves. Looking at the characteristics of the jobs and the firms' workers move to, we find that moves to larger firms represent by far the main source of gender differences in returns to mobility. We offer two possible explanations for this finding; one which involves differences in bargaining behaviour and one which relates to the theory of compensating differentials. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The model can accommodate Adam Smith's view that competition may possibly improve on monopoly's performance and also David Hume's opposite view that, because the clergy have an incentive to distort the message of religion, monopoly might possibly improve on competition. Impacts on religiosity of greater diversity and of increased competition in the marketplace for religion are isolated. It is shown that while greater diversity benefits the devout (as claimed by supply-side theorists), increased competition dilutes spiritual standards by encouraging monetary donations at the expense of genuine piety. These opposing effects of diversity and competition help reconcile apparently contradictory empirical findings on the American religious market and also those suggesting European exceptionalism.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Eswaran, M (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada.",eswaran@econ.ubc.ca,,,,,,,46,13,14,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

This review examines the economic literature regarding incentive contracts and the provision of food quality, with a focus on empirical analyses. Studies of specific value chains find that a desire for higher quality or specific quality attributes increases the likelihood that a contract, rather than the spot market, is used. Consistent with economic theory, studies regarding the selection of contract provisions find that financial incentives are used when an attribute is easily observable at the time of sale, whereas requirements for specific inputs and actions tend to be used when an attribute is not easily observable.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Goodhue, RE (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",goodhue@primal.ucdavis.edu,,"Goodhue, Rachael/0000-0003-4576-9035",,,,,82,25,36,0,46,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4703-1,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

However, until very recently there has been surprisingly little formal empirical evidence on whether such a link exists, let alone its magnitude if it does. Moreover, the anticipated direction of the effect is ambiguous theoretically. Although previous studies have concluded that individual job loss destabilizes marriages, macroeconomic conditions may affect divorce probabilities even for those not directly experiencing a job shock. We add to the few existing contemporaneous studies of the effects of macroeconomic shocks on divorce by conducting an empirical analysis of the relationship between state-level unemployment rates and state-level divorce rates using vital statistics data on divorces in the United States from 1976-2009. We find a significant and robust negative relationship between the unemployment and divorce rates, whereby a one percentage point rise in the unemployment rate is associated with a decrease of 0.043 divorces per one thousand people, or about a one percent fall in the divorce rate. The result that divorce is pro-cyclical is robust to a host of alternative empirical specifications, to disaggregating by state characteristics and time period, to expanding the unemployment series back to 1970, and to using alternative measures of local economic conditions.","[Hellerstein, Judith K.] Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Morrill, Melinda Sandler] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Hellerstein, Judith K.] Univ Maryland, MPRC, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Hellerstein, Judith K.] NBER, College Pk, MD USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; North Carolina State University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Hellerstein, JK (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",hellerst@econ.umd.edu; melindamorrill@ncsu.edu,,"Morrill, Melinda/0000-0002-1479-1996",NIA NIH HHS [R03 AG037161] Funding Source: Medline,NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,41,27,31,1,30,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

First, I argue that the pre-Depression gold standard, though not ideal, was not a barrier to a desirable reflation. I then offer an account of the 1937-38 recession that views it as a continuation of the Roosevelt regime in a way that contradicts Eggertsson's attempt to cleave it from the expectations-enhancing regime change he focused on. I also respond to his invoking the conventional wisdom regarding Hoover and Roosevelt by offering additional evidence that said wisdom is faulty. Fourth, I respond to his admission of ignorance of Robert Higgs's work by recapping and adding to the evidence for regime uncertainty's role in extending the Great Depression (evidence notably about private investment and about private-sector hours worked). I critically assess the role investment played in Eggertsson's original AER article by noting his failure to distinguish government and private investment, as it was the latter that Higgs demonstrates was affected by regime uncertainty and whose weakness constituted the failed recovery. Finally, I note that if narrow methodological strictures blind us to the evidence provided by narrative history, we will fail to understand that history at our own peril, as the growing parallels between the Great Recession and the Great Depression demonstrate.","[Horwitz, Steven] St Lawrence Univ, Canton, NY 13617 USA; [Horwitz, Steven] George Mason Univ, Mercatus Ctr, Arlington, VA 22201 USA",Saint Lawrence University; George Mason University,"Horwitz, S (通讯作者)，St Lawrence Univ, Canton, NY 13617 USA.",sghorwitz@stlawu.edu,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,5,INST SPONTANEOUS ORDER ECONOMICS,FAIRFAX,"9745 KINGS CROWN COURT #102, FAIRFAX, VA 22031 USA",1933-527X,,,ECON J WATCH,Econ.

While a productivity-growth based explanation is able to account for broader trends in the rising consumption-income ratio from about 1980 to 2000, there are other episodes during which the model is less successful.

These effects are substantial and robust to the inclusion of sibling fixed effects and an extensive set of controls. The results reveal that low birth weight ages people in their 30s and 40s by 12 years, increases the probability of dropping out of high school by one-third, lowers labor force participation by 5 percentage points, and reduces labor market earnings by roughly 15 percent. While poor birth outcomes reduce human capital accumulation, they explain only 10 percent of the total effect of low birth weight on labor market earnings. Taken together, the evidence is consistent with a negative reinforcing intergenerational transmission of disadvantage within the family; parental economic status influences birth outcomes, birth outcomes have long reaching effects on health and economic status in adulthood, which in turn leads to poor birth outcomes for one's own children.","[Johnson, Rucker C.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Schoeni, Robert F.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Johnson, RC (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",ruckerj@berkeley.edu; bschoeni@umich.edu,,,,,,,79,34,35,1,25,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

More concretely, we try to quantify the effects of tax, entry cost, and contract enforcement on output, income distribution, and tax revenue. The model is specifically calibrated to the Korean economy. Under the assumption of an endogenously determined interest rate, the effects of policies on total output are restrictive. However, the demand effect shows that entry cost and contract enforcement have significant potential influences on output. Lowering the tax rate increases income inequality in spite of the shrinkage in size of the informal sector. There is no Laffer curve effect when the tax rate is lowered, despite the broadened tax base. Lowering the entry cost turns out to be a viable policy option for reducing the size of the informal sector, as it reduces inequality and increases tax revenue effectively.","Bank Korea, Dept Res, Seoul, South Korea",Bank of Korea,"Joo, D (通讯作者)，Bank Korea, Dept Res, Seoul, South Korea.",jdhlkw@bok.or.kr,,,,,,,28,4,4,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

The cointegration test used is the 'bounds' test of Pesaran et al. (2001) that is based on the estimation of an Unrestricted Error-Correction Model (UECM). This article addresses one of the major problems of how to use a relatively small sample to estimate tourism demand elasticities using cointegration approaches, which is faced by many researchers in modelling tourism demand. The results show that permanent income is the most important explanatory variable for all origin countries, but there are substantial variations between countries with the long-run elasticity ranging between 1.74 for China and 3.05 for Australia. Price elasticity is the next most important variable with the long-run elasticities ranging from 0.35 (Australia) to 0.98 (Taiwan). The findings are consistent with economic theory and have implications for government policies and strategies on investment, marketing and promotion and pricing.","City Univ Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong,"Lee, KNH (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",henry.kn.lee@cityu.edu.hk,,,,,,,75,10,10,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We extend work by Shapiro (2001) and Lerner and Tirole (2004) by studying the effects of increases in the number of patented research inputs on innovation incentives and optimal patent policy. We consider not only the effects on the incentives to invent final goods, but also on the incentives to invent research inputs (ex-ante effect). We find increasing complexity has a negative effect on innovation activity in the final goods sector when research inputs are complements. Either limiting market power through weaker patents or reducing the lack of coordination through patent pools may solve this problem. We also find the optimal patent breadth and show it is increasing in the elasticity of substitution between the inputs used in research and decreasing (increasing) in the complexity of the R&D process when research inputs are complements (substitutes).","[Llanes, Gaston] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Trento, Stefano] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Llanes, G (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile.",gaston@llanes.com.ar; stefano.trento@uab.es,,"Llanes, Gaston/0000-0002-6687-0864",,,,,24,2,2,0,15,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

This paper exploits a unique setting - a group of tea plantations in South India where women are employed in permanent wage labor and where incomes do not vary by caste to anticipate the impact of globalization on mobility across social groups in the future. The main result of the paper is that a relative increase in female income weakens the family's ties to the ancestral community and the traditional economy, but these mobility enhancing effects are obtained for certain historically disadvantaged castes alone. Although the paper provides a context-specific explanation for why the women from these castes emerge as agents of change, the first general implication of the analysis is that the incentive and the ability of women to use their earnings to influence household decisions depends importantly on their social background. The second implication is that historically disadvantaged groups may, in fact, be especially responsive to new opportunities precisely because they have fewer ties to the traditional economy to hold them back.

Japanese meat imports come from a few countries thus making Japan potentially very sensitive to the swings in one or a few bilateral exchange rates. One of the key contributions of this article is the use of commodity (meats in this case) imports weighted exchange rates in the analysis. The standard practice in previous international agricultural trade studies related to either exchange rate pass-through or pricing to market was to use the aggregate trade weighted exchange rates usually provided by the Central Bank authorities or sources. Beef and poultry import prices indicate partial exchange rate pass-through while import prices of pork indicate zero exchange rate pass-through, primarily due to gate price policy system applied to pork imports. In terms of competitiveness, these results suggest relatively more competitive markets among poultry importing firms, somewhat competitive markets among beef importing firms, while competitiveness of pork importing firms could not be assessed due to existing import policies.","[Miljkovic, D.] N Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, NDSU Dept 7610, Fargo, ND 58108 USA; [Zhuang, R.] USA Poultry & Egg Export Council, Stone Mt, GA 30087 USA",North Dakota State University Fargo,"Miljkovic, D (通讯作者)，N Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, NDSU Dept 7610, 614A Barry Hall, Fargo, ND 58108 USA.",dragan.miljkovic@ndsu.edu,,,,,,,20,10,11,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This dichotomous view reflects longstanding scientific uncertainty about the role of weight-gain in triggering relapse. This scientific uncertainty, which stems from mixed clinical trial results, is problematic for insurance coverage decisions such as state Medicaid programme decisions to cover or exclude smoking-cessation and weight-control pharmaceuticals. Analysts hypothesize that selection bias may explain the inconsistency between the negative clinical results and the persistent view that weight-gain triggers relapse, if weight-concern is both a key determinant of the transition from 'smoker' to 'ex-smoker,' and a key moderating variable in the relationship between weight-gain and relapse. We therefore use the nationally representative 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97) to test the relapse-trigger hypothesis, and conclude that post-smoking-cessation weight-gain triggers relapse among weight-concerned white women, but it is associated with quitting success among Hispanic women. In addition, our results do not support the hypothesis that the mixed clinical trial results reflect selection bias based on weight-concern.","[Mukhopadhyay, Sankar; Wendel, Jeanne] Univ Nevada, Coll Business, Dept Econ 030, Reno, NV 89557 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno,"Mukhopadhyay, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Coll Business, Dept Econ 030, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",sankarm@unr.edu,,,,,,,29,10,11,2,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A competitive model is specified in which random cost shocks lead some firms to cheat in equilibrium on their reputation for high quality. When cheating occurs, instituting or raising the level of a minimum standard can lead to the price of high quality products either increasing or decreasing. The effect of a minimum quality standard on the price of high quality products becomes an empirical rather than a theoretical issue.","[Panzar, John C.] Univ Auckland, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Savage, Ian] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",University of Auckland; Northwestern University,"Panzar, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Auckland, Auckland 1, New Zealand.",j.panzar@auckland.ac.nz; ipsavage@northwestern.edu,,,,,,,19,3,3,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

EU policies that search for balance between family life and work have gradually moved in their range - from the women and men equal treatment at work towards the need to stimulate economic growth by increasing the employment means to reach better work-life balance and, recently, ways to support a growth in birth rates. Over the past decade, EU policies have been transformed to emphasize the reality that harmonizing family life and work, the gender division of paid and unpaid work, and a growth in birth rates are all just as relevant policy domains.

The implications of long-memory differ, however, based on whether it is of a 'fractional' or of a 'stochastic' type. The aims of this article are to determine, in the case of agricultural commodity futures data, which type better describes price volatility and also to evaluate several competing explanations for findings of long memory. The evidence presented here finds little support for three out of four potential explanations, namely, excessive noise in the volatility measure, bias in the long-memory estimator and understated SEs of the long-memory parameter. For the data considered, price volatility appears to be most likely generated by a nonfractional long-memory process such as a stochastic break or stochastic unit root.","[Power, G.

The diffusion of this arrangement and the favourable stance of competition authorities call for the assessment of the social and private desirability of Input Production Joint Ventures (IPJV), which represent a form of input production cooperation, scantly investigated so far. IPJV can be seen as an intermediate organizational setting lying between the two extremes of vertical integration and vertical separation, with a major difference, due to partial collusion. Our investigation is based on an oligopoly model with horizontally differentiated goods. We characterize the conditions under which IPJV is privately optimal finding that firms' incentives may be welfare detrimental. We also provide a rationale for the empirical relevance of IPJV both in terms of its ability to survive and in terms of disengagement incentives which account for the large number of divorces among members of joint ventures.

The objective of the author is the analysis of equilibrium, an efficient input choice, the study of the returns to scale function, the estimation of the elasticity of substitution, and the evaluation of the technical progress. Depending on the chosen objectives, economic restrictions such as the homogeneity, homotheticity, and regularity condition (positivity, monotonicity, and quasiconcavity) can be imposed. Various well-known functions beginning from the Cobb Douglas (CD) to a globally well-behaved polynomial series are listed and the performances are compared with respect to the possibility of extracting economic interpretation, usefulness for advanced studies, computational easiness, and the potentiality of extending the given function to a more complex function. The isoquants and three dimensional output surfaces are plotted for a series of production functions using the transportation data of Zellner and Revankar (1969). Barnett and Jonas (1983) imposed the sufficient conditions for quasiconcavity of production functions while Gallant and Golub (1984) imposed the necessary and sufficient conditions. The strength and weakness of the above two methods are discussed. These methods are extended for three input cases using the U.S. electric power industry data of Nerlove (1963) and Greene (2008).

Since the level of the felicity function shows up in the optimal path it leads to qualitatively different solutions when one uses a negative or positive felicity function.

Alan Greenspan's retrospective indicates what he has learned from the crisis. He argues that the crisis, the housing price bubble, was unpredictable and unavoidable. Greenspan now focuses on desirable capital requirements, or leverage, for banks and financial intermediaries. I explain why the Fed's and Greenspan's views stem from a lack of the appropriate tools of analysis of what is an excessive debt or leverage. The Quants who devised the highly leveraged financial derivatives ignored systemic risk. My theme is that the application of stochastic optimal control (SOC) is an effective approach to implement what the D-F bill is authorizing. I explain: first, what is the optimal capital requirement/leverage that balances expected return against risk. Second, what is a theoretically derived early warning signal of a crisis. Third, I derive an excess debt ratio, equal to the difference between the actual and optimal ratios. The probability of a debt crisis is directly related to the excess debt ratio. The excess debt ratio starting from 2004-05 indicated that a crisis was most likely. The Fed should use this SOC analysis in implementing the Dodd-Frank bill. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, is the trading based on technical analysis profitable? This paper is dealing with the profitability of the business strategies which use the following indicators of technical analysis: Simple Moving Average (SMA), Bollinger Bands (BB) and Moving Average Envelopes (MAE). All the mentioned indicators are the application of the moving average of the length N. The moving average was gradually counted for 199 lengths N=2, 3, 4 ... 200. MAE are then counted for 4%, 6% and 8%. Bollinger Bands (BB) are counted for 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0 multiple of standard deviation. The profitability of particular methods is counted using the data from the Prague Stock Exchange in the space of 5 years from 1 January 2006 until 31 December 2010, specifically for the prices of the following shares: Komercni Banka and Telefonica 02. In contrast with other papers there are included the transaction costs in the amount of 0.4% of trade volume and dividends paid after imposition of taxes. The profitability of particular methods in given parameters is then compared to passive strategy Buy and Hold (BH). In total 4179 results were obtained for was the set parameters (597 for SMA, 1791 for BB and 1791 for MAE). Calculations proved that trading based on the strategies mentioned above is interesting mainly for brokers who earn money from the realised trade fees. Trading according to the SMA method did not beat BH in any length of average and in any share.

Based on the aggregation of establishment-level data at 4-digit industrial classification, we find that both intermediate inputs and service outsourcing are relatively skill-biased.

This paper tests these hypotheses using data on co-authorship among economists. Our data supports the hypothesis of transitivity of strong ties, but it rejects the hypothesis that weak ties are more crucial than strong ties.

In this case it is impossible not to include the deepening differentiation of requirements and criteria on the expert qualification and personal qualities of the labor force.

To understand changes in intergenerational disparity, we created the intergenerational mobility index (IMI), which can simultaneously measure changes in income rankings and in health outcomes across two generations. We selected obesity as one health outcome to illustrate the application of IMI due to its severe health and financial consequences for society and the significant changes in the distribution of obesity across income groups. Although obesity has increased in all income groups in the last four decades, higher income groups have tended to have a faster increase in obesity, which has reduced the disparity in obesity across income groups. The strength of our intergenerational approach within families is to control the genetic influence, which is one of the strongest determinants of obesity. The decomposition of the IMI illustrates that it captures changes in obesity distribution (holding constant income rankings between generations) and changes in income rankings (holding constant the obesity distribution across generations), simultaneously. We used the data of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), which have been collected since 1967, is the longest longitudinal survey in the U.S. The PSID surveyed respondents' height and weight were recorded in 1986 and from 1999 to 2007. We selected respondents from 1986 as the parental generation and respondents from 2007 as the adult children's generation. To make the adult children's body weight status and income comparable to their parents', we stratified the analysis by gender. For the pairs of fathers and adult sons, we found the intergenerational disparity in overweight, a less severe indicator of excessive fatness, across income was decreasing. This was partially due to the up-swing in the adult children's income status. For the pairs of mothers and adult daughters, we found a similar decrease in socioeconomic disparity in obesity. However, decomposition of the IMI indicated that changes in income distributions between mothers and adult daughters contributed smaller effects than that between fathers and adult sons. Our study has demonstrated that the IMI and its decomposition are useful tools for analyzing intergenerational disparity in income and health.","[Zhang, Qi] Old Dominion Univ, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Zheng, Buhong] Univ Colorado, Denver, CO 80202 USA; [Zhang, Ning] Univ Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Wang, Youfa] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Old Dominion University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver; University of Rochester; Johns Hopkins University,"Zhang, Q (通讯作者)，Old Dominion Univ, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.",qzhang@odu.edu; buhong.zheng@ucdenver.edu; ningzhang@urmc.rochester.edu; ywang@jhsph.edu,,,,,,,24,3,4,1,20,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Using this source of variation we find portfolio responses to taxation among more affluent households. The estimated effects are statistically significant but economically modest.

We evaluate the impact of this unique schooling policy on maternal labour supply. Using a Regression-Discontinuity design, we show that early school availability has a significant employment effect on lone mothers, but no effect on two-parent families. Also we show that the effect grows larger as the child grows older and as the family loses eligibility for child benefits. Finally, we provide some new evidence that school enrolment at the age of two has no adverse effect on children's subsequent educational outcomes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A full understanding of what happened in the financial crisis requires investigation into the plumbing of debt markets. During a financial crisis, when funds often cannot be raised easily or quickly, the fundamental values for certain assets can become separated for a time from market prices, with consequences that can echo into the real economy. This article will explain in concrete ways how debt markets can malfunction, with deleterious consequences for the real economy. After a quick overview of debt markets, I discuss three areas that are crucial in all debt markets decisions: risk capital and risk aversion; repo financing and haircuts; and counterparty risk. In each of these areas, feedback effects can arise so that less liquidity and a higher cost for finance can reinforce each other in a contagious spiral. I will document the remarkable rise in the premium that investors placed on liquidity during the crisis. Next, I will show how these issues caused debt markets to break down; indeed, fundamental values and market values seemed to diverge across several markets and products that were far removed from the toxic subprime mortgage assets at the root of the crisis. Finally, I will discuss briefly four steps that the Federal Reserve took to ease the crisis and how each was geared to a specific systemic fault that arose during the crisis.","[Krishnamurthy, Arvind] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Krishnamurthy, Arvind] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Krishnamurthy, A (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",a-krishnamurthy@kellogg.northwestern.edu,,,,,,,31,126,150,1,26,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We show that if an owner delegates the task of bargaining to a manager, the owner always compensates the manager for profits by penalising sales, regardless of whether the rival owner delegates or not. Moreover, we show that an owner's decision to delegate the task of bargaining to a manager depends on the incremental benefit of delegating and the cost of hiring a manager. The asymmetric outcome (wherein one owner delegates but the other does not) can occur if there is a sufficiently large disparity of hiring costs between the owners. Finally, we show that the union in an owner-managed firm always earns more than the union in a managerial firm.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Accounting, Taipei 10617, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Liao, PC (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Accounting, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",pcliao@ntu.edu.tw,,,,,,,27,8,8,0,6,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC PAPERS,ADELAIDE,"UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS, ADELAIDE, SA 5001, AUSTRALIA",0004-900X,,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

The study covers the period from the beginning of 1996, when a series of regulatory reforms were introduced to improve consumer protection, until the end of 2008. The study concludes that decision-makers who find in favor of customers have had a statistically lower probability of being removed, consistent with public interest theory. A transitory effect of favoring utilities can be observed for the period from 2 to 6 years following the reforms. In this period, government and public scrutiny of the regulator, which had been high in the immediate aftermath of the reforms, had waned and there were few precedents decided by the courts that the regulator was required to follow. This vacuum created an opportunity for the utilities to increase their influence over the regulator. Once the courts started establishing precedents in relatively large numbers, the supervisory role of the courts ensured that the actions of the regulator were scrutinized. This development has served a similar function to government and public scrutiny in the years immediately following the reforms in promoting the public interest.","[Soederberg, Magnus] Univ S Australia, Ctr Regulat & Market Anal, Sch Commerce, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Smyth, Russell] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",University of South Australia; Monash University,"Söderberg, M (通讯作者)，Univ S Australia, Ctr Regulat & Market Anal, Sch Commerce, GPO Box 2471, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",magnus.soderberg@unisa.edu.au,"Smyth, Russell/AAE-1492-2019","Smyth, Russell/0000-0001-6593-5462; Soderberg, Magnus/0000-0002-9931-6624",,,,,37,8,10,1,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

We extend the growth equation by incorporating age structure dynamics and apply it to China's provincial-level data during the period 1989-2004. We find that changes in demographic structure, especially the contribution of fertility decline to lower youth dependency, have helped fuel China's economic growth since 1989. The effect of demographic change on income growth operates mainly through its impact on steady state income levels and the effect of age structure is more pronounced in provinces that are more open to market forces. We also find a significant feedback effect of economic growth on demographic behaviors through the mechanisms of birth rates, marriage age and life expectancy.

This paper investigates whether CO2 emissions have converged across 22 European countries over the 1971 to 2006 period. The Bayesian shrinkage estimation method is employed to do this work and the results reveal the following: first, the hypothesis of absolute convergence in per capita CO2 emissions is supported and a slight upward convergence is observed; second, the fact that countries differ considerably in both their speed of convergence and volatility in emissions makes it possible to identify different groups of countries; third, the results with respect to convergence do not vary much once the share of industry in GDP is accounted for in a conditional convergence analysis. However, a decreasing share of industry in GDP seems to contribute to a decline in per capita emissions. These findings may carry important implications for both national and EU environmental policies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Leung, SE",,,,"Leung, Suiwah E.",,,Vietnam: an economic survey,ASIAN-PACIFIC ECONOMIC LITERATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper reviews the two decades of economic development in Vietnam since Doi Moi, with the recurrent theme that integration with the world economy brings substantial benefits when accompanied by domestic reforms-when transition catches up with integration. In the 1990s, liberalisation of the agricultural sector-and of trade generally-led to rapid economic growth and reductions in poverty. Since 2001, addressing the extreme bias against the private sector has resulted in growth via development of labour-intensive industries as well as enabling Vietnam to climb onto the first rung of the ladder in the global supply chains of electronics and related manufacturing. However, deeper international integration has made the economy more vulnerable to external shocks. Although Vietnam achieved two decades of rapid growth as well as survived the global financial crisis in better shape than most other economies of similar size in the region, prospects of sustaining another decade of rapid growth are far from assured. Vietnam still has very large state-owned enterprises in capital-intensive industries. The recent extension of these large enterprises into real estate and finance contributed to de-stabilize the macro-economy, and administrative measures were adopted to pare back some of these 'non-core' activities. However, administrative measures are hard to sustain once a crisis is over. The Vietnamese government has the goal of transforming Vietnam into an industrialised society over the coming decade. The recent macroeconomic turbulence has demonstrated that the country needs strong macroeconomic institutions capable of stabilising the economy and setting the parameters for resumption of rapid growth. Thus there is a strong case for the development of modern public institutions as the focus of the third phase of reforms.","Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Leung, SE (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",,,,,,,,25,11,12,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

It shows that an elasticity of substitution that is asymptotically greater than unity is a sufficient (but not a necessary) condition for the existence of a lower bound on the marginal product of capital, which in turn can lead to unbounded endogenous growth. Hence, an elasticity of substitution that eventually becomes greater than unity can counteract the role of diminishing returns to capital. This renders factor substitution a powerful engine of growth.","[Palivos, Theodore] Univ Macedonia, Dept Econ, GR-54006 Thessaloniki, Greece",University of Macedonia,"Palivos, T (通讯作者)，Univ Macedonia, Dept Econ, 156 Egnatia St, GR-54006 Thessaloniki, Greece.",tpalivos@uom.gr,"Palivos, Theodore/A-9807-2009","Palivos, Theodore/0000-0003-2576-7796",,,,,19,32,33,1,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

First, it argues for a climate-policy ramp that deems back-loading of mitigation optimal. Second, it demonstrates that an intergenerational tradeoff is at the heart of the mitigation problem. In this paper we argue that both of these findings rest on contestable assumptions. To demonstrate this a recast DICE is presented. It outcomes show that DICE's predictions are not robust with higher migitations earlier on and slower temperature increases along the optimal path. The adoption of a baseline scenario in which pollution is a negative externality makes mitigating climate change a Pareto improvement. The alleged sacrifice of present generations vanishes.

Previous tax-tool comparisons have not included these central forces of industry structure. This paper examines a general equilibrium monopolistic competition model with heterogeneous firms and intra-industry reallocations. We show that the welfare superiority of ad valorem over unit taxes under imperfect competition is not only preserved but amplified. The additional difference between the tools arises because unit taxes distort relative prices, which in turn reduces average industry productivity through reallocations (the survival and increased market share of lower productivity firms). Importantly, numerical solutions of the model reveal that the relative welfare loss from using the unit tax increases dramatically in the degree of firm heterogeneity.","[Schroder, Philipp J.

It is shown that there exists an equilibrium which has qualitatively different properties from those in standard real option games driven by common stochastic shocks. The properties of the equilibrium are four-fold: (i) preemption does not necessarily occur, (ii) if preemption takes place, the rent-equalization property holds, (iii) for almost all sample paths it is clear ex-ante which player invests first, and (iv) it is possible that both players invest simultaneously, even if that is not optimal.

Due to the desire to KUJ, the propensity to consume out of total wealth rises (declines), and the balanced growth rate declines (increases), when the households' individual total (physical and human) wealth is increasing (decreasing) with age. The rate of retirement determines whether or not a household's total wealth is increasing with age. If total wealth is increasing (decreasing) with age, an optimal allocation is decentralized by an intergenerationally progressive (regressive) lump-sum tax system. The desire to KUJ strengthens the intergenerational regressivity (progressivity) of the optimal tax system.

It is based on the observation that decision makers often do not seem to fully distinguish between different but seemingly similar decisions and tend to treat such similar decisions in a standardised/habitual way. To capture this, each player's information partition is derived from a similarity grouping of decisions based on the local structure of the game equality of available actions and analogy of locally foreseen subtrees - and possibly refined by additional information about crucial aspects of past play. The equilibrium concept considered is a (trembling-hand) perfect Nash equilibrium (Selten, 1975), in which players are required to choose the same (routine) behaviour for similar decisions. Based on the approach, it is shown how the Chain Store Paradox (Selten, 1978) can be resolved, and how mixed equilibria in the Centipede Game (Rosenthal, 1981) can be rationalised.

In this paper, we re-examine the causal relationship between government expenditure and economic growth by conducting the panel Granger causality test recently developed by Hurlin (2004, 2005) and by utilizing a richer panel data set which includes 182 countries that cover the period from 1950 to 2004. Our empirical results strongly support both Wagner's law and the hypothesis that government spending is helpful to economic growth regardless of how we measure the government size and economic growth. When the countries are disaggregated by income levels and the degree of corruption, our results also confirm the bi-directional causality between government activities and economic growth for the different subsamples of countries, with the exception of the low-income countries. It is suggested that the distinct feature of the low-income countries is likely owing to their inefficient governments and inferior institutions. (C) 2010 Society for Policy Modeling.

In particular, the equivalence scales applied to cash income are not necessarily appropriate when including non-cash income, because the receipt of public services is likely to be associated with particular needs. In this paper, we propose a theory-based framework designed to provide a coherent evaluation of the distributional impact of local public services. The valuation of public services, identification of target groups, allocation of expenditures to target groups, and adjustment for differences in needs are derived from a model of local government spending behaviour. Using Norwegian data from municipal accounts and administrative registers we find that the inclusion of non-cash income reduces income inequality by about 15% and poverty rates by almost one-third. However, adjusting for differences in needs for public services across population subgroups offsets about half the inequality reduction and some of the poverty decrease. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Against a background of, and to inform, heightened theoretical controversy as to the appropriate balance between trade and other taxes (not least the VAT), this paper uses panel data for 117 countries over 32 years cleaned for a variety of problems in standard data sources-to address a central question of fact: Have countries recovered from domestic taxes the revenues they have lost from past episodes of trade liberalization? For high income countries, the answer is clearly 'yes.' For middle income countries, there are robust signs of strong replacement both concurrently with the revenue loss and-essentially dollar-for-dollar-in the long run. Signs of significant recovery by low income countries are flimsier, however, and their experiences appear to have varied widely. The picture that emerges for low income countries is thus that replacement has been (and become) higher than previous studies have suggested, but sufficiently incomplete in many cases to give cause for concern.

In the presence of such portfolio restrictions, we need to confine our attention to aggregate arbitrage-free asset prices, i.e., for which there is no arbitrage in the space of marketed portfolios. Our main result states that such asset prices are quasi-equilibrium prices under standard assumptions and then deduces that they are equilibrium prices under a suitable condition on the accessibility of payoffs by agents, i.e., every payoff that is attainable in the aggregate can be marketed through some agent's portfolio set.

Duality of risk sensitivity to the multiplier version of min-max expected utility theory of Hansen and Sargent (2001) allows us to compute risk-sensitivity operators by solving two-player zero-sum games. Because the approximating model is a Gaussian probability density over sequences of signals and states, we can exploit a modified certainty equivalence principle to solve four games that differ in continuation value functions and discounting of time t increments to entropy. The different games express different dimensions of concerns about robustness. All four games give rise to time consistent worst-case distributions for observed signals. But in Games I-III, the minimizing players' worst-case densities over hidden states are time inconsistent, while Game IV is an LQG version of a game of Hansen and Sargent (2005) that builds in time consistency.

By revealing information on a common fundamental factor and thereby affecting the behavior of creditors, the failure of a single firm can trigger the failure of another firm. The model provides a unique equilibrium framework to assess the consequences of contagion and yields some hitherto unnoticed insights. While contagion increases the correlation among the financial failures of different firms, its impact on the incidence of failure is ambiguous. I consider an analytically tractable version of the model in which the effect on the ex ante failure probabilities is exactly zero. Moreover, the impact of contagion increases with the relevance of a common underlying fundamental, but is limited to firms near the brink of success or failure. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This paper investigates properties of debt stabilizing rules which link the needed budgetary adjustments to the state of the economy. The paper establishes that the magnitude of the target level of long-run debt is a key determinant of whether it is possible to find a rule of this type that can be implemented under all available fiscal instruments. Specifically, considering linear feedback rules, the paper demonstrates that there may well exist a critical target level of debt beyond which this is no longer possible. From an applied perspective, this finding is of particular relevance in the context of a monetary union with decentralized fiscal policies. Depending on the target level of debt, there might be a conflict between a common fiscal framework that tracks deficit developments as a function of the state of the economy and the unrestricted choice of fiscal policy instruments at the national level.","[Michel, Philippe; Von Thadden, Leopold; Vidal, Jean-Pierre] European Cent Bank, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Michel, P (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Kaiserstr 29, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany.",leopold.von_thadden@ecb.europa.eu,,,,,,,22,7,8,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

The transfers follow from a distributive liberal social contract defined as a redistribution of initial endowments such that the resulting market equilibrium allocation is both: (i) a distributive optimum (i.e., is Pareto-efficient relative to individual interdependent preferences) and (ii) unanimously weakly preferred to the initial market equilibrium. We elicit minimal conditions for meaningful social contract redistribution in this setup, namely, the weighted sums of individual interdependent utility functions, built from arbitrary positive weights, have suitable properties of nonsatiation and inequality aversion; individuals have diverging views on redistribution, in some suitable sense, at (inclusive) distributive optima; and the initial market equilibrium is not a distributive optimum. We show that the relative interior of the set of social contract allocations is then a simply connected smooth manifold of dimension n - 1. We also show that the distributive liberal social contract rules out transfer paradoxes in Arrow-Debreu social systems. We show, finally, that the liberal social contract yields a norm of collective action for the optimal provision of any pure public good.","Univ Metz, BETA, Inst Econ Publ, Metz, France",Universite de Lorraine,"Ythier, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Metz, BETA, Inst Econ Publ, Metz, France.",jean.mercier-ythier@wanadoo.fr,"Mercier Ythier, Jean/HGC-4687-2022","Mercier Ythier, Jean/0000-0001-9571-7458",,,,,30,5,5,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

To learn on which trading institutions to coordinate, traders follow behavioral rules of thumb that are based on the past performances of the trading institutions. Given the choice of institutions, market outcomes are determined by an equilibrium concept that allows for rationing. We find that full coordination on the market-clearing institutions without any rationing is a stochastically stable outcome, independently of the characteristics of the alternative available institutions.

A country's form of government has important economic and political consequences, but the determinants that lead countries to choose either parliamentary or presidential systems are largely unexplored. This paper studies this choice by analyzing the factors that make countries switch from parliamentary to presidential systems (or vice versa). The analysis proceeds in two steps. First, we identify the survival probability of the existing form of government (drawing on a proportional hazard model). In our model, which is based on 169 countries, we find that geographical factors and former colonial status are important determinants of survival probability. Also, presidential systems are, ceteris paribus, more likely to survive than parliamentary ones. Second, given that a change has taken place, we identify the underlying reasons based on panel data logit models. We find that domestic political factors are more important than economic ones. The most important factors relate to intermediate internal armed conflict, sectarian political participation, degree of democratization, and party competition, as well as the extent to which knowledge resources are distributed among the members of society.

I show that important theoretical differences exist between English and Vickrey pricing rules and those used in electronic auctions, due to the presence of bid increments. I also show, using data on eBay laptop sales, that these differences have practical significance. I explore the implications of bid increments for strategic bid selection in a static model within the symmetric independent private-value paradigm. I derive the unique symmetric equilibrium bid function, showing that the presence of bid increments can significantly alter bidder behavior. Using numerical methods, I also illustrate that these result in a highly non-linear bid function, in contrast to that predicted under either the English or the Vickrey formats. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In a society where many women are allocated to the elite, there are high returns for the non-elite men to rebel. Monogamy, or constrained polygyny, can pacify non-elite men, and thus serve the elite's reproductive interests. The more unequal is the society, the stricter constraints the elite want to impose on themselves. This suggests how monogamy might have arisen in response to rising class cleavages, e.g., in the wake of the introduction of agriculture. Another result is that, if the elite can write a law that commits not only themselves but also any group that would come to replace them in a rebellion, then polygyny will be more constrained than if they cannot. We speculate that the Church in Europe may have facilitated the imposition of such binding constraints.","York Univ, Dept Econ, N York, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",York University - Canada,"Lagerlöf, NP (通讯作者)，York Univ, Dept Econ, 4700 Keele St, N York, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",,,"Lagerlof, Nils Petter/0000-0002-8857-3262",,,,,45,12,14,1,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

The proposed model evaluates quantitatively the policy value provided by developing renewable energy (RE) in the face of uncertain fossil fuel prices and RE policy-related factors. The economic intuition underlying the policy-making process is elucidated, while empirical analysis illustrates the option value embedded in the current development policy in Taiwan for wind power. In addition to revealing the benefits that RE development provides when considering real options, analytical results indicate that ROA is a highly effective means of quantifying how policy planning uncertainty including managerial flexibility influences RE development. In addition to assessing the policy value of current RE development policy, this study also compares policy values in terms of internalized external costs and varying feed-in tariff (FIT). Simulation results demonstrate that the RE development policy with internalized CO2 emission costs is appropriate policy planning from sustainability point of view. Furthermore, relationship between varying FIT and policy values can be shown quantitatively and appropriate FIT level could be determined accordingly. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Such a framework matches numerous observations reported in the sociological and anthropological literature dealing with patronage relations in traditional setups. A central result derived from our model is that an asymmetric gift exchange equilibrium can occur only if the importance attached to social shame by a recipient is smaller than that attached to social esteem by a donor. Moreover, if this (necessary) condition is fulfilled, an asymmetric gift exchange will take place only if the recipient's productivity is neither too high nor too low. Finally, the possibility of a parasitic response of the gift recipient is more likely to be observed when the donee's sensitivity to social shame is low, or when his productivity is high.

Therefore, demand side dynamics depend on the wholesale prices of the domestic goods, the prices of the imported goods, the nominal exchange rate, the level of indirect taxes, the marginal cost of retail production and interest rates. Hence, this mechanism provides a theoretical basis for causality from wholesale prices to consumer prices. Being motivated by this causal transmission mechanism, this paper tries to examine the causal relationship between wholesale prices and consumer prices in a small developing economy like Pakistan. Empirical methodology uses recently developed tests for the existence of a long-run relationship between wholesale prices and consumer prices. Typically, in applied analysis, testing for the existence of cointegration and causality can only be carried out once the time series properties of the data have been established. For example, tests for cointegration require the variables to be integrated to the same order, typically I(1), prior to estimation. By eliminating the need for unit root pre-testing, the tests applied here considerably simplify the inference procedure. They also reduce the potential for distortions in the inference due to the unknown properties of the testing sequence. Our findings include robust evidence that, for Pakistan, there is a bidirectional causality between wholesale prices and consumer prices. Feedback impact shows that influences from the wholesale price index (WPI) to the consumers' price index (CPI) is stronger or dominating as compared to feedback from CPI to WPI supporting the Cushing-McGarvey (1990) hypothesis.","[Wahid, Abu N.

These methods have been applied to simple one-state, one-control quadratic-linear tracking models; however, large outliers may occur in a substantial number of the Monte Carlo runs when certain parameter sets are used in these models. Building on the work of Mizrach (1991) and Amman and Kendrick (1994, 1995), this paper tracks the source of these outliers to two sources: (1) the use of a zero for the penalty weights on the control variables and (2) the generation of near-zero initial estimate of the control parameter in the systems equations by the Monte Carlo routine. This result leads to an understanding of why both the unsophisticated optimal feedback (certainty equivalence) and the sophisticated dual methods do poorly in some Monte Carlo comparisons relative to the moderately sophisticated expected optimal feedback method.

In this paper a dynamic micro simulation model is used for calculating the financial and economic implications of the ageing problem and the policy measures considered. The model uses micro datasets of all Dutch pensions and pension entitlements. The retirement decision is modelled by using an option value approach. First, the paper discusses the baseline scenario of unchanged policies. The micro simulation results differ from previous macro CGE results. The state pension costs rise less sharply than the number of pensioners. Also the micro simulation model is used to analyse the redistributive character of the Dutch pension system, both through differences in pension entitlements and through differences in life expectancy, for different subgroups. The retirement decision is analysed with an option value based behavioural model. Secondly, the paper discusses the effects of five policy measures aimed at reducing the state pension costs and the sustainability gap: abolishment of the partner allowance (a measure that is already decided about), raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 years of age, introduction of a flat rate state pension at the same level as the current pension for partners of a couple, raising the taxation of wealthier pensioners by abolishing their tax exemption and introduction of a flexible retirement window with a high accrual to reward later retirement. For each measure, the budgetary effects, labour participation effects and redistributive effects are quantified and assessed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

First, product quality has not been fully considered in the measurement of sophistication, which has caused an overestimation of the sophistication of China's exports. Second, the average income of China has been used to measure the export capability of China, which has caused an underestimation of China's capability of exporting sophisticated goods.

A sequential algorithm is proposed to tackle this problem. Applied to the recent 1997 Asian crisis, the analysis confirms that breaks in variances always precede those in the dependence parameter.

Each sector contains a continuum of heterogeneous firms that produce differentiated goods within their sector. Trade is costly and there are both variable and fixed costs of exporting. The paper shows that under some plausible conditions supported by the data, trade between similar countries can increase the demand for skilled labor, which in turn increases the wage inequality between skilled and unskilled labor.

The Indian State of Maharashtra is a front-runner in formulating and implementing such a reform policy. Its policy aims at demand-led, participatory and democratic decision-making for project implementation (as distinct to the previous supply-driven policies). This paper evaluates the success of this reform policy for 12 villages of the Deccan Plateau in Maharashtra. There, these projects were implemented under two funding programs of different donors that implemented the reform policy through different guidelines. The paper confirms that promoting bottom-up decision-making supported by capacity building can lead to better outcomes. However, it also highlights several risks, which may be mitigated by selective top-down control mechanisms. Hence, a combination of bottom-up and top-down decision-making may lead to best results.

We find closed form solutions for a number of popularly traded energy derivatives such as: forwards, European call options written on spot prices and European Call options written on forward contracts. Our modeling approach is to first construct noisy supply and demand processes and then equate them to find an equilibrium price. This approach is very general while still allowing for sensitivity analysis within a valuation setting. Our assumption is that, in the presence of emission costs, traditional supply growth will slow down causing output prices of energy products to become more costly over time. However, emission costs do not immediately cause output price appreciation, but instead expose individual projects, particularly those with high emission outputs, to much more extreme risks through the cost side of their profit stream. Our results have implications for hedging and pricing for producers operating in areas facing a stochastic emission cost environment. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A two-factor (skilled and unskilled labour), two-sector Heckscher-Ohlin trade model is supplemented with an education sector which uses skilled labour and time to convert unskilled workers into skilled workers. A skilled worker's income depends on her ability, but all unskilled workers have the same income. Trade liberalisation in a relatively skilled labour abundant country increases the relative skilled wage and induces skill upgrading by the existing workforce, with younger and more able unskilled workers most likely to upgrade. But not all upgraders are better off as a result of the liberalisation. The older and less able upgraders are likely to lose. For an anticipated liberalisation we show that the preferred upgrading strategies depend on a worker's ability and that much of the upgrading will take place before the liberalisation. Hence some workers who would have upgraded had they anticipated the liberalisation will not if it is unanticipated, and adjustment assistance that applies only to post-liberalisation upgraders will fail to compensate some losers and distort the upgrading decisions of others.

This paper presents a survey of the literature, and then uses the technique of meta-regression analysis to establish insights into the nature of the demand for beer, wine and spirits. Unlike previous meta-studies of the demand for alcoholic beverages this study adjusts for the precision of each elasticity estimate. The analysis presented suggests reported elasticity estimates will be influenced by such factors as estimation technique, data frequency and time period under consideration. With respect to time, the findings suggest that the demand for alcoholic beverages has become less inelastic since the mid-1950s and that the income elasticity has been falling since the mid-1960s. The analysis also found support for the idea that alcohol as a commodity group is a necessity, and that consumers respond to price discounting with inventory behaviour rather than true substitution behaviour. Little support is found for the idea that the demand for alcoholic beverages varies fundamentally across most countries, although wine may be an exception.","Univ Western Australia, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Fogarty, J (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia.",,,,,,,,137,85,91,0,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

This finding holds better for the country pairs with more different capital-labor ratios as a result of the stronger distributional effects of RTAs. The support for the median voter model (lobbying model) is stronger when the two countries in a pair have left-oriented (right-oriented) governments.

Much of this debate remains in the urban and domestic water sector, thereby disregarding the struggles of marginalized urban and rural producers who use water for multiple purposes. Furthermore, while private providers are blamed for prioritizing profit over people, it is increasingly clear that while water may be a valuable commodity, the sector as a whole inhibits long-term profitability. Instead, using the concept of accumulation by dispossession, the current process of privatization is understood as a new round of enclosures of the commons, implemented by a neoliberal state to open up new territories to capitalist development and to capitalist forms of market behavior. The contraction of global markets and the reconfiguration of the public sector as notions of nation and citizenship take on new meanings allow for the commodification and privatization of public goods and assets. Using the case of a Mexican irrigation district the paper shows how notions of scarcity are mobilized during neoliberal reform to reconfigure social relations of agricultural production so as to free up land, water, and labor for the market. This has not only resulted in large-scale dispossession of land and water, but also in stripping a group of their collective rights, and thereby dismantling a collective identity forged on past struggles over land and water.","UNESCO IHE, Inst Water Educ, Delft, Netherlands",IHE Delft Institute for Water Education,"Ahlers, R (通讯作者)，UNESCO IHE, Inst Water Educ, Delft, Netherlands.",r.ahlers@unesco-ihe.org,"Quinn, Patrick/B-5489-2010; ahlers, rhodante/AAM-7150-2020","Subba, Rajkrishna/0000-0003-0051-0062",,,,,60,56,66,1,58,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

We model the movement of traded goods prices via a generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model and embed this within an expected utility maximising model of the production sector. The empirical results are consistent with expected utility maximisation and the hypothesis of risk neutrality is soundly rejected. Estimates of the effects of changes in expected prices and volatility of traded goods prices upon production decisions and the return to capital are discussed. The conclusion is that price uncertainty matters for the Australian production sector.,"[Woodland, Alan D.] Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Appelbaum, Elie] York Univ, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada",University of New South Wales Sydney; York University - Canada,"Woodland, AD (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",A.Woodland@unsw.edu.au,"Woodland, Alan/AAG-6239-2020; Woodland, Alan/J-9157-2012","Woodland, Alan/0000-0003-0523-6517; Woodland, Alan/0000-0003-0523-6517",,,,,30,4,5,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0249,,,ECON REC,Econ.

There is skepticism about the ability of econometric analysis to resolve these issues or of development agencies to learn from their own experience. In response, there is increasing use in development economics of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to accumulate credible knowledge of what works, without overreliance on questionable theory or statistical methods. When RCTs are not possible, the proponents of these methods advocate quasi-randomization through instrumental variable (IV) techniques or natural experiments. I argue that many of these applications are unlikely to recover quantities that are useful for policy or understanding: two key issues are the misunderstanding of exogeneity and the handling of heterogeneity. I illustrate from the literature on aid and growth. Actual randomization faces similar problems as does quasi-randomization, notwithstanding rhetoric to the contrary. I argue that experiments have no special ability to produce more credible knowledge than other methods, and that actual experiments are frequently subject to practical problems that undermine any claims to statistical or epistemic superiority. I illustrate using prominent experiments in development and elsewhere. As with IV methods, RCT-based evaluation of projects, without guidance from an understanding of underlying mechanisms, is unlikely to lead to scientific progress in the understanding of economic development. I welcome recent trends in development experimentation away from the evaluation of projects and toward the evaluation of theoretical mechanisms.

We use a simple multi-country general equilibrium model of a world economy, in which there are two types of cross-country spillovers: the first one generated by the international capital mobility and, the second one, by the presence of international public goods. In the absence of international public goods, although welfare in the non-cooperative case is typically lower than in the cooperative case, the welfare difference is negligible quantitatively.

The usual conditions for the stability of Walras' tatonnement are obtained as a limiting case from these conditions. The iteration leads to an equilibrium under a strengthened form of the weak axiom of revealed preferences introduced in the paper. Results for economies with global gross substitutability and no trade at equilibrium are also presented. Furthermore, it is shown that a rather general class of non-normalized iterations converges under the same conditions as the fixed-point iteration. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Entrepreneurs' willingness to invest and aggregate output is affected in two opposite ways. First, uncertainty about equity price or lack of market liquidity discourages technology adoption. This can explain slow technology adoption and limited participation by venture capitalists in underdeveloped equity markets. Second, fast adoption is a positive signal to imperfectly informed equity market participants. This provides a rational explanation for overpricing technology stocks and overinvestment in developed markets. Fast adoption is most probable at an intermediate quality of information.","Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Colchester C04 35Q, Essex, England",University of Essex,"Tinn, K (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester C04 35Q, Essex, England.",ktinn@essex.ac.uk,"Tinn, Katrin/AAF-7329-2020; Tinn, Katrin/A-6439-2019","Tinn, Katrin/0000-0001-5705-880X; Tinn, Katrin/0000-0001-5705-880X",,,,,39,6,7,2,36,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

We first explain the rationality using an overlapping-generations model with heterogeneous households possessing land-use rights or not, and find that economic agents profiting from land in the latter stage of their life tend to save less for retirement than their land-deprived counterparts. Empirical evidence from village-clustered Chinese survey data on rural households supports this finding, locating a significant negative effect of land on social and commercial endowment insurance purchase. Apart from the important policy implication of compensating land-deprived farmers with insurance, our theoretical and empirical models both yield unexpected informing findings. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The database used throughout is the User Data Base of the European Community Household Panel (ECHP). The proposed approach is based on the generalized hyperbolic distribution, which allows to model wage change distributions characterized by thick tales, skewness and leptokurtosis. Significant downward nominal wage rigidity is found in all countries under analysis, but the extent varies considerably across countries. Yearly estimates reveal increasing rigidity in Italy, Greece and Portugal, while rigidity is declining in Denmark and Belgium. The results imply that the costs of price stability differ substantially across Europe.","[Behr, Andreas] Univ Munster, Inst Econometr, D-48143 Munster, Germany; [Poetter, Ulrich] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Bochum, Germany",University of Munster; Ruhr University Bochum,"Behr, A (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Inst Econometr, Stadtgraben 9, D-48143 Munster, Germany.",andreas.behr@wiwi.uni-muenster.de,,,,,,,24,6,6,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1465-6485,,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

We propose a layer cake metaphor to capture the kernel of the ML approach and contrast it with the neoclassical metaphor of capital as an amorphous, homogeneous jelly. According to the ML approach, capital is combinatorial and is organized structurally and relationally. The approach examines capital as it exists out there in the world, as it is actually formed and experienced by entrepreneurs. Capital goods only exist and become productive once they are connected in entrepreneurs' production plans so that the focus is upon relations of complementarity between heterogeneous capital goods as used in production. Hence, capital has a layered structure: there is a nested hierarchy of capital goods, capital combinations and economy-wide capital structures. Using Bunge's theory of systems, we investigate how each of these entities is a concrete system at a different layer of economic reality. Both capital combinations and overall capital structure arise in an irreversible, causal-genetic process in real time and capital structure has the added distinction of being an emergent, spontaneous order.

Its intensity is either high or low, and unknown to the players. We considerMarkov perfect equilibria with beliefs as the state variable and show that all such equilibria exhibit an encouragement effect relative to the single-agent optimum. There is no equilibrium in which all players use cutoff strategies. Owing to the encouragement effect, asymmetric equilibria in which players take turns playing the risky arm before all experimentation stops Pareto dominate the unique symmetric equilibrium. Rewarding the last experimenter with a higher continuation value increases the range of beliefs where players experiment, but may reduce the intensity of experimentation at more optimistic beliefs. This suggests that there is no equilibrium that uniformly maximizes the players' average payoff.","[Keller, Godfrey] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Rady, Sven] Univ Munich, Dept Econ, D-80539 Munich, Germany",University of Oxford; University of Munich,"Keller, G (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",godfrey.keller@economics.ox.ac.uk; rady@lrz.uni-muenchen.de,,,,,,,18,53,85,0,12,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

Both these factors have helped to curb wage growth and to enhance employment growth, but have also led to a crisis in Italian labour productivity growth. Our estimates among 3,000 firms show that firms with a high share of flexible workers, a high labour turnover and lower costs of labour (relative to capital) experienced significantly lower rates of labour productivity growth. Our findings raise doubts about the mainstream call for flexibilisation of European labour markets.

Evidence on in-house electricity supply in Africa,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Generators; Ownership; Electricity; Reliability; Africa,COST; SECTOR; POOR,"This paper attempts to identify the underlying causes and costs of own generation of electric power in Africa. Rigorous empirical analysis of 8483 currently operating firms in 25 African countries shows that the prevalence of own generation would remain high (at around 20%) even if power supplies were perfectly reliable, suggesting that other factors such as firms' size, emergency back-up and export regulations play a critical role in the decision to own a generator. The costs of own-generation are about three times as high as the price of purchasing (subsidized) electricity from the public grid. However, because these generators only operate a small fraction of the time, they do not greatly affect the overall average cost of power to industry. The benefits of generator ownership are also substantial. Firms with their own generators report a value of lost load of less than US$50 per hour, compared with more than US$150 per hour for those without. Nevertheless, when costs and benefits are considered side by side, the balance is not found to be significantly positive. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Bargaining frictions add to the classical intertemporal distortion present in most monetary models, whereby agents work today to obtain cash that can be used only in future transactions. In this paper, we study the properties of optimal fiscal and monetary policy within the framework of Lagos and Wright (2005). We show that fiscal policy can be implemented to alleviate underproduction while money is still essential. If lump sum monetary transfers are available, a production subsidy can restore the efficiency of monetary equilibria. The Friedman rule belongs to the optimal policy set, but higher inflation rates are also possible. When lump-sum monetary transfers are not available, equilibrium allocations are generally not first-best. Nevertheless, fiscal policy still results in substantial welfare gains. Money can be extracted from circulation via a sales tax on decentralized market activities, and the Friedman rule is only optimal if the buyer has relatively low bargaining power.

The behavior we observe is consistent with a natural generalization of existing theories of industry dynamics that incorporates endogenous product selection within firms.

We put forward the trade-off between the benefits obtained through development cost-sharing and the cost of intensified competition due to reduced product differentiation, which implies that no-cooperation can be an equilibrium outcome. We allow for firms to cooperate partially, i.e., to develop some product components jointly, but not necessarily all components. This enables us to study the factors that may have an effect on the degree of cooperation in product development, both in the presence and in the absence of process R&D. We also analyze the interaction between cooperation decisions on product development and process R&D. By considering a direct link between the two, we show that the degree of cooperation in product development may adversely affect the intensity of cooperation in process R&D. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

If the stochastic discount factor and dividend process are analytic, then the resulting differential equation has analytic coefficients. Under these circumstances, the one-dimensional Cauchy-Kovalevsky Theorem can be used to prove that the solution to such an asset-pricing model is analytic. Also, this theorem allows for the development of a recursive rule, which speeds up the computation of an approximate solution. In addition, this theorem yields a uniform bound on the error in the numerical solution. Thus, the Cauchy-Kovalevsky Theorem yields a quick and accurate solution of many known asset-pricing models.","[Cosimano, Thomas F.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Finance, Mendoza Coll Business, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Chen, Yu] Idaho State Univ, Dept Math, Pocatello, ID 83209 USA; [Himonas, Alex A.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Math, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",University of Notre Dame; Idaho; Idaho State University; University of Notre Dame,"Cosimano, TF (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Dept Finance, Mendoza Coll Business, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",thomas.f.cosimano.1@nd.edu,"Himonas, A.

Both in the case of one-sided and two-sided markets, for introductory offers to be profitable when consumers can multihome, they need to be discriminatory and exclusive. In this setting, exclusivity as opposed to just commitment to purchase is critical - consumers must commit not to purchase from the rival in the future in order that introductory offers can work.

We highlight a mechanism through which the appearance of a product innovation results in an eventual reduction of the aggregate economic activity. When a new product appears, demand moves towards this more attractive product. The 'creative destruction' effect in this context is represented by the resources lost when firms producing old varieties exit the market due to the shortage of demand. Because firms producing a given product receive on average the same amount of demand, exits happen to be highly synchronized. We use this fact to explain the fluctuation asymmetries observed in real data. We test the ability of the model to meet features of real data against the United States' GDP in the 1950-1992 period.

An equilibrium of a complete information game is robust to incomplete information under non-common priors if for every incomplete information game where each player's prior assigns high probability on the event that the players know at arbitrarily high order that the payoffs are given by the complete information game, there exists a Bayesian Nash equilibrium that generates behavior close to the equilibrium in consideration. It is shown that for generic games, an equilibrium is robust under non-common priors if and only if it is the unique rationalizable action profile. Set-valued concepts are also introduced, and for generic games, a smallest robust set is shown to exist and coincide with the set of a posteriori equilibria. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

After this path-breaking paper, many mechanisms have been proposed to attain desirable allocations with public goods. Thus, economists have thought that the free-rider problem is solved, in theory. Our view to this problem is not so optimistic. Rather, we propose fundamental impossibility theorems with public goods. In the previous mechanism design, it was implicitly assumed that every agent must participate in the mechanism that the designer provides. This approach neglects one of the basic features of public goods: non-excludability. We explicitly incorporate non-excludability and then show that it is impossible to construct a mechanism in which every agent has an incentive to participate.","[Saijo, Tatsuyoshi] Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, Osaka 5670047, Japan; [Saijo, Tatsuyoshi] Univ Calif Los Angeles, CASSEL, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Yamato, Takehiko] Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Social Engn, Grad Sch Decis Sci & Technol, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1528552, Japan",Osaka University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Tokyo Institute of Technology,"Saijo, T (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, Osaka 5670047, Japan.",saijo@iser.osaka-u.ac.jp; yamato@valdes.titech.ac.jp,"Saijo, Tatsuyoshi/D-1788-2012; Yamato, Takehiko/B-7240-2015","Yamato, Takehiko/0000-0001-7552-865X",,,,,19,14,15,0,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

Using a national household panel containing demographic and billing information, we estimate own and cross-elasticities of demand for fixed and mobile services and find moderate substitution between the two. We control for the role of income effects by showing the subsidy has little effect on consumption of similar products and services. To account for potential bias due to endogeneity of program participation, a difference-in-differences analysis of re-sampled households results in estimates similar to the cross-sectional analysis. An asymmetry in the response to Lifeline participation arose depending on whether a household added or dropped Lifeline between samplings. We use the estimated demand parameters to simulate the impact of making the Lifeline program universal, or eliminating it altogether. In either case we find the net impact on combined fixed and mobile penetration is small. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We explain this U-shaped relationship by means of a Ricardian model of trade in vertically differentiated products between a developing country and the (developed) rest of the world. The model generates the U-shaped relationship because the preferences of the political majority (as captured by the median voter model) are shaped not only by the influence of inequality on the desire for redistribution, but also by the influence of inequality on the relative size of the tax base on which income taxes and tariffs are applied.","[Katsimi, Margarita; Moutos, Thomas] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, Athens 10434, Greece; [Katsimi, Margarita] CESifo, Munich, Germany",Athens University of Economics & Business; Ifo Institut,"Katsimi, M (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, 76 Patis Str, Athens 10434, Greece.",mkatsimi@aueb.gr; tmoutos@aueb.gr,"Moutos, Thomas/AAE-2552-2022",,,,,,30,6,6,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Our findings imply insignificant peace dividends once the conflict is resolved and the military spending is cut to internationally acceptable standards.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Econ, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben Gurion University,"Abu-Qarn, AS (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Econ, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",aamer@bgu.ac.il,/B-2723-2008,/0000-0003-1225-6436,,,,,20,7,8,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Estimators delivered by this algorithm for the example of a GARCH(1,1) model are dependent on some computational capabilities - namely number of iterations and replications performed. In this context, the Large Numbers Law might be applied in a completely different dimension. An alternative toward waiting until the historical data series are recorded (while the underling process may change several times) is to use computers for correctly extracting information from the most recent data. Given the existent computational support, it is also possible to determine estimates for the rates of convergence. As a result, potential benefits of this econometric technique can be gained in case of very young financial markets from Eastern European countries. Also, prediction and political decisions based on these estimations are properly grounded.","[Agapie, Adriana; Bratianu, Constantin] Acad Econ Studies, UNESCO Chair Business Adm, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Agapie, A (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, UNESCO Chair Business Adm, Bucharest, Romania.",agapie@clicknet.ro; cbratianu@yahoo.com,"Miclea, Adriana/S-6223-2019; CONSTANTIN, BRATIANU/L-3402-2018","Miclea, Adriana/0000-0001-5976-7351; CONSTANTIN, BRATIANU/0000-0002-1029-7384",,,,,15,2,2,0,9,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

In the first experiment, participants played the trust game and the dictator game with co-players of different ethnic affiliation. The family name of the players was exposed to their co-players. Results for the trust game showed no significant discrimination against co-players with foreign backgrounds. On the other hand, the results for the dictator game showed a statistically significant discriminatory behaviour by men against co-players with non-European backgrounds. The discriminatory behaviour was solely a male phenomenon. In the second experiment, the dictator game was replicated to check the stability of the results in the first experiment. The second experiment also examined whether people with foreign backgrounds discriminate against other people with foreign backgrounds; that is, the purpose was to discover whether discrimination is systematic. The observations in the second experiment underlined the results found in the first experiment: foreign co-players are discriminated against by Swedish players. However, we did not find that people with foreign backgrounds discriminated against other people with foreign backgrounds.","Vaxjo Univ, Ctr Labour Market Policy Res CAFO, Sch Management & Econ, SE-35195 Vaxjo, Sweden",Vaxjo University; Linnaeus University,"Ahmed, AM (通讯作者)，Vaxjo Univ, Ctr Labour Market Policy Res CAFO, Sch Management & Econ, SE-35195 Vaxjo, Sweden.",ali.ahmed@vxu.se,,,,,,,22,22,24,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In a static advertising game, an advertising equilibrium exists in which lower-cost firms select higher advertising levels. In this equilibrium, informed consumers rationally employ an advertising search rule in which they buy from the highest-advertising firm since lower-cost firms also select lower prices. In a repeated advertising game, colluding firms face a trade-off: the use of advertising can promote productive efficiency, but only if sufficient current or future advertising expenses are incurred. At one extreme, if firms pool at zero advertising, they sacrifice productive efficiency but also eliminate current and future advertising expenses. Focusing on symmetric perfect public equilibria for the repeated advertising game, we establish conditions under which optimal collusion entails pooling at zero advertising. More generally, full or partial pooling is observed in optimal collusion. Such collusive agreements reduce consumer welfare, since they restrict informed consumers' ability to locate the lowest available price in the market.","[Bagwell, Kyle] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Bagwell, Kyle] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lee, Gea M.] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, Singapore, Singapore",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Singapore Management University,"Bagwell, K (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,"LEE, Gea Myoung/D-1437-2009",,,,,,31,3,3,0,12,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Our second result is that the van den Elzen-Talman algorithm is a special case of the global Newton method, which was known only for the Lemke-Howson algorithm. More generally, the global Newton method implements the linear tracing procedure for any number of players. All three algorithms find generically only equilibria of positive index.

The analysis of each industrial sector is based on an unbalanced panel including data for eight EU member countries (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden and the UK) for the period 1991 to 2005. The panel-econometric approach, in which we account for country-specific fixed effects, is based on a factor demand model similar to the one derived in Collard et al. (2005) for the French service sector. On the one hand, our analysis provides some evidence for an electricity-saving effect on production, induced by communication technologies in all sectors considered. On the other hand, the effect of computers and software on the electricity intensity of industrial production is not that clear-cut, but it does seem to be strongly dependent on the sector-specific production processes involved. Overall, the net effect of ICT diffusion on electricity intensity of production appears to be in favour of an enhancement of electricity efficiency in production.","[Bernstein, Ronald; Madlener, Reinhard] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Fac Business Econ, EON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Future Energy Consumer Needs & Behav FCN, D-52056 Aachen, Germany",E-ON; RWTH Aachen University,"Madlener, R (通讯作者)，Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Fac Business Econ, EON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Future Energy Consumer Needs & Behav FCN, D-52056 Aachen, Germany.",rmadlener@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de,,,,,,,3,44,45,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We study this implementability notion in allotment economies with single-peaked preferences [Sprumont, Y., 1991. The division problem with single-peaked preferences: A characterization of the uniform allocation rule. Econometrica 59, 509-519]. The equal division rule and priority rules are characterized on the basis of secure implementability, which underlines a strong trade-off between efficiency and symmetry. Though the uniform rule is not securely implementable, we show that, in its direct revelation game, any bad Nash equilibrium is blocked by a credible coalitional deviation, and any good Nash equilibrium is never blocked. Thus the impossibility of securely implementing the uniform rule can be resolved by allowing pre-play communication among players. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Indeed, a significant percentage of job changes made by workers involves no interim unemployment. The object of the study is to develop and analyze a labor market model where unemployed workers and firms bargain over the wage paid if employment is accepted. Any employed worker can choose to search for another job but only at a cost. It will be shown that in such an environment the bargaining set is not convex. Nevertheless, utilizing a strategic bargaining game we show there is a unique bargaining outcome which may involve a lottery. The resulting market equilibrium exists and if the cost of search is low enough the resulting equilibrium is where some employees search on-the-job even in the case where both workers and firms are homogeneous.","[Bonilla, Roberto] Newcastle Univ, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Burdett, Kenneth] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Newcastle University - UK; University of Pennsylvania,"Bonilla, R (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.",roberto.bonilla@ncl.ac.uk; kennethb@ssc.upenn.edu,,"Bonilla, Roberto/0000-0001-5568-9165",,,,,21,2,2,0,4,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Recently, some authors have suggested that the SE may be also linked to the institutional setting (efficiency of the bureaucracy, regulations, corruption, etc.) so that just two stable equilibria are possible. In the good one, there is a small hidden sector, large fiscal revenues and honest/appreciated institutions. The other, bad, equilibrium is the opposite. Unlike the traditional approach, therefore, the recent literature argues that the tax burden and SE can be negatively correlated. Examining the links between these variables in relatively uncorrupt systems, this paper reconciles the two views. Theoretically, it claims that many different good equilibria can emerge whereby SE and its determinants are linked in complex and different ways. For instance, taxation and SE can go hand-in-hand, even taking into account the institutional framework. Empirical evidence for OECD countries supports both the model and the changing nature of the SE.","[Bovi, Maurizio] ISAE, Dept Macroecon, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Dell'Anno, Roberto] Univ Foggia, Dept Econ Math & Stat, I-71100 Foggia, Italy",University of Foggia,"Bovi, M (通讯作者)，ISAE, Dept Macroecon, Piazza Indipendenza 4, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",m.bovi@isae.it; r.dellanno@unifg.it,"Dell'Anno, Roberto/AAB-6385-2022","Dell'Anno, Roberto/0000-0001-7441-8328",,,,,29,23,24,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Using data envelopment analysis we find that the mean provider efficiency varies between 83 and 90 percent over the period. Productivity change over the period was around 12 percent, and this comprised 8 percent technology change and 4 percent technical efficiency change. A multivariate analysis is therefore performed, which shows that, in general, student-related variables such as gender, ethnic and age mix are more important than staff-related variables in determining efficiency levels. The local unemployment rate also has an effect on provider efficiency. The policy implications of the results are that further education providers should implement strategies to improve the completion and achievement rates of white males, and should also offer increased administrative support to teachers.","[Bradley, Steve; Johnes, Jill; Little, Allan] Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England",Lancaster University,"Bradley, S (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England.",s.bradley@lancaster.ac.uk,"Johnes, Jill/AAB-2233-2020","Johnes, Jill/0000-0002-1607-1810",,,,,29,23,26,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

In two of the treatments the pay-offs are hypothetical. In the first of these, a short cheap talk script was used and subjects were required to state their own preferences in this scenario. In the second treatment, subjects were asked to state how they believed the average student would respond to the choices. In the third treatment the pay-offs were real, allowing us to use the results to compare the validity of the two hypothetical treatments. Our hypothesis is that when subjects are asked to state how they believe an average person would respond, they will use their own preferences in their responses without using the survey situation for self-enhancement. However, we find a large difference in the results from both hypothetical treatments compared to the real money treatment. We find that the marginal willingness to pay for donations is higher when subjects state their own preferences but lower when subjects state what they believe are other people's preferences.

We present three main findings. First, an adverse financial shock leads to a decline in the manufacturing sector's output and employment that peaks about 11 months afterward. Next, this shock has a much greater impact on the durables sector than the nondurables sector. Last, continuing financial market weakness in 1933 and 1934 may have restrained the recovery from the Great Depression. The findings suggest that financial market weakness contributed to the length and depth of the Great Depression, and that this occurred mainly through the investment channel.

Also, a huge amount of research has been done on the association between income inequality and health for which numerous proxies have been used. We seek to link these two strands of scholarship by treating smoking as a major health hazard and considering the association between income inequality and smoking. Using US state-level data for the year 2004, we estimate an augmented model of cigarette consumption in which income inequality is added to a fairly standard specification. Subject to the caveats appropriate for such studies, there is little indication of a significant association between income inequality and the health-retarding behaviour in the form of cigarette smoking.

Results illustrate that omitted factors are quite important. Drinking coefficient magnitudes fall substantially in regressions that control for risk and time preference, mental health, self-esteem and consumption of other addictive substances. Moreover, the impact of binge drinking is negligible for students who are less risk averse, heavily discount the future or use other drugs. However, effects that remain significant after accounting for unobserved heterogeneity and are relatively large for risk averse, future-oriented and drug-free students suggest that binge drinking might slightly worsen academic performance. Consistent with this, the relationship between grades and drinking without binging is small and insignificant on the extensive margin and positive on the intensive margin.","[DeSimone, Jeff] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Econ, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [DeSimone, Jeff] Univ Texas Arlington, Natl Bur Econ Res, Arlington, TX 76019 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington,"DeSimone, J (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Econ, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.",jdesimone@uta.edu,,,,,,,35,11,14,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

According to our results, the null hypothesis of linear cointegration between stock prices and dividends is rejected in favour of a two-regime threshold cointegration model. We find also that stock prices do not respond to equilibrium error, and dividends respond to the past divergence only if the deviation from the equilibrium error does not exceed the estimated threshold parameter.

We investigate the technology choice of firms and consumers in a formal model of the private transport market. Two competing technologies exist; today's internal combustion engine based on fossil fuels, and tomorrow's hydrogen car. Due to network externalities, several market equilibria may exist, of which one is likely to Pareto dominate the other(s). Thus, a lock-in situation is possible. On the other hand, if either the costs of establishing hydrogen filling stations are too high or the hydrogen car technology is still in its infancy, the only equilibrium is the current internal combustion engine equilibrium. Hence, apart from internalizing the environmental externality on gasoline cars, the government has no reason to intervene before the technology is ripe.","[Heggedal, Tom-Reiel] Norwegian Sch Management, Oslo, Norway",BI Norwegian Business School,,mgr@ssb.no; tom-reiel.heggedal@bi.no,,,,,,,30,8,8,0,19,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

In this paper, I postulate a government that uses trade and pollution policy to maximize a weighted welfare function where domestic producers get a higher weight than consumers. International trade is regulated by either a tariff or a quota, and pollution is regulated using a pollution tax. I find that if the government has full control on both trade and pollution policy, endogenously created quantitative distortions (quantitative restrictions) have the same effect as price distortions (tariffs).","Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Gulati, S (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",sumeet.gulati@ubc.ca,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,3,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Moreover, all these types of risk has been recently introduced by Solvency II into the insurance sector. Since the operational risk is a relatively new subject of modeling and measuring, there are still many unanswered questions. Generally, the risk estimation for a complex portfolio (ie. many intersections of business lines and risk event types) can be obtained by following a top-down or a bottom-up approach. Notwithstanding, for performance measuring it is important to be able to allocate the available capital for particular units due to its real consumption as given by the true contribution to the overall amount of risk. In this paper we apply the loss distribution approach for the combinations (intersections) of operational risk events types and business lines which we treat as marginal distributions. Then we estimate the overall risk exposure by means of basic copula functions assuming several types of dependency and illustrate its impact on capital requirements.","[Havlicky, Jiri; Tichy, Tomas] Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,,jiri.havlicky@gmail.com; tomas.tichy@vsb.cz,"Tichy, Tomas/ABH-9773-2020; Tichy, Tomas/AAA-1564-2021","Tichy, Tomas/0000-0002-6503-5330",,,,,13,0,0,0,2,"UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,CESKE BUDEJOVICE, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZ-370 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-218-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,220,225,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS47,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287979900038,0

The SHIW provides information on consumption, income and wealth, and a sizable panel component that allows econometricians to estimate sophisticated income, consumption, and wealth processes and to analyze labor market and portfolio transitions. We find that over the sample period income inequality is higher and has grown faster than consumption inequality. Most of the increase in income inequality is related to an increase in the degree of earnings' instability rather than to shifts in the wage structure. We suggest that, in particular, the labor market reforms of the 1990s and 2000s are the most plausible explanation of the increased earnings inequality. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The data consist of 12,000 rental households in the free-market and municipal sectors. The effect is estimated using the programme reform of 2002 as an instrument. The reform increased the allowance of the assisted households depending on housing characteristics, but it had little effect on the eligibility. Results suggest that in the private sector, one additional euro of allowance increases the rent of claimants by 60-70 cents. The effect is zero in the municipal sector, as rents are tied to the housing costs.","Govt Inst Econ Res, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland",,"Kangasharju, A (通讯作者)，Govt Inst Econ Res, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland.",aki.kangasharju@vatt.fi,,,,,,,23,18,18,1,15,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0347-0520,,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

This study employs the bounds test for Level Relationships and Granger causality tests to investigate a long-run equilibrium relationship between international trade and real income growth, and the direction of causality among themselves in three selected Pacific Islands: Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands. Results reveal that a long run equilibrium relationship can be inferred between international trade and economic growth in the case of Fiji and Solomon Islands whereas economic growth is cointegrated only with exports of goods and services in Papua New Guinea. Granger causality test results show that there are bidirectional causality between exports and economic growth, and between exports and imports in Fiji Islands. Economic growth in Solomon Islands stimulates a growth in exports of goods and services, and exports stimulates a growth in imports of goods and services. No causal relationship has been obtained between international trade (both exports and imports) and economic growth in the case of Solomon Islands. The major finding of this study is that trade-led growth hypothesis cannot be inferred for the Pacific Islands.","[Katircioglu, Salih] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Famagusta, Northern Cyprus, Turkey; [Eminer, Fehiman; Aga, Mehmet; Ozyigit, Ahmet] Near East Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Nicosia, Northern Cyprus, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University; Near East University,"Katircioglu, S (通讯作者)，Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, POB 95,Via Mersin 10, Famagusta, Northern Cyprus, Turkey.",salih.katircioglu@emu.edu.tr; feminer@neu.edu.tr; mehmetaga@neu.edu.tr; aozyigit@neu.edu.tr,"Katircioglu, Salih T./H-3494-2016; Ozyigit, Ahmet/D-1088-2019","Ozyigit, Ahmet/0000-0002-0717-8528",,,,,29,4,4,0,6,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

This article examines how the raw milk market in western and central Kenya has developed after the dairy sector liberalisation in 1992 by using panel data of 862 rural households. From the late 1990s to 2004, the proportion of rural households who sold milk increased from 37 to 51%. During the same period, the proportion of households who sold milk to traders more than doubled, while it declined from 29 to 12% for those who sold milk to dairy cooperatives. On the basis of the price differentials between the farm gate and retail prices, we find that the functioning of the market improved between the late 1990s and 2004; in turn, the development of the milk market has increased the adoption of improved cows, resulting in higher milk sales.","[Kijima, Yoko] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Syst & Informat Engn, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan; [Yamano, Takashi] Fdn Adv Studies Int Dev, Tokyo, Japan; [Yamano, Takashi] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, Tokyo, Japan; [Baltenweck, Isabelle] Int Livestock Res Inst, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Tsukuba; National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI),"Kijima, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Syst & Informat Engn, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan.",kijima@sk.tsukuba.ac.jp,"Kijima, Yoko/HJI-7875-2023","Kijima, Yoko/0000-0003-1568-1358",,,,,26,5,5,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The author of the article analyses the implementation of the Lisbon agenda in Estonia (in 2000-2009) and tries to evaluate Estonia's perspectives in post-Lisbon strategy (in 2010-2020). The research problem in this article is: implementation of Lisbon strategy (EU-Strategy 2020) in changed financial and economic circumstances. Since 2000, the European Commission has been measuring the innovation performance of countries with the help of the European Innovation Scoreboard (EIS) which is the instrument developed by the European Commission, under the Lisbon strategy, to provide a comparative assessment of the innovation performance of EU Member States annually. Estonia's innovation performance has been increasing over the past five years in relation to the EU average, taking the lead in the moderate innovators' group in 2008 and in the Innovation followers' group in 2009 Estonia is reaching the EU mean level according to summary innovation index and has a relatively high growth rate for its level. However, elaborated analysis shows some relevant problems. According to the prognosis made in the strategy of Knowledge Based Estonia, employment in 20072013 in the high technology sector will grow about 19,800 employees, diminishing at the same time employment by the same amount in other sectors. This means that actually there is an acute need for highly qualified specialists (with doctorate degrees) for the Estonian high technology sector. First of all this indicates a need for additional investments in higher educational institutions. In Knowledge Triangle conception two main tendencies of the development are related: innovative rearrangements in economy and in higher educational sphere and, second, the increase of Estonian economic competitiveness. Today in Estonia modernisation of universities is a key element for enhancing competitiveness. At the same time there is some backwardness in higher educational sphere compared with EU neighbour countries. Other aspects of the knowledge triangle concern the creation of new economic mechanisms (concrete business solutions) and a new structure of institutions to carry out a new comprehensive and dynamic innovation model. In the process of globalisation, where Europe will need a new understanding of financial and economic integration concerning all EU member states and their own mission, Estonia must focus on the challenge of small country being more flexible economically and taking a chance in quick rearrangements of the higher education system.","Tallinn Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Dept Int Relat, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,"Kirch, A (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Dept Int Relat, Akad Tee 3, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia.",Aksel.Kirch@tseba.ttu.ee,,,,,,,36,3,3,0,10,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

One of capitalism's main virtues is the strong incentive it gives to dynamism, enterprise and the innovation process. Every revolutionary new product (for civilian use) has been brought about by the capitalist system. The socialist system was capable at most of developing new military products. The article analyzes how far the radical difference can be explained by the innate tendencies and basic attributes of the two systems. Our daily lives have been transformed by these new products (for instance, the sphere of information and communications by the computer, the mobile phone and the internet). While many people see all these as favourable changes, fewer discern the causal relation between the capitalist system and rapid technical progress. Yet the usual syllabus of microeconomics does not enlighten students on this important virtue of capitalism, neither it is not adequately emphasized in the statements of leading politicians.","[Kornai, Janos] Coll Budapest, H-1014 Budapest, Hungary; [Kornai, Janos] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kornai, Janos] Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary",Harvard University; Central European University,"Kornai, J (通讯作者)，Coll Budapest, Szentharomsag U 2, H-1014 Budapest, Hungary.",kornai@colbud.hu,"János, Kornai/N-3078-2014",,,,,,76,18,21,0,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0967-0750,,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

This paper proposes that they are both valid, and further that the classical economics, with its numerical data, informs the behaviourist approach. Of particular note is that around 4 out of every 5 managers acknowledged the influences of representativeness, availability bias, overconfidence and anchoring. Such a high proportion provides compelling supportive evidence of the primacy of behavioural economics in decision-making, and that in consequence, the gyrations of investment portfolios are more satisfactorily explained with reference to the personality profiles and psychological traits of the major active market participants than they are by reference to data and numerical analysis, as classical economists would claim.","Yasar Univ, Dept Fin, Izmir, Turkey",Yasar University,,,"Aktan, Bora/S-6019-2017","Aktan, Bora/0000-0002-1334-3542",,,,,38,1,1,0,23,NATL ACAD MANAGEMENT,KYIV,"VUL PANASA MYMOGO 26, KYIV, 01011, UKRAINE",1993-6788,,,ACTUAL PROBL ECON,Actual Probl.

I present a simple statistical model that relates the wages of workers at different points in their lifecycle to the earnings of their parents. I decompose cross-sectional variance of wages into a permanent component related to parental background, a permanent component unrelated to parental background, and a transitory component. Data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) suggests that intergenerational relationships are stronger when measured later in the lifecycle of the son. This implies that the permanent parent-related component is increasingly important for wage determination as workers grow older. This is not consistent with wage evolution through persistent random shocks. Rather, it is consistent with human capital models and learning models of wage evolution.","Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Mayer, A (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",amayer@econmail.tamu.edu,,,,,,,30,1,2,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Although the Burmese regime has signed Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with the Thai Government, a lack of will on the part of the Burmese Government to implement the MoUs has left undocumented Burmese migrants worse off than their Laotian and Cambodian counterparts. In addition, the Thai Government's corrupt and discriminatory law enforcement record and its failure to protect labour rights have led to ongoing violence against migrant workers, as well as to their exploitation and trafficking by unscrupulous recruiters. The Thai Government, and Thai society at large, should acknowledge the positive contribution of migrant workers to the Thai economy and improve their working and living conditions.

The effectiveness of the organization activity is determined by the level of provision with tangible fixed assets and its rational usage in economic processes. The aforementioned accounting is important in the management system of any organization that provides valuable information for the production organizers. The organization managers and specialists must have operative knowledge about tangible fixed assets, its physical condition, depreciation and level of provision. Such knowledge is useful for control of asset's reception and its turnover, while analyzing its usage effectiveness. (Domeika, 2008). In the organization activity, accounting is becoming the system of registration, grouping and generalization of economic operations expressed in money, which is meant to adopt economical decisions and make financial reports. According to Valanciene, Strumickas (2009), one of the main tools that help to guarantee successful activity of the organization, is flexible accounting system suitable for management of changes and timely informing of management. According to Markovic (2008), the successful companies in the future will be the ones, which are wise enough to harness the full potential of the entire organization in the rapidly changing business environment. Accounting provides data about the results of organization's activity and money flows, and its information is used to evaluate the organization's activity, adopt management decisions and predict future perspectives. Such definition stresses the importance of accounting for economical processes. The success of each organization personal enterprise, major international organization or public institution, depends on the accounting conceptions and practical skills (Vecerskiene, Valanciene, Boguslauskas, 2008). Therefore accounting needs scientific researches, results of which would help to form the legislation basis and methods of accounting, to correct and develop accounting standards, to form accounting systems of companies' management, and to investigate the cases of their practical implementation. The practical accounting problems of long-term tangible result need scientific researches, while scientific researches require practical results. This helps to transfer accounting to another qualitative level and render knowledge for future practicians. The conditions of knowledge economy have determined global changes, which are changing the nature of organization's (Valanciene & Gimzauskiene, 2007). The real competitive advantage of the organization is made from the combination of several factors: knowledge, skills, technologies, work methods and information (Boguslaukas & Kvedaraviciene, 2009). In order to prepare correct and accurate financial and tax reports, the method of united configuration accounting of tangible fixed assets (TFA) is needed, which would help to coordinate the provisions of Business Accounting Standards (BAS) and requirements of Law on Corporate Income Tax (WIT), and which are needed for the preparation of an accurate and correct financial and tax report. The article reveals the significance of the selection of accounting methodology of tangible fixed assets for the reflection of organization's financial results, analyzes variety of TFA methods, statutory standards of accounting of tangible fixed assets and problems of their compatibility, reveals the influence of discrepancies in the accounting methods of depreciation of tangible fixed assets on the organization's activity results, and presents the research results on the application of TFA methods in the Lithuanian organizations.","[Mykolaitiene, Violeta; Vecerskiene, Giedre; Jankauskiene, Kristina; Valanciene, Loreta] Kaunas Univ Technol, Laisves Av 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Mykolaitiene, V (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Laisves Av 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",violeta.mykolaitien@ktu.lt; giedre.vecerskiene@ktu.lt; kristina.jankauskiene@ktu.lt; loreta.valanciene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,26,6,7,1,26,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

This is an area where broadband diffusion is just starting to take off and there is a lack of empirical evidence. In this context, a first interesting point is the fact that certain demographic variables (income and education) appear to be more correlated with Internet access as such than with the type of access.

In some of the euro zone countries the main factor that contributed to the deterioration of their international competitiveness was the negative feedback loop between low level of real interest rate and unsustainable credit boom. The experiences of Spain and Ireland illustrate that unsustainable credit booms are possible also in case of these monetary union members that are highly advanced in real convergence and succeeded both in liberalizing their labor markets and keeping budgets in balance. In the case of the Central and Eastern European (CEE) catching-up economies the risk of a fall in real interest rates that might trigger unsustainable credit boom is augmented by inflationary pressures stemming from the Balassa-Samuelson effect (BSE) and the convergence of their price levels towards the average euro zone level. The important lesson from the euro zone experiences for the CEE countries is the necessity to tighten banking supervision in order to shield their economies against the risk of an unstable lending boom after joining the euro zone.,"Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Slawinski, A (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",,,,,,,,55,2,2,0,4,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

Consistent with previous studies, though beta plays no role under unconditional framework, there is evidence of a significantly positive (negative) risk premium on beta during periods of up (down) markets, supporting for the continuous use of beta as a risk measure. Interestingly, our results show that firm size is the only significant variable in explaining average returns under the unconditional framework but its impact becomes much less under the up and down market conditions. However, significant conditional effect of E/P is found. Although, B/M alone is not significantly conditionally related to returns, in various combinations with beta, it becomes significant and the joint role of beta and B/M, due to an interaction effect between them, has an 'amplified' gain in the explanatory power. Our study suggests that beta does not suffice to explain the cross-sectional variations of returns, but it is possible that the joint effect of beta and B/M may be a surrogate as an underlying and more fundamental factor that is missing in the conditional SLB model. We also find evidence that investors in the Singapore stock market react virtually the same to these firm-specific factors and to beta during up and down markets. Our results are robust for both beta-size and size-beta sorting procedures and for both value- and equally weighted market proxies.","[Tang, Gordon Y.

The main task of auditing is to establish whether the correct types of safety methods are used and whether they are effectively implemented. The safety auditing in Estonian enterprises (on the basis of European Union legislation, Standards OHSAS 18001: 1999 and BS 8800: 1996) is only in the beginning stage. As the prerequisite to the paper the safety auditing in 12 medium-and small-scale enterprises in Estonia from 5 branches of industry (metal and wood processing, plastic, garment and printing) has been carried out. The modified Diekemper & Spartz (D&S) method has been used. The D&S method addresses 30 activities, divided into five activity areas: organization and administration; industrial hazard control; fire control and industrial hygiene; supervisory participation, motivation and training; accident investigation, statistics and reporting procedures. The maximum score was gained in the plastics industry: 62.9% and the minimum score in a printing industry: 40.9%. Economically developed enterprises have possibilities to pay also more attention to safety matters. The cost-effectiveness of the planned safety measures is calculated. The method considers the cost, the effectiveness and the uncertainty of the safety measure (Roed method). These three variables integrate the cost-effectiveness of a safety measure. The most cost-effective measures by investigated industries were: provide the workers with protective footwear in metal industry; the analysis of the spectrum of noise in printing industry; analysis of chemicals in the workrooms' air (risk analysis of chemicals) in plastic industry; the analysis of chemicals and medical examinations of workers in wood processing industry; advanced training of workers to prevent the injuries with fingers in garment industry. The safety policy and safety plan that set the framework for health and safety activities in enterprises are usually not available in written form in Estonian firms. In addition, there is a need for raising the awareness of workers in the field of occupational health and safety. Supervisory participation, motivation and training were the activities that received quite low scores. The recommendations to the employers were given: to improve the information of workers, motivation to use the personal protective equipment and to carry out continuing training of workers as well as the leaders in work safety and health.","[Tint, Piia; Paas, Onnela; Reinhold, Karin] Tallinn Univ Technol, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,"Tint, P (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, Ehitajate 5, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia.",piia.tint@tseba.ttu.ee; onnela.pass@tvesi.ee; karinhold@tseba.ttu.ee,"Reinhold, Karin/ABB-2011-2021",,,,,,31,8,10,0,18,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

However, regressions based on budgetary variables tend to overpredict public investment during the post-1990 period, i.e. when the budgetary stress eased. We supplement the budgetary consolidation approach to public investment with ideas from behavioural economics to explain why these investments do not increase when additional budgetary resources are available. We use the peak/end evaluation procedure to capture the frustration of voters as cuts in government consumption expenditures accumulate. This 'memory-effect' of budgetary consolidations implies that voters recall the previous peak in government consumption expenditures. They remain discontent as long as current expenditures are below the peak value. When the budgetary situation improves, policy makers will choose to increase government consumption because this is electorally more rewarding. Public investment will thus decline when budgetary consolidations are imposed and will remain constant when additional budgetary resources emerge. We test for a memory-effect by introducing expenditure gaps in public investment regressions. These gaps equal the difference between the highest previously observed primary government consumption to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratio and the current ratio. The regression results for most EU countries support our assumption.","[Vuchelen, Jef; Caekelbergh, Stijn] Vrije Univ Brussel, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Vuchelen, J (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Brussel, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",Jef.Vuchelen@vub.ac.be,,,,,,,37,6,6,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A nonlinear threshold model is developed, with the threshold variable of the real GDP growth dividing the model into two regimes: strong economy and weak economy. The model is used to test again for liquidity constraints on consumers in the ten Asian countries analyzed in Habibullah et al. (2006). Of the ten countries, seven are found to exhibit nonlinearity in their consumption data. This confirms that levels of economic growth affect the proportion of consumers who are liquidity-constrained. Weak economic growth is found to be associated with higher levels of liquidity constraints, and strong economic growth with lower levels of constraints.","[Lee, Yuan-Ming] So Taiwan Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei, Taiwan",Southern Taiwan University of Science & Technology,,,"Wang, Kuan Min/H-5247-2019","Wang, Kuan Min/0000-0002-0237-0596; Lee, Yuan-ming/0000-0002-4054-2651",,,,,42,1,1,0,6,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

We also consider the abilities of refugee and non-refugee immigrants to offset the trade-inhibiting influence of cultural distance. Our results show that while immigrants, in general, exert positive influences on US imports from - and exports to - their home countries, the influence of refugee immigrants is quite minimal when compared with that of non-refugee immigrants. For both immigrant types, however, evidence supporting the notion that immigrants act to offset cultural distance is observed.

With the outbreak of BSE in Canada, the US ceased imports of Canadian cattle and beef products. This study analyses the short to medium-term effect of the import trade ban for the US economy using a 20 sector, economy wide Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. Uncertainty about exogenous elasticity values was addressed using Monte Carlo techniques. Beneficiaries of the trade ban are the cattle industry and related sectors, such as feed production and agricultural service providers. The US economy as a whole, however, is negatively affected with a loss of $-1.7 billion in gross domestic product and -11000 jobs.

The research question is to what extent labour market entry success is affected by graduates' characteristics and how different groups of graduates differ in probabilities of finding their first jobs. The study of chances of young people in entering the labour market is important for a number of reasons. It is important from the point of view of education policy and its intermediary role in matching labour demand with labour supply. It is also important from the point of view of the human capital formation and long run macroeconomic performance of the economy. Successful entry into the labour market reduces the problem of human capital depreciation and results in greater flexibility of the labour market. The analysis reveals that demographic variables, marital status, age, level of education, various measures of human capital as well as social capital characteristics play important role in determining the chance of finding first job for a graduate. Groups of graduates with higher chances are: male graduates with tertiary education, living in larger cities, with high levels of various measures of human capital and social activities characteristics. There are also interesting regional disparities as well as important role of a business cycle.","Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ, Dept Macroecon & Trade Theory, PL-00325 Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Wincenciak, L (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ, Dept Macroecon & Trade Theory, PL-00325 Warsaw, Poland.",lwincenciak@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Wincenciak, Leszek/C-4328-2019","Wincenciak, Leszek/0000-0002-9872-4239",,,,,16,1,1,0,14,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,2299-6184,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2010,,6,,,,,859,876,,,,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,714BW,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000286783500006,0

We document some stylized facts in the patterns and sources of efficiency change in Korean and American pharmaceutical firms. The evidence shows that ownership structure can substantially influence the efficiency of pharmaceutical firms. Especially, institutional ownership rate affects corporate efficiencies negatively, corroborating the myopic institutional investor hypothesis. The hypothesis is supported by both Korean and American samples. However, we find evidence that foreign ownership in Korea promotes efficiency of pharmaceutical firms. It is shown that R&D intensity is positively related to contemporaneous largest ownership rate and prior foreign ownership rate in Korean pharmaceutical firms. In contrast, little evidence is found on the relationship between ownership structure and R&D intensity in the American pharmaceutical industry. These empirical results are robust even after we check the causal links among efficiency, R&D and ownership.","[You, Taewoo] Myongji Coll, Dept Business, Seoul 120776, South Korea; [Holder, Mark E.] Kent State Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Finance, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Chen, Xiaoying] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Coll Business Adm, Dept Finance, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA",University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Kent; Kent State University Salem; California State University System; California State University Long Beach,"You, T (通讯作者)，Myongji Coll, Dept Business, 356-1 Hongeun3 Dong, Seoul 120776, South Korea.",taewooyou@mjc.ac.kr,"You, Taewoo/Y-3288-2019","You, Taewoo/0000-0001-7798-6558",,,,,51,12,14,1,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The article draws trajectories of improvement of managerial decisions, and organization climate; it discusses the structure of diagnostics dysfunctional relations of employees, prevention and intervention of conflicts. The article refers to the works of P. F. Drucker, H. A. Simon, J. F. Yates, K. Tafel-Viia, R. Alas, C. Seydl, B. Meschkutat, M, Stackelbeck, G. Lagengoff, A. Valackiene, P. Zakarevicius, P. Zukauskas, J. Vveinhardt and other works. As a brief review of the researches performed in Lithuania and abroad on mobbing, organization's commitment, a manager's role, the sequence of actions that should guarantee positive influence upon organization climate is presented. In emphasising the complexity of the phenomenon, it pointed out that attention is hardly paid to managerial decisions on conflicts' mobbing. In solving any problem it is very important to specifically diagnose, to formulate and to assess it. The model of managerial intervention decisions of mobbing as discrimination in employees' relations, designed by the authors of the article, presents certain, specific interrelated stages. The field of the first decision discloses the factor of information about dissemination of the phenomenon of mobbing, which separates into: understanding of the phenomenon by society, trade unions and their pressure; decisions of manager's will that involve understanding of the phenomenon and its interconnection to organization's activity. The field of the second decision reveals the importance of the solution of problems in human resource management, i.e. variety of workforce. It involves the policy of minorities that are understood at the level of every person with individual differences; of procedures of employment, involvement and discharge; of career, stimulation and reward; of internal communication, of competition; of conflict resolution; organization climate, culture development. In the field of the third decision two stages are distinguished. The first stage seeks to fix employees' claims; to operatively and objectively react to them as well as to evaluate the situation in question. Having performed the evaluation, in the second stage the rulebook, code of work ethics, as well as abilities of personnel to resolve conflicts are integrated. The article suggests the corrections of structural system of activity organization settled in Lithuania. According to J. F. Yates (1990), managers understand their responsibility in making good decisions, but only few of them perceive that a manager does not avoid a role of decision manager. P. F. Drucker states that organizations are more and more based on trust, though the trust does not mean that people like each other; thus it is necessary to absolutely take responsibility for interrelationship at work, and the responsibility for relations is the duty of the employees. The authors of the article follow the attitude that main responsibility for the expression of mobbing as discrimination in employees' relations goes to an organization's manager. The composed structure-gram helps organizations to envisage the process and character of intervention decisions of mobbing as discrimination in employees' relations. Thus, when solving the problem of mobbing as discrimination, responsibility of organization's employees and prevention of the phenomenon as well as development of intervention system.","[Zukauskas, Pranas; Vveinhardt, Jolita] Vytautas Magnus Univ, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Zukauskas, P (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, Daukanto Str 28, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania.",p.zukauskas@evf.vdu.lt; j.vveinhardt@evf.vdu.lt,"Vveinhardt, Jolita/AAB-6754-2020","Vveinhardt, Jolita/0000-0001-6231-9402",,,,,39,8,8,0,22,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Bad quality governance has clearly been much less damaging (if at all) in some economies than in others. Why this is so is a question that has largely been ignored, and the intention of this paper is to provide an answer. We develop a dynamic general equilibrium model in which growth occurs endogenously through the invention of new goods based on research and development activity. For such activity to be undertaken, firms must acquire complementary licenses from public officials who are able to exploit their monopoly power by demanding bribes in exchange for these (otherwise free) permits. We show that the effects of corruption depend on the extent to which bureaucrats coordinate their rent-seeking behaviour. Specifically our analysis, predicts that countries with organised corruption networks are likely to display lower levels of bribes, higher levels of research activity and higher rates of growth than countries with disorganised corruption arrangements.

We distinguish among performance, process, and design standards, and study the relative merit of each type of regulatory instrument. Relative to previous work on standards design, we emphasize technology and process verification. An optimal performance standard is relatively strict when regulator and firm preferences are congruent, but the regulator may prefer no performance standard at all if verification costs are sufficiently high. A process standard unambiguously increases expected surplus (relative to no regulation) in some environments, and otherwise improves welfare only when it is unlikely to generate a bad technology choice by the firm. A design standard can improve welfare if the regulator is sufficiently well informed about the technological possibilities for pollution control, but only when the firm's private benefits from technology choice are sufficiently small.","[Hueth, Brent] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Melkonyan, Tigran] Univ Nevada, Reno, NV 89557 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno,"Hueth, B (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",hueth@wisc.edu,"Melkonyan, Tigran/ISR-9270-2023; Hueth, Brent/D-9220-2018","Hueth, Brent/0000-0003-4307-5849",,,,,29,10,12,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

We present a new data set with dates of colonization, independence, and a colonizing event for all former colonies and dependencies that are regarded as countries today (143 observations). Our data, as well as the existing literature, suggest that the very heterogeneous era of colonization should be divided into an early 'mercantilist' wave and a much later 'imperialist' wave with quite different characteristics. We show that there is a strong positive effect of colonial duration on democracy, an effect which turns out to be driven primarily by former British colonies and by countries colonized during the imperialist era.

The main findings of the paper are as follows: (i) Chinese firms adjust toward an equilibrium level of debt ratio in a given year at a very slow rate; (ii) firm size, tangibility and state shareholdings are positively associated with firm's leverage ratio, while profitability, non-debt tax shields, growth and volatility are negatively related to firm's leverage ratio: (iii) lagged profitability has a negligibly small and positive impact on firm's leverage ratio; (iv) for a firm experiencing a large reduction in its leverage ratio only about 11% Of the discrepancy between its desired and actual leverage level is eliminated within a year (compared to more than 18% for full firm sample); (v) extending the basic model to allow for both the target level and the speed of adjustment to be endogenously determined, we find that Chinese firms tend to adjust faster if they are farther away from the equilibrium leverage level: and lastly (vi) extending the sample period to cover the earlier periods starting from 1993, when the Chinese stock markets were first developed, results in a slower speed of adjustment for firms in the below target sample.

Prices of model uncertainty contain information about the benefits of removing model uncertainty, not the consumption fluctuations that Lucas [22,23] studied. A max-min expected utility theory lets us reinterpret Tallarini's risk-aversion parameter as measuring a representative consumer's doubts about the model specification. We use model detection instead of risk-aversion experiments to calibrate that parameter. Plausible values of detection error probabilities give prices of model uncertainty that approach the Hansen and Jagannathan [11] bounds. Fixed detection error probabilities give rise to virtually identical asset prices as well as virtually identical costs of model uncertainty for Tallarini's two models of consumption growth.

This paper deals with the control of a bifurcation caused by a rise in information costs in a human capital investment model. By employing the delayed feedback control (DFC) method, unstable fluctuations stemming from the system can be controlled without changing its original properties.

We study the interaction between these aspects in a simple vintage capital framework with discrete time and an infinite horizon, focussing on Markov perfect equilibrium. We show that the equilibrium taxation destabilizes agglomeration advantages. The agglomeration advantage is valuable, but is exploited in the short run. The tax revenue in the equilibrium is substantial, and higher on old FDI than on new FDI, even though countries are not allowed to use discriminatory taxation. If countries can provide fiscal incentives for attracting new firms, this stabilizes existing agglomeration advantages, but may erode the fiscal revenue in the equilibrium. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

When the asymptotic critical values are used. the two powerful tests are found to reject the null hypothesis less in the presence of a large negative moving-average (MA) error in inflation. To cope with this problem, a parametric bootstrap scheme is developed and then is investigated by a Monte Carlo study. The simulation results demonstrate that the bootstrap tests display a better control over the empirical rejection rates at finite samples. Furthermore, after applying these tests to the inflation in G-10 countries, we find that one of the two tests using bootstrap critical values yields inferences that differ from when using asymptotic ones, and as a whole, the bootstrap tests consistently provide strong evidence in support of mean reversion in inflation in most countries of the G-10.

Remarkably, the evidence clearly indicates that the panel dataset of relative per capita CO2 emissions is stationary after the structural breaks and cross-sectional dependence are introduced into the model. These findings offer strong policy implications for governments, regardless of whether they are in convergent group or divergent group countries. We also find that the structural breaks in the 1960s and over the 1970-1982 period are associated with time periods of fossil fuel becoming the main source of productivity, higher oil prices, and the development of nuclear power.

By utilizing a nonlinear behavioral model where the chartists and fundamentalists coexist, evidence obtained from two sample periods significantly supports the existence of contrarian trading in the British pound, the Japanese yen and the German mark markets. The contrarian trading can only partially offset the price impacts of trend-followers, therefore the price impact of the chartists as a whole is destabilizing. The ability that the contrarians can counterbalance the extrapolation of the trend-followers differs across markets. Traders in the BP market have the highest tendency to contrarian strategy, which in turn contributes to the least deviations of the BP exchange rates departing from its PPP fundamentals. The fundamentalists' confidence in trade fades during large misalignments, which make the mean reversion function of the fundamentalists weak under the circumstances. We find the magnitudes of interventions will be affected by the price impacts of contrarians and their abilities on market stabilization. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

First, we present Eastham's contribution and show that despite using a graphical analysis, Eastham's model anticipated the modern competitive storage model (e.g., the presence of speculative stockholders acting as arbitrageurs and the shape of the aggregate commodity demand curve). Second, we explore the writings that may have influenced Eastham in the formulation of his model, by considering contributions of Wicksteed, through the influence of the London School of Economics; Keynes; and economists from the United States such as Mordecai Ezekiel and John Williams. Finally, our paper explores possible reasons why Eastham's contribution on storable commodity markets was overlooked in the subsequent literature.","[Carter, Colin A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Carter, Colin A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Revoredo-Giha, Cesar L.] SAC, Food Mkt Res Team, Land Econ & Environm Res Grp, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, Midlothian, Scotland",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis; Scottish Agricultural College,"Carter, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",cacarter@ucdavis.edu; cesar.revoredo@sac.ac.uk,,"Revoredo-Giha, Cesar/0000-0001-9890-4160",,,,,50,4,6,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

We argue that tying a firm's available rent to a regime's survival acts as a credible commitment forcing entrepreneurs to support the government and to exert effort in its stabilization. In return, politically-connected firms get access to profitable markets and are exempted from the regime's extortion. We show that such a gift exchange between government and politically-connected firms can only exist if certain institutional conditions are met. In particular, the stability of the regime has to be sufficiently low and the regime needs the power to exploit independent firms. We also show that building up a network of politically-connected firms acts as a substitute for investments in autonomous stability (such as spending on military and police force). The indirect strategy of stabilizing a regime via politically-connected firms gradually becomes inferior when a regime's exploitative power rises.","[Thum, Marcel] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Business & Econ, D-01062 Dresden, Germany; [Choi, Jay Pil] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Technische Universitat Dresden; Michigan State University,"Thum, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Business & Econ, D-01062 Dresden, Germany.",choijay@msu.edu; marcel.thum@tu-dresden.de,,"Thum, Marcel/0000-0002-5071-7849",,,,,24,18,21,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

My approach borrows from the extreme bounds analysis approach of Leamer while also addressing concerns raised by Granger and Uhlig, Sala-i-Martin, and others that not all specifications are equally likely to be true. I then apply this approach to identify robust determinants of state economic growth. My analysis confirms the importance of productivity characteristics of the labor force and industrial composition of a state's economy.

CEOs are almost exclusively in the top 1 of the pay distribution, and regulation of their pay is seen as a well-targeted way of reducing income inequality. Mandatory disclosure of executive compensation has increased nearly uniformly since 1933. A number of other regulations, including special taxes on CEO pay and rules regarding votes on some pay packages have also been introduced, particularly in the last 20 years. However, there is little solid evidence that any of these policies have had any substantial impact on pay. I also review limited evidence from overseas on Say on Pay, recently proposed in the US, which would allow nonbinding shareholder votes on CEO compensation. The experiences of other countries have been positive, with tighter linkages between pay and performance and improved communication with investors. Mandatory say on pay would be beneficial in the United States, both increasing shareholder value and making CEO pay fairer, thus reducing the likelihood of passage of other legislation to reduce income inequality, such as higher taxes on the rich.

I examine the size of shareholder added value when the company increases its financial leverage while keeping its credit rating constant by hedging its asset yield volatility. Ross ( 1996) shows that by reducing the asset yield volatility of the company, its debt capacity can permanently be increased, which can create 10-15% additional value for shareholders. With the help of my model, I develop an alternative approach to quantify this impact on shareholder value with better calibration characteristics. Uniquely in the technical financial literature, I derive the shareholder value creation potential from the mean-reversion parameters of the asset yield process. Also, I define the optimal structure of swap-basket needed for efficient hedging of industrial asset yield process, and analyse the sensitivity of shareholder added value to the term and transaction costs of applied swap contracts.","[Flesch, A.] McKinsey&Co, H-1061 Budapest, Hungary; [Flesch, A.] MOL Grp, Budapest, Hungary; [Flesch, A.] PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Frankfurt, Germany",,"Flesch, A (通讯作者)，McKinsey&Co, Andrassy Ut 23, H-1061 Budapest, Hungary.",adam_flesch@mckinsey.com,,,,,,,11,1,1,0,6,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Using annual budget data for the 1974-2004 period, it investigates whether current and investment spending by the Ministry of Public Order has been an effective policy measure to counter terrorism. The results seem to suggest that such investment has at best a weak negative impact on internal terrorist actions. The main policy implication of this finding is that investing in counter-terrorist infrastructure and equipment can potentially prove to be an effective policy measure in the fight against terrorism. This, however, may be conditional upon a number of other factors including other anti-terrorist measures such as legislation or how efficiently such expenditure is used.

The finite-population evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) yields overdissipation of rent when there are increasing returns to expenditure. However, imitative behavior, considered to be a source of the evolutionary dynamics behind the ESS, is implausible because individual rationality is not always satisfied. In this paper, we attempt to specify such implicit imitative behavior and construct explicit evolutionary dynamics. Under our plausible imitation rule, we show that full dissipation may prevail in the long run as long as there are increasing returns.

Many forecasting methodologies are available in the literature nowadays with mixed conclusions about which method is most convenient. This paper focuses on the modeling of electricity market time series sampled hourly in order to produce short-term (1 to 24 h ahead) forecasts. The main features of the system are that (i) models are of an Unobserved Component class that allow for signal extraction of trend, diurnal, weekly and irregular components; (ii) its application is automatic, in the sense that there is no need for human intervention via any sort of identification stage; (iii) the models are estimated in the frequency domain; and (iv) the robustness of the method makes possible its direct use on both load demand and price time series. The approach is thoroughly tested on the PJM interconnection market and the results improve on classical ARIMA models. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Mature firms are more likely to pay dividends, and high asset growth increases the probability of retaining all earnings.

Data from 79 countries for the 1990-2006 period and estimates of gravity equations are used to analyse the effects of countries' factor endowment, geographical characteristics and degree of economic openness. The results are consistent with the factor abundance model and reveal that economies with a larger human capital endowment export a greater volume of manufactures to China. Having a large economy and being geographically close to China also make a country more likely to export manufactures to it. The results do not indicate that other characteristics of countries, such as openness to trade or an outlet to the sea, play an important role; nor does the endowment per worker of land or capital. The implications of this study should be of interest to economies seeking to benefit from the remarkable dynamism of the Chinese economy by diversifying their exports into manufactures.","[Alvarez E, Roberto] Cent Bank Chile, Financial Policy Div, Santiago, Chile; [Figueroa B, Eugenio; Figueroa Z, Maria Pia; Palma E, Macarena] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile",Central Bank of Chile; Universidad de Chile,"Alvarez, R (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Chile, Financial Policy Div, Santiago, Chile.",ralvarez@bcentral.cl; efiguero@econ.uchile.cl; mfiguero@fen.uchile.cl; mpalma@fen.uchile.cl,,,,,,,20,1,2,0,6,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,AUG,2009,,98,,,,,103,116,,,,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,532ZD,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272789400006,0

We show that the optimal tax on capital and labor income only addresses the production inefficiency (and is time-invariant), while the tax on the environmental externalities affects both the production inefficiency and the environmental spillovers (and is time-varying). More interestingly, the socially optimal emission tax will be characterized by a Keynesian-like stabilizer that is designed to mitigate business cycle fluctuations, i.e., that will stimulate the economy with a lower emission tax during recessions. In a positive analysis, we show that the beneficial effects arising from pollution taxation will become larger the greater is the degree of the firms' monopoly power. In addition, a triple dividend in terms of improving environmental quality and increasing employment and firms' profit can be simultaneously realized if the environmental production externality is more significant and if the elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption is relatively small.","[Chang, Juin-Jen; Lai, Ching-Chong] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Chen, Jhy-Hwa] Tamkang Univ, Dept Econ, Tamsui 251, Taipei Hsien, Taiwan; [Shieh, Jhy-Yuan] Soochow Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; Tamkang University; Soochow University,"Chang, JJ (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan.",jjchang@econ.sinica.edu.tw; jhchen@mail.tku.edu.tw; jyshieh@scu.edu.tw; cclai@econ.sinica.edu.tw,"Chang, Juin-Jen/ABD-9235-2022","Shieh, Jhy-yuan/0000-0002-7282-5365",,,,,43,17,17,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Financial globalization may not in general fulfill its theoretical role as a risk sharing mechanism in financially underdeveloped economies, and hence may provide an impetus for compensating government spending. Comparative studies of the public sector have provided evidence of a robust positive association between government size and openness of the economy to trade flows. This paper extends the existing literature by investigating the relationship between government size and financial openness for 87 developing and developed countries between 1976 and 2003. The analysis reveals a positive relationship between exposure to international capital flows and government size. Furthermore, interacting capital flows with income levels shows that richer open economies tend to have smaller government size. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that benefits of financial integration, in terms of improved risk-sharing and consumption smoothing, accrue only beyond a certain minimum level of financial development.","York Univ, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",York University - Canada,"Kimakova, A (通讯作者)，York Univ, TEL 2005,4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",akimakov@yorku.ca,,,,,,,26,29,31,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,AUG,2009,62.0,3,,,,,394,406,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2009.00442.x,0.0,,,13,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,469GJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267883700004,0

There are two firms and infinitely many identical consumers. The firms produce a homogeneous product and distribute their brands through a common retailer. Consumers randomly arrive at the retailer and buy their most preferred brands. The order in which a consumer sees the advertising messages affects his brand preferences. Under the primacy effect the consumer prefers the brand he first saw advertised, under the recency-the last encountered brand. The equilibrium of the advertising game is characterized separately under the primacy and the recency effects. In the first setting all consumers are initially unaware of the product existence. The equilibrium advertising intensities, remarkably, do not depend on the type of exposure order effect. In the other two settings some consumers have already formed their brand preferences. The primacy and the recency effects give rise to different equilibrium outcomes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In addition to the relationship between technical and service characteristics, the analysis explores the existence of clusters of ergonomic characteristics within mobile phone handsets.

We argue that the presence of financially attractive early retirement schemes in a world of imperfect financial and insurance markets can lead to an 'early retirement trap'. Indeed, Europe witnesses many (early) retired individuals in financial distress. In our analysis we use data on 10 European countries, which differ in their pension and welfare systems, in prevailing retirement age and in households' access to financial markets. We find evidence that an early retirement trap exists, particularly in some Southern and Central European countries: people who retired early in life are more likely to be in financial hardship in the long run. Our analysis implies that governments should stop making early retirement attractive, let retirees go back to work, improve access to financial markets and make sure long-term care problems are adequately insured. - Viola Angelini, Agar Brugiavini and Guglielmo Weber.","[Angelini, Viola] Univ Padua, IFS, I-35100 Padua, Italy; Univ Padua, CEPR, I-35100 Padua, Italy; Univ Venice, IFS, I-30123 Venice, Italy; Univ Venice, SSAV, I-30123 Venice, Italy",University of Padua; University of Padua; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Angelini, V (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, IFS, I-35100 Padua, Italy.",,"Weber, Guglielmo/A-2310-2009; Angelini, Viola/AAF-6679-2021; Brugiavini, Agar/B-4988-2011","Angelini, Viola/0000-0002-5177-3447; Brugiavini, Agar/0000-0002-5871-2575",,,,,33,39,42,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

We find that the opening bid is a function of the observed characteristics of the past transaction prices for the coin, the seller's characteristics and the fee structure imposed by the auctioneer. The results demonstrate that increasing the opening bid fee structure induces a lower optimal opening bid, while an increase in the degree of risk in the price distribution increases the opening bid.

Allowing for endogenously identified breaks in the cointegrating and error correction matrices, we find evidence for breaks after 1980:5, 1988:1, and 1999:9. There is a clear long-run relationship between these series for six OECD Countries for 1971:1-1980.5 and 1988:2-1999.9, suggesting that stock market indices respond negatively to increases in the oil price in the long run. During 1980.6-1988.1, we find relationships that are not statistically significantly different from either zero or from the relationships of the previous period. The expected negative long-run relationship appears to disintegrate after 1999.9. This finding Supports a conjecture of change in the relationship between real oil price and real stock prices in the last decade compared to earlier years, which may suggest the presence of several stock market bubbles and/or oil price bubbles since the turn of the century.

Higher democratic capital stimulates growth by increasing the stability of democracies. Heterogeneous effects of democracy induce sorting of countries into political regimes, which helps explain systematic differences between democracies and autocracies. Our results suggest the possibility of a virtuous circle, where accumulation of physical and democratic capital reinforce each other, promoting economic development and consolidation of democracy.

Because the estimated increase in tax revenues is uncertain, these policies are essentially gambles with tax dollars. This paper shows that it is possible for a welfare-maximizing government to exhibit risk-loving behavior even though individual taxpayers are risk-averse. This risk-loving behavior may occur when the government has the option to provide an indivisible public good, such as a park. Interestingly, the poorest and wealthiest municipalities do not find gambles optimal. For communities that find gambles optimal, both the provision of the public good and tax rates are affected.","Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, Stokely Management Ctr 513, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Santore, R (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, Stokely Management Ctr 513, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",rsantore@utk.edu,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,9,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0307-3378,,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

The present paper addresses the fat tax and thin subsidy within a food-intake rational-choice model. Assuming that healthy meals are cooked at home with purchased ingredients and time input, the paper examines the effects on obesity of a tax on junk-food meals and a subsidy to cooking ingredients, distinguishing between a weight-conscious and a non-weight conscious individual, and between a weight-conscious individual who is physically active and physically inactive. The results show that for a non-weight conscious individual a fat tax will unambiguously reduce obesity, whereas a thin subsidy may increase obesity.

The instruments used by the policy makers are fiscal and educational policies, which are intended to eliminate disparities between the migrants and the native population. The aim of this paper is to examine the success of this policy among second generation Israelis. In other words, the question of interest is whether the second generation is more similar to the natives, or to their own parents. The methodology used is ANOGI - ANalysis Of GIni - which is similar to ANOVA except that it offers an additional parameter - stratification between groups. We compare two classifications: in the first, the second-generation Israelis were classified as Israelis, while in the second they were classified as belonging to the country of origin (of their parents). We find that the latter classification is more stratified than the former. This suggests that the melting pot policy did not achieve its declared targets.","[Schechtman, Edna] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Ind Engn, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Yitzhaki, Shlomo] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Econ, Jerusalem, Israel; [Yitzhaki, Shlomo] Cent Bur Stat, Jerusalem, Israel",Ben Gurion University; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Schechtman, E (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Ind Engn, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",yitzhaki@cbs.gov.il; ednas@bgu.ac.il,"Schechtman, Edna/F-1160-2012","Schechtman, Edna/0000-0001-7350-9068",,,,,25,8,9,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

In Ramsey models based oil Lucas and Stokey [Journal of Monetary Economics 12, 55-93 (1983)] and Chari, Christiano, and Kehoe [Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking 23, 519-539 (1991)], nominal money holdings are freely adjustable in response to shocks in the period in which they will be used to purchase consumption. In contrast, under Svensson [Journal of Political Economy 93, 919-944 (1985)] timing, normal balances cannot be adjusted in the period they will be used. The broad finding is that benchmark Ramsey results are not very sensitive to this slight, ultimately ad hoc, modification. In particular, optimal inflation Continues to display very high variability just as in the original models, although this call differ depending on exactly which exogenous processes are driving the economy. That the basic results in the Ramsey literature are not sensitive to the choice of cash/credit timing is reassuring as Ramsey analysis is applied to an ever-expanding set of model environments.","Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Chugh, SK (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, 3105 Tydings Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",chughs@econ.umd.edu,,,,,,,14,8,8,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Emphasis is placed on determining some of the major influences on the extent to which total corporation tax revenue changes when profits change over the economic cycle. A microsimulation model, CorpSim, is constructed and used to obtain numerical results. In the model, corporations use group relief, capital allowances and losses in a tax-minimising manner. The growth of aggregate corporation tax revenue in practice in the UK appears to be highly volatile in relation to the growth of profits. High volatility in revenue elasticities is found to be especially associated with economic downturns. In mild economic downturns, corporation tax revenue elasticities may rise (because tax growth falls less than profit growth), but in more severe downturns, large but temporary decreases in revenue elasticities (and even negative elasticities) can be expected.

This paper considers the controversial question of when private financing of public projects is optimal. Private development can dominate public financing through more efficient termination decisions for bad projects, resolving soft budget constraint problems. Due to contractual incompleteness and externalities, on the other hand, private developers cannot commit to large debt repayments, and hence can finance only a subset of valuable projects. Public developers, who do not face the same commitment problems, can finance a larger set of projects. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The main results of this analysis are that (i) with the exception of the response to the supply shock in Germany, the response of loans to the three macroeconomic shocks is rather weak and in most cases insignificant; (ii) the 2000-05 credit slowdown and weak economic performance in Germany were primarily driven by adverse supply shocks; and (iii) the marked slowdown in credit creation in Germany over this period actually represents a realignment of the outstanding stock of loans with its deterministic level. In order to assess the role of bank lending in the transmission of macroeconomic shocks, we further perform counterfactual simulations and analyze the dynamic responses of German loan subaggregates in order to test the distributional implications of potential credit market frictions. These exercises do not indicate that credit market frictions play an amplifying role in the transmission of macroeconomic fluctuations.","[Eickmeier, Sandra; Hofmann, Boris; Worms, Andreas] Deutsch Bundesbank, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany; [Eickmeier, Sandra; Worms, Andreas] Univ Cologne, D-5000 Cologne 41, Germany; [Hofmann, Boris] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",Deutsche Bank; University of Cologne; European Central Bank,"Eickmeier, S (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany.",sandra.eickmeier@bundesbank.de,,,,,,,55,9,9,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

We derive an equilibrium model within the framework of differentiated product analysis and explain the dynamic interaction between these two sources of innovation. Based on the empirical analysis of the global DRAM market, we show that the relative importance of technology-push and demand-pull in technological innovation is described by an L-type curve which describes the phenomenon where technology-push is greater than demand-pull in the early stages and then decreases as demand-pull becomes greater. Our finding suggests that the role of supply and demand is different in inducing technological change and their relative importance changes with product development over the technological life cycle; the marginal prices of products are an important factor in determining the principal forces of technological innovation between these two sources.","[Kim, Wonjoon] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Taejon 305701, South Korea; [Lee, Jeong-Dong] Seoul Natl Univ, Technol Management Econ & Policy Program, Seoul 15172, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Seoul National University (SNU),"Kim, WJ (通讯作者)，Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, 373-1 Guseong Dong, Taejon 305701, South Korea.",wonjoon.kim@kaist.ac.kr; leejd@snu.ac.kr,"Kim, Wonjoon/C-1649-2011","Kim, Wonjoon/0000-0002-2568-2066",,,,,24,29,32,1,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

We find evidence of factor-augmenting technological differences. Further, the ratios of factor productivities are strongly correlated with corresponding factor endowments.

The exercise identifies a set of puzzles for standard theories: (i) the model cannot account for the steep decline in manufacturing and rise in services in the later data; (ii) the standard model requires implausibly low elasticity of substitution across goods to match the consumption and output data; and (iii) the behavior of consumption and output shares differs significantly from that of employment shares. We argue that models that incorporate home production, sector-specific factor distortions, and differences across sectors in the accumulation of human capital are promising avenues to amend the standard models.

The experimental settings closely parallel earlier experimental studies of the investment or trust game. The primary research question relates to the effect of the initial allocation of property rights on the level of trust that subjects will extend to others with whom they are linked. We find that assigning the initial endowments as common property of each of N pairs of a first mover and second mover leads to marginally greater trust than when the initial endowments are fully owned by the two individual movers as their respective private property. Subjects' decisions are also shown to be correlated with attitudes toward trust and fairness that are measured in post-experiment questionnaires.,"[Cox, James C.] Georgia State Univ, Expt Econ Ctr ExCEN, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Coleman, Eric; Steed, Brian] Indiana Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA; [Walker, James M.] Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Castillo, Antonio Jamie] Univ Granada, Dept Sociol, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Schoon, Michael] Arizona State Univ, Ctr Study Inst Diversity, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of Granada; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Cox, JC (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Expt Econ Ctr ExCEN, 14 Marietta St NW, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",jccox@gsu.edu; ostrom@indiana.edu; walkerj@indiana.edu; amjaime@ugr.es; eracolm@indiana.edu; raholaha@indiana.edu; mlschoon@indiana.edu; bcsteed@indiana.edu,"Jaime-Castillo, Antonio M./N-9559-2019; Jaime-Castillo, Antonio M./A-7388-2008","Jaime-Castillo, Antonio M./0000-0002-5853-529X; Coleman, Eric/0000-0002-5315-7111",,,,,37,56,62,0,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

We study three potential types of delegation: strong, weak or no delegation, the latter case corresponding to direct democracy. We show that populations decide to bind themselves by delegating the national policy decision-making to a powerful conservative representative, in order to improve their bargaining position. These noncooperative behaviors of countries when they decide on their delegation rule induce negative political externalities between countries, which cancel the gains achieved by the internalization of economic externalities in the case of political integration. We then examine the consequences of ratification by referendum.

First, the finite sample properties of operational and practical procedures for the forecast evaluation of explanatory discrete time models of financial variability are studied. Second, based on the simulation results a simple but general framework is proposed and illustrated.

Based on a competition a la Cournot, our model predicts that aluminium spot price and inventories will respond to macroeconomic shocks to line up supply to the demand level. The model also includes incomplete adjustments to shocks that occur near the delivery date of futures contracts with the implication of a likely high persistence in the aluminium spot price. Estimation results show that the influence of the real exchange rate and the real interest rate on the aluminium price, though statistically significant, is small. We argue that this result is largely expected once we consider the peculiar features of the aluminium market. Further Support to this view is provided by the large persistence of the aluminium price response to its own shock and by the negligible contribution of stockholdings innovations to the price forecast error variance.

By examining scanner data on thousands of household purchases, we find that the poor pay less-not more-for the goods they purchase. And by extending the advances on price measurement in the recent decade back to the 1970s, we find that current poverty rates are less than half of the official numbers.","[Broda, Christian] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Leibtag, Ephraim] Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC USA; [Weinstein, David E.] Columbia Univ, New York, NY USA; [Weinstein, David E.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Chicago; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Broda, C (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",cbroda@chicagobooth.edu; eleibtag@ers.usda.gov; dew35@columbia.edu,,,"Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0820536] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0820462] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,20,93,110,2,14,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

The effects of benefit generosity on work incentives are more ambiguous in a broader behavioural framework in which workers get substantial disutility from unemployment (given income) and know that unemployment has scarring effects in the future. The micro evidence suggests modest effects of changes in generosity, but there are reasons to doubt that the impacts on national unemployment rates are consequential. The empirical case for the orthodox prediction comes from cross-country regressions on the OECD's gross replacement rate (GRR), but the published evidence is mixed, and we find little support in the pattern of annual changes in the GRR and the unemployment rate for OECD countries over the last three decades. We take advantage of new and much improved net replacement indicators from the OECD, which show little correlation with either the GRRs or with unemployment and employment rates. We conclude that the available evidence does not offer compelling support for the conventional view.","[Howell, David R.; Rehm, Miriam] New Sch, SCEPA, New York, NY 10011 USA",The New School,"Howell, DR (通讯作者)，New Sch, SCEPA, New York, NY 10011 USA.",howell@newschool.edu; rehmm151@newschool.edu,"Holloway, Susan/KBD-1889-2024",,,,,,72,35,38,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

The ideology and thus behavior of interest groups cannot be isolated from history, customs, economic conditions and changing alternatives open to individuals. In Australia, there were historical and traditional divisions concerning farmers producing for international markets that depend on flexible world prices and those producing for the domestic market with stabilized and subsidized prices. The National Farmers Federation (NFF) (1979) is the result of a historical-evolutionary-developmental process of preceding agricultural interest groups. Hence, an understanding of the NFF ideology that promotes free competition and the elimination of agricultural subsidies worldwide, in contrast to the agricultural interest groups in the United States and UK, requires an examination, using an institutional and economic complexity approach, of the evolution of agricultural interest groups in Australia.","Univ Crete, Dept Econ, Crete, NE USA",,"Marangos, J (通讯作者)，Univ Crete, Dept Econ, Crete, NE USA.",,"Marangos, John/F-7349-2017","Marangos, John/0000-0002-2765-8342",,,,,33,2,2,0,6,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The derivation of balanced growth paths shows that the most relevant cases for studying the impact of emigration are those where these paths can only be attained asymptotically. This requires and justifies the need for using transitional dynamics. We therefore derive a complete characterization of the transitional dynamics of output and wages in the sending country for all possible values taken by the elasticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled workers.

It was proved in Einy et al.

However when feasibility is defined with free disposal, competitive equilibrium allocations may not be incentive compatible and contracts may not be enforceable (see e.g. Glycopantis et al. in Econ Theory 21, 495-526, 2002). This is the main motivation for considering equilibrium solutions with exact feasibility. We first prove that the results in Einy et al. (Econ Theory 18, 321-332, 2001) are still valid without free-disposal. Then, motivated by the issue of contracts' execution, we adapt the incentive compatibility property introduced in Krasa and Yannelis (Econometrica 62, 881-900, 1994) and we prove that every Pareto optimal exact feasible allocation is incentive compatible, implying that contracts of competitive or core allocations are enforceable.","[Martins-da-Rocha, V.

The key implication is that squatters squeeze the formal market, raising the price paid by formal residents. The squatter organizer ensures that squeezing is not too severe, since otherwise, the formal price will rise to a level that invites eviction by landowners. Because eviction is absent in equilibrium, the model differs from previous analytical frameworks, where eviction occurs with some probability. It also facilitates a general equilibrium analysis of squatter formalization policies.

It is shown that, when there is one injurer and multiple victims, there is no liability rule with the property of invariably yielding efficient outcomes. The fact that there is no rule which is efficient for all applications of course does not in any way preclude the possibility of a rule being efficient with respect to some subclass of applications which may be of interest. We consider in this paper the important subclass of applications which are such that the expected loss of a victim depends only on the care level taken by that victim and the care level taken by the injurer. It is shown that a sufficient condition for a one-injurer multiple-victim liability rule to be efficient with respect to the above subclass of applications is that its structure be such that: (i) whenever the injurer is negligent and a particular victim is non-negligent, the entire loss incurred by that victim must be borne by the injurer; and (ii) whenever a particular victim is negligent and the injurer is non-negligent, the entire loss incurred by that victim must be borne by the victim himself. In fact, for an important subclass of one-injurer multiple-victim liability rules, characterized by the condition that the proportions in which the loss incurred by a particular victim is to be borne by the injurer and that victim must depend only on the non-negligence proportions of the injurer and that victim, the above condition is both necessary and sufficient for efficiency with respect to the restricted subclass of applications.","Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Social Sci, Ctr Econ Studies & Planning, New Delhi 110067, India","Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi","Jain, SK (通讯作者)，Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Social Sci, Ctr Econ Studies & Planning, New Delhi 110067, India.",skjain@mail.jnu.ac.in,,,,,,,12,1,1,0,1,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1361-374X,,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

From time series models we can conclude that there is a considerable variation in the value of the coefficients across sectors, even though energy demands with sensible parameters can rarely be estimated. When using a panel approach, the ability of some estimators to allow for diversity across subsectors was an important factor in explaining the estimates for price elasticity. On the other hand, correlation across panel members or common factors did not markedly influence our results. With regard to the estimated parameters, our preferred choice for elasticity of economic activity and price in the longer sample is 0.52 and -0.64. Similar values are found in the case of the shorter samples. Bearing in mind the high price elasticity, energy taxes can be considered an effective strategy for reducing energy consumption.

As a result, we find that the nonstationarity of the real exchange rate has strongly been rejected in favour of giving support to the purchasing power parity.","[Aslan, Oezguer] Istanbul Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34590 Istanbul, Turkey; [Korap, Levent] Marmara Univ, Dept Econ, Incirli, Turkey",Istanbul University; Marmara University,"Aslan, Ö (通讯作者)，Istanbul Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34590 Istanbul, Turkey.",ozgaslan@istanbul.edu.tr,"ASLAN, ÖZGÜR/AAC-6095-2021; KORAP, Hüseyin Levent/AAB-6123-2020","KORAP, Hüseyin Levent/0000-0001-6216-5941; ASLAN, OZGUR/0000-0002-8780-5463",,,,,35,5,5,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The analysis is focussed on the US case. Differently from life-cycle interpretations of the phenomenon, and from interpretations in terms of erratic deviations of current income flows from their long-run trend, the rising household debt is viewed as the outcome of persistent changes in income distribution and growing income inequalities. Through household debt, low wages appear to have been brought to coexist with relatively high levels of aggregate demand, thus providing the solution to the contradiction between the necessity of high and rising consumption levels, for the growth of the system's actual output, and a framework of antagonistic conditions of distribution which keeps within limits the real income of the vast majority of society. The question of the long-run sustainability of this substitution of loans for wages is finally discussed.","[Pivetti, Massimo] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Ist Econ & Finanza, Dipartimento Sci Giurid, I-00185 Rome, Italy; Univ Naples Federico 2, I-80138 Naples, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; University of Naples Federico II,"Pivetti, M (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Ist Econ & Finanza, Dipartimento Sci Giurid, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",albarba@unina.it; massimo.pivetti@uniroma1.it,,,,,,,54,298,338,1,63,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Whilst the type of killings has become more specialised (politicians, reporters, etc.), a new phenomenon based on urban guerrilla tactics, and called in Basque 'kale borroka' (street fighting), has emerged, creating an atmosphere of violence in the streets. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we create a daily measure of the level of violence in the area. Second, we examine if police action and the repressive policy measures adopted by the government since 2001 have been effective in reducing the intensity of violence. Third, we investigate whether the level of violence has had an effect on the stock market index in the Basque Country. The results, based on daily data from 1 July 2001 to 15 November 2005, suggest that the only effective measure to reduce violence was the banning of Herri Batasuna (HB), the radical party close to ETA supporters. Moreover, there was a decrease in the stock market index as a consequence of the violence in the area during the period under analysis.","[Caporale, Guglielmo Maria] Brunel Univ, Ctr Empir Finance, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Barros, Carlos P.] Univ Tecn Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal; [Gil-Alana, Luis A.] Univ Navarra, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain",Brunel University; Universidade de Lisboa; University of Navarra,"Caporale, GM (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, Ctr Empir Finance, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",Guglielmo-Maria.Caporale@brunel.ac.uk,,,,,,,23,20,20,0,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

In this model, the magnitude of the reservation utility has a nontrivial impact on the decision to accept or decline a marriage proposal. Even so, Batabyal (2003a) treats the marrying agent's reservation utility as an exogenous variable. Consequently, the purpose of this article is to endogenize the reservation utility variable in the context of a dynamic and stochastic model of decision making in arranged marriages. Our analysis leads to two results. First, we demonstrate that the optimal reservation utility is the solution to a particular maximization problem.

Numerous explanations have been advanced to account for this excess output volatility. Some examples are pro-cyclical inventory movements induced by a stockout-avoidance motive, cost and technology shocks and decreasing marginal costs. This article assesses the contribution of these different motives to output volatility for six different manufacturing industries. Linear-quadratic models are estimated for each of the industries and then dynamic simulations are employed to determine the volatility of output when one or more of the factors are removed from the model. Technology shocks provide the most significant contribution to output volatility. The stockout-avoidance motive is also important. Cost shocks provide a very small contribution and marginal production costs are increasing at the margin and thus stabilize output. It is also shown that output volatility declines when current values of sales and material costs are assumed known rather than forecasted from prior periods' values.","[Bivin, David G.] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Econ, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Humphreys, Brad R.] Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H4, Canada",Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis; University of Alberta,"Bivin, DG (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Econ, 425 Univ Blvd, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.",dbivin@iupui.edu,"Humphreys, Brad R/P-3340-2019","Humphreys, Brad R/0000-0003-0099-7237",,,,,39,1,1,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Allowing radiative forcing to exceed the long-term target level provides greater latitude in achieving the goal, but implies major changes to both global energy and land-Use systems in the near term as well as the long term. In addition, delay on the part of major emitting parties creates potential leakage in both energy and land use.

The results suggest that the inflation-targeting framework has helped anchor expectations, with the dispersion of inflation expectations declining considerably, particularly during periods of high uncertainty. We also find that apart from the inflation target, the stance of fiscal policy, as proxied by the ratio of the consolidated primary surplus to GDP, has been instrumental in shaping expectations. The importance of past inflation in determining expectations appears to be relatively low, and the overall empirical evidence does not suggest the presence of substantial inertia in the inflation process.","[Cerisola, Martin; Gelos, Gaston] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Cerisola, M (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",mcerisola@imf.org,,"Gelos, Gaston/0000-0003-4362-676X",,,,,33,18,21,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Labor wedges by themselves would have caused a recession beginning in late 1980s but was overwhelmed by the positive impact of efficiency and investment wedges. In the 1990s, efficiency, labor and investment wedges all contributed to the recession.

The game is played by non-overlapping generations of players who, after they are done, pass on advice to their successors who take their place in the game. We conjectured that this inter-generational design might enable subjects to converge to the payoff-dominant outcome. We find that coordination is most likely to result when the advice is made public and also distributed in a manner that makes it common knowledge.","[Chaudhuri, Ananish] Univ Auckland, Auckland 1, New Zealand; NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA",University of Auckland; New York University; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Chaudhuri, A (通讯作者)，Univ Auckland, Auckland 1, New Zealand.",,,,,,,,39,69,80,0,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

However, in many near-homogeneous product industries there is evidence that cost differences are minor and capacity differences seem a more reasonable explanation of firm heterogeneity. Based on simulations from a dynamic model of capacity accumulation, I find that mergers are welfare-reducing and that their long-run effects are worse than their short-run effects. If instead the simulated data is fit to an asymmetric costs model, the long-run welfare-reducing effects of mergers will be systematically underestimated, which can give rise to misguided antitrust policies.

Diverse pieces of public information can be taken into account differently by different players and are likely to lead to different appreciations ex post.

The main result shows that equilibrium uniqueness depends on two conditions: (i) signals are sufficiently dispersed and (ii) private beliefs about signals' relative precision differ sufficiently. We derive some implications for information dissemination policy. Transparency in this context is multidimensional: it concerns the publicity of announcements, the number of signals disclosed and their precision.","[Cornand, Camille] Natl Ctr Sci Res, F-67085 Strasbourg, France; [Cornand, Camille] BETA, F-67085 Strasbourg, France; [Heinemann, Frank] Tech Univ Berlin, D-10623 Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin,"Cornand, C (通讯作者)，Natl Ctr Sci Res, F-67085 Strasbourg, France.",cornand@cournot.u-strasbg.fr; f.heinemann@ww.tu-berlin.de,"Cornand, Camille/H-3184-2017",,,,,,21,2,2,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

In most of the countries where heterogeneity is present a grading-on-a-curve practice emerges, with grading standards increasing with average competence of the school's students (Table 4, Figures 3 & 4).

In the case of Chile, according to our GMM analysis, capital controls succeeded in reducing net short-term capital flows, but did not affect long-term flows. As far as Colombia is concerned, the regulations were capable of affecting total flows and also long-term ones. In addition, our cointegration models indicate that the regulations did not have a direct effect on the real exchange rate in the Chilean case. Nonetheless, the model used for Colombia did detect a direct impact of the capital controls on the real exchange rate. Therefore, our results do not seem to support the idea that those regulations were easily evaded.","Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",University of Essex,"David, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",A.C.David.00@cantab.net,,,,,,,22,10,10,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Nevertheless, GDP growth has remained positive, as the subsistence sector is sheltered, and foreign financial assistance has supported construction activity and permitted an expansionary stance of fiscal policy. The macroeconomic picture is one of stability, with inflation back to low levels and the budget and the balance of payments showing overall surpluses. The economy remains vulnerable, however, and Tonga still does not appear to be within reach of a sustainable development path. The government will need-with the help of donor countries-to mobilise the private sector in key areas and tackle the main obstacles to development. Regional cooperation should also be strengthened, especially through consolidation and harmonisation. Pursuing these goals while maintaining the momentum for constitutional reform will be a major challenge.","[de Fontenay, Patrick] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"de Fontenay, P (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,2,ASIA PACIFIC PRESS,CANBERRA,"AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIV, CRAWFORD SCH ECONOMICS & GOVERNMENT, CANBERRA, ACT 0200, AUSTRALIA",0817-8038,,,PAC ECON BULL,Pac.

Notwithstanding the challenges, the article shows that most of the problems in the venture were self-inflicted, the result of poor co-operation between the partners and self-interest.","[Klonowski, Darek] Brandon Univ, Dept Business Adm, Brandon, MB R7A 6A9, Canada; [Golebiowska-Tataj, Daria] Warsaw Univ Technol, Sch Business, Warsaw, Poland",Brandon University; Warsaw University of Technology,"Klonowski, D (通讯作者)，Brandon Univ, Dept Business Adm, Brandon, MB R7A 6A9, Canada.",klonowskid@brandonu.ca,,,,,,,23,6,6,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2009,21.0,3,,,,,361,371,,10.1080/14631370903090673,0.0,,,11,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,596GR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277673700006,0

Secondly, we use the Samuelson rule to explain the distribution of military expenditures across countries over time. According to the constant defence burden interpretation of the Samuelson rule, corresponding to the diagonal in the Lorenz diagram, the defence burdens should be equal across countries. It is shown that about three quarters of the variation in military expenditures can be explained by the Samuelson rule. We then go beyond the Samuelson rule to see which countries spend much more or less than predicted and investigate which other factors may influence the defence burden.","[Groot, Loek] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Sch Econ, Dept Publ Sector Econ, NL-3512 BL Utrecht, Netherlands; [Van Den Berg, Vincent] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ, Dept Spatial Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Groot, L (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Sch Econ, Dept Publ Sector Econ, Janskerkhof 12, NL-3512 BL Utrecht, Netherlands.",L.Groot@econ.uu.nl,"Groot, Loek L.

This semi-elasticity increases to infinity as interest rates fall to zero. Therefore, the use of this semi-elasticity has an advantage when examining the highly interest-elastic demand for money in low interest rate environments. Using Japanese and U.S. data, we find that the semi-elasticity increases exponentially in low interest rate environments. For example, the highest value of the semi-elasticity in Japan is observed in 2005, and is approximately 350 times larger than the value in 1990. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It begins with a review of those aspects of the subprime crisis that required the large, observed government interventions, namely the feared bankruptcy of individual banks, insurers, and government sponsored enterprises with the potential to create a meltdown of the entire financial system. The paper then develops legislative responses that would make future systemic failures and bailouts of this magnitude highly unlikely. The paper's key analytic device is to distinguish two financial firm activities: (1) risky investment activities (hedge fund division) capable of causing firm bankruptcy, and (2) market-making and related activities (infrastructure division), the failure of which would have systemic implications. The goal of the proposed regulatory change is to ensure that the infrastructure division is bankruptcy remote and can operate on a stand-alone basis if necessary even when losses from the hedge fund division threaten the holding company's solvency.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Jaffee, DM (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",jaffee@haas.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,23,6,6,0,3,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The aim of such a plan implies the elimination of all the obstacles that are limiting the free market competition and the free flow of goods on the global market, thus constraining the global economic growth. Agricultural trade counts as one of many factors that can affect the growth of an economy, but is often suppressed within the conditions of fast growing technological progress, especially at the global level. In this regard, the paper aims to give a founded answer to the following question: could international agricultural trade be considered as a relevant factor of the world economy growth and to what extent? Bringing these two values into a functional relation, based on continuing time series of data and using the LSM-method with exclusively statistical and econometric criteria, it has been proceeded with testing the model. Results of the analysis have shown that the international agricultural trade does not represent a relevant factor of the global economic growth but in some extent, however, exerts its impact.","[Kandzija, Vinko; Donadic, Marko] Fac Econ Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Kandzija, V (通讯作者)，Fac Econ Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia.",vinko.kandzija@efri.hr; mdonadic@efri.hr,,,,,,,35,1,1,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

This work analyzes returns and volatility relationships among these three markets for a twenty one year period, using daily data from the stock indexes from those markets. A Vector Autoregression (VAR) with an error correction model is used, fitting over time changing correlations and volatilities from these markets. The evidence suggests the presence of a long term equilibrium relationship to which the markets adjust from their contemporaneous deviations showing significant channels of interaction between returns of these share markets. Volatility transmission effects are also identified, from the United States and Canadian markets to the Mexican Stock market; no evidence was found that volatility from the Mexican market influences in a meaningful way the volatility from the other North American markets.","[Lopez Herrera, Francisco; Ortiz, Edgar; Cabello, Alejandra] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Herrera, FL (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",francisco_lopez_herrera@yahoo.com.mx; edgaro@servidor.unam.mx; acr2001mx@yahoo.com.mx,"López-Herrera, Francisco/F-9634-2010","López-Herrera, Francisco/0000-0003-2626-9246",,,,,49,0,0,0,5,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC ECONOMIA",MEXICO,"CIRCUITO INTERIOR S-N EDIFICIO B, PRIMER PISO, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO, DISTRITO FEDERAL 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

Also, the effect of neighbour's region expenditures on own location's decision of government size is undetermined. Estimations for the American states for 1999-2000 year data suggest that there is no spatial interaction among states' expenditures.

To explore the facets of a child's pacifier habit, we make use of an extensive questionnaire on the effectiveness of several proposed methods for stopping a child's pacifier consumption. Results indicate that children's pacifier use approaches the habit/addiction threshold, and it is best alleviated with abrupt cessation, or 'cold turkey.' Interestingly, our empirical finding that 'cold turkey' dominates or is superior to other methods of getting children to stop relying on pacifier use ( e. g. limiting time of use, altering the pacifier's tip, etc.) has two implications. First, it supports the Beckerian notion that a child's pacifier habit approaches the habit/addiction threshold, as stated above. Second, it contradicts suggestions from many in the health profession to seek methods other than 'cold turkey' to stop a child's pacifier use.","[Mixon, F. G., Jr.; Green, T.

Large scale macroeconometric models with forward-looking variables give raise to very large systems of equations. Nowadays there are a number of libraries like LAPACK or ATLAS available in C or FORTRAN for solving such models. Java is a relatively new object-oriented language and is almost universally recognized as a very good programming language for writing portable programs. Despite these advantages, it is a common believe that Java still lags behind C/C++ or Fortran performance especially for computational intensive numerical applications. Starting from solving large econometric models, we developed a Java library for matrix computations and show that using a set of optimization techniques Java can achieve performance comparable with other libraries developed in C or Fortran.","[Oancea, Bogdan] Artifex Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",,,oanceab@ie.ase.ro; andreitudorel@yahoo.com; stelian_stancu@yahoo.com; claudiu.herteliu@gmail.com,"Herteliu, Claudiu/K-4643-2014; Andrei, Tudorel/C-3731-2012; Herteliu, Claudiu/K-3367-2019; STANCU, Stelian/HRB-5488-2023; Oancea, Bogdan/C-4147-2011; Andrei, Tudorel/U-6307-2019","Herteliu, Claudiu/0000-0001-8860-9547; Herteliu, Claudiu/0000-0001-8860-9547; Oancea, Bogdan/0000-0001-6987-5137;",,,,,16,0,0,0,1,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,157,165,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS72,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287984500022,0
