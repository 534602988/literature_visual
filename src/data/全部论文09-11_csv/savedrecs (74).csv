Social interactions require that the cross-partial effect of partner's weight and own weight in the utility function be positive. Using life satisfaction as a utility proxy, semi-parametric regressions show that the correlation between satisfaction and own BMI is initially positive, but turns negative after some threshold. Critically, this latter threshold increases with partner's BMI when the individual is overweight. The negative well-being impact of own BMI is thus lower when the individual's partner is heavier, which is consistent with social contagion effects in weight. However, this relationship may also reflect selection on the marriage market or omitted variables, and it is difficult to think of convincing instruments that would allow causality to be clearly established.

The Grossman model then predicts the existence of a health threshold above which individuals do not demand medical care.

Empirically, we find evidence of multiple breaks in return prediction models based on the dividend yield or a short interest rate. Our analysis suggests that model instability is a very important source of investment risk for buy-and-hold investors with long horizons and that breaks can lead to a negative slope in the relationship between the investment horizon and the proportion of wealth that investors allocate to stocks. Once past and future breaks are considered, an investor with medium risk aversion reduces the allocation to stocks from close to 100% at short horizons to 10% at the five-year horizon. Welfare losses from ignoring breaks can amount to several hundred basis points per year for investors with long horizons. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We determined the cost-effectiveness of the noncalcium-based phosphate binder lanthanum carbonate (LC) as second-line treatment of hyperphosphatemia after therapy failure with calcium-based binders (CB). Methods: Two CKD populations were modeled: 1) predialysis CKD patients and 2) incident dialysis patients. Patients not responding to CB with a serum phosphate (SP) level >5.5 mg/dl received a trial with LC. Patients not responding to LC (SP >4.6 mg/dl) returned to CB treatment. Patient-level data were obtained from clinical trials in predialysis and dialysis. Time-dependent, life-long Markov models (discounting at 3.5% annually) were developed, using a UK National Health Service perspective. Results: The health gains with second-line LC treatment compared to CB treatment were 44 and 56 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for the predialysis and incident dialysis populations, respectively. Second-line LC was a cost-saving strategy in the predialysis population because of the cost-savings of delayed CKD progression. Second-line LC was cost-effective at 6900 pound (90% probability interval: 5800- pound 8300) pound per QALY gained in the dialysis population. Results were robust to plausible variations in other model parameters; inclusion of future unrelated dialysis costs had a large influence on cost-effectiveness estimates. Conclusions: Second-line treatment with LC is associated with considerable clinical benefits and good value for money in CKD, irrespective of dialysis status. These results support Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines to treat CKD patients with hyperphosphatemia irrespective of dialysis status.","[Vegter, Stefan; Postma, Maarten J.] Univ Groningen, Unit PharmacoEpidemiol & PharmacoEcon PE2, Dept Pharm, NL-9713 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Keith, Michael S.] Shire Pharmaceut Grp, Wayne, PA USA",University of Groningen; Shire Pharmaceuticals Limited,"Vegter, S (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Unit PharmacoEpidemiol & PharmacoEcon PE2, Dept Pharm, Antonius Deusinglaan 1, NL-9713 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",s.vegter@rug.nl,,"Postma, Maarten/0000-0002-6306-3653",Shire Pharmaceuticals,Shire Pharmaceuticals,This study was funded within a consultancy grant by Shire Pharmaceuticals.,,53,17,20,0,22,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2011,14.0,6,,,,,852,858,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.05.005,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BJ,21914505.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299081600008,0

Methods: This is a real-world cohort study that included inpatients treated with UFH or enoxaparin for deep venous thromboembolism or pulmonary embolism in a tertiary public hospital. To estimate medical costs we computed the acquisition costs of drugs, supplies for administration, laboratory tests, and hospitalization cost according to the patient ward. Results: One hundred sixty-seven patients aged 18 to 92 years were studied (50 treated with UFH and 117 with enoxaparin). The median of days in use of heparin was the same in both groups. Activated partial thromboplastin time was monitored in 98% of patients using UFH and 56.4% using enoxaparin. Nonstatistically significant differences were observed between groups in the number of bleeding events (10.0% and 9.4%; P - 1.00); blood transfusion (2.0% and 2.6%; P - 1.00); death (8.0% and 3.4%; P = 0.24); and recurrent VTE, bleeding, or death (20.0% and 14.5%; P = 0.38). Daily mean cost per patient was US$12.63 +/- $4.01 for UFH and US$9.87 +/- $2.44 for enoxaparin (P < 0.001). The total costs considering the mean time of use were US$88.39 and US$69.11. Conclusion: The treatment of VTE with enoxaparin provided cost savings in a large teaching hospital located in southern Brazil.","[Moreira, Leila Beltrami] Hosp Clin Porto Alegre, Farmacol Clin Sala 947, Pharm & Therapeut Comm, BR-90035903 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Argenta, Catia; Moreira, Leila Beltrami] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Grad Program Med Sci, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Moreira, Leila Beltrami] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Pharmacol, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Moreira, Leila Beltrami] Natl Inst Sci & Technol Hlth Technol Assessment C, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Moreira, LB (通讯作者)，Hosp Clin Porto Alegre, Farmacol Clin Sala 947, Pharm & Therapeut Comm, Ramiro Barcelos 2350, BR-90035903 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",lbmoreira@hcpa.ufrgs.br,"MOREIRA, LEILA LEILA B/AAC-2240-2019; Moreira, Leila/G-1251-2013; Iats, Inct/K-2300-2013","MOREIRA, LEILA LEILA B/0000-0002-4730-7988; Moreira, Leila/0000-0002-4730-7988;",Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre,Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre,This study was funded by Fundo de Incentivo a Pesquisa/Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre.,,25,4,7,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2011,14.0,5,,S,,,S89,S92,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.05.017,0.0,,,4,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BE,21839908.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299081000020,0

Methods: Twelve vignettes were designed, pilot-tested, and administered to a convenience sample in a cross-sectional design to elicit descriptive EQ-5D state data. Country-specific EQ-5D time-trade-off-based weights were used to map these descriptive health states into local country preference weights. Descriptive analysis is reported and intercountry differences for each condition were compared using repeated measures analysis of variance. Results: Seventy-three subjects completed the survey. Pneumococcal disease-related health states mean values ranged from -0.331 (sepsis, Chile) to 0.727 (auditive sequelae, Argentina). HPV-related conditions ranged from 0.152 (cervical cancer, United Kingdom) to 0.848 (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1, Argentina). Chile had consistently the lowest mean values in pneumococcal states and in one HPV state, whereas those of the United Kingdom were the lowest in most HPV states. Argentina had the highest mean values in both diseases. Differences in country-specific values for each health state were statistically (P < 0.001) significant except for six health states in which differences between Chilean and United Kingdom weights were nonsignificant. Conclusions: Utility values for most conditions differed statistically relevantly among analyzed countries, even though the same health states' descriptive set was valued for each. These results reflect the difference in social weights among different countries, which could be attributed to either different population values or valuation study methodologies. They stress the importance of using local preference weights for context-specific decision making.","[Augustovski, Federico] Inst Clin Effectiveness & Hlth Policy, Econ Evaluat & HTA Dept, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Augustovski, Federico] Univ Buenos Aires, Family & Community Med Div, Hosp Italiano Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Kind, Paul] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires; University of Buenos Aires; University of York - UK,"Augustovski, F (通讯作者)，Inst Clin Effectiveness & Hlth Policy, Econ Evaluat & HTA Dept, Ravignani 2024,C1414CPV, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",faugustovski@iecs.org.ar,"Bardach, Ariel/H-9566-2019; Kind, Paul/E-9715-2015; Bardach, Ariel E/E-6153-2012; Galante, Julieta/C-3151-2016","Bardach, Ariel/0000-0003-4437-0073; Kind, Paul/0000-0003-2377-1652; Galante, Julieta/0000-0002-4108-5341; Colantonio, Lisandro/0000-0001-8742-1788",,,,,30,28,31,0,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2011,14.0,5,,S,,,S60,S64,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.05.007,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BE,21839901.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299081000014,0

We extend the festival game, originally given by Kaneko-Matsui, to include new constraints on the observability of ethnic identities and on accessible locations for players. We characterize the Nash equilibrium set, which reveals a different variety of segregation patterns and discriminatory behavior. In order to facilitate the analysis of discrimination and prejudices, we introduce a measure of discrimination, which chooses a representative equilibrium with the smallest degree of discrimination.

These estimators share the same higher order bias properties as the generalized empirical likelihood estimators and once bias corrected, have the same higher order efficiency properties as the bias corrected generalized empirical likelihood estimators. Unlike the generalized empirical likelihood estimators, our new estimators are much easier to compute. A simulation study finds that our estimators have better finite sample performance than the two-step GMM, and compare well to several potential alternatives in terms of both computational stability and overall performance.

Among the many different definitions which can be found in the statistical literature four concepts are discussed and tested: Kendall's tau, quadrant dependence, stochastic decreasing conditional food share distribution function and decreasing regression. Only the last one is used in the economic literature, yet it does not imply useful information of the underlying distribution. For linking Engels's Law to micro-economics, stronger concepts of stochastic association are needed. This motivates the empirical study of the proposed alternative concepts of negative association.

First-order conditions for production under risk are shown to admit many alternative specification pairs representing risk preferences and either perceived price risk, production risk, or the deterministic production structure. Imposing an arbitrary specification on any of the latter three determines which risk preference specification fits a given dataset, undermining global identification even when parameter identification is suggested by typical statistics. This lack of identification is not relaxed by increasing the number of observations. Critical implications for estimation of mean-variance specifications are derived. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Two concepts of partial boundaries of the production set have been proposed: an expected maximum output frontier of order m = 1, 2, ... and a conditional quantile-type frontier of order alpha is an element of ]0, 1]. In this paper, we answer the important question of how the two families are linked. For each m, we specify the order alpha for which both partial production frontiers can be compared. We show that even one perturbation in data is sufficient for breakdown of the nonparametric order-m frontiers, whereas the global robustness of the order-alpha frontiers attains a higher breakdown value. Nevertheless, once the alpha frontiers break down, they become less resistant to outliers than the order-m frontiers. Moreover, the m frontiers have the advantage to be statistically more efficient. Based on these findings, we suggest a methodology for identifying outlying data points. We establish some asymptotic results, contributing to important gaps in the literature. The theoretical findings are illustrated via simulations and real data. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, the effects of these initiatives on total health-care expenses, the mix of utilization, and access to care remain unclear. We examine the effect of changes in Medicaid HMO penetration between 1996 and 2002 on these outcomes using data for the nonelderly Medicaid population in the Community Tracking Study's Household Survey. We develop market-level measures of Medicaid HMO penetration from CMS and InterStudy data, distinguish whether the HMOs specialize in serving the Medicaid population, and use a market fixed-effects model to focus on changes in HMO penetration rates over time. Although limited by imprecise estimates, we find some evidence that utilization and access are related to the market penetration rates of commercial and Medicaid-dominant HMOs, but the pattern of results we observe does not appear to be consistent with welfare improvements.

Our findings indicate that a higher level of state spending on tobacco control programs in the prior year is associated with a statistically significant increase in the probability that current daily smokers report at least one attempt to quit smoking in the past year. We also find evidence that higher state expenditures on tobacco control programs in the prior year are associated with reductions in the prevalence of daily smoking and 30-day cigar use among college students.

The planner's problem is presented and the optimal paths are characterized. We prove that there exists a critical value of initial stock, in the vicinity of which, small differences lead to permanent differences in the optimal path. Indeed, we show that a development trap can arise even under a strictly convex technology. In contrast with the early contributions that consider recursive preferences, the critical stock is not an unstable steady state so that if an economy starts at this stock, an indeterminacy will emerge. We also show that even under a convex-concave technology, the optimal path can exhibit global convergence to a unique stationary point. The multipliers system associated with an optimal path is proven to be the supporting price system of a competitive equilibrium under externality and detailed results concerning the properties of optimal (equilibrium) paths are provided. We show that the model exhibits globally monotone capital sequences yielding a richer set of potential dynamics than the classic model with exogenous discounting. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

An alternative is to fit a series of models that assume that treatment acts on specific transitions. Investigators can then choose among alternative models using goodness-of-fit statistics. However, structural uncertainty about any chosen parameterization will remain and this may have implications for the resulting decision and the need for further research. Methods: We describe a Bayesian approach to model estimation, and model selection. Structural uncertainty about which parameterization to use is accounted for using model averaging and we developed a formula for calculating the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) in averaged models. Marginal posterior distributions are generated for each of the cost-effectiveness parameters using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation in WinBUGS, or Monte-Carlo simulation in Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA). We illustrate the approach with an example of treatments for asthma using aggregate-level data from a connected network of four treatments compared in three pair-wise randomized controlled trials. Results: The standard errors of incremental net benefit using structured models is reduced by up to eight-or ninefold compared to the unstructured models, and the expected loss attaching to decision uncertainty by factors of several hundreds. Model averaging had considerable influence on the EVPI. Conclusions: Alternative structural assumptions can alter the treatment decision and have an overwhelming effect on model uncertainty and expected value of information. Structural uncertainty can be accounted for by model averaging, and the EVPI can be calculated for averaged models.

This paper adds to the literature by investigating HSAs as both a form of insurance and as saving vehicle in an expected utility framework. Assuming no regulatory constraints on the deductible, we show that individuals voluntarily choose a positive deductible and increase their savings with HSAs. If the government-imposed minimum deductible becomes too great, however, individuals may instead choose to remain in traditional insurance. We determine the effect of HSAs on prevention effort. We find that an increased tax subsidy may worsen moral hazard issues. Assuming partial risk aversion to be less than or equal to one, individuals will either invest less in the health preservation effort and more money in the HSA or vice versa. However, they will never increase both effort and savings simultaneously as was intended when HSAs were introduced. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We examine delivery care and the health of newborns using the universe of Florida births from 1989 to 2003 combined with hospital data from the American Hospital Association. We find that charity care requirements were binding on hospitals, but that private hospitals under obligation cream skimmed the least risky maternity patients. Conditional on patient characteristics, they provided less intensive maternity services but without compromising patient health. When obligations expired, private hospitals quickly reduced their charity caseloads, shifting maternity patients to public hospitals. The results in this paper suggest, perhaps surprisingly, that requiring private providers to serve the underinsured can be effective. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

On the one hand Czech firms have been allowed to use great market opportunities on the other hand they have been under a great pressure of foreign competitors. Further, to Czech exporters and importers has appeared a brand new problem connected with a floating exchange rate, a factor which has a strong power to influence revenues and costs of their activities hence their ability to survive in the long term view. This paper aims to determine if revenues from the export of the main Czech exporters are significantly affected by the exchange rates of the main trade partners of the Czech Republic or there exist other and stronger factors which are able to compensate exchange rates volatility such as the real convergence of the CZ.

Here, it is further argued that the welfare implications of survivor consumption are already known because unlike new medical treatments or interventions whose complex and uncertain outcomes and third-party purchasing make the welfare implications unclear, survivor consumption must have passed a private market welfare test. That is, the gains must have exceeded the costs in order for the survivor consumption to be purchased; therefore, survivor consumption is welfare increasing. The same would apply for survivor leisure forgone. Implications for cost-benefit analysis are clear, but are less so for cost-utility analysis. Moreover, as it is currently practiced, cost-utility analysis does not evaluate welfare because quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) do not meet all the criteria for representing utility. Therefore, rather than using QALYs to analyze welfare, cost-QALY analysis should be differentiated from cost-utility analysis.

This paper reports new empirical data comparing hypothetical and real preferences in a health care context, using the clinical setting of patient self-management (PSM) of anticoagulation (warfarin) therapy. The data offer considerable support for the use of WTP and CBAs in a self-management health care context; the hypothetical bias hypothesis is not supported by our data. The generalisability of these results to other health care settings needs to be explored.

Methods: Focus groups and interviews were conducted in the United States with COPD patients treated for exacerbations during the past 6 months. Participants were asked to describe exacerbation attributes, care-seeking cues, and indications of progression and recovery. An iterative process was used to identify themes in the data to inform instrument content and structure. Cognitive debriefing interviews were performed to evaluate and revise the draft item pool. Experts in COPD, instrument development, and clinical research participated in the process. Results: Eighty-three subjects participated in elicitation focus groups or interviews (n = 48); elicitation interviews with cognitive debriefing (n = 23), or cognitive interviews alone (n = 12). Mean age of the sample was 65 years (SD = 10); 45% were male; mean FEV-1% predicted was 44% (SD = 16). Participants characterized exacerbations as a persistent increase in the severity of respiratory symptoms and other systemic manifestations accompanied by a dramatic reduction in activity. Specific attributes included shortness of breath, chest congestion, cough, sputum, chest discomfort, feeling weak or tired, sleep disturbances, and concern or worry. The diary card of 23 candidate items was debriefed in booklet and electronic format. Conclusions: Qualitative data from patients and input from experts formed the basis of the EXACT's structure and item pool, ready for empirically based item reduction and reliability and validity testing.","[Leidy, Nancy Kline; Wilcox, Teresa K.; Murray, Lindsey; Winnette, Randall; Howard, Kellee; Petrillo, Jennifer] United BioSource Corp, Ctr Hlth Outcomes Res, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Jones, Paul W.] Univ London, St Georges Hosp, London, England; [Powers, John] George Washington Univ, Sch Med, Washington, DC USA; [Sethi, Sanjay] SUNY Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA",United Biosource Corporation; University of London; St Georges University London; George Washington University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"Leidy, NK (通讯作者)，United BioSource Corp, Ctr Hlth Outcomes Res, 7101 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 600, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",nancy.leidy@unitedbiosource.com,,,"Adams Respiratory Therapeutics; Almirall; Altana AG (Nycomed); AstraZeneca; Bayer; Boehringer Ingelheim; DEY, L.P.; Forest Laboratories, Inc.; GlaxoSmithKline; Merck Company; Mpex Pharmaceuticals; Novartis; Ortho-McNeil; Pfizer, Inc.; Sepracor, Inc.; Schering-Plough","Adams Respiratory Therapeutics; Almirall(Almirall); Altana AG (Nycomed); AstraZeneca(AstraZeneca); Bayer(Bayer AG); Boehringer Ingelheim(Boehringer Ingelheim); DEY, L.P.; Forest Laboratories, Inc.; GlaxoSmithKline(GlaxoSmithKline); Merck Company(Merck & Company); Mpex Pharmaceuticals; Novartis(Novartis); Ortho-McNeil; Pfizer, Inc.(Pfizer); Sepracor, Inc.; Schering-Plough(Merck & CompanySchering Plough Corporation)","The following companies have provided unrestricted funds to support the EXACT-PRO Initiative: Adams Respiratory Therapeutics; Almirall; Altana AG (Nycomed); AstraZeneca; Bayer; Boehringer Ingelheim; DEY, L.P.; Forest Laboratories, Inc.; GlaxoSmithKline; Merck & Company; Mpex Pharmaceuticals; Novartis; Ortho-McNeil; Pfizer, Inc.; Sepracor, Inc.; Schering-Plough.",,49,91,97,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2010,13.0,8,,,,,965,975,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00772.x,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,691FR,20659270.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000285066200015,0

The severity of mood symptomatology has been associated with functional impairment in this population. However, the majority of studies have assessed global functioning without considering specific domains. The main objective of the current study was to assess specific life domains of functioning as well as the overall functioning in patients with BD across different mood states ([hypo] mania, depression, or euthymia) compared with healthy controls by the means of a standardized scale validated for BD. Methods: The sample included 131 subjects with BD (68 in remission, 31 hypo [manic], and 32 depressed) and 61 healthy controls. The Functioning Assessment Short Test was used to assess overall and multiple areas of functional impairment (autonomy, occupational functioning, cognitive functioning, interpersonal relationships, financial issues, and leisure time). Results: The results showed significant intergroup differences; depressed patients had the lowest functioning (48.03 +/- 12.38) followed by (hypo) manic patients (39.81 +/- 13.99). The euthymic group showed least impairment in functioning compared with the depression and (hypo) mania groups (11.76 +/- 12.73) but still displayed significant impairment when compared with the healthy control group (5.93 +/- 4.43). Conclusions: This study indicates that depressive symptoms are associated with greater negative impact on psychosocial functioning than (hypo) manic symptoms. Further deficits in functioning seem to persist during remission. The results highlight the importance of aggressively treating depression and mania and the need to develop psychosocial interventions targeting to improve functional outcomes.","[Rosa, Adriane R.; Reinares, Maria; Mar Bonnin, C.; Sole, Brisa; Franco, Carolina; Comes, Merce; Torrent, Carla; Vieta, Eduard] Univ Barcelona, Bipolar Disorders Program, Inst Neurosci, Hosp Clin,IDIBAPS,CIBERSAM, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Michalak, Erin E.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Psychiat, Div Mood Disorders, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Kapczinski, Flavio] Hosp Clin Porto Alegre, Bipolar Disorder Program, Ctr Pesquisas, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERSAM; University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; IDIBAPS; University of British Columbia; Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Fisicas,"Vieta, E (通讯作者)，Univ Clin Hosp Barcelona, Clin Inst Neurosci, Villarroel 170, Barcelona 08036, Spain.",evieta@clinic.ub.es,"Kapczinski, Flavio/J-5803-2014; Solé, Brisa/HTQ-6414-2023; rosa, adriane ribeiro/G-6923-2013; Kapczinski, Flavio Pereira/JPA-3835-2023; Kapczinski, Flavio/D-3175-2013; Vieta, Eduard/Y-2919-2019","rosa, adriane ribeiro/0000-0001-8629-4625; Kapczinski, Flavio/0000-0001-8738-856X; Vieta, Eduard/0000-0002-0548-0053; Sole, Brisa/0000-0003-1673-8248; Torrent Font, Carla/0000-0003-0335-582X; Bonnin, Caterina del Mar/0000-0002-1197-1596","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, Instituto de Salud Carlos III [PI080180, PI08/90094]; CIBERSAM; Generalitat de Catalunya to the Bipolar Disorders; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through Juan de la Cierva [JCI-2009-04329]","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, Instituto de Salud Carlos III(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); CIBERSAM; Generalitat de Catalunya to the Bipolar Disorders; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through Juan de la Cierva","This work was supported by grants from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, Instituto de Salud Carlos III (PI080180 and PI08/90094), CIBERSAM and the support of the Generalitat de Catalunya to the Bipolar Disorders.

The programme offers free out-patient diagnosis and lab tests at discounted rates when ill, but, more importantly, it covers highly catastrophic and less discretionary in-patient surgical procedures. For its impact evaluation, 4109 randomly selected households in villages in rural Karnataka, an Indian state, were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. A comprehensive set of indicators was developed and the quality of matching was tested. Generally, the programme is found to have increased utilisation of health-care services, reduced out-of-pocket spending, and ensured better health and economic outcomes. More specifically, however, these effects vary across socio-economic groups and medical episodes. The programme operates by bringing the direct price of health-care down but the extent to which this effectively occurs across medical episodes is an empirical issue. Further, the effects are more pronounced for the better-off households. The article demonstrates that community insurance presents a workable model for providing high-end services in resource-poor settings through an emphasis on accountability and local management.

For example, risk preferences can be derived over normal, exponential, and Poisson families of probability distributions. My extension uses a version of Arrow's (1970) Monotone Continuity, which implies countable additivity for subjective beliefs and a novel property of tail-continuity for the revealed risk preferences.

A crucial question is what probabilistic distribution is suitable for synthesizing the available information (mainly data from clinical trials) about these parameters. In this context, the important role of Bayesian methodology has been recognized, where the parameters are of a random nature. We explore, in the context of CE analyses, how formal objective Bayesian methods can be implemented. We fully illustrate the methodology using two CE problems that frequently appear in the CE literature. The results are compared with those obtained with other popular approaches to PSA. We find that the discrepancies can be quite marked. specially when the number of patients enrolled in the simulated cohort under study is large. Finally, we describe in detail the numerical methods that need to be used to obtain the results. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons.

We propose a method to construct tests that concentrate their asymptotic powers upon only such interesting alternatives. The test has a chi(2)(1) limiting distribution under the null hypothesis, and even accommodates the case where the parameter estimates have a convergence rate slower than root n as in the case of maximum score estimation. The testing procedure can be easily modified when the main interest lies in average increment effects of binary covariates, multivariate average derivatives or linear restrictions other than those of average derivatives. Results from Monte Carlo experiments show that the asymptotic theory is a reasonable approximation of the finite-sample distributions and an application of our methods to female labor market participation illustrates the importance of this non-omnibus approach.

Prominent examples of such models are multinomial probit models and binomial panel probit models with serially correlated errors. In this paper we propose to use a generic procedure known as Efficient Importance Sampling (EIS) for the evaluation of likelihood functions for probit models with correlated errors. Our proposed EIS algorithm covers the standard GHK probability simulator as a special case. We perform a set of Monte Carlo experiments in order to illustrate the relative performance of both procedures for the estimation of a multinomial multi period probit model. Our results indicate substantial numerical efficiency gains for ML estimates based on the GHK-EIS procedure relative to those obtained by using the GHK procedure. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Existing studies that find a link between debt and depression tend to utilise small and highly selective samples of people and only self-reported measures of financial stress, responses to which are likely to correlate with subjective measures of health. From additional household data, we can construct a variety of 'objective' quantitative measures of financial stress in order to validate self-reported measures. We show that, although there is a positive association between subjective measures of financial well-being and psychological well-being, individuals differ in their psychological response to objective household financial situations. We also examine how the potential simultaneity of financial and psychological health might be handled. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Flabbi, L",,,,"Flabbi, Luca",,,Prejudice and gender differentials in the US labor market in the last twenty years,JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Gender discrimination; Search models; Maximum likelihood estimation; Structural estimation,,"Earnings differentials between men and women have experienced a stable convergence during the 1980s, following a process started in the late 1970s, However, in the 1990s the convergence has almost stopped. The first objective of the paper is to evaluate if discrimination, defined as explicit prejudice, may have a role in explaining this slowdown in the convergence. The second objective is to assess whether the prediction of a decrease in the proportion of prejudiced employers implied by the Becker's model of taste discrimination is taking place and if so at what speed. These objectives are achieved by developing and estimating a search model of the labor market with matching, bargaining, employer's prejudice and worker's participation decisions. The results show that the proportion of prejudiced employers is estimated to be decreasing at an increasing speed, going from about 69% in 1985 to about 32% in 2005. Therefore prejudice is not estimated to be a relevant factor in explaining the slower convergence between male and female earnings in the 1990s. The results are consistent with the Becker's model of taste discrimination if one is willing to assume a very slow adjustment process. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The rise in temperature is caused by the use of fossil resources so that the temperature level can be linked to the remaining stock of these resources. The rise in temperature affects both productivity and utility. We characterize optimal solutions for the maximin and zero discounting cases and present closed-form solutions for the case where the production and utility functions are Cobb-Douglas, and the temperature level is an exponential function of the remaining stock of resources. We show that a greater weight on temperature in intratemporal preferences and a larger intertemporal elasticity of substitution both lead to postponing resource use. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Parents cite safety reasons as part of their motivation for hosting parties, preferring their teens and their teens' friends to drink in a supervised and safe locale. Both sides predict an effect of social host liability for minors on alcohol-related traffic accident rates for under-aged drinkers: the effects, however, work in opposite directions. This paper finds that, among 18-20 year olds, social host liability for minors reduced the drunk-driving fatality rate by 9%. I find no effect on sober traffic fatalities. Survey data on drinking and drunk driving suggest the declines resulted mostly from reductions in drunk driving and not reductions in drinking. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Göhlmann, S; Schmidt, CM; Tauchmann, H",,,,"Goehlmann, Silja; Schmidt, Christoph M.; Tauchmann, Harald",,,SMOKING INITIATION IN GERMANY: THE ROLE OF INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,GSOEP; youths; intergenerational transmission; discrete time hazard model,QUITTING SMOKING; TOBACCO TAXES; DURATION; ALCOHOL; ONSET; PRICE,"This paper analyzes the decision to start smoking using data from the German Socio-Economic Pallet (GSOEP). Our focus is on the role that parental smoking behavior plays for children's smoking initiation. The data used are a combination of retrospective information on the age individuals started smoking and, by tracing back these individuals within the panel structure up to that point, information on characteristics at the age of smoking initiation. In contrast to the previous literature it is possible to control for the environment at the time of smoking onset that might have influenced the decision to start. Our preferred specification of a discrete time hazard model indicates that parental smoking significantly increases the offspring's hazard to start smoking. While this effect is most prominent for currently smoking parents, it is also found for parents who have given up smoking already. However, an ambiguous effect of the timing of parental smoking cessation is found, arguing against role-model effects being a key determinant for smoking initiation.

Education policies might be important for reducing this increase. This paper analyses the causal effect of education on the probability of being overweight by using longitudinal data of Australian identical twins. The data include self-reported and clinical measures of body size. Our cross-sectional estimates confirm the well-known negative association between education and the probability of being overweight. For men we find that education also reduces the probability of being overweight within pairs of identical twins. The estimated effect of education on overweight status increases with age. Remarkably, for women we find no negative effect of education on body size when fixed family effects are taken into account. Identical twin sisters who differ in educational attainment do not systematically differ in body size. Peer effects within pairs of identical twin sisters might play a role. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Documentary reviews supplemented by interviews with senior policymakers of relevant public health authorities. Results: Drug regulatory authorities play a vital role in the market authorization process by considering evidence on safety, efficacy and quality for new medicines, and bio-equivalence for new generic products of previously patented medicines. For the formulation of the reimbursement list, all three cases applied evidence on cost-effectiveness, to various degrees, with clear institutional structure, capacity, and functions. Only Thailand has specified an explicit benchmark on cost-effectiveness for inclusion in the reimbursement list. For price control, all have established mechanisms and processes for price negotiation. These mechanisms apply evidence on cost structure and relative prices in other countries to ensure affordable prices, especially with the patented drug industry. Thailand's universal insurance schemes use a capitation payment model which proves effective in implicit price control. To increase access to essential medicines that have parents on and high price, Thailand applied Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property flexibilities; government use of patent, for public noncommercial purposes to seven essential drugs in 2006 to 2008. Conclusion: Rapidly increasing health expenditure and universal health insurance systems have created greater requirement for proof of value for money in the approval and funding of new medical technologies.

For such a concept of bounded rationality a semantic interpretation by the possible world semantics of the Kripke (1963) type is no longer available because the definition of knowledge in these possible world semantics implies that the agent knows all valid statements of the model. The key to my alternative semantic approach is the extension of the method of truth tables, first introduced for the propositional logic by Wittgenstein (1922), to an epistemic logic so that I can determine the truth value of epistemic statements for all relevant truth conditions. In my syntactic approach 1 define an epistemic logic-consisting of the classical calculus of propositional logic plus two knowledge axioms - that does not include the inference rule of necessitation, which claims that an agent knows all theorems of the logic. As my main formal result I derive a determination theorem linking my semantic with my syntactic approach. The difference between my approach and existing knowledge models is illustrated in a game-theoretic application concerning the epistemic justification of iterative solution concepts.

We assess whether this view is correct. We examine the relationship between common sources or airborne pollution and Population mortality for England. We use data at local authority level for 1998-2005 to examine whether current levels of airborne pollution, as measured by annual mean concentrations of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter less than 10 mu m in diameter (PM10) and ozone, are associated with excess deaths. We examine all-cause mortality and deaths from specific cardiovascular and respiratory causes that are known to be exacerbated by air pollution. The panel nature of Our data allows us to control for any unobserved time-invariant associations at local authority level between high levels of air Pollution and poor population health and for common time trends. We estimate multi-pollutant models to allow for the fact that three of the pollutants are closely correlated. We find that higher levels of PM10 and ozone are associated with hie her mortality rates, and the effect sizes are considerably larger than previously estimated from the primarily time series studies for England.

Some argue that most drug spending is on me-too drugs-drugs that provide only marginal health gains. Others suggest that the opposite is true-new drugs offer good value for money and are well worth the cost. To provide evidence on this issue, we evaluated the impact of drug innovation on the longevity of Canadians. Methods: We analyzed patient-level claims data from Quebec's provincial health plan. We selected elderly patients with continuous health coverage dispensed at least one drug prescription in each year of the study period, 1997 to 2006. Drug vintage was defined as the active ingredient's earliest marketed date. We estimated the impact of drug vintage on patient survival using a time-varying Cox proportional hazards model that controlled for year indicator variables, patient age, sex, region of residence, low income status, medical services use, concomitant drug use, and comorbidities. Results: Of the 102,743 subjects in the study population, 14,154 (14%) died during the study period. Mean patient age was 68 years; 59% were women. Our survival models indicated that the use of newer medications was associated with a statistically significant mortality risk reduction (hazard ratio: 0.522; 95% confidence interval: 0.476 to 0.572, P < 0.0001), relative to older medications. Other covariates associated with an increased risk of mortality included age, sex (male), low guaranteed income supplement status, hospitalization, and number of comorbidities. Conclusion: This analysis showed that recent drug innovation has had a significant beneficial impact on the longevity of elderly patients.","[Van Audenrode, Marc; Latremouille-Viau, Dominick; Lefebvre, Patrick] Grp Anal, Montreal, PQ H2Z 1S8, Canada; [Lichtenberg, Frank R.] Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Business, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Lichtenberg, Frank R.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Grootendorst, Paul] Univ Toronto, Fac Pharm, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Grootendorst, Paul] McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON, Canada",Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Toronto; McMaster University,"Lefebvre, P (通讯作者)，Grp Anal, 1080 Beaver Hall Hill,Suite 1810, Montreal, PQ H2Z 1S8, Canada.",plefebvre@analysisgroup.com,,"Grootendorst, Paul/0000-0003-1978-2834","Canada's Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies (Rx&D), Ottawa, Ontario, Canada","Canada's Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies (Rx&D), Ottawa, Ontario, Canada","Parts of this work were presented as podium presentations at the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research 2008 Annual International Meeting and at the Canadian Association for Health Services and Policy Research 2008 Conference.

The ability to translate QLQ-C30 responses into utility scores would further expand its use in medical decision-making. The aims of this study were to: 1) map QLQ-C30 responses onto patient time trade-off utility scores; and 2) compare a multiattribute approach to a global evaluation approach to modeling utility scores. Methods: Two distinct approaches were applied to data from 1432 cancer patients. The multiattribute approach used psychometric analysis and expert input to select a subset of functioning and symptom scale items for modeling. The second approach focused on global health and quality-of-life items based on a conceptual model. Model selection criteria included parsimony, statistical significance and logical consistency of parameter estimates, predictive accuracy, number of states described, and scale range. Results: The optimal multiattribute model included nine variables for five items from different scales, described 144 unique states, predicted values ranging from 0.63 to 1.00, but it had poor predictive accuracy (cross-validation pseudo-R-2 = 0.056). The best-fitting global approach-based model described 24 unique states using eight indicators for two items from one scale (plus a constant) and predicted values ranging from 0.17 to 1.00 (cross-validation pseudo-R-2 = 0.127). Conclusions: Multiattribute models produced a greater number of unique predicted values, while global models exhibited more desirable statistical properties and a wider range of values. The recommended models will enable users to predict cancer patients' utilities from existing and future QLQ-C30 data sets.","[Pickard, A.

We reviewed and critically appraised the literature to identify the main methodological issues that might explain differences among reports in the relationship of nonadherence and costs in patients with diabetes. Methods: Two investigators reviewed Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane library and CINAHL and studies with information on costs by level of adherence in patients with diabetes published between January 1, 1997 and September 30th 2007 were included. Results: A total of 209 studies were identified and ten fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All included studies analyzed claims data and 70% were based on non-Medicaid and non-Medicare databases. Low medication possession ratios were associated with higher costs. Important differences were found in the ICD-9/ICD-9 CM codes used to identify patients and their diagnoses, data sources, analytic window period, definitions of adherence measures, skewness in cost data and associated statistical issues, adjustment of costs for inflation, adjustment for confounders, clinical outcomes and costs. Conclusions: Important variation among cost estimates was evident, even within studies of the same population. Readers should be cautious when comparing estimated coefficients from various studies because methodological issues might explain differences in the results of costs of nonadherence in diabetes. This is particularly important when estimates are used as inputs to pharmacoeconomic models.","[Salas, Maribel] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Div Prevent Med, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Hughes, Dyfrig] Bangor Univ, Ctr Econ & Policy Hlth, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales; [Vardeva, Kawitha] Amgen Inc, Cambridge, England; [Lebmeier, Maximilian] Wyeth Taplow, Taplow, England",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham; Bangor University; Amgen; Amgen Limited; Pfizer,"Salas, M (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama Birmingham, Div Prevent Med, 1530 3rd Ave S MT 644, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.",msalas@dopm.uab.edu,"Hughes, Dyfrig/H-5252-2012","Hughes, Dyfrig/0000-0001-8247-7459; Lebmeier, Maximilian/0000-0002-5343-0122",International Society for Pharmacoeconomics & Outcomes Research (ISPOR) Economics of Medication Compliance Working Group,International Society for Pharmacoeconomics & Outcomes Research (ISPOR) Economics of Medication Compliance Working Group,This article is written by members of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics & Outcomes Research (ISPOR) Economics of Medication Compliance Working Group; part of the Medication Compliance and Persistence Special Interest Group.

In this paper, we explore the possibility that reported limitations in daily activities are mis-reported, in particular for those who define their labour force Status as disabled/ill, and assess if economic incentives influence this group to mis-report. The main questions we wish to address therefore are: (1) was there state-dependent reporting error and did economic incentives play a role, and (2) did this change over the years 1995-2001? Using a generalised ordered response model, we compute cleansed measures of disability that correspond to predicted responses individuals would have made if employed. Unobserved differences between the employed and non-employed may exist, therefore, we control for this via correlated random effects. The results indicate that the disabled/ill group did over-report and the difference between actual and predicted probabilities only marginally changed between 1995 and 2001. The extent of this measurement error is lower once we control for Unobserved lieteroggencity.

The procedure is based on a Feasible Quasi Generalized Least Squares method from an AR(1) specification with parameter alpha, the sum of the autoregressive coefficients. The estimate of a is the OLS estimate obtained from an autoregression applied to detrended data and is truncated to take a value 1 whenever the estimate is in a T(-delta) neighborhood of 1. This makes the estimate super-efficient when alpha = 1 and implies that inference on the slope parameter can be performed using the standard Normal distribution whether alpha = I or vertical bar alpha vertical bar < 1. Theoretical arguments and simulation evidence show that delta = 1/2 is the appropriate choice. Simulations show that our procedure has better size and power properties than the tests proposed by [Bunzel, H., Vogelsang, T.J., 2005.

This study begins to address this gap through an analysis of the consumer market for malaria treatment in rural areas of three districts in Tanzania. We developed methods for investigating market definition, sales volumes and concentration, and used these to explore the relationship between antimalarial retail prices and competition. The market was strongly geographically segmented and highly concentrated in terms of antimalarial sales. Antimalarial prices were positively associated with market concentration. High antimalarial prices were likely to be an important factor in the low proportion of care-seekers obtaining appropriate treatment. Retail sector distribution of subsidised antimalarials has been proposed to increase the coverage of effective treatment, but this analysis indicates that local market power may prevent such subsidies from being passed on to rural customers. Policymakers should consider the potential to maintain lower retail prices by decreasing concentration among antimalarial providers and recommending retail price levels.

The size of the learning effect and the depreciation rate are estimated for two cardiac procedures in Maryland and Arizona. Models are estimated using patient survival as the outcome of interest. The results show that learning does not appear to be a factor in hospital quality for either procedure or for surgery generally. From a policy standpoint, based on these results, regulations in Maryland that seek to concentrate these two procedures among a small number of providers could not be justified on the grounds that higher volume would increase the quality of care.

There is a close analogy between this problem and the issue of risk adjustment in health insurance. Traditional methods of risk adjustment are analogous to indirect standardization. They are equivalent to the so-called conditional egalitarian mechanism in social choice. In general, they do not remove incentives for risk selection, even if the effect of non-morbidity variables is correctly taken into account. A method of risk adjustment based on direct standardization does remove the incentives for risk selection, but at the cost of violating a neutrality condition, stating that insurers should receive the same premium subsidy for all members of the same risk group. Direct standardization is equivalent to the egalitarian-equivalent (or proportional) mechanism in social choice. The conflict between removing incentives for risk selection and neutrality is unavoidable if the health expenditure function is not additively separable in the morbidity and efficiency variables.

In this paper, We test the constant proportionality (CP) assumption and determine the sign of relationship between duration and health state value for 42 health states using the nationally representative data from the United Kingdom Measurement and Valuation of Health study. The results reject the CP assumption and suggest that the relationship is negative for optimal health (i.e. fair innings argument) and that the relationship is positive for poorer health states (i.e. adaptation). We find no evidence of the maximum endurable time hypothesis using these data.

This finding can explain why we identify parsimonious univariate ARIMA models in applied research although VAR models of typical order and dimension used in macroeconometrics imply non-parsimonious univariate ARIMA representations. Next, we develop a strategy for Studying interactions between variables prior to possibly modelling them in a multivariate setting. Indeed, the similarity of the autoregressive roots will be informative about the presence of co-movements in a set of multiple time series. Our results justify both the use of a panel setup with homogeneous autoregression and heterogeneous cross-correlated vector moving average errors and a factor structure, and the use of cross-sectional aggregates of ARIMA series to estimate the homogeneous autoregression.

Although deterministic sensitivity analyses are essential for interpretation of results, it remains difficult to combine these alongside Monte Carlo simulations in standard modeling packages without enormous time investment. Our purpose was to facilitate one-way deterministic sensitivity analysis of TreeAge Markov state-transition models requiring first-order Monte Carlo simulations. Using TreeAge Pro Suite 2007 and Microsoft Visual Basic for EXCEL, we constructed a generic script that enables one to perform automated deterministic one-way sensitivity analyses in EXCEL employing microsimulation models. In addition, we constructed a generic EXCEL-worksheet that allows for use of the script with little programming knowledge. Linking TreeAge Pro Suite 2007 and Visual Basic enables the performance of deterministic sensitivity analyses of first-order Monte Carlo simulations. There are other potentially interesting applications for automated analysis.","[Geisler, Benjamin P.; Siebert, Uwe; Gazelle, G.

The great crash, the oil price shock and the unit root hypothesis. Econometrica 57, 1361-1401] introduced a variety of unit root tests that are valid when a break in the trend function of a time series is present. The motivation was to devise testing procedures that were invariant to the magnitude of the shift in level and/or slope. In particular, if a change is present it is allowed under both the null and alternative hypotheses. This analysis was carried under the assumption of a known break date. The subsequent literature aimed to devise testing procedures valid in the case of an unknown break date. However, in doing so, most of the literature and, in particular the commonly used test of Zivot and Andrews [Zivot, E., Andrews, D.W.K., 1992. Further evidence on the great crash, the oil price shock and the unit root hypothesis. journal of Business and Economic Statistics 10, 251-270], assumed that if a break occurs, it does so only under the alternative hypothesis of stationarity. This is undesirable since (a) it imposes an asymmetric treatment when allowing for a break, so that the test may reject when the noise is integrated but the trend is changing; (b) if a break is present, this information is not exploited to improve the power of the test. In this paper, we propose a testing procedure that addresses both issues. It allows a break under both the null and alternative hypotheses and, when a break is present, the limit distribution of the test is the same as in the case of a known break date, thereby allowing increased power while maintaining the correct size. Simulation experiments confirm that our procedure offers an improvement over commonly used methods in small samples. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Treatment options are transplantation and dialysis. Alternative dialysis modalities are peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD), each of which has been shown to produce similar outcomes and survival. Nevertheless, the financial implications of each modality are different and these differences vary by country, especially in the developing world. Changes in clinically appropriate dialysis delivery leading to more efficient use of resources would increase the resources available to treat ESRD or other disabling conditions. This article outlines the relative advantages of HD and PD and uses budget impact analysis to estimate the country-specific, 5-year financial implications on total dialysis costs assuming utilization shifts from HD to PD in two high-income (UK, Singapore), three upper-middle-income (Mexico, Chile, Romania), and three lower-middle-income (Thailand, China, Colombia) countries. Peritoneal dialysis is a clinically effective dialysis option that can be significantly cost-saving compared to HD, even in developing countries. The magnitude of costs associated with treating ESRD patients globally is large and growing. PD is a clinically effective dialysis option that can be used by a majority of ESRD patients and can also be significantly cost-saving compared to HD therapy. Increasing clinically appropriate PD use would substantially reduce health-care costs and help health-care systems meet ever-tightening budget constraints.","[Neil, Nancy; Tschosik, Elizabeth A.] ICON Clin Res, Lifecycle Sci Grp, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA; [Walker, David R.; Bhattacharyya, Samir K.] Baxter Healthcare Corp, McGaw Pk, IL USA; [Sesso, Ricardo] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Escola Paulista Med, Div Nephrol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Sesso, Ricardo] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Ctr Paulista Econ Saude, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Blackburn, Juan Carlos] Baxter Export Corp, Ft Lauderdale, FL USA; [Sciaraffia, Vito] Univ Chile, Dept Econ & Business, Hlth Adm Inst, Santiago, Chile; [Garcia-Contreras, Fernando] IMSS, Res Unit Hlth Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Capsa, Dimitrie] Fundeni Clin Inst, Bucharest, Romania",ICON plc; Baxter International Inc; Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP); Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP); Universidad de Chile; Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social; Institutul Clinic Fundeni,"Neil, N (通讯作者)，ICON Clin Res, Lifecycle Sci Grp, 188 Embarcadero Suite 200, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA.",nneil@ovation.org,"Neil, Nancy/I-4913-2012; Sesso, Ricardo C C/B-4767-2013","Neil, Nancy/0000-0002-1442-028X; Sesso, Ricardo/0000-0002-1062-0073",Baxter Healthcare Corporation.,Baxter Healthcare Corporation.,Source of financial support: This research was supported by a grant from Baxter Healthcare Corporation.,,89,34,36,0,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2009,12.0,1,,,,,73,79,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00414.x,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,397XX,18680485.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000262696800011,0

On the one hand, these sudden public incidents could cause huge casualties and property losses, thus a large quantity of emergency materials would be needed to avert deterioration, reduce casualties and losses, facilitate the reconstruction and renew its manufacture. On the other hand, although the development of science and technology improves the ability of predicting those incidents, a majority of serious natural calamity, accidents, public sanitation incidents and social security incidents are difficult to predict or the interval of their predicting time and happening time are too short, which lay high requirements to emergency response logistics system. Therefore, the study on emergency response logistics system in coal mines is of great realistic signification. Aimed at this question, the concept of emergency response logistics system for water inrush accidents in coal mines is proposed, and furthermore, the negotiation mechanism of emergency response logistics system for water inrush accidents which focuses on the water inrush prevention and control is established. This system organizes the materials of coal mines and their succor departments through Agent and on the base of MAS (Multi-Agent System), the negotiation mechanism of emergency response logistics system for water inrush accidents is designed. Not only the colliery logistics requirement of constant effect can be responded in time, but also the succor solution can be consisted quickly after the water inrush. Therefore, the disadvantage of the former colliery accidental rescuing process including slow response speed, blindness and inefficient succor resources distribution will be overcome. The negotiation mechanism provides the integrated information platform for emergency rescue and recovery from disasters so that the emergency response ability of accidents is enhanced and the casualties and losses in property are reduced effectively.","[Zhang Yanliang; Wang Jinfeng] Zhengzhou Univ, Dept Management & Engn, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China",Zhengzhou University,,yanliang@zzu.edu.cn; jinfengwang@zzu.edu.cn,"lu, qian/IUN-7445-2023",,,,,,13,0,0,0,5,ALFRED UNIV,ALFRED,"ONE SAXON DR, ALFRED, NY 14802 USA",,,978-0-9800510-2-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,2914,2918,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science,BJZ06,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000267479301137,0

This article investigates approaches used to inform the general population about the health states that they are valuing. Methods: Studies reporting methods to obtain informed general population HSUVs were identified, outlined, and critically appraised. Results: Fourteen studies were identified: seven used information sessions, two used simulation methods, two used reflection and deliberation techniques, and three used adaptation exercises. Conclusions: This review demonstrated a range of approaches to elicit informed general population HSUVs. The majority of the studies indicated that informing the respondents significantly affected their opinions of the health states and hence their HSUVs. This suggests that the utilities that are currently used to guide health-care resource allocation decisions may not represent the general population's preferences for specific health states. This could result in decisions that do not maximize societal health benefits.","[McTaggart-Cowan, Helen] Canadian Ctr Appl Res Canc, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [McTaggart-Cowan, Helen] British Columbia Canc Agcy, Vancouver, BC V5Z 4E6, Canada",British Columbia Cancer Agency,"McTaggart-Cowan, H (通讯作者)，Canadian Ctr Appl Res Canc Control, 675 W 10th Ave, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada.",hcowan@bccrc.ca,,,Canadian Institutes for Health Research,Canadian Institutes for Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),"The author thanks the editor and the two anonymous reviewers for their valuable suggestions, as well as Aki Tsuchiya and Stuart Peacock for comments on earlier versions of this article.

The trends are estimated by the OLS estimator and the long run variance (LRV) matrix is estimated by a series type estimator with carefully selected basis functions. Regardless of whether the number of basis functions K is fixed or grows with the sample size, the Wald statistic converges to a standard distribution. It is shown that critical values from the fixed-K asymptotics are second-order correct under the large-K asymptotics. A new practical approach is proposed to select K that addresses the central concern of hypothesis testing: the selected smoothing parameter is testing-optimal in that it minimizes the type II error while controlling for the type I error. Simulations indicate that the new test is as accurate in size as the nonstandard test of Vogelsang and Franses (2005) and as powerful as the corresponding Wald test based on the large-K asymptotics. The new test therefore combines the advantages of the nonstandard test and the standard Wald test while avoiding their main disadvantages (power loss and size distortion, respectively).

It affects our decision making and may have influence on cooperation. Often uncertainty is so severe that we can only predict some upper and lower bounds for the outcome of our actions, i.e., payoffs lie in some intervals. A suitable game theoretic model to support decision making in collaborative situations with interval data is that of cooperative interval games. Solution concepts that associate with each cooperative interval game sets of interval allocations with appealing properties provide a natural way to capture the uncertainty of coalition values into the players' payoffs. In this paper, some set-valued solution concepts using interval payoffs, namely the interval core, the interval dominance core and the interval stable sets for cooperative interval games, are introduced and studied. The main results contained in the paper are a necessary and sufficient condition for the non-emptiness of the interval core of a cooperative interval game and the relations between the interval core, the interval dominance core and the interval stable sets of such a game.

However, the mechanism through which education influences health has been largely unexplained. Grossman argued that education improves health production efficiency. In contrast, Fuchs argued that the association between health and education is not primarily causal but reflects unobserved causes of both outcomes. Instead of education causing better health, some 'third' variables may be related to both education and health. The 'third' variable most frequently mentioned is time preference. The aim of this paper is to investigate the role of time preference in the relationship between education and health. The role of risk attitude is also investigated. The paper exploits a unique data set of households that incorporated stated preference questions eliciting individuals' time preferences. The results show that the effect of education reduces but does not disappear when controlling for individuals' time preferences.

The aim of this study was to estimate a weighting system for the SF-6D health states representing the preferences of a sample of the Southern Brazilian general population. Methods: A sample of 248 health states defined by the SF-6D was valued by a sample of the southern Brazilian population using the standard gamble. Mean and individual level multivariate regression models were fitted to the standard gamble valuation data to estimate preference weights for all SF-6D health states. The models were compared with those estimated in the UK study. Results: Five hundred twenty-eight participants were interviewed, but 58 (11%) were excluded for failing to value the worst state. Data from 469 subjects producing 2696 health states valuations were used in the regression analysis. In contrast to the best performing model for the UK data, the best performing model for the Brazilian data was a random effects model using only the main effects variables, highlighting the importance of adopting a country-specific algorithm to derive SF-6D health states values. Inconsistent coefficients were merged to produce the final recommended model, which has all significant coefficients and a mean absolute difference between observed and predicted standard gamble values of 0.07. Conclusions: The results provide the first population-based value set for Brazil for SF-6D health states, making it possible to generate quality-adjusted life years for cost-utility studies using regional data. Besides, utility weights derived using the preferences of a sample from a southern Brazilian population can be derived from existing SF-36 data sets.","[Cruz, Luciane N.; Hoffmann, Juliana F.; Polanczyk, Carisi A.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Grad Studies Program Epidemiol, Hlth Technol Assessment Inst, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Camey, Suzi A.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Stat, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Rowen, Donna; Brazier, John E.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Fleck, Marcelo P.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Grad Studies Program Psychiat, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Polanczyk, Carisi A.] Hosp Clin, Div Cardiol, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; University of Sheffield; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Cruz, LN (通讯作者)，Rua Ramiro Barcelos 2350,Bldg 21, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",lncruz@terra.com.br,"Cruz, Luciane N/I-5163-2013; Fleck, Marcelo P/B-6706-2009; Polanczyk, Carisi CAP/D-6208-2013; brazier, john e/B-1936-2008; Camey, Suzi Alves/Y-2756-2019; Iats, Inct/K-2300-2013","Camey, Suzi Alves/0000-0002-5564-081X; Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780; Polanczyk, Carisi/0000-0002-2447-2577; Rowen, Donna/0000-0003-3018-5109","CNPQ/Brazil (Edital MCT-CNPq/MS-SCTIE-DECIT) [36/2005]; CAPES, Brazil; CNPq/Brazil","CNPQ/Brazil (Edital MCT-CNPq/MS-SCTIE-DECIT)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CAPES, Brazil(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CNPq/Brazil(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ))","This study was funded by CNPQ/Brazil (Edital MCT-CNPq/MS-SCTIE-DECIT - No. 36/2005).

Because depression has a large influence on quality of life, it is expected that utilities are responsive to changes in depression. Objective: To evaluate the change in utility derived from different instruments in depression, including the Short Form 6D (SF-6D), the Euroqol based on the UK (EQ-5D(UK)), the Euroqol based on the Dutch tariff (EQ-5D(NL)), and utilities derived from Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition (BDI-II) using the Depression-Free-Day method. Method: This study evaluated the responsiveness, the minimally important difference, and the agreement in utility change derived from the different instruments. Results: The SF-6D, EQ-5D(UK), and EQ-5D(NL) were responsive. The minimally important difference values are in line with previous studies, about 0.3. The Depression-Free-Day method nearly always resulted in positive utility changes, even for subgroups that had no change or deterioration in health status or depression. There was poor agreement between utility changes of the SF-6D, EQ-5D (either EQ-5D(UK) or EQ-5D(NL)), and DFDu. Conclusions: The SF-6D, EQ-5D(UK), and EQ-5D(NL) seem responsive and thus adequate for estimating utility in depression treatment. We do not recommend the use of the Depression-Fee-Day method. The low agreement between utility changes indicates that outcomes of the different instruments are incomparable.","[Gerhards, Sylvia A. H.; Huibers, Marcus J.

Patients on active therapies often undergo a washout period after which a single medication is initiated. Observational research has the potential to compare alternative treatments under a wider range of clinical situations if care is taken to document each patient's treatment history. Methods: This study used paid claims data from a large commercial insurer to investigate drug therapy outcomes in schizophrenia. Episodes of drug therapy were defined each time a patient initiated or restarted drug therapy using an antipsychotic, antidepressant or mood stabilizing medication. Episode definitions were based on calculations of continuous drug therapy using a 15-day gap definition. A total of 21,570 episodes of drug therapy were included in the analysis, some of which used two drugs as initial therapy. Results: Most episodes were initiated using a mood stabilizing drug (27%) or an antidepressant (38%). Over 62% of all episodes were augmentation therapy in which a psychotropic drug was added to an existing psychotropic medication, followed by switching episodes (22%) and restart episodes (16%). Patient outcomes measured by either duration of uninterrupted therapy or one-year post-treatment cost varied significantly with patient treatment history, especially episode type. The comparative effectiveness of alternative therapies is sensitive to the extent to which treatment history is taken into account. Conclusions: Observational comparative effectiveness research should capture and evaluate patient outcomes across a wide range of patients taking into account the patient's treatment history.","[McCombs, Jeffrey; Zolfaghari, Sara; Ganapathy, Vaidynathan] Univ So Calif, Dept Clin Pharm & Pharmaceut Econ & Policy, Sch Pharm, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"McCombs, J (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Dept Clin Pharm & Pharmaceut Econ & Policy, Sch Pharm, 1540 E Alcazar St,Rm CHP 140, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",jmccombs@usc.edu,,,Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS),Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS)(Bristol-Myers Squibb),"Source of financial support: The data set used in this research was developed as part of a research grant from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) to the University of Southern California, which retains the unrestricted publication rights to all research findings.",,10,3,3,1,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2011,14.0,5,,,,,679,686,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.02.002,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BG,21839406.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299081300009,0

The recent focus on improving the quality of nursing homes through market-based incentives such as public reporting may have changed this relationship, as public reporting provides nursing homes with increased incentives to engage in quality-based competition. If quality improvement activities require substantial production costs, nursing home profitability may become a more important predictor of quality under public reporting. This study explores the relationship between financial performance and quality of care and test whether this relationship changes under public reporting. Using a 10-year (fiscal years 1997-2006) panel data set of 9444 skilled nursing facilities in the US, this study employs a facility fixed-effects with and without instrumental variables approach to test the effect of finances on quality improvement and correct for potential endogeneity. The results show that better financial performance, as reflected by the 1-year lagged total profit margin, is modestly associated with higher quality but only after public reporting is initiated. These findings have important policy implications as federal and state governments use market-based incentives to increase demand for high-quality care and induce providers to compete based on quality.

They increase both morbidity and mortality and lead to extensive health-care resource utilization. Methods: Health care resource utilization by BC/PC patients with at least one SRE during the preceding 12 months was assessed through retrospective chart review. SRE-treatment costs were estimated using the Portuguese Ministry of Health cost database and analyzed using generalized linear models. Results: This study included 152 patients from nine hospitals. The mean (SD) annual SRE-treatment cost per patient was (sic)5963 ((sic)3646) and (sic)5711 ((sic)4347), for BC (n=121) and PC (n=31) patients, respectively. Mean cost per single episode ranged between (sic)1485 (radiotherapy) and (sic)13,203 (spinal cord compression). Early onset of bone metastasis (P - 0.03) and diagnosis of bone metastases at or after the occurrence of the first SRE (P < 0.001) were associated with higher SRE-treatment costs. Conclusion: These results reveal the high hospital SRE-treatment costs, highlighting the need for early diagnosis and treatment, and identify key factors determining the economic value of therapies for patients with skeletal metastases.","[Felix, J.; Soares, M.; Borrego, P.] Exigo Consultores, Alhos Vedros, Portugal; [Andreozzi, V.] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal; [Andreozzi, V.] Univ Lisbon, Ctr Estat Aplicacoes, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal; [Gervasio, H.] Inst Portugues Oncol Francisco Gentil, Coimbra, Portugal; [Moreira, A.; Passos-Coelho, J.

In an empirical application for a U.S. dataset, we find a large and significant role for a dynamic frailty component even after controlling for more than 80% of the variation in more than 100 macro-financial covariates and other standard risk factors. We emphasize the need for a latent component to prevent a downward bias in estimated default rate volatility and in estimated probabilities of extreme default losses on portfolios of U.S. debt. The latent factor does not substitute for a single omitted macroeconomic variable. We argue that it captures different omitted effects at different times. We also provide empirical evidence that default and business cycle conditions partly depend on different processes. In an out-of-sample forecasting study for point-in-time default probabilities, we obtain mean absolute error reductions of more than forty percent when compared to models with observed risk factors only. The forecasts are relatively more accurate when default conditions diverge from aggregate macroeconomic conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Schwierz, C",,,,"Schwierz, Christoph",,,EXPANSION IN MARKETS WITH DECREASING DEMAND-FOR-PROFITS IN THE GERMAN HOSPITAL INDUSTRY,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,hospital ownership; privatization; hospital market structure,OWNERSHIP FORM; EFFICIENCY; PERFORMANCE; COST,"Over the last 20 years, acute-care hospitals in most OECD countries have built up costly overcapacities. From the perspective of economic policy, it is desirable to know how hospitals of different ownership forms respond to changes in demand and are probably best suited to deal with existing overcapacities. This article examines ownership-specific differences in the responsiveness to changes in demand for hospital services in Germany between 1996 and 2006. With respect to the speed of adaptation to increasing demand, the study finds for-profit ownership to be superior to public and nonprofit ownership. However, contrary to other ownership types, for-profits also tend to expand in markets with decreasing demand - mainly through conversions of publicly owned hospitals. Thus, in short term, the privatization of the hospital sector may slow down the reduction of excess capacities and be therefore socially wasteful.

Methods: We identified 13,203 NHL patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database who received the diagnosis from 1992 to 2002 and who received chemotherapy within 12 months of diagnosis. Benefit (effectiveness) of CSF use (primary and secondary prophylaxis) was measured as observed improvement in overall survival. Costs for each patient were calculated by adding the cumulative reimbursement amounts from Medicare claims. Cost-effectiveness was estimated by modeling the joint influence of CSF use on both costs and effectiveness using a propensity-score net monetary benefit approach. Results: Primary prophylactic CSF use was cost-effective at lower willingness-to-pay thresholds, whereas at higher thresholds, not providing prophylactic CSF became the cost-effective strategy. For secondary prophylactic CSF use among patients experiencing neutropenia, fever, and/or infection, the opposite trend was observed. For low willingness-to-pay thresholds (<$20,000 per life-year gained), not administering CSF was the cost-effective strategy, whereas CSF use became cost-effective as willingness to pay increased (from $100,000+ per life-year gained). Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first large population-based study to empirically measure the cost-effectiveness of CSF among NHL patients treated with chemotherapy. CSF use as primary or secondary prophylaxis may be a cost-effective strategy depending on society's (or payers') willingness to pay for improvements in outcomes.

Using an approach based on superdifferentials, we define the notion of a risk aversion measure, from which the classical absolute as well as relative risk aversion follows as a Radon-Nikodym derivative if it exists. Using this notion, we are able to compare risk aversions for nonsmooth utility functions, and to extend a classical result of Pratt to the case of nonsmooth utility functions. We prove how relative risk aversion is connected to a super-power property of the function. Furthermore, we show how boundedness of the relative risk aversion translates to the corresponding property of the conjugate function. We propose also a weaker ordering of the risk aversion, referred to as essential bounds for the risk aversion, which requires only that bounds of the (absolute or relative) risk aversion hold up to a certain tolerance.

Dyspnea, the prominent symptom, can be measured using existing measures, but a lack of consensus about standardization of dyspnea measurement remains. We examined the psychometric performance of two item-response theory-based (IRT) measures of dyspnea and related functional limitations (FLs) in patients with COPD and simulated computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of the banks to determine the number of questions required to achieve high precision. Methods: A total of 102 patients completed banks measuring dyspnea and FLs (33 items), from which the 10-item dyspnea and FL short forms were scored as well as other self-report measures of respiratory and physical function and emotional distress. A subset of patients completed the banks 7 to 10 days later. Pulmonary function test results were obtained from medical charts. Results: The 33-item banks and 10-item short forms had excellent internal consistency (alphas >0.9) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients >0.89). Patients sorted by severity level on the Medical Research Council scale were differentiated by item banks (P < 0.001) and the short forms (P < 0.01). The banks and short forms were also associated with related measures of dyspnea (e. g., Baseline Dyspnea Index, r = 0.47-0.53), physical function (e. g., 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, r = -0.83 to -0.86) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (r = -0.32 to -0.35). On average, CAT required 4 and 5 items for accurate measurement of dyspnea and FLs, respectively. Conclusion: The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Dyspnea short forms and banks provide options for brief, psychometrically sound measures of dyspnea and/or FLs in COPD.

They were first discovered in 2003 in smoke from wildfires (Flematti et al. 2004 and Van Staden et al. 2004). Wildfire smoke can positively affect germination and post-germination stage(s) resulting in increased seedling vigour (Soos et al. 2009). To date, six members of butenolide/karrikin family have been found in smoke, KAR1 and its five naturally occurring analogues (KAR1-KAR6), (Flematti et al. 2009). Smoke stimulates germination of numerous plant species including Arabidopsis thaliana. In this work we decided to use A. thaliana plants treated with butenolide to analyse changes on the protein and phosphoprotein levels. We employed total protein TCA-acetone precipitation for total protein extraction (Mechin et al. 2006) and the PhosphoProtein Purification Kit (QIAGEN) was used to obtain phosphoproteins. We then employed 2D electrophoresis using SDS polyacrylamide gels and gel image analysis (Decodon delta 2D) to analyse protein expression changes. Chosen spots with significant changes underwent in-gel tryptic digestion and identification by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS and MASCOT peptide mass fingerprint search. We identified 32 spots with changed protein expression from phosphoproteome analysis and 42 spots from total proteome analysis. Our work was focused on investigation of responses to butenolide on expression of phosphoproteins and total proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our aim is to reveal the possible target(s) of butenolide action and further to understand the mechanism(s) of its action.","[Baldrianova, J.; Brzobohaty, B.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Mol Biol & Radiobiol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Jedelsky, P.] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Cell Biol, Prague 12844, Czech Republic; [Brzobohaty, B.] Mendel Univ Brno, Inst Biophys CR, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Charles University Prague; Mendel University in Brno,"Baldrianová, J (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Mol Biol & Radiobiol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",baldrianova@ibp.cz,"Brzobohaty, Bretislav/D-7212-2012; Jedelsky, Petr L/C-5879-2009","Brzobohaty, Bretislav/0000-0002-1552-1314;",,,,,0,0,0,0,2,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-563-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,647,647,,,,,,1,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2HX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341783400076,0

These findings appear to be contradictory. Using a sample of high-frequency returns for 20 heavily traded US stocks, we show how microstructure noise distorts the standard deviation and kurtosis of returns normalized using realized variance. When returns are standardized using a recently developed realized kernel estimator, the resulting series is clearly platykurtotic and the standard normal distribution is soundly rejected. Moreover, daily returns standardized using realized bipower variation, an estimator for integrated variance that is robust to the presence of jumps, are more consistent with the standard normal distribution. These results suggest that there is no empirical contradiction: jumps should be included in stock price models. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The goal of this study was to explore methods to compare micro-level data from hospitals in different health care systems. To do so, we developed a multi-level framework in combination with a propensity score matching technique using similarly structured data for patients receiving treatment for acute myocardial infarction in German and US Veterans Health Administration hospitals. Our case study shows important differences in results between multi-level regressions based on matched and unmatched samples. We conclude that propensity score matching techniques are an appropriate way to deal with the usual baseline imbalances across the samples from different countries. Multi-level models are recommendable to consider the clustered structure of the data when patient-level data from different hospitals and health care systems are compared. The results provide an important justification for exploring new ways in performing health system comparisons.

The parameters of production function were estimated using available panel data from 14 Czech regions in the period from 2000 to 2009 by OLS and GLS methods - depending on the form of individual effects used in the model. The convenience of the application of fixed or random individual effects was tested and discussed.

I focus attention on two particular semiparametric classes of jump-driven stochastic volatility models. In the first, the price has a continuous component with time-varying volatility and time-homogeneous jumps. The second jump-driven stochastic volatility model analyzed here has only jumps in the price, which have time-varying size. In the empirical application I model the memory of the stochastic variance with a CARMA(2,1) kernel and set the jumps in the variance to be proportional to the squared price jumps. The estimation, which is based on matching moments of certain realized power variation statistics calculated from high-frequency foreign exchange data, shows that the jump-driven stochastic volatility model containing continuous component in the price performs best. It outperforms a standard two-factor affine jump-diffusion model, but also the pure-jump jump-driven stochastic volatility model for the particular jump specification. (C) 2010 Elsevier By.

Labour market frictions are modelled as aggregate costs that firms and workers face in the process of forming a match. The question of interest is how do the labour market frictions behave during business cycle and what are the implications for development of unemployment rate. The role of labour frictions during recent global financial and subsequent economic crisis is investigated. Possible structural changes of economy caused by global crisis are considered as well. Explaining potential of labour market frictions concept is evaluated by comparison of marginal likelihood of different specifications of the model. To capture the changing structure of economy a recursive estimation method is employed. Sensitivity and identification analysis of estimated parameters is performed as well. Computations are carried out using Dynare toolbox for Matlab. Results of the estimations confirm the importance of labour market frictions and suggest their procyclical nature.,"[Tvrz, Stanislav] Masaryk Univ, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,,207212@mail.muni.cz; Osvald.Vasicek@econ.muni.cz,"Vašíček, Osvald/AAR-5742-2021","Vašíček, Osvald/0000-0003-3805-4939",,,,,7,0,0,0,2,PROFESSIONAL PUBLISHING,PRAHA 4,"MIKULOVA 1572 13,, PRAHA 4, 149 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7431-058-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,739,744,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BBZ07,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309074600123,0

However, these values are mostly not corrected for time preference, i.e., a lower valuation being attached to later life years than to earlier life years, and therefore may underestimate the true QALY weights. Moreover, the magnitude of the underestimation depends on the severity of the health state and the horizon chosen in the TTO method. Hence, we cannot just add a constant component to all existing QALY tariffs. In this study, we estimated the value of correcting TTO scores. We showed the possible consequences for health policymaking when we correct TTO scores for time preference, thereby taking into account severity and horizon. Methods: We employed the results obtained using a nonparametric time preference elicitation method. We made use of experimental time preference data, in order to better represent individuals' time preferences. Results: Our results demonstrate that correcting for time preference does not result in one clear influence on the QALY gains from health changes. When considering these changes in the context of cost-utility ratios, the proportional change in the QALY gain is crucial. Conclusions: Correcting TTO scores has a moderate, yet nonnegligible influence on outcomes. We conclude that correcting TTO scores for time preference is feasible and influential, so that there can be a substantial value of correcting values for time preference.","[Attema, Arthur E.; Brouwer, Werner B.

The economy is populated by an arbitrarily large number of traders whose investment choices are described by means of generic smooth functions of past realizations. These choices can be consistent with (but not limited to) the solutions of expected utility maximization problems. Under the assumption that individual demand for the risky asset is expressed as a fraction of individual wealth, we derive a complete characterization of equilibria. It is shown that irrespectively of the number of agents and of their behavior, all possible equilibria belong to a one-dimensional Equilibrium Market Curve. This geometric tool helps to illustrate the possibility of different phenomena, as multiple equilibria, and can be used for comparative static analysis. We discuss the relative performances of different strategies and the selection principle governing market dynamics on the basis of the stability analysis of equilibria. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

While the approach in Abrevaya (1999) is root n-consistent, it is not applicable when censoring is present. For the case with fixed censoring, existing approaches such as those of Manski (1987) and Abrevaya (2000) apply, but their estimators converge at rates slower than root n, thus possessing zero efficiency compared with root n-consistent estimators. While the approaches by Honore (1992) and Ridder and Tunali (1999) do produce root n-consistent estimators under fixed and independent censoring respectively, they require either the error distribution or the transformation function to be completely known. Our root n-consistent estimator for the fixed censoring case could be extended to the cases with independent and dependent censoring. Under dependent censoring, in contrast to our method, the existing approaches (e.g., Horowitz and Lee (2003), Lee (2008) and Das and Ying (2005)) require parametric specification for the transformation function or the error distribution. Large sample properties of the proposed estimators are presented. We also provide a simulation study to illustrate our estimation methods in finite samples.

When trying to estimate the integrated volatility and the variance of noise, this parametric approach remains consistent, efficient and robust as a quasi-estimator under misspecified assumptions. Moreover, it shares the model-free feature with nonparametric alternatives, for instance realized kernels, while being advantageous over them in terms of finite sample performance. In light of quadratic representation, this estimator behaves like an iterative exponential realized kernel asymptotically. Comparisons with a variety of implementations of the Tukey-Hanning(2) kernel are provided using Monte Carlo simulations, and an empirical study with the Euro/US Dollar future illustrates its application in practice.

To the extent demand-side programs are successful, their cost effectiveness can be appealing from a policy perspective. Established in 2005, the Montana Meth Project (MMP) employs a graphic advertising campaign to deter meth use among teens. Due to the MMP's apparent success, seven other states have adopted Meth Project campaigns. Using data from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (YRBS), this paper investigates whether the MMP reduced methamphetamine use among Montana's youth. When accounting for a preexisting downward trend in meth use, effects on meth use are statistically indistinguishable from zero. These results are robust to using related changes of meth use among individuals without exposure to the campaign as controls in a difference-in-difference framework. A complementary analysis of treatment admissions data from the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS) confirms the MMP has had no discernable impact on meth use. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This requires specifying probability distributions for the model variables that are uncertain. Methods: The effect size of the intervention is often expressed as a relative risk, and the standard assumption for a relative risk is that it has a lognormal distribution with the natural log of the relative risk and its standard error as parameters. The problem with this assumption is that the mean of the bootstrap draws from the lognormal distribution is always higher than the relative risk. Results: This article looks at two ways to correct for this effect and discusses their advantages and drawbacks. Both methods return a bootstrap mean equal to the relative risk, but the first returns an uncertainty interval that is narrower than the corresponding confidence interval, although the second method retains the corresponding width. Conclusions: The article concludes that the second correction method is preferred.","Univ Queensland, Sch Populat Hlth, Herston, Qld 4006, Australia",University of Queensland,"Barendregt, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Populat Hlth, Herston Rd, Herston, Qld 4006, Australia.",j.barendregt@sph.uq.edu.au,"Barendregt, Jan J/F-6895-2010",,NHMRC [351558],NHMRC(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),NHMRC grant 351558.,,7,22,23,0,8,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN-JUL,2010,13.0,4,,,,,388,391,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00686.x,0.0,,,4,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,625DD,20659273.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000279872300008,0

We evaluated the relationship between patient expectations before TJR, their fulfillment and HRQoL outcomes at 3 and 12 months after surgery. Methods: Consecutive patients preparing for TJR of the knee or hip due to primary osteoarthritis in 15 hospitals in Spain were recruited for the study. Patients completed questionnaires before surgery, and 3 and 12 months afterward: five questions about expectations before surgery and their fulfillment at 3 and 12 months; three HRQoL instruments Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Short Form 12 (SF-12), and European Quality of Life Instrument (EQ-5D); as well as questions about sociodemographic information. Student's t test was used to assess the relationship between fulfillment of expectations and gains in HRQoL. Results: A total of 881 patients took part in the study. Preintervention expectations for TJR ranged from 85% to 86% of patients, with high expectations for pain relief and ability to walk to 70% with high expectations about interacting with others. Patients who reported hawing fulfilled their expectations at 3 and 12 months had significantly greater gains in HRQoL than those who did not. Besides, we observed a statistically significant improvement in the percentage of patients who fulfill their expectations from 3 to 12 months. Conclusions: Patients have high expectations for the benefits of TJR, and those who fulfill their expectations have greater gains in HRQoL assessing by SF-12, WOMAC and EQ-5D. Health-care providers should help their patients develop realistic expectations about the impact of TJR.","[Gonzalez Saenz de Tejada, Marta] Hosp Basurto, Unidad Invest, Bilbao 48013, Vizcaya, Spain; [Herrera, Carmen] Hosp Virgen Nieves, Granada, Spain; [Garcia, Lidia] Canary Isl Hlth Serv, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain; [Aizpuru, Felipe] Hosp Txagorritxu, Vitoria, Spain; [Sarasqueta, Cristina] Hosp Donostia, Donostia San Sebastian, Spain",Basurto Hospital; Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves; University Hospital of Araba; University Hospital Donostia,"de Tejada, MGS (通讯作者)，Hosp Basurto, Unidad Invest, Jado 4 Planta,Avda Montevideo 18, Bilbao 48013, Vizcaya, Spain.",marta.gonzalezsaenzdetejada@osakidetza.net,"Geurts, José W/O-3673-2014; García-Pérez, Lidia/C-6364-2011","García-Pérez, Lidia/0000-0002-5626-8116; Herrera-Espineira, Carmen/0000-0002-3062-4055; Gonzalez-Saenz de Tejada, Marta/0000-0003-3826-6587",Fondo de Investigacion Sanitaria [PI04/0938],Fondo de Investigacion Sanitaria(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government),This study was supported by a grant from the Fondo de Investigacion Sanitaria (PI04/0938).

We do so by analyzing two polar cases, and a number of intermediate ones. In our most structured case, that is where choice behavior is defined in universal choice domains and satisfies the weak axiom of revealed preference, finding the complete preorder rationalizing choice behavior is a simple matter. In the polar case, where no restriction whatsoever is imposed, either on choice behavior or on choice domain, finding a collection of complete preorders that rationalizes behavior turns out to be intractable. We also show that the task of finding the rationalizing complete preorders is equivalent to a graph problem. This allows the search for existing algorithms in the graph theory literature, for the rationalization of choice. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We allow both their marginal utilities of income and their marginal disutilities from health risks to vary systematically with the structures of their households. Demand by adults for programs which reduce their own health risks is found to be influenced by (1) their parenthood status, (2) the numbers of children in different age brackets currently in their households, (3) the ages of the adults themselves, (4) the latency period before they would fall ill, and (5) whether there will still be children in the household at that time. For younger adults, willingness to pay by parents is greater than for non-parents, and increases with each additional young child. For middle-aged adults, willingness to pay for corresponding risk reductions falls when teenagers are present and falls further with each additional teenager in the household. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Each consumer who visits only one store, chooses the quantities of the goods which maximize his/her utility function under the budget constraint (namely consumption expenditures must equal income minus transportation costs), choosing the store which provides him/her with the largest indirect utility. We derive the equilibrium price when the firms are located at the two extremities of Hotelling's linear city and show that income increases have a pro-competitive effect. Equilibrium prices are indeed decreasing with consumers' income and increasing with the transportation cost. They converge to marginal costs as income goes to infinity or the transportation cost goes to zero. However the analysis does not amount to a story of weight of transportation cost relative to income. Equilibrium profits do not change in the same way as the transportation cost decreases or the income increases. They do not tend toward the same limit as the income tends to infinity or the transportation cost tends to zero. Finally the one-stop shopping assumption is discussed. It is mainly proved that it may emerge endogenously. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents a decision program that addresses the question in which disease areas and at what intensity to invest in quality improvement (QI) in order to maximize Population health. The decision program considers both a budget constraint as well as time constraints of educators and health professionals to participate in educational activities. The calculations of the model are based on a single assumption which is that more intense quality efforts lead to larger QIs, but with diminishing returns. This assumption has been validated by previous studies. All other relationships described by the model are deduced from this assumption. The model uses data from QI trials published in the literature. Thus, it is able to assess how the vast number Of Published QI strategies compare in terms of their value.

Inside the shell, which is normally maintained at room temperature (cca.20 degrees C), there are two symmetrical container. Resistance thermometer and heating member embedded in the carrier sample serves as the primary temperature control system. Secondary temperature control system measures the difference in temperature between the two carriers, and this difference is adjusted to zero heat flow control, which is measured. Otherwise, we can say that the temperature of the sample is kept isothermally with the comparative sample (or block) supplying heat to the comparative samples.

By providing a framework of standards of practice and encouraging nations to collaborate and co-operate in maritime archaeological teaching the UNESCO Convention 2001 will fundamentally change the ways in which the teaching of maritime archaeology is conducted in many countries of the world. This paper describes one model for the implementation of Article 21 (Training in Underwater Archaeology) of the UNESCO Convention 2001 which it is hoped will provide the basis for effective collaboration and co-operation in the teaching of maritime archaeologists in the Asia-Pacific region.

Nitrogen was applied in the form of ammonium nitrate with limestone during the sowing in the growing stage DC 23 and DC 31. The problem was of small plot field experiment with two varieties of barley (Jersey, Sebastian) and three fore-crops (sugar beet, wheat, maize). Later term of nitrogen fertilization did not affect significantly any of the monitored parameters. High significant effect of year and the fore-crop was showed at the grain yield. Conversely term effect of nitrogen fertilization did not show significantly. Nitrogen substances in grain were significantly affected by the year. Effect of variety, date of nitrogen fertilization and fore-crop was evaluated as statistically insignificant. The effect of year and variety was evaluated as very highly significant at weight of thousands grains. Very high influence of variety and highly significant effect of year was developed at the grain over the sieve overflow.

The purpose of this study was to assess MIDs for the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Melanoma (FACT-M). Methods: A prospective validation study of the FACT-M was performed with 273 patients with stages I through IV melanoma. FACT-M, Karnofsky Performance Scales, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status scores were obtained at baseline and 3 months following enrollment. Anchor- and distribution-based methods for assessing MIDs were compared, and pattern-mixture modeling was employed to derive multivariate adjusted estimates. Results: This study indicates that an approximate range for MIDs of the FACT-M subscales is between 5 to 9 points for the Trial Outcome Index, 4 to 6 points for the Melanoma Combined Subscale, 2 to 4 points for the Melanoma Subscale, and 1 to 2 points for the Melanoma Surgery Subscale. Each method produced similar but not identical ranges of MIDs. Conclusions: The properties of the anchor instrument employed to derive MIDs directly affect resulting MID ranges and point values. When MIDs are offered as supportive evidence of a clinically meaningful change, the anchor instrument used to derive clinically meaningful thresholds of change should be clearly stated along with information supporting the choice of anchor instrument as the most appropriate for the domain of interest.","[Askew, Robert L.; Xing, Yan; Cormier, Janice N.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Surg Oncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Palmer, J.

Often there are no objective signs or symptoms of injury, and diagnosing lasting whiplash-associated disorders (WAD) is difficult, in particular for individuals with mild or moderate injuries. This leaves a scope for compensation-seeking behaviour. The medical literature disagrees on the importance of this explanation. In this paper we trace the long-term earnings of a group of Danish individuals with mild to moderate injuries claiming compensation for having permanently lost earnings capacity and investigate if they return to their full pre-whiplash earnings when the insurance claim has been assessed. We find that about half of the claimants, those not granted compensation, return to an earnings level comparable with their pre-whiplash earnings suggesting that these individuals do not have chronic WAD in the sense that their earnings capacity is reduced. The other half, those granted compensation, experience persistent reductions in earnings relative to the case where they had not been exposed to a whiplash, even when they have a strong financial incentive to not reduce earnings. This suggests that moderate injuries tend to be chronic, and that compensation-seeking behaviour is not the main explanation for this group. We find that claimants with chronic WADS used more health care in the year prior to the whiplash than claimants with non-chronic cases. This suggests that lower initial health capital increases the risk that a whiplash causes persistent WAD. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: The PHARMO Record Linkage System comprised among others linked drug dispensing, hospital and clinical laboratory data from approximately 2.5 million individuals in The Netherlands. Patients with DM (type 1 and type 2) were included in the study cohort from 2000 to 2004 if they used antidiabetic drugs or had HbA1c >= 6.5 mmol/L or had a hospitalization for DM or a diabetic complication in the measurement year or in the preceding year. Controls, defined as subjects without a diagnosis of DM and/or subjects not prescribed glucose-lowering medication, were 1:1 matched to patients with diabetes, on birth year, zip code, and gender. Complications (hospitalizations and dispensings for cardiovascular disease/eye problems/amputations) were classified into stages. Complications attributed to DM were estimated as complication stages 1 and 2 among patients minus those among controls. Drug costs were extrapolated to The Netherlands by direct standardization. Results: Among the total population in The Netherlands, the prevalence of DM increased from 2.8% in 2000 to 4.0% in 2004. Severe cardiovascular complications attributed to DM increased from 18,000 to 39,000 patients. Per DM patient the cost of direct treatment attributed to DM increased from 974 in 2000 to 1283 in 2004. Per 100 members of the total population, this increase was from 2764 in 2000 to 5140 in 2004. Most of these costs (65% in 2004) were because of hospitalizations. Conclusion: Drug treatment, hospitalizations, and cost attributed to diabetes mellitus have almost doubled between 2000 and 2004, but so did the background costs in the general population, perhaps because of preventive efforts.","[van der Linden, Michiel W.; Plat, Arian W.; Erkens, Joelle A.; Herings, Ron M.

We find that when one opponent's utility is a concave transformation of the other's, the agent doing the ranking prefers the more risk averse, easier to satisfy, opponent. When opponents' utilities are translations of each other, we find that the bargainer whose ideal point is farthest from Q prefers an opponent whose ideal is closest to his own. For the agent closest to Q, the ranking of opponents depends on the absolute risk aversion (ARA) of the opponents' utility functions. Another intuitive result emerges when opponents' preferences exhibit increasing ARA: the ranking of solutions and opponents' ideal points coincide. However, under decreasing ARA, the agent closest to Q prefers the opponent whose ideal is farthest from her own. We also study rankings when one opponents' utility is a combination of a concave transformation and a right translation of the other's. For the concave/DARA and convex/IARA combinations, the effects on the solutions reinforce one another. In the concave/IARA and convex/DARA cases, the effect is ambiguous. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Adult schizophrenia patients were selected from deidentified Pennsylvania Medicaid claims database (1999-2003). Included patients were continuously enrolled and initiated with olanzapine or quetiapine monotherapy after a 90-day washout period. Treatment costs were calculated for 1-year post-therapy initiation and inflation adjusted to year 2003. To control for selection bias, olanzapine and quetiapine patients were 1:1 matched using an optimal matching algorithm on propensity score, which was generated using logistic regression controlling for demographics, prior drug therapy, utilization, and costs. Treatment costs for the matched cohorts were compared directly, as well as using a difference-in-difference analysis. Results: A total of 6929 patients treated with olanzapine and 2321 with quetiapine met inclusion criteria. Quetiapine patients appeared more severe at baseline. After propensity score matching, 2321 patient pairs had similar baseline characteristics, including total costs. Compared with matched quetiapine patients, for the 1-year postindex period, olanzapine patients had similar drug costs ($6131 vs. $6014, P = 0.326), lower medical costs ($9897 vs. $11,218, P = 0.0128), and lower total health-care costs ($16,028 vs. $17,232, P = 0.0279). Lower psychiatric hospitalization costs account for most of the total cost difference. Difference-in-difference regression analysis confirmed olanzapine's economic advantage. Further adjusting for baseline variations, the total cost advantage of olanzapine patients was $962 (P = 0.032), and was mostly because of reduced psychiatric hospitalization costs of $992 (P = 0.004). Conclusion: Schizophrenia patients treated with olanzapine had lower total costs than quetiapine patients, mostly attributable to reductions in psychiatric hospitalization costs.","[Yu, Andrew P.; Atanasov, Pavel; Ben-Hamadi, Rym; Birnbaum, Howard] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA USA; [Stensland, Michael D.; Philips, Glenn] Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA",Analysis Group Inc.; Eli Lilly,"Yu, AP (通讯作者)，111 Huntington Ave,10th Floor, Boston, MA 02199 USA.",ayu@analysisgroup.com,,,Eli Lilly and Company,Eli Lilly and Company(Eli Lilly),"Source of financial support: This study was presented at the 2007 American Psychiatric Association Annual Meeting, San Diego, CA, May 19-24, 2007, and was supported by funding from Eli Lilly and Company.",,33,8,10,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2009,12.0,5,,,,,708,715,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00498.x,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,459SR,19508658.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000267130200011,0

Using two different surveys of the Spanish population (total n = 892), we consider whether willingness to pay (WTP) is (approximately) proportional to the health gains measured in QALYs. We also explore whether subjects' responses are prone to any significant biases. We find that the estimated MVQ varies inversely with the Magnitude Of health gain. We also find two other (ir)regularities: the existence of ordering effects: and insensitivity of WTP to the duration Of the period of payment. Taken to-ether, these effects result in large variations in estimates of the MVQ. If we are ever to obtain consistent and stable estimates, we should try to Understand better the sources of variability found in the course of this study. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We propose novel statistics, that are based on the maximum likelihood estimator of Gibbons [Gibbons, M., 1982. Multivariate tests of financial models: A new approach. journal of Financial Economics 10, 3-27], which remain trustworthy in these cases. The inadequacy of the FM and GLS two-pass t/Wald statistics is highlighted in a power and size comparison using quarterly portfolio returns from Lettau and Ludvigson [Lettau, M., Ludvigson, S., 2001. Resurrecting the (C)CAPM: A cross-sectional test when risk premia are time-varying. journal of Political Economy 109, 1238-1287]. The power and size comparison shows that the FM and GLS two-pass t/Wald statistics can be severely size distorted. The 95% confidence sets for the risk premia in the above-cited work that result from the novel statistics differ substantially from those that result from the FM and GLS two-pass t-statistics. They show support for the human capital asset pricing model although the 95% confidence set for the risk premia on labor income growth is unbounded. The 95% confidence sets show no support for the (scaled) consumption asset pricing model, since the 95% confidence set of the risk premia on the scaled consumption growth consists of the whole real line, but do not reject it either.

The method is built on a technique that can separate avoidable and unavoidable mortality risks, using world mortality data compiled by the World Health Organization for the year 2000. The new method is applied to data from 191 countries. It is found that controlling for unavoidable mortality risks leads to a lower estimate of health inequality than otherwise, especially for developed countries. Furthermore, although countries with a higher life expectancy at birth tend to have lower health inequality, there are significant variations in health inequalities across countries with the same life expectancy. The results therefore support the WHO's plea for using health inequality as a distinct parameter from the average level of health in assessing the performance of health systems.

Health-related quality of life data (N = 6890) covering a wide range of health conditions was used to explore the relationship between the SF-6D and the eight health dimension scores. Models obtained using ordinary least square regressions were compared for goodness of fit and predictive abilities on both within-sample subgroups and out-of-sample published data sets. The models explained more than 83% of the variance in the individual SF-6D scores with a mean absolute error of 0.040. When using mean health dimension scores from within-sample subgroups and out-of-sample published data sets, the majority of predicted scores were well within the minimal important difference (0.041) for the SF-6D. This article presents a mechanism to estimate a mean cohort preference-based SF-6D score using the eight mean health dimension scores of the SF-36. Using published summary statistics, the out-of-sample validation demonstrates that the algorithms can be used to inform both clinical and economic research.

We use data on 231 208 individuals in Great Britain from 19 rounds of the General Household Survey between 1979 and 2000. Results are insensitive to the measure of self-assessed health used but the sign and significance of the effect of relative income depend on the reference group (national or regional) and the measure of relative income (Gini coefficient, absolute or proportional difference from the reference group mean, Yitzhaki absolute and proportional relative deprivation and affluence). Only one model (relative deprivation measured as income proportional to regional mean income) performs better than the model without relative income and has a positive estimated effect of absolute income on health. In this model the increase in the probability of good health from a ceteris paribus reduction in relative deprivation from the upper quartile to zero is 0.010. whereas an increase in income from the lower to the upper quartile increases the probability by 0.056. While our results provide only very weak support for the relative deprivation hypothesis, the inevitable correlation of measures of individual income and relative deprivation measured by comparing income and incomes in a reference group makes identification of the separate effects of income and relative deprivation problematic.

This paper provides an evidence-based scenario of causality leading to the current state of reef degradation. Contrary to revisionist narratives that emphasize the local-scale effects of fishing and nutrient loading, coral populations were and are degrading primarily due to regional- to global-scale factors. Most important among these large-scale factors are disease outbreaks and coral bleaching, both of which are related to climate change. Because policy recommendations and management strategies will differ depending on which cause(s) are perceived to exert the greatest influence, scientists must be explicit about when they are acting as advocates and when they are objectively conveying scientific results. Legitimate scientific debate is healthy and in no way diminishes the goal of creating cogent policy. Forced ideological unification, in contrast, risks obfuscation, undermining the scientific process. Science must move forward unfettered by political expediency; however, the situation is dire enough to warrant immediate action on local, regional, and global levels, based on the best scientific information at hand, in parallel with continuing research.","[Aronson, Richard B.] Florida Inst Technol, Dept Biol Sci, 150 West University Blvd, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA; [Precht, William F.] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Florida Keys Natl Marine Sanctuary, Key Largo, FL 33037 USA",Florida Institute of Technology; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Aronson, RB (通讯作者)，Florida Inst Technol, Dept Biol Sci, 150 West University Blvd, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA.",,,"Aronson, Richard/0000-0003-0383-3844",,,,,72,3,3,0,20,AMER INST PHYSICS,MELVILLE,"2 HUNTINGTON QUADRANGLE, STE 1NO1, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",0094-243X,,978-0-7354-0694-0,AIP CONF PROC,,,2009,1157.0,,,,,,48,+,,,,,,3,Ecology; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BLH26,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000270167600007,0

The Cardinal Health database repository was utilized to extract reimbursement data for laparoscopic and open cholecystectomy, hysterectomy, and appendectomy surgical procedures. Utilizing a 22-hospital sample and a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant clinical data extraction technique, the Cardinal Health database repository produced a Nosocomial Infection Marker to identify and track nosocomial infection rates for these procedures. ICD-9 codes were utilized to identify 10,731 patients who had undergone these procedures between September 2004 and December 2006. Multivariable linear regression models were estimated to isolate the effects of laparoscopic versus open surgery and nosocomial infections on the cost of care. Laparoscopic surgery significantly reduces the overall cost of care for cholecystectomies, hysterectomies, and appendectomies. Controlling for the cost of nosocomial infection, incremental cost savings from laparoscopic versus open surgery for all three procedures average $1608. Cholecystectomy has the largest savings ($3299), followed by hysterectomy ($1385) and appendectomy ($1032). These cost savings in part reflect that patients undergoing laparoscopic procedures have shorter lengths of stay. In contrast, nosocomial infection increases costs substantially for each surgery type, raising costs for cholecystectomy by $4794, hysterectomy by $4528, and appendectomy by $6108. The cost of care for laparoscopic surgery is lower than open surgery for cholecystectomy, hysterectomy, and appendectomy. This conclusion is based on actual hospital reimbursement data.","[Gunnarsson, Candace] Stat Solut, Cincinnati, OH USA; [Rizzo, John A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Prevent Med, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Rizzo, John A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Econ, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Hochheiser, Louis] Univ Vermont, Coll Med, Burlington, VT USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; University of Vermont,"Gunnarsson, C (通讯作者)，S2 Stat Solut Inc, 7691 Cornell Rd, Cincinnati, OH 45242 USA.",clgunnarsson@cinci.rr.com,,,"Ethicon-Endo Surgery, Cincinnati, OH, USA.","Ethicon-Endo Surgery, Cincinnati, OH, USA.","Source of financial support: This study was supported by Ethicon-Endo Surgery, Cincinnati, OH, USA.",,82,7,7,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2009,12.0,1,,,,,47,54,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00422.x,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,397XX,18657101.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000262696800008,0

One of them is frequently great nebulosity, which decreases the direct radiation, but increases the diffused one. Therefore usual constructions of solar energy receivers are not efficient enough in Latvia, and new constructions are required, which would be able to use the diffused radiation more efficiently. One of such new constructions a semi-spherical solar collector can be. Such semi-spherical solar collector has many advantages in comparison with conventional flat one. It receives more solar radiation at morning and at evening, it is more durable against wind impact, it has good look. A model of such semi-spherical solar collector has been made. This article considers the distribution and daily course of its surface temperature. The measured distribution of surface temperature of the semi-spherical solar collector corresponds to the calculated one. There are no spot on the semi-spherical surface which would never get warm.

Cost-effectiveness analyses can guide choices toward interventions with the most health benefit for the least cost but are limited because generic measures of health value are infrequently available in the literature and are expensive to collect. We report on the application of a new approach to estimate the health value of alternative treatment patterns. We apply this approach to common treatment patterns for major depression, and we generate estimates of the change in health value that is attributable to a particular treatment. We also obtain estimates of treatment costs and report cost/health value ratios. We used a modified expert panel approach to estimate the change in health value attributable to different patterns of treatment. We used claims and pharmacy data to define usual care treatment patterns and estimate costs. The lowest cost and most frequent treatment, 1 to 3 psychotherapy visits, produces minimal improvement. Treatments that include an antidepressant medication provide more health benefit per unit cost than all other treatments and adding a medication follow-up visit provides a lot of benefit for minimal cost. We demonstrate the application of a new approach to estimate the health value of common depression treatment practices in the United States. Our results suggest cost-effective targets for quality improvement efforts by identifying ways in which treatment for depression could cost less to get to a given outcome. Because our approach uses a generic health outcome measure, it can be applied to other conditions, permitting comparisons of benefit across diseases.","[Watkins, Katherine E.; Burnam, M.

Consumers differ in their wealth and illness severity (defined as treatment cost). Due to a limited budget, some consumers must be rationed. Rationed consumers may purchase from a monopolistic private market. We consider two information regimes. In the first, the public supplier rations consumers according to their wealth information (means testing). In equilibrium, the public supplier must ration both rich and poor consumers, Rationing some poor consumers implements price reduction in the private market. In the second information regime, the public supplier rations consumers according to consumers' wealth and cost information. In equilibrium, consumers are allocated the good if and only if their costs are below a threshold (cost effectiveness).

The proposed test fully exploits the information in the joint conditional distribution of underlying economic processes and hence is expected to have good power in a multivariate context. A class of easy-to-interpret diagnostic procedures is supplemented to gauge possible sources of model misspecification. Our tests are also applicable to discrete-time distribution models. Simulation studies show that the tests provide reliable inference in finite samples. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We develop a modified Akaike information criterion (AIC), a modified Mallows' C(p) criterion and a modified Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The penalty terms in these criteria are shown to be different from the usual terms. We prove that the modified BIC consistently selects the regressors and the number of breaks whereas the modified AIC and the modified C(p) criterion tend to overfit with positive probability.

The cost-utility of adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC remains unknown. We evaluated the cost-utility of bevacizumab added to chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. Methods: We developed a Markov model to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and direct medical costs from the US payer perspective in patients treated with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy and compared these outcomes with patients treated with chemotherapy alone. We populated the model with survival and toxicity data from the clinical trial that compared the two strategies. We obtained utilities from a literature search and unit costs from Medicare. We discounted QALYs and costs at 3% per year. We addressed uncertainty with one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyzes. Results: Compared with chemo-therapy alone, bevacizumab and chemotherapy increased mean QALYs by 0.13, at an incremental life-time cost of US$72,000 per patient. The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was US$560,000/QALY. The ICUR was most sensitive to the survival on bevacizumab treatment, the drug costs of bevacizumab, and the utility of stable disease on treatment. At a threshold of US$100,000/QALY, the addition of bevacizumab had a 0.2% probability of being cost-effective. Conclusions: Bevacizumab does not appear to be cost-effective when added to chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC, based on approximate cost-effectiveness thresholds that have been identified in the United States. These results may inform decision-makers about resource allocation for NSCLC care.","[Goulart, Bernardo; Ramsey, Scott] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98104 USA; [Goulart, Bernardo; Ramsey, Scott] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Goulart, B (通讯作者)，1100 Fairview Ave N,M-S M3-B232, Seattle, WA 98109 USA.",bgoulart@fhcrc.org,"Goulart, Bernardo Haddock Lobo/L-5514-2019",,,,,,36,77,81,1,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2011,14.0,6,,,,,836,845,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.04.004,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BJ,21914503.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299081600006,0

There appears to be a significant positive association between local area-level radiation dosage and perception of poor health, though much weaker associations between local area-level dosage and other specific self-reported health conditions.

One previous study validating the WPAI in Crohn's disease (CD) patients suggested that its reproducibility may be unsatisfactory. This study evaluated the validity and reproducibility of the Spain Spanish version of the WPAI questionnaire in CD patients. Methods: In a prospective study, convergent validity was tested comparing WPAI with quality of life and CD activity indices. Known-groups validity was assessed by comparing WPAI scores in CD patients with active versus inactive disease. Reproducibility of repeated tests was evaluated by comparing two WPAI measures obtained two to four weeks apart in stable patients. Results: One hundred eight patients were included in the various steps of the analysis. The WPAI showed adequate known groups validity and convergent validity. The reproducibility of the test and, specifically, that of the evaluation of presenteeism (the impairment of productivity while working) were good. Conclusions: This study confirms the validity of WPAI for measuring work impairment in CD patients. In contrast to previous studies, the test reproducibility was adequate.","[Vergara, Mercedes; Montserrat, Antonia; Villoria, Albert; Gallardo, Olga; Calvet, Xavier] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Digest Dis Unit, Hosp Sabadell, Inst Univ Parc Tauli, Sabadell, Spain; [Vergara, Mercedes; Montserrat, Antonia; Casellas, Francesc; Ricart, Elena; Calvet, Xavier] Inst Salud Carlos III, CIBERehd, Madrid, Spain; [Casellas, Francesc] Hosp Valle De Hebron, Digest Dis Unit, Barcelona, Spain; [Suarez, David] Fundacio Parc Tauli, Unitat Epidemiol & Avaluacio, Sabadell, Spain; [Maudsley, Michael] Univ Barcelona, Escola Idiomes Moderns, Barcelona, Spain; [Ricart, Elena] Serv Gastroenterol Hosp Clin, Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Parc Tauli Hospital Universitari; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBEREHD; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Parc Tauli Hospital Universitari; University of Barcelona,"Calvet, X (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Serv Digestiu, Hosp Sabadell, Inst Univ Parc Tauli, Parc Tauli 1, Barcelona 08208, Spain.",xcalvet@tauli.cat,"Calvet, Xavier/H-3288-2019; Casellas, Francesc/AAT-1018-2021","Calvet, Xavier/0000-0002-6278-9663; Casellas, Francesc/0000-0003-3196-039X; Calvet, Xavier/0000-0002-4413-4209; Vergara, Mercedes/0000-0002-6971-8657","Marato de TV3, Instituto de Salud Carlos III [C03/02, PI 05/1157]; Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca de la Generalitat de Catalunya [2004ACOM 00041]; Societat Catalana de Digestologia","Marato de TV3, Instituto de Salud Carlos III(Instituto de Salud Carlos III); Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca de la Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); Societat Catalana de Digestologia","This study was supported by grants from the Marato de TV3, Instituto de Salud Carlos III (C03/02 and PI 05/1157 and CIBEREHD), from the Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca de la Generalitat de Catalunya (2004ACOM 00041), and from the Societat Catalana de Digestologia.",,12,23,25,0,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2011,14.0,6,,,,,859,861,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.02.1179,0.0,,,3,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BJ,21914506.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299081600009,0

The focuses of the approach are the modeling of in-sample structural breaks and forecasting time series allowing out-of-sample breaks. The model has several desirable features. First, the number of regimes is not fixed but is treated as a random variable. Second, the model adopts a hierarchical prior for regime coefficients, which allows for the coefficients of one regime to contain information about coefficients of other regimes. Third, the regime coefficients can be integrated analytically in the posterior density; as a consequence the posterior simulator is fast and reliable. An application to US real GDP quarterly growth rates links groups of regimes to specific historical periods and provides forecasts of future growth rates. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Traditional methods to value such care include opportunity and replacement cost. This study is the first to employ the discrete choice experiment methodology to value informal care tasks. A monetary value is estimated for three tasks (personal care, supervising and household tasks). The relationship between time spent on formal and informal care is also modelled and preference heterogeneity investigated using the Latent Class Model. Complementarity between supervising tasks and formal care is observed. Monetary compensation is important, with willingness to accept per hour values ranging from pound 0.38 to 0.83 pound for personal care, 0.75 pound for supervising and 0.31 pound to 0.6 pound for household tasks. Heterogeneity in preferences is observed, with monetary compensation being important for younger people, but insignificant for older individuals. Such heterogeneity is important at the policy level. Values are lower than those generated by opportunity cost and replacement cost methods, perhaps because of the limited ability of revealed preference methods to capture broader aspect of utility. Differences with contingent valuation methods are also observed, suggesting future research should investigate the external validity of the different methods.

Methods: A Markov model with four therapy lines and six health states based on CD4(+) cell-count ranges was developed to estimate lifetime costs and health outcomes. Efficacy data (virologic response and CD4(+) cell-count changes) for first-line therapy were from 144-week results of Study 934 comparing tenofovir/emtricitabine with zidovudine/lamivudine and 48-week results of Study CNA30024 comparing abacavir/lamivudine with zidovudine/lamivudine, all in combination with efavirenz. Data from Study CNA30024 for abacavir/lamivudine were adjusted to allow for an indirect comparison with tenofovir/emtricitabine. Subsequent therapy lines were based on likely baskets of antiretroviral therapy recommended by US treatment guidelines. Utility values, mortality rates, and costs (2009 US dollars) were obtained from published sources. Base-case results were tested in sensitivity and variability analyses. Results: Average discounted results showed that individuals using tenofovir/emtricitabine were predicted to remain on first-line therapy for 7.7 years, accrue lifetime costs of $747,327, and experience 15.75 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), compared with 6.0 years, $777,090, and 15.68 QALYs for individuals using abacavir/lamivudine and 5.8 years, $778,287, and 15.44 QALYs for individuals using zidovudine/lamivudine. Tenofovir/emtricitabine was cost-effective compared with the other two first-line regimens in more than 75% of all probabilistic sensitivity analysis simulation runs for every willingness-to-pay threshold between $0 and $250,000 per QALY gained. Results were robust in variability and one-way sensitivity analyses.

Previous cost-effectiveness analysis described favorable results considering long-term supervised exercise intervention and significant effectiveness of exercise therapy; however, these evidences are now no longer supported. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of supervised exercise therapy in HF patients under the perspective of the Brazilian Public Healthcare System. Methods: We developed a Markov model to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of supervised exercise therapy compared to standard treatment in patients with New York Heart Association HF class II and III. Effectiveness was evaluated in quality-adjusted life years in a 10-year time horizon. We searched PUBMED for published clinical trials to estimate effectiveness, mortality, hospitalization, and utilities data. Treatment costs were obtained from published cohort updated to 2008 values. Exercise therapy intervention costs were obtained from a rehabilitation center. Model robustness was assessed through Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity analysis. Cost were expressed as international dollars, applying the purchasing-power-parity conversion rate. Results: Exercise therapy showed small reduction in hospitalization and mortality at a low cost, an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of Int$26,462/quality-adjusted life year. Results were more sensitive to exercise therapy costs, standard treatment total costs, exercise therapy effectiveness, and medications costs. Considering a willingness-to-pay of Int$27,500, 55% of the trials fell below this value in the Monte Carlo simulation. Conclusions: In a Brazilian scenario, exercise therapy shows reasonable cost-effectiveness ratio, despite current evidence of limited benefit of this intervention.","[Polanczyk, Carisi A.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Hosp Clin Porto Alegre, Natl Inst Hlth Technol Assessment, Div Cardiol,Dept Med, BR-90035007 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Kuehr, Eduardo M.; Rohde, Luis Eduardo P.; Polanczyk, Carisi A.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Grad Program Cardiol, BR-90035007 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Ribeiro, Rodrigo A.; Polanczyk, Carisi A.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Grad Program Epidemiol, BR-90035007 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Polanczyk, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Hosp Clin Porto Alegre, Natl Inst Hlth Technol Assessment, Div Cardiol,Dept Med, Ramiro Barcelos 2350,Bldg 21,5th Floor, BR-90035007 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",cpolanczyk@hcpa.ufrgs.br,"Polanczyk, Carisi CAP/D-6208-2013; Rohde, Luis Eduardo/I-4216-2013; Ribeiro, Rodrigo Antonini/E-8352-2013","Ribeiro, Rodrigo Antonini/0000-0003-3080-3704; Polanczyk, Carisi/0000-0002-2447-2577","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico, Brazil; Brazilian Institute for Health Technology Assessment","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico, Brazil(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Brazilian Institute for Health Technology Assessment","Dr. Rohde and Dr. Polanczyk received research sponsorship from Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico, Brazil.

We address this gap by estimating a preference-based measure for cancer from the EORTC QLQ-C30. Methods: Factor analysis, Rasch analysis, and other psychometric analyses were undertaken on a clinical trial dataset of 655 patients with multiple myeloma to derive a health state classification system amenable to valuation. Second a valuation study was conducted of 350 members of the UK general population using time trade-off. Mean and individual-level multivariate regression models were fitted to derive preference weights for the classification system. Results: The health state classification system has eight dimensions (physical functioning, role functioning, social functioning, emotional functioning, pain, fatigue and sleep disturbance, nausea, constipation, and diarrhea) with four or five levels each. Regression models have few inconsistencies (0 to 2) in estimated preference weights and small mean absolute error ranges (0.046 to 0.054). Conclusions: It is feasible to derive a preference-based measure from the EORTC QLQ-C30 for use in economic evaluation. Future research will extend this to other countries and replicate across other patient groups.","[Rowen, Donna; Brazier, John; Young, Tracey] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Gaugris, Sabine] Janssen Cilag Ltd, High Wycombe, Bucks, England; [Craig, Benjamin M.] Univ S Florida, H Lee Moffitt Canc Ctr, Tampa, FL 33682 USA; [Craig, Benjamin M.] Univ S Florida, Dept Econ, Tampa, FL USA; [King, Madeleine T.] Univ Sydney, Sch Psychol, Psychooncol Cooperat Res Grp, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Velikova, Galina] Canc Res UK Clin Ctr, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; Johnson & Johnson; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; University of Sydney; Cancer Research UK; University of Leeds,"Rowen, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",d.rowen@sheffield.ac.uk,"brazier, john e/B-1936-2008; Young, Tracey A/A-4543-2010","Craig, Benjamin Matthew/0000-0003-1121-1316; Young, Tracey/0000-0001-8467-0471; Rowen, Donna/0000-0003-3018-5109; Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780",Janssen-Cilag Ltd.,Janssen-Cilag Ltd.,Source of financial support: The studies described in this article were funded by Janssen-Cilag Ltd.,,35,122,127,0,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2011,14.0,5,,,,,721,731,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.01.004,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BG,21839411.0,"Green Accepted, Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299081300014,0

Analogical reasoning suggests to combine past observations of x and y with the current values of x to generate an assessment of y by similarity-weighted averaging. Specifically, the predicted value of y, y(t)(s), is the weighted average of all previously observed values y(i), where the weight of y(i), for every i = 1, n is the similarity between the vector x(t)(1), ... , x(t)(d), associated with y(t), and the previously observed vector, x(i)(1), ... , x(i)(d). The empirical similarity approach suggests estimation of the similarity function from past data. We discuss this approach as a statistical method of prediction, study its relationship to the statistical literature, and extend it to the estimation of probabilities and of density functions.

J,"Strumpf, E",,,,"Strumpf, Erin",,,Medicaid's effect on single women's labor supply: Evidence from the introduction of Medicaid,JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Health insurance; In-kind transfers; Labor supply; Great Society programs,WELFARE PARTICIPATION; PROGRAM,"This paper examines the impact of the introduction of the Medicaid program on labor supply decisions among single women in the late 1960s and early 1970s. I use a differences-in-differences-in-differences methodology to estimate the effect of Medicaid on eligible women's labor force participation, using variation in the timing of Medicaid implementation across states and in eligibility across demographic groups. Using March supplements to the CPS from 1963 to 1975, I find no evidence that women who were eligible for Medicaid decreased their labor supply relative to ineligible women, in contrast to clear theoretical predictions of a negative supply response. Positive point estimates suggest that health benefits from health insurance coverage may have contributed to relative increases in labor supply.

If the strength of habits is below a critical level, positive bequests generate Ramsey-Stiglitz equilibria: the altruism factor determines long-run growth and habits increase output levels by increasing capital accumulation and smoothing resource extraction during the transition. If the strength of habits is above the threshold, zero bequests induce Diamond-Mourmouras equilibria: the transitional effects become permanent and habits increase long-run growth. Results differ from those of capital-labor models because resource dependence implies that long-run growth is determined by the intergenerational distribution of wealth. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Examples of such functionals include consumer surplus and weighted average derivatives. The estimation procedure is robust to a setting where the underlying model is not identified but the linear functional is. In order to attain such robustness, it is necessary to employ a partially identified nuisance parameter. We address this problem by consistently estimating a unique element of the identified set for nuisance parameters which we then use to construct a root n asymptotically normal estimator for the desired linear functional.

The shape constraints we consider include monotonicity, convexity and functions with a single minimum. A computationally efficient MCMC sampling algorithm is developed that converges faster than previous methods for non-Gaussian models. Simulation results indicate the monotonically constrained function estimates have good small sample properties relative to (i) unconstrained function estimates, and (ii) function estimates obtained from other constrained estimation methods when such methods exist. Also, asymptotic results show the methodology provides consistent estimates for a large class of smooth functions. Two detailed illustrations exemplify the ideas. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Data from the Current Population Survey identifies a worker's country of birth and the National Survey of Registered Nurses (NSRN) identifies nurses who received their basic training outside the US. In 2004 about 3.1% of the registered nurse (RN) workforce is foreign-born non-US citizens, and 3.3% received their basic education elsewhere. The principal countries of origin are the Philippines, Canada, India, and England. Regression results show a 4.5% lower wage for non-citizen nurses born outside of the US (Canadian nurses are an exception). The wage disadvantage is concentrated on foreign-born nurses new to the US; once a nurse has been in the US for 6 years there is no longer a significant penalty. Results from the NSRN show relatively little overall wage differences between RNs who received their basic training outside versus inside the US, but there is a significant wage disadvantage for those new to the US market. The presence of foreign-trained nurses appears to decrease earnings for native RNs, but the effects are small.

A similar, long run, cointegrating relationship between life expectancy and both total GDP and GDP per capita was found for all the countries estimated. The relationships have a significant influence on both total GDP and GPD per capita in most of the countries estimated, with 1% increase in life expectancy resulting in an average 6% increase in total GDP in the long run, and 5% increase in GDP per capita. Total GDP and GDP per capita also have a significant influence on life expectancy for most countries. There is no evidence of changes in the relationships for any country over the periods estimated, indicating that shifts in the major causes of illness and death over time do not appear to have influenced the link between health and economic growth.

The traditional PERT approach is usually used to estimate the mean and variance of the activity duration. The PERT uses the beta distribution that is a unimodal probability distribution defined on a closed interval. At real projects the three-point PERT estimate is often adapted to suit specific requirements and project needs. The peak of the beta distribution is possible to shift to the left or right and get a different mean estimate of the activity duration. The shift of the distribution peak depends on the human behaviour while working on the task. The paper proposes the modification of the three-point PERT estimate using parameterization of the weighted average. It proposes to shift the beta distribution peak, which is dependent on a human work effort and which is reachable by adjusting the PERT three-point estimate.

An approximate approach, which reformulates the p-median problem to a covering problem, seems to be an admissible way how to master the computational complexity. Nevertheless, the faster computational process is paid for by a loss of accuracy. This contribution deals with a sequential method of the dividing point deployment to obtain a tighter lower bound of the solved p-median problem and to provide a user of the approximate approach with an estimation of accuracy.","[Janacek, Jaroslav] Univ Zilina, Fac Management Sci & Informat, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,,ja-roslav.janacek@fri.uniza.sk,,,,,,,8,1,1,0,2,PROFESSIONAL PUBLISHING,PRAHA 4,"MIKULOVA 1572 13,, PRAHA 4, 149 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7431-058-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,317,320,,,,,,4,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BBZ07,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309074600053,0

Regarding the different age of hop gardens, the individual varieties were tested separately. The results showed that variety Saaz hops had the highest content of essential oil in the samples from the gardens found in 2007 in both tested years. Also, higher content of farnesene in essential oil was confirmed at this variety, as it is the feature which distinguishes Saaz hops from the other varieties. Variety Sladek had also the highest content of essential oil in the samples from hop gardens found in 2007 in both years. These samples had also the highest content of myrcene. Caryophyllene and humulene content was completely different at this variety. The content of the essential oil and its compounds at variety Premiant was different in the observed years.

In the field of medicine, professionalism should lead at least some practitioners in developing countries to effectively care for their patients despite the absence of extrinsic incentives to do so. In this study we examine the behavior of 80 practitioners from the Arusha region of Tanzania for evidence of professionalism. We show that about 20% of these practitioners behave professionally, and almost half of those who do so practice in the public sector. These professional health care workers provide high quality care even when they work in an environment that does not reward this effort, a finding that has important implications for the use of performance-based incentives.

Instead of the traditional approach which depends on Kakutani's fixed point theorem, we employ the theories of aggregative games and best reply potential games. We show that, if there exists a representative consumer, under some conditions on preferences and production technologies, the profit maximization game is a (pseudo) best reply potential game. Hence, the existence of the equilibria is proved independently of the well known convex-valued assumption on the best responses. Although our assumptions result in the additive separability on a utility function of a representative consumer, the existence of increasing returns and indivisible productions can be allowed. In our model, it is shown that the game played by firms exhibits strategic substitutes whether the products of firms are substitutes or complements, and this plays an important role for the existence of the equilibria.

In contrast to the existing procedures, we allow for a flexible specification, where a possible continuum of quantiles is simultaneously specified under fairly weak conditions on the serial dependence in the underlying data-generating process. Since the null limit distribution of tests is not pivotal, we propose a subsampling approximation of the asymptotic critical values. A Monte Carlo study shows that the asymptotic results provide good approximations for small sample sizes. Finally, an application suggests that our methodology is a powerful alternative to standard backtesting procedures in evaluating market risk. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we develop an extremely flexible modeling approach which can accommodate virtually any of these specifications. We build on earlier work showing the relationship between flexible functional forms and random variation in parameters. Our contribution is based around the use of priors on the time variation that is developed from considering a hypothetical reordering of the data and distance between neighboring (reordered) observations. The range of priors produced in this way can accommodate a wide variety of nonlinear time series models, including those with regime-switching and structural breaks. By allowing the amount of random variation in parameters to depend on the distance between (reordered) observations, the parameters can evolve in a wide variety of ways, allowing for everything from models exhibiting abrupt change (e.g. threshold autoregressive models or standard structural break models) to those which allow for a gradual evolution of parameters (e.g. smooth transition autoregressive models or time varying parameter models). Bayesian econometric methods for inference are developed for estimating the distance function and types of hypothetical reordering. Conditional on a hypothetical reordering and distance function, a simple reordering of the actual data allows us to estimate our models with standard state space methods by a simple adjustment to the measurement equation. We use artificial data to show the advantages of our approach, before providing two empirical illustrations involving the modeling of real GDP growth. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The test extends the non-linearity tests based on Kolmogorov-Gabor polynomials (Thursby and Schmidt, 1977; Tsay, 1986; Terasvirta et al., 1993), but circumvents problems of high dimensionality, is equivariant to collinearity, and includes exponential functions, so is a portmanteau test with power against a wide range of possible alternatives. A Monte Carlo analysis compares the performance of the test to the optimal infeasible test and to alternative tests. The relative performance of the test is encouraging: the test has the appropriate size and has high power in many situations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: General population mail survey in French-speaking Switzerland that included the EQ-5D instrument (five items rated on three levels as no problem, moderate problem, severe problem, and a visual analog health scale between 0 and 100) and descriptive variables. Results: Questionnaires were returned by 1956 adults (response rate 52.1%). Three of the five items had important ceiling effects (proportions with no problem: mobility 92.1%, self-care 97.6%, usual activities 91.2%), the other two less so (pain/discomfort 54.3%, anxiety/depression 68.1%). Four health states represented the majority of the population: no health problem (41.8%), moderate pain/discomfort only (21.0%), moderate anxiety/depression only (11.5%), moderate pain/discomfort and moderate anxiety/depression only (13.2%). The mean health utility was 0.83 (SD 0.15) on a scale between 0 and 1 and the mean visual analog score 81.7 (SD 15.5); the two were correlated (Pearson r 0.63, P < 0.001). Health utility scores were lower among women, older respondents, those with basic education, users of health services, and those with lower self-reported health status. The pattern was similar for the visual analog score except that women reported slightly higher ratings than men. Conclusion: The EQ-5D performed as expected in a French-speaking general population sample. Reference values by sex and age group may facilitate the interpretation of results obtained in clinical settings.","[Perneger, Thomas V.; Combescure, Christophe; Courvoisier, Delphine S.] Univ Hosp Geneva, Div Clin Epidemiol, CH-1211 Geneva 14, Switzerland",University of Geneva,"Perneger, TV (通讯作者)，Univ Hosp Geneva, Div Clin Epidemiol, 6 Rue Perret Gentil, CH-1211 Geneva 14, Switzerland.",thomas.perneger@hcuge.ch,"Courvoisier, Delphine Sophie/AGI-4432-2022; Combescure, Christophe/GLS-3380-2022","Courvoisier, Delphine Sophie/0000-0002-1956-2607;",University Hospitals of Geneva,University Hospitals of Geneva,"Research and development grant, University Hospitals of Geneva, and Mimosa grant, Department of Community Health and Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.",,25,94,98,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2010,13.0,5,,,,,631,635,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00727.x,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,635RQ,20412541.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000280674200016,0

The Tobit model and censored least absolute deviations (CLAD) have both been used as analytic solutions to this apparent truncation effect. These models assume that the observed utilities are censored at 1, and hence that the true utility can be greater than 1. We aimed to examine whether the Tobit and CLAD models yielded acceptable results when this censoring assumption was not appropriate. Methods: Using health utility (captured through EQ5D) data from a diabetes study, we conducted a simulation to compare the performance of the Tobit, CLAD, ordinary least squares (OLS), two-part and latent class estimators in terms of their bias and estimated confidence intervals. We also illustrate the performance of semiparametric and nonparametric bootstrap methods. Results: When the true utility was conceptually bounded above at 1, the Tobit and CLAD estimators were both biased. The OLS estimator was asymptotically unbiased and, while the model-based and semiparametric bootstrap confidence intervals were too narrow, confidence intervals based on the robust standard errors or the nonparametric bootstrap were acceptable for sample sizes of 100 and larger. Two-part and latent class models also yielded unbiased estimates. Conclusions: When the intention of the analysis is to inform an economic evaluation, and the utilities should be bounded above at 1, CLAD, and Tobit methods were biased. OLS coupled with robust standard errors or the nonparametric bootstrap is recommended as a simple and valid approach.","[Pullenayegum, Eleanor M.] St Josephs Healthcare Hamilton, Biostat Unit, Hamilton, ON L8N 4A6, Canada; [Pullenayegum, Eleanor M.; Tarride, Jean-Eric; Xie, Feng; Goeree, Ron; Gerstein, Hertzel C.; O'Reilly, Daria] McMaster Univ, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Tarride, Jean-Eric; Xie, Feng; Goeree, Ron; O'Reilly, Daria] St Josephs Healthcare Hamilton, Programs Assessment Technol Hlth, Hamilton, ON L8N 4A6, Canada",McMaster University; McMaster University; McMaster University,"Pullenayegum, EM (通讯作者)，St Josephs Healthcare Hamilton, Biostat Unit, 50 Charlton Ave E, Hamilton, ON L8N 4A6, Canada.",pullena@mcmaster.ca,"Pullenayegum, Eleanor/AAT-1712-2020; Gerstein, Hertzel C/B-1235-2013; Gerstein, Hertzel/ABB-8781-2020; Pullenayegum, Eleanor/A-1215-2013","Pullenayegum, Eleanor/0000-0003-4265-1330; Gerstein, Hertzel/0000-0001-8072-2836;","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (Toronto, ON, Cnada); Drug Innovation Fund","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (Toronto, ON, Cnada); Drug Innovation Fund","EMP was supported by a Discovery Grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

The objective is to quantify the impact of nine potential causes of variation in cost-effectiveness of pharmacological smoking cessation therapies (SCTs) between The Netherlands (reference case), Germany, Sweden, UK, Belgium, and France. Methods: The life-time benefits of smoking cessation were calculated using the Benefits of Smoking Cessation on Outcomes model, following a cohort of smokers making an unaided quit attempt, or using nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, or varenicline. We investigated the impact of between-country differences in nine factors-demography, smoking prevalence, mortality, epidemiology and costs of smoking-related diseases, resource use and unit costs of SCTs, utility weights and discount rates-on the incremental net monetary benefit (INMB), using a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of 20,000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY). Results: The INMB of 1000 quit attempts with NRT versus unaided, varies from 0.39 million (Germany) to 1.47 million (France). The differences between the countries were primarily due to differences in discount rates, causing the INMB to change between -65% to +62%, incidence and mortality rates (epidemiology) of smoking-related diseases (-43% to +35%) and utility weights. Impact also depended on the WTP for a QALY and time horizon: at a low WTP or a short time horizon, the resource use and unit costs of SCTs had the highest impact on INMB. Conclusions: Although all INMBs were positive, there were significant differences across countries. These were primarily related to choice of discount rate and epidemiology of diseases.","[Vemer, Pepijn; Rutten-van Moelken, Maureen P. M.

A direct approach is to estimate all the parameters including the fixed effects. Because of the incidental parameter problem, some parameter estimators may be inconsistent or their distributions are not properly centered. We propose an alternative estimation method based on transformation which yields consistent estimators with properly centered distributions. For the model with individual effects only, the direct approach does not yield a consistent estimator of the variance parameter unless T is large, but the estimators for other common parameters are the same as those of the transformation approach. We also consider the estimation of the model with both individual and time effects. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This irreversibility raises the value of treatment modalities that preserve future treatment options. Surprisingly, partial reversibility with or without learning can either increase or decrease this value, depending on the distribution of patient types within the treated population.

They have often been proposed as a more cost effective alternative to other modal shift and congestion relief initiatives, such as public transport or highway improvement schemes; however, with little implementation in practice, practitioners have only limited evidence for assessing their likely impacts. This study reports the findings of a Stated Preference (SP) study aimed at understanding the value that car drivers put on car sharing as opposed to single occupancy trips. Following an initial pilot period, 673 responses were received from a web-based survey conducted in June 2008 amongst a representative sample of car driving commuters in Scotland. An important methodological aspect of this study was the need to account for differences in behaviour to identify those market segments with the greatest propensity to car share. To this end, we estimated a range of choice model forms and compared the ability of each to consistently identify individual behaviours. More specifically, this included a comparison of: Standard market segmentation approaches based on multinomial logit with attribute coefficients estimated by reported characteristics (e.g. age, income, etc.); A two-stage mixed logit approach involving the estimation of random parameters logit models followed by an examination of individual respondent's choices to arrive at estimates of their parameters, conditional on know distributions across the population (following Revelt & Train, 1999); and A latent-class model involving the specification of C classes of respondent, each with their own coefficients, and assigning each individual a probability that they belongs to a given class based upon their observed choices, socioeconomic characteristics and their reported attitudes. As hypothesised, there are significant variations in tastes and preferences across market segments, particularly for household car ownership, gender, age group, interest in car pooling, current journey time and sharing with a stranger ( as opposed to family member/friend). Comparing the sensitivity of demand to a change from a single occupancy to a car-sharing trip, it can be seen that the latter imposes a 'penalty' equivalent to 29.85 IVT minutes using the mixed logit structure and 26.68 IVT minutes for the multinomial specification. Segmenting this latter value according to the number of cars owner per household results in 'penalties' equivalent to 46.51 and 26.42 IVT minutes for one and two plus car owning households respectively.","[Crockett, Jon; Sinclair, Caroline Louise] MVA Consultancy, London, England; [Whelan, Gerard Andrew] MVA Consultancy, Transport Planning & Social Market Res Act, London, England",,"Crockett, J (通讯作者)，MVA Consultancy, London, England.",,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84950-772-1,,,,2010,,,,,,,421,443,,,,,,23,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Psychology, Mathematical; Transportation",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Psychology; Transportation,BE0JU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366173200020,0

CO2eq production of feed was 3460 t of nitrogen emissions caused by undigested feed - faeces urine was 3227.9 tons CO2eq and methane was 52 t CO2eq. The extra traffic - piglet heating, hot water, fuel, light, eliminates the manure was 102.47 tons CO2ekv. From this it is clear that the reduction CO2eq is the only way to reduce emissions from feces and urine. To practice means to feed this perception that we should pay more attention to the digestibility of the diet to reduce emissions from manure. Increasing the digestibility of 10% would reduce emissions by 553.4 tons of emissions CO2eq feces and urine. Ancillary activities such sites does not share in the production of carbon footprint and a reduction of 10% or 20 will bring the overall perspective of any substantial change. Production of a pig weighing 105 kg and 173 days of fattening period led to the formation of 66 kg of CO2 equivalent.","[Krobot, R.; Zeman, L.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Nutr & Forage Prod, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Krobot, R (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Nutr & Forage Prod, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",ric.krobot@centrum.cz,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,3,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-453-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,278,286,,,,,,9,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341786800036,0

The analysis was focused on the evaluation of average fermentation indicators, chemical structure, TMR nutrition value and macro - and microelement concentration. The results of the analysis were compared with the recommended values and the potential effect of the assessed TMR on the lameness occurrence by dairy cows was determined. A total starch excess (226.4 g and 257.8 g in 1 kg dry mass) was detected due to the TMR analysis. This excess can be a cause of a higher volatile fatty acids production, which can evocate acidosis of rumen contents, followed by laminitis. By one of the analysed enterprises a high acidity of TMR water extract (1210 mg KOH/100 g) was detected. Marked differences in macro - and microelement supply of TMR in comparison with daily need were recorded as well. These deficits or excesses in mineral nutrition could be likewise an influential factor for the lameness occurrence in a herd.","[Paroulek, J.; Doleial, P.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Nutr & Forage Prod, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Paroulek, J (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Nutr & Forage Prod, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",paroulek.j@seznam.cz,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,4,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-453-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,292,296,,,,,,5,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341786800038,0

Methods: A common approach to defining probability distributions for model inputs in PSA on the basis of input-related data is to use the likelihood of the data on an appropriate scale as the foundation for the distribution around the inputs. We will look at this approach from a Bayesian perspective, derive the implicit prior distributions in two examples (proportions and relative risks), and compare these to alternative prior distributions. Results: In cases where data are sparse (in which case sensitivity analysis is crucial), commonly used approaches can lead to unexpected results. Weshow that this is because of the prior distributions that are implicitly assumed, namely that these are not as uninformative or vague as believed. We propose priors that we believe are more sensible for two examples and which are just as easy to apply. Conclusions: Input probability distributions should not be based on the likelihood of the data, but on the Bayesian posterior distribution calculated from this likelihood and an explicitly stated prior distribution.","[Boshuizen, Hendriek C.] RIVM, Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm, Dept Stat & Math Modelling, NL-3720 AA Bilthoven, Netherlands",Netherlands National Institute for Public Health & the Environment,"Boshuizen, HC (通讯作者)，RIVM, Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm, Dept Stat & Math Modelling, POB 1, NL-3720 AA Bilthoven, Netherlands.",Hendriek.Boshuizen@rivm.nl,"Boshuizen, Hendriek C/B-3718-2014; Boshuizen, Hendriek/M-3415-2014; van Baal, Pieter HM/A-9165-2010","Boshuizen, Hendriek/0000-0002-3916-9095; van Baal, Pieter/0000-0001-9913-2393",,,,,19,18,18,1,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,NOV-DEC,2009,12.0,8,,,,,1210,1214,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00590.x,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,515TH,19695002.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271495300024,0

Methods: Study design is a cost-effectiveness analysis in decision analytic modeling based on previously published evidence. Outcome measures included costs and quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Results and Conclusion: In the base-case analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of oseltamivir during influenza and complications was JPY398,571 ($3320) per QALY without productivity loss, which implied oseltamivir is evidently cost-effective. Furthermore, considering the productivity loss, the ICER for oseltamivir turned to be negative, which means simply dominant. When the prevalence was in the low range of 10% to 38%, oseltamivir became less cost-effective than conventional treatment. Regarding potential emergence of the drug-resistant virus, we found the dominance of oseltamivir will vanish if the emerging rate becomes larger than 27%. The two-way sensitivity analysis also suggested that if the resistant virus rate becomes less and the prevalence higher, then oseltamivir becomes more advantageous. The analysis for uncertainty, using cost-effectiveness acceptability curve by Monte Carlo simulation, resulted in the estimate of about 80% chance that oseltamivir Could be cost-effective at the willingness-to-pay level of JPY6,000,000 ($50,000), which is commonly accepted as an affordable threshold.","[Nagase, Hiroko] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Med, Div Med Stat, Chuo Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6500017, Japan; [Kamae, Maki] Tufts Med Ctr, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, Boston, MA USA; [Yanagisawa, Shinichiro] Himeji Dokkyo Univ, Sch Pharm, Div Med Econ, Himeji, Hyogo, Japan; [Kamae, Isao] Keio Univ, Grad Sch Hlth Management, Keio, Japan",Kobe University; Tufts Medical Center; Himeji Dokkyo University; Keio University,"Nagase, H (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Med, Div Med Stat, Chuo Ku, 7-5-1 Kusunoki Cho, Kobe, Hyogo 6500017, Japan.",nagase@med.kobe-u.ac.jp,"Nagase, Hiroaki/AFC-5940-2022",,,,,,28,11,12,0,8,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,NOV-DEC,2009,12.0,,,,,,S62,S65,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00629.x,0.0,,,4,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,524KG,20586984.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000272141600012,0

Ordinal measurement strategies such as DCE may have considerable practical advantages over more conventional cardinal measurement techniques, e.g. time trade-off (TTO), because they may not require such a high degree of abstract reasoning. However, there are a number of challenges to deriving the cardinal values for health states using ordinal data, including anchoring the values on the full health-dead scale used to calculate QALYs. This paper reports on a study that deals with these problems in the context of using two ordinal techniques, DCE and ranking, to derive the cardinal values for health states derived from a condition-specific sexual health measure. The results were compared with values generated using a commonly used cardinal valuation technique, the TTO. This Study raises some important issues about the use of ordinal data to produce cardinal health state valuations.

These shadow-prices can be used by the Central Bank to set personalized intraday monetary policies in order to reduce idleness of money and to give a microfoundation of the too-big-to-fail policy.

In this paper we consider a subsampling confidence interval (CI) that is based on an estimator that can be viewed either as a post-model selection estimator that employs a consistent model selection procedure or as a super-efficient estimator. We show that the subsampling CI (of nominal level 1 - alpha for any alpha is an element of (0, 1)) has asymptotic confidence size (defined to be the limit of finite-sample size) equal to zero in a very simple regular model. The same result holds for the m out of n bootstrap provided m(2)/n -> 0 and the observations are i.i.d. Similar zero-asymptotic-confidence-size results hold in more complicated models that are covered by the general results given in the paper and for super-efficient and shrinkage estimators that are not post-model selection estimators. Based on these results, subsampling and the m out of n bootstrap are not recommended for obtaining inference based on post-consistent model selection or shrinkage estimators.

Using data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, a representative sample of the Medicare population, we estimate the annual probability that a healthy 65-year-old will transition to a drug-intensive health state or death. We then use Monte Carlo simulations to estimate expected lifetime prescription drug spending with and without drug insurance. We find that for the statutory minimum benefit policy with a $30 per month premium, lifetime expected expenditures are about 10% higher for women and 6.5% higher for men if healthy beneficiaries postpone enrollment in Part D. Eliminating the late enrollment penalty Would create a significant cost advantage for postponed enrollment, particularly for men. Under Current rules, the financial advantage of early enrollment coupled with the reduction in risk associated with purchasing Part D plans and potential utility gains from insurance-induced drug consumption, suggests that immediate purchase of Part D is the optimal choice for Medicare beneficiaries.

Orthopedic surgeons were high-volume joint replacement specialists or who performed >= 50 joint replacements per year. Preference measures were elicited using trade-offs between impaired health versus full health with shortened life, and between two temporary health states. Patient preference scores were in some cases higher than surgeon preference scores. The difference was most pronounced for the health state constant severe pain. Outpatients revealed much higher preferences for staying in short-term major medical complication as compared with surgeons.

Variation in the treatment of UTIs between practices is high. To assess the cost-effectiveness of a maximum care model for UTIs in children, implying more testing and antibiotic treatment, compared with current practice in primary care in The Netherlands. We performed a probabilistic modeling study using Markov models. Figures used in the model were derived from a systematic review of the research literature. Multidimensional Monte Carlo simulation was used for the probabilistic analyses. Maximum care gained 0.00102 (males) and 0.00219 (girls) QALYs (quality-adjusted life-years) and saved 42.70 (boys) and 77.81 (girls) in 30 years compared with current care, and was thus dominant. Net monetary benefit of maximum care ranged from 20 to 200 for a willingness to pay for a QALY ranging from 0 to 80,000, respectively. Maximum care was also dominant over improved current care, although less dominant than to current care. This study suggested that maximum care for childhood UTI was dominant in the long run to current care, meaning that it delivered more quality of life at lower costs. Nevertheless, making firm conclusions is not possible, given the limitations of the input data.","[Harmsen, Mirjam; Wolters, Rene J.; Grol, Richard P. T.
