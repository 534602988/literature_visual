Study results indicate that all symmetric models outperform the asymmetric ones, both for normal and Student's t distributions. We also find that GARCH(1,1) underestimates 1% VaR in comparison to RiskMetrics and GARCH-t(1,1) that perform very well. Moreover, GARCH-t(1,1) gives better 2.5% VaR estimates and RiskMetrics outperforms GARCH(1,1) and GARCH-t(1,1) for 5% VaR estimates.","[Predescu, Oana Madalina; Stancu, Stelian] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Dept Econ Cybernet, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Predescu, OM (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Dept Econ Cybernet, Bucharest, Romania.",predescu_oana85@yahoo.com; stelian_stancu@yahoo.com,"STANCU, Stelian/HRB-5488-2023; Popescu, Oana Madalina/F-4437-2015","Stancu, Stelian/0000-0002-4727-993X",,,,,14,4,4,2,20,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

The author proposes a study in this work regarding the patterning process of the market structures with imperfect competition by using the games theory. This particular theory suggests solutions for actions taking place among rational individuals by using adequate mathematical patterns with possible applicability in the economic field. In perfectly competitive markets, buyers and sellers are sufficiently large in number to ensure that no single one of them, alone, has the power to determine market price. Equilibrium in a competitive market thus requires the simultaneous compatibility of disparate and often conflicting self-interested plans of a large number of different agents. Perfect competitive occupies one polar extreme on a spectrum of possible market structures from the more on the less competitive. Many markets display a blend of monopoly and competition simultaneously. Firms become more interdependent the smaller the number of firms in the industry, the easier entry, and the closer the substitute goods available to consumers. When firms perceive their interdependence, they have an incentive to take account of their rivals' actions and formulate their own plans strategically. When firms are behaving strategically, one of the first things we need to do is ask ourselves how we should characterize equilibrium in situations like this. On the face of it, one might be tempted to reason as follows: Because firms are aware of their interdependence, and because the actions of one firm may reduce the profits of others. Putting the legality of such collusion aside, there is something tempting in the idea of a collusive equilibrium such as this. From this reason the analysis instrument of games theory making up the new syntax of the market efficiency. The final conclusions of this paper refer to optimal strategies chosen by players, strategies with applicability in patterning different market structures and the equilibrium","[Sirghi, Nicoleta] W Univ Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania",West University of Timisoara,,nicoleta..sirghi@yahoo.com,"SIRGHI, Nicoleta/E-5730-2019",,,,,,5,0,0,0,7,"ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA UNIV IASI, FACULTY ECONOMICS & BUSINESS ADMINSTRATION",IASI,"22 CAROL 1ST BLVD, IASI, 700505, ROMANIA",,,978-973-640-658-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,51.0,55,,,,,,5,Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BZM22,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000302002900008,0

Credit institutions, mainly determined by Basel Committee's papers and national regulations, that imbedded those requirements in the local regulations, were considered more advanced in risk management domain being known all the efforts - financial and human - allocated to this area. But all the risk models, risk systems and forecasting scenarios proved to be insufficient and sometimes inadequate for the complexity and changing nature of risks. All the analysis on financial crisis roots pointed out that inadequate risk management is one of the most important weaknesses in financial institutions. The last 18 months brought enormous difficulty and uncertainty as a result of the global crisis in the Romanian economy and banking industry. The financial crisis has forced banks to take a critical look at how they manage risk. The crisis has highlighted an urgent need for improved banks' risk management process. This risk management process improvement reaches all the risk management components. The paper wishes to emphasize the need of a new approach in risk management process: a holistic approach, being known that risks action is interrelated and their consequences must be evaluated in their convergence and the need to better manage operational risk which, is in the authors' opinion, one weak link in Romanian banks' risk management systems.","[Stanciu, Victoria; Ali, Eden; Ivancenco, Veronica Constanta] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,stanciuvictoria58@hotmail.com; vivancenco@yahoo.de,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,6,"ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA UNIV IASI, FACULTY ECONOMICS & BUSINESS ADMINSTRATION",IASI,"22 CAROL 1ST BLVD, IASI, 700505, ROMANIA",,,978-973-640-658-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,355.0,359,,,,,,5,Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BZM22,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000302002900057,0

Efforts to foster new partnerships between healthcare providers and industry have been framed with suggestions that clinical trials can offer 'patient benefit' within the NHS, cutting across ethical and sociological concerns with the possible tension between doing research and offering care. This paper draws on ethnographic research to explore the sometimes awkward juxtapositions between trial protocols and everyday care, individual health and commercial profit, and thus the distribution of value produced through trials. While researchers appear to find the distinction between research and care useful, at least some of the time, both formal and informal strategies for living with this distinction may have the unintended consequence of making research appear supplementary to rather than simply different from clinical care.","[Will, Catherine M.] Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Will, CM (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England.",c.will@sussex.ac.uk,,"Will, Catherine/0000-0001-7224-714X","ESRC [R42200134004]; ESRC/MRC [PTA-037-27-0093-A]; Economic and Social Research Council [PTA-037-27-0093-A, PTA-037-27-0093] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC/MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"I am grateful for all those NHS researchers who have allowed me to observe clinical trials, and have been so patient in answering my questions.

Since the mid-1970s there has been renewed interest in, and reinterpretation of Smith's work. This paper looks at two aspects of this reinterpretation, the first of which is Smith's writing on wages. Smith was an advocate of high wages, a view that strongly contrasted with the received wisdom of the day He considered that a wage which provided for a reasonable standard of living was essential for the development of an economy. The second aspect encompasses Smith's notion of the subsistence wage which traces its historic lineage to the Greek philosophers. The paper concludes that Smith, the champion of 'liberty' and non-government interference in markets, would probably have supported the notion of minimum wages, such as are now mandated in the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia. Nevertheless, the mandating of minimum wages is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the achievement of living wage outcomes.","[Plowman, David H.; Perryer, Chris] Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Plowman, DH (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia.",david.plow-man@uwa.edu.au; chris.perryer@uwa.edu.au,,,,,,,42,4,4,0,11,UNIV NEW SOUTH WALES-CENTRE APPLIED ECONOMIC RESEARCH,SYDNEY,"ECONOMIC & LABOUR RELATIONS REVIEW, INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS RES CTR, SYDNEY, NSW 2052, AUSTRALIA",1035-3046,,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

I demonstrate that up until recently views on foreign trade were highly correlated with the national unemployment rate. Views on free trade are also strongly related to opinions of how the economy is doing. I further assess predictors of opinions on outsourcing and immigration, as they relate to the causes of job losses. Education, occupation, work experience, and political party are important predictors of views on the economy, free trade, and job losses.

Co-evolutionary processes between the anthroposphere and the biosphere offer an alternative to sustainability and hence the timescales could be examined by a simple systems analysis. We consider a system of anthropospheric food energy demand and entropy production to evaluate the timescales of sustainability at past technological revolutions in the anthroposphere. Our analysis suggests that each of technological revolutionary steps, the Neolithic/Agricultural, Industrial, and Information Revolutions, has forced the sustainability timescale to decrease by an order of 2. However, we suggest that the minimum timescale of the most recent sustainability is 100-400 years, which is longer than that implied by other sustainability indices (similar to 100 years). The recently emerged concept of 'futurability', an ideal form of sustainability, could help seek futurable states of human-environment interactions beyond the next few hundred years.

A number of questions have arisen about the feasibility and desirability of continuing to rely on defined benefit pensions for teachers. This article provides a brief history of teacher pensions and an overview of teacher retirement benefits today, including differences in the legal and economic context for public and private sector pensions that are important considerations in plan design. It then introduces issues related to financial sustainability, teacher mobility, and teacher shortages. The article concludes with an overview of key differences between traditional defined benefit and defined contribution plans and raises the possibility of adopting a hybrid kind of plan that includes features from both kinds of traditional plans.","Comm Econ Dev, Washington, DC 20036 USA",,"Hansen, JS (通讯作者)，Comm Econ Dev, 2000 L St NW,Suite 700, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",janet.hansen@ced.org,,,,,,,38,17,19,0,8,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",1557-3060,,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

The analysis of the geographic distribution of physicians is based on the ratio of general practitioners (GPs) and specialists to 1,000 inhabitants. The inequality is measured using Gini indices, coefficients of variation, and physician-to-population ratios. The econometric models were estimated by ordinary least squares. The data used refer to 1996 and 2007. The impact of the growing number of physicians, and therefore potential increased competition, on geographic distribution during the period studied was small. Nonetheless, there is evidence of competitive forces acting on the dynamics of doctor localisation. Geographic disparities in physician density are still high, and appear to be due mainly to geographic income inequality.","[Paula, Veiga] Univ Minho, Escola Econ & Gesta, Appl Microecon Res Grp NIMA, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Paula, Veiga] Univ Minho, Appl Microecon Res Unit NIMA, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Isabel, Correia] Univ Minho, European Int & Ind Econ Res Unit NEEII, Dept Econ, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal",Universidade do Minho; Universidade do Minho; Universidade do Minho,"Paula, V (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, Escola Econ & Gesta, Appl Microecon Res Grp NIMA, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.",icorreia@eeg.uminho.pt; paulav@eeg.uminho.pt,"Veiga, Paula/AAC-9820-2020","Veiga, Paula/0000-0001-5110-7906; Correia, Isabel M./0000-0002-6735-3148",,,,,37,55,58,1,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The study examined demographic and clinical variables, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and health care resources. Clinical data was obtained from medical records and patient interviews. Several empirical models for identifying the relationship between health care costs and independent variables were developed. The greatest expense came from pharmaceutical expenditure (82.1% of direct costs), while hospital costs only represented 4.6% of total expenditure. The data showed a statistically significant association between health care costs and the CD4 count of the previous year. HRQOL was also a significant variable. Therefore, CD4 cell count can be used to predict health care costs in patients. Policymakers could use this information to help guide their decisions in allocating limited health care resources to HIV treatments.","[Oliva-Moreno, Juan] UCLM, Dept Econ Anal & Finances, Toledo, Spain; [Oliva-Moreno, Juan] CIBERESP CIBER Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Toledo, Spain; [Lopez-Bastida, Julio; Serrano-Aguilar, Pedro; Perestelo-Perez, Lilisbeth] Canary Isl Hlth Serv SCS, Evaluat & Planning Serv, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain; [Lopez-Bastida, Julio; Serrano-Aguilar, Pedro; Perestelo-Perez, Lilisbeth] CIBERESP CIBER Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain; [Lopez-Bastida, Julio] Univ Hosp Nuestra Senora Candelaria, Canary Isl Hlth Serv, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERESP; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERESP,"Oliva-Moreno, J (通讯作者)，Fac Ciencias Jurid & Sociales Toledo, Anal Econ & Finanzas Cobertizo San Pedro S-N, Toledo, Spain.",Juan.OlivaMoreno@uclm.es; lperperr@gobiernodecanarias.org,"Oliva, Juan/JOZ-4028-2023; Perestelo-Perez, Lilisbeth/C-6439-2011; Oliva, Juan/A-1299-2011","Oliva, Juan/0000-0002-8997-0307; Perestelo-Perez, Lilisbeth/0000-0002-6113-7313",,,,,50,6,9,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

While the ancient Greeks did not have a concept of labour as a measure of value, in Scholastic authors the notion was fixed that labour and cost of production determine value. Labour assumed a central role in Adam Smith, but it was with David Ricardo that a fully blown labour theory of value was achieved. Marx gave the concept its philosophical dimension, tying it to a critique of classical political economy. The labour theory of value came under attack in neoclassical formulations which in the end effected the analytical disappearance of labour in several ways. Labour became just another factor of production, with marginal productivity regulating its price. Then factors of production and final goods became analytically equivalent as sources of subjective utility, especially in the context of general equilibrium theory. In disutility models of labour supply, labour was substituted by its absence, 'leisure'. Finally, attempts were made to explain the employment relationship as an application of agency theory moving away from the pure commodity model of labour. Nevertheless, all these theories failed to account for what became the Achilles' heel of neoclassicism namely the indeterminacy of the labour contract.","[Theocarakis, Nicholas J.] Univ Athens, Fac Econ Sci, Dept Polit Econ, GR-10679 Athens, Greece; [Theocarakis, Nicholas J.] Univ Athens, Grad Fac, Econ Dept, GR-10679 Athens, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,"Theocarakis, NJ (通讯作者)，Univ Athens, Fac Econ Sci, Dept Polit Econ, GR-10679 Athens, Greece.",ntheocar@econ.uoa.gr,,,,,,,174,4,4,0,22,UNIV NEW SOUTH WALES-CENTRE APPLIED ECONOMIC RESEARCH,SYDNEY,"ECONOMIC & LABOUR RELATIONS REVIEW, INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS RES CTR, SYDNEY, NSW 2052, AUSTRALIA",1035-3046,,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

The higher education sector has been through extensive change over a relatively short period of time and this is likely to continue in the future. This paper presents the results of a futures study focussed on the Higher Education sector in the UK in 10 and 25 years time. Following an extensive, broad ranging literature review covering business, education, futures, and socio-political texts and studies, a series of scenarios were developed for the future of the sector as a whole. This study differs from other studies in its field as it is does not focus on individual institutions, but rather at the environmental factors that are going to impact on the sector, setting out a range of scenarios within which institutions will need to shape their individual futures. Five scenarios are presented in this paper with their underlying driving factors, and their implications for the academic workforce being employed in the sector.

We develop a kernel density difference-in-difference approach to isolate how tax limits and/or education finance reform affect the full distribution of education expenditures. Simulations of the difference in distributional differences across school finance regimes over time suggest that parametric approaches offer an incomplete description of the distributional impacts of policy changes. Using data for the population of U. S. school districts in 1972, 1982, and 1992, we find that educational reforms and tax limits yield greater equality of expenditures by reducing the number of districts in the tails of the distribution, particularly when both are adopted during the same decade. Our results also suggest that the incompleteness of the parametric descriptions used in prior work can suggest greater variation in the distributional consequences of reform than is actually present.","[Singell, Larry D., Jr.] Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [McMillen, Daniel P.] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [McMillen, Daniel P.] Univ Illinois, Inst Govt & Publ Affairs, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Oregon; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Singell, LD (通讯作者)，Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",mcmillen@illinois.edu; lsingell@uoregon.edu,,,,,,,27,2,3,0,7,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

The Ken Wilber inspired integral futures, developed by Richard Slaughter and others, and put forth as the most comprehensive approach to-date, is critiqued and assessed. While Wilber's integral and the variant it has inspired in futures represent significant innovations, it also contains the tendency to un-necessarily close down, lock out or to sub-ordinate alternative conceptions of holism, what I term 'Wilber-ism'. Wilber's 'theory of everything' and integral futures are analysed, re-assessed and resituated in the context of the alternative approaches to holism that exist. What emerges is a rich view of potential genealogies and ontogenies as movements toward holism. One variant from the action research tradition, which I call 'integrative foresight', is put forward as all example of an alternative. The article concludes by proposing a process of dynamic dialogue between diverse conceptions of holism, which call at once honour the great diversity of approaches, while likewise continuing the journey of creating shared meaning and common understandings of the complex contexts in which futures inquiry works.

Fujian is the most heavily forested province in China and experiences an unprecedented property rights reform and changes in investment in forestry by rights holders. This paper focuses on the net present value (NPV) and the internal rate of return (IRR) for projected financial performance of plantation management for five species in Fujian. Based on our data, Chinese fir offers the lowest internal rate of return on capital, but still a respectable NPV. Despite the long rotation (31 years) masson pine returns are very high according to the NPV, because there are returns from thinnings and rosin for more than half the rotation period. Eucalyptus and bamboo offer the lowest NPVs, with high IRRs and short rotations they are well suited to planting by smallholders. and this has occurred widely. Some ecological and environmental issues are discussed according to calculation results of NPV and IRR in Fujian. Further. this should popularize the loblolly pine planting, so that species could play an increasing role. Based on the above studies, projected economic benefit to rights holders have been a powerful driver for private investment in forestry development. Property rights reforms, private investment, and demand growth have successfully fostered considerable investment in forest management in Fujian. In 2007 foreign investors initiated planting operations there. We believe management should pay more attention to forest layout and ecological issues. This would enhance forest sustainable development as well as promote further economic development, social progress and environmental protection. Fujian is one of China's key forest regions. In recent years, forest resources have been developed rapidly, with significant local benefits to employment and economic activities. To suggest ways to better promote forest development and improve management, this paper studies the projected economic performance of five of the most prominent species being planted.

The use of these specific data is important because of available information on the final educational attainment of survey respondents and both parents, as well as family size and birth order. OLS estimates reveal that: (I) relying exclusively on maternal schooling to capture the effects of parental education results in coefficient estimates that are biased upwards: (2) children born to parents with some post-secondary schooling are more likely to attain similar education levels than children born to parents with lower educational accomplishment; (3) in most specifications coefficient estimates of paternal schooling are greater in magnitude than maternal accomplishment; and finally, (4) coefficient estimates of the number of siblings are consistently negative and significant even after the inclusion of birth order effects, implying that a larger family is correlated with a reduced likelihood of post-secondary education.

The results of this study suggest that there is considerable public support for policies aimed at reducing damage to the benthic ecosystem, limiting fishing pressure during the plaice spawning period, and restoring spawning stock biomass of plaice and sole.

Despite the wide use of such models in the policy analyses, the impact of the overall uncertainty on the results and the distribution of the resulting variable values have not been considered. it would be important for the users of the results to know the robustness of the model outputs and conclusions made to variations in model inputs. This study attempts to systematically account for the uncertainties in forest sector model analysis. Monte Carlo simulation is applied to a spatial partial equilibrium model for the Finnish forest sector in order to examine how the uncertainty over the parametric data and output price developments affects the model projections. The focus is on the sawlog market and sawnwood production. As a policy example, the impacts of forest conservation set-asides are examined in the presence of these uncertainties. The uncertainty in the basic parametric data seems to have rather moderate impact on the results. Instead, the unpredictability of the world market prices for the forest industry products is an important source of variation among the model projections. Hence, any single model projection should be perceived to be strongly conditional to the assumptions made concerning the developments of world markets. The model projections for the relative impacts of forest conservation seem to be rather robust despite the uncertainties. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Four policy options are considered: 1) Baseline Scenario - Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPA) between the EU and six countries, 2) Option 1 - expanded VPAs increased to include 12 countries covering most of the sources of illegally traded wood, 3) Option 3 - border control actions stopping illegal imports from all non-EU countries entering into the EU, 4) Option 4 - all illegal wood coming both from the EU and non-EU countries is eliminated. The Baseline scenario with six VPA partners has the strongest impacts with respect to reduced harvests, increased wood prices and reduced industrial production in the baseline VPA countries, whereas harvests, production and forest sector value added increases in non-VPA countries with a high or moderate risk for illegal logging and in low risk regions like the EU and USA. However, these positive changes are marginal. Under Option 1 all 12 potential VPA countries are expected to suffer from a lowering of harvests and production. The EU, USA and other low and high/moderate risk countries increase their harvests, production and value added. These positive changes are substantially more significant. since the suggested 12 VPA countries cover most of the trade of illegal wood. Under Option 3 & 4 the impacts are rather marginal, since these options do not foresee elimination of illegal logging for high-risk countries under VPA arrangements. These options mostly affect trade with the EU in the short to medium term. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that a stationary positive relationship between the total energy consumption and gross domestic product (GDP) exists, and the main reason of the rising energy consumption is the continuous growing of GDP. The decomposition of H-P filtration was conducted on the energy consumption and GDP separately based on above analysis. The characteristic of common trends and volatilities between the energy consumption and economic growth was then obtained. From the view of trend components, a long-term equilibrium relation between the two sides was clearly proved, which explains that the growth of China's energy consumption is inevitable in a considerable period. However, it was found that in. a long-term, the growth of GDP doesn't necessarily depend on the large inputs of energy. The economy cycle will profoundly affect the energy cycle components, and the both sides will be linked more closely in the future. Therefore, the transitions of economy development model need to be accelerated and the measures of energy-saving and cost-reducing need to be developed.","[Wei Hua; He Yaqun; Wu Shan] China Univ Min & Technol, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",China University of Mining & Technology,,yqhe@263.net,"liu, xiao/JLL-2119-2023",,,,,,12,1,1,0,0,UNIVERSE ACADEMIC PRESS TORONTO,TORONTO,"1 SPADINA CRESCENT, ROOM 205, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 3G3, CANADA",,,978-1-926642-05-5,,,,2010,,,,,,,186.0,191,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BUE43,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000289010900028,0

Among many questions, respondents were asked whether they believe humans will become extinct. Forty-five percent of the almost 600 respondents believe that humans will become extinct. Many of those holding this believe felt that humans could become extinct within 5001000 years. Others estimated extinction 5000 or more years into the future. A logistic regression model was estimated to explore the bases for this belief. It was found that people who describe themselves a secular are more likely to hold this belief than people who describe themselves as being Protestant. Older respondents and those who believe that humans have little control over their future also hold this belief. In addition, people who are more apt to think about the future and are better able to imagine potential futures tend to also believe that humans will become extinct. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Protected areas were established decades ago in order to preserve the forest's unique biodiversity from being converted into agricultural land by the regions large number of small-scale farmers. Nonetheless, recent research shows that degradation continues at alarming rates. In this paper we address an important challenge faced by protected area management, namely, the design of a cost-effective incentive scheme that balances local demand for subsistence non-timber forest products against conservation interests. Using primary data collected from 369 randomly selected farm-households we combine a farm-household classification with mathematical programming in order to estimate the opportunity costs of conserving the Kakamega Forest and restricting access to non-timber forest product resources. We validate our model and analyze the impact of changes in major economic frame conditions on our results before we derive recommendations for an improved protected area management in the study region. Our findings suggest that a more flexible approach to determining the price of recently established forest product extraction permits would greatly enhance management efficiency without significantly compromising local wellbeing.

The unique nature of the new law allowed for voluntary adoption during the initial three-year period, after which it became mandatory. We find no evidence of superior abnormal returns for those firms voluntarily adopting the new law versus those forced to accept the new law as it became mandatory. Trading volume also increased for those not adopting and declined for those that did voluntarily adopt. These results indicate that the capital markets did not perceive voluntary adoption of the new law as effective protection for minority shareholders. We also find a greater presence of institutional investors in the ownership structure of those firms not voluntarily adopting the new law, indicating their monitoring role by investing in firms with better corporate governance practices. Our results suggest that, in the Chilean case, the presence of strong institutional investors is as effective a corporate governance mechanism as is the new law.","[Parisi, Franco] Univ Chile, Sch Management & Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Mathur, Ike] So Illinois Univ, Coll Business & Adm, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Nail, Lance] Univ So Mississippi, Coll Business, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA",Universidad de Chile; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University; University of Southern Mississippi,"Parisi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Sch Management & Econ, Santiago, Chile.",fparisi@unegocios.cl; imathur@cba.siu.edu; lance.nail@usm.edu,"Nail, Lance A/N-3586-2013","Nail, Lance/0000-0003-2685-3653",,,,,22,13,14,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

To the best of my knowledge, this theme has not been explored, despite two observations: Firstly, the commonly applied framework of noncompetitive and competitive fringe firms has implausible properties for the limit of purely strategic players. Secondly, real world cases correspond at least potentially to such strategic interactions, e.g., non-competitive players selling and buying permits (CO2 and SO2). The major implications are that these non-competitive markets are characterized by a kind of double marginalization (on the demand and the supply side) resulting in too little trade and wrong price signals.

This article focuses on discourses only, but it does so from an institutional perspective. The reasons to advocate this so-called discursive-institutional approach are threefold: (1) to acknowledge the relevance of both meanings and rules in policy continuity and change; (2) to emphasize the role of ideas, concepts and narratives in institutional dynamics; and (3) to make a useful distinction between discourses and practices ('analytical dualism'). As an example of applying this approach, we analyze the case of global forest politics from the early 1980s till today. It shows that new ideas and meanings concerning sustainability, biodiversity and governance have been institutionalized in this field over time. implying policy change and innovation. Compared to more 'classical' analyses, for example based on rationalistic or (purely) institutional accounts, the discursive-institutional approach draws another picture of global forest policy.

As society becomes ever more complex. direct means of exercising power no longer enjoy the same legitimacy and efficacy. Discourses are instead now assuming a dominant role in defining governance regimes; the sense of what is correct and socially acceptable, and what is not. This is particularly relevant for the rapidly advancing development frontiers in the Amazon region, where local communities are coming into contact with external players highly interested in their forest resources. This study focuses on understanding how external discourses can restrict the Amazonian communities' options for using their forests, but also how communities can harness these discourses to achieve their own claims and objectives. Empirical evidence from four study areas in the Bolivian, Brazilian and Peruvian Amazon regions is used to show how discourses on sustainable forest management are moulding forestry governance. The conclusion shows that while the discourses used by loggers and development organisations are strongly influencing the way communities manage their forests, some communities are also successfully using these discourses in alliances with environmental organisations to achieve acknowledgment of their demands.

Using comparative survey data for 26 countries, it investigates the determinants of maternal employment behaviour with women's attitudes as important predictors, alongside cost-benefit considerations and the influence of national context factors. Results show that mothers' personal care attitudes are significantly related to their paid work involvement. Yet, multilevel analyses reveal cross-country differences in the predictive power of such attitudes. Stressing that neither women's choices nor their attitudes can in fact be taken as expressions of what their personal ideals are, observed attitude-behaviour relations are interpreted as the result of two underlying processes-the selection of behaviours based on attitudes and the adaptation of attitudes to match the chosen behaviour.","[Steiber, Nadia; Haas, Barbara] Vienna Univ Econ, Inst Sociol & Social Res, Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Steiber, N (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ, Inst Sociol & Social Res, Vienna, Austria.",nadia.steiber@wu.ac.at,"Steiber, Nadia/IXN-7351-2023","Haas, Barbara/0000-0003-3057-3267; Steiber, Nadia/0000-0002-9425-8840",,,,,67,55,60,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

As Hicks, Allen, and then Bronfenbrenner showed, this rule is not quite correct, and actually is complicated by an unexpected negative relationship involving labor's share of total costs and the elasticity of substitution. The standard intuitive explanation for the exception to the rule presented by Stigler and referenced in many textbooks describes a situation rather different than the one described in the rule. The author presents an example that illustrates the peculiar negative impact of labor's share operating via the elasticity of substitution and then explains why the unexpected relationship between labor's share of total cost, the elasticity of substitution, and the elasticity of labor demand holds.","Univ Delaware, Dept Econ, Newark, DE 19716 USA",University of Delaware,"Hoffman, SD (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Dept Econ, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",hoffmans@lerner.udel.edu,,,,,,,13,3,3,0,5,HELDREF PUBLICATIONS,WASHINGTON,"1319 EIGHTEENTH ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-1802 USA",0022-0485,,,J ECON EDUC,J.

Specifically, we analyse how such 'biotechnology for the poor' proponents represent a future with or without transgenic crops. Such representations include visions of a beckoning (promising) future, where much is to be gained from an embrace of transgenic technology in agriculture, and an onrushing (threatening) future, where much will be lost if the technology is not embraced. The article shows that claims about a beckoning or onrushing future by 'biotechnology for the poor' proponents are based upon unexamined or problematic assumptions about the poor and poverty. As such, poverty becomes merely a moral backdrop against which visions of a future are articulated. Furthermore, 'biotechnology for the poor' writings do not engage in dialogue with alternative voices in articulating their perspectives on the future, losing a key opportunity to democratize debate about this crucial issue. We conclude by considering the policy consequences (in regulatory and institutional terms) of 'biotechnology for the poor' depictions of the future, particularly for the global South where such consequences will be felt.

Decades of industrial offset agreements between Western aerospace companies and Chinese subcontractors have endowed China with the technological fundamentals required to build commercial passenger jets. These offset agreements were designed to secure sales of Western-built aircraft to China, and often involved critical streams of knowledge transfer from prime contractors to Chinese suppliers. By now, China has acquired virtually all of the technological know-how to enter the commercial aircraft market on an internationally competitive basis. The implications for Western producers are presumably not bright, as China's unit costs are extraordinarily low. Further, it is clear that China's first regional jet has been designed to lead to a replacement for the Boeing 737. Looking to the future, I contend that China will challenge Airbus and Boeing in the market for medium-to-large passenger jets by the mid-2020s. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The monetary values of ecosystem services that are provided by this park are estimated in order to assess the mechanisms to finance the park's conservation and sustainable use. The main ecosystem services provided by the park are water supply (for drinking and electricity generation), maintenance of biodiversity and opportunities for recreation and tourism. Based on interviews with over 300 stakeholders, the study identified the main beneficiaries of these ecosystem services. The monetary benefits of the three services combined were estimated at approx. US$2.5 million/year, equivalent to an average of US$43/year for the total park area (58.323 ha). Compared to other. similar areas, the recreation values are relatively low (approx. 0.6 million US$/year) while the water-supply service is very high: approx. 1.7 million US$/year for hydroelectricity and approx. 0.2 million US$/year for drinking water. Both the low recreation and high water supply values can be correlated with the high rainfall of over 6500 mm/year. To develop payment-mechanisms for the conservation and sustainable use of Tapanti National Park, the main stakeholders were asked about their willingness to pay for the maintenance of the services they benefited from. Different financing mechanisms have been explored, such as taxes, user fees, individual and corporate donations, friends' schemes, and voluntary contractual arrangements. In general, most of the stakeholders were willing to pay for the ecosystem services they received. These potential payments amounted to at least 400,000 US$/year, which excludes the hydro-electricity beneficiary. Even without payments from the hydroelectricity company, this amount suffices to cover the current (245,000 US$) and urgently needed additional budget (100,000 US$) for the National Park management.

This paper addresses a different question: What is the effect of local open-space conservation on the rate of growth in the density of residential land? A discrete-choice econometric model of lakeshore development is estimated with a unique parcel-level spatial-temporal dataset, using maximum simulated likelihood to account for (i) the panel structure of the data, (ii) unobserved spatial heterogeneity, and (iii) sample selection resulting from correlated unobservables. Results indicate that, contrary to the intuition derived from the current literature, local open-space conservation policies do not increase the rate of growth in residential density, and some open-space conservation policies may reduce the rate of growth in residential development density. This is consistent with land-value complementarity between local open space and parcel size. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

J,"Tonn, B; MacGregor, D",,,,"Tonn, Bruce; MacGregor, Donald",,,Individual approaches to futures thinking and decision making,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TIME PERSPECTIVE,"This paper presents results of a second international web-based survey designed to gather data about how individuals approach thinking about their futures and making decisions regarding their futures. Five hundred and five respondents from 38 countries participated in the survey. Similar to the first survey, the sample has gender, age and religious diversity but is not representative with respect to education, income and race/ethnicity. The results suggest that the external environment provides a great deal of stimuli for people to think about the future (e.g., special occasions like New Years day, birthdays, and funerals). Individuals tend to think about the future more in the morning, and just before bed. Overall, most respondents experience happiness. confidence, and lightness when thinking about the future. Respondents employ many different approaches to thinking about the future, such as relying on personal past experiences, imagining future situations, and relying on their personal intuitions. Most respondents do not pattern their futures decision making on decisions made by others or on tradition. Most respondents believe that their thinking about the future is very worthwhile: most develop plans and take decisive action as a result of their efforts. About three quarters of the respondents report that they are able to predict their personal futures at least one-half of the time. Most respondents face few barriers to thinking about the future, although many reported it would be nice to have more energy, be able to concentrate better, and be able to better organize their thoughts. Females report that thinking about the future is a more emotional experience than it is for males. Males, on the other hand, have more confidence in their futures-oriented decision making abilities. Age plays a big part in how individuals relate to and think about the future. Younger respondents think more about the future more times during the day and find thinking about the future more fearful and anxious. They also pattern their decisions more on those made by others and older individuals. Older respondents tend to rely a great deal upon their lifetime of experiences and worry less about the future. Middle-aged respondents report worrying more about financial and career issues and report that thinking about the future can be emotionally draining. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

One typical pattern exhibits low accrual in early years, accelerating in the mid- to late fifties, followed by dramatic decline or even negative returns in years that are relatively young for retirement.

Using a difference-in-difference estimation strategy, I find that school districts in Michigan used the increase in educational spending generated through Proposal A to increase teacher salaries and reduce class size to a smaller extent. Then, using the foundation allowance created by Proposal A as an instrument, I estimate the causal effect of increased spending on 4th and 7th grade math scores for two test measures - a scaled score and a percent satisfactory measure - and find positive effects of increased spending on 4th grade test scores. A 60% increase in spending increases the percent satisfactory score by one standard deviation. The positive impact of expenditures on test performance seems largely due to higher teacher salaries.

Respondents were hypertensive patients suspected of having renal artery stenosis. Data were gathered using telephone interviews. Both the willingness-to-pay and willingness to give up time methods revealed that patients preferred CTA to MRA in order to avoid DSA. The agreement between willingness-to-pay and willingness to give up time responses was high (kappa 0.65-0.85). The willingness-to-pay method yielded relatively more protest answers (12%) as compared to willingness to give up time (2%). So, our results provided evidence for the comparability of willingness to pay and willingness to give up time. The high percentage of protest answers on the willingness-to-pay questions raises questions with respect to the application of the willingness-to-pay method in a broad decision-making context. On the other hand, the strength of willingness-to-pay is that the method directly arrives at a monetary measure well founded in economic theory, whereas the willingness to give up time method requires conversion to monetary units.","[van Helvoort-Postulart, Debby; Dirksen, Carmen D.; Kessels, Alfons G.

For the majority of consumers, the purchase of potatoes is a routine or low involvement decision, with almost half of the respondents being unable to recall the last price that they paid to buy fresh potatoes. As prices increased, the quantity of potatoes purchased decreased but not in a linear fashion. There was evidence of at least two price points and for some 28% of buyers they will continue to purchase potatoes irrespective of the price. With a superior coefficient of determination (R-2) and a smaller standard error (SE), a quadratic model was found to be a more accurate indicator of the price/quantity relationship.","Curtin Univ Technol, Perth, WA, Australia",Curtin University,"Batt, PJ (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ Technol, Perth, WA, Australia.",,,,,,,,11,3,3,0,8,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-6605-429-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,831.0,,,,,,169.0,178,,,,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAW33,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305708700019,0

Thus, the competitiveness of local food can be questioned. In Sweden most horticultural produce is sold through the large-scale food retailing system, which is concentrated to few highly vertically integrated wholesale and retail actors. Thus, our hypothesis is that these actors could be regarded as gate-openers to the marketplace for local food products. Hence, the success and competitiveness of local food ought to be dependent on the willingness of the major food wholesale and retail actors to offer a local range of products in their stores. The purpose of this paper is to examine the competitiveness of a local vegetable cluster in the southern part of Sweden, Skane, with particular attention paid to the gate-opening role of the local supermarkets. For the competitive analysis we have used the Porter Diamond. Primary data were collected through observations of the range of locally produced vegetables in local supermarkets and interviews with representatives of local actors along the value chain. Results show that the range of locally profiled vegetables in the supermarkets is very limited, and some store managers stated that central chain strategy is a barrier to buying local produce. In contrast to this, many consumers stated that they buy local vegetables in the supermarkets on a regular basis. This contradiction could be explained by the fact that Swedish may be perceived by many consumers in Skane as equivalent to local due to the region's large share of national vegetable production. While supermarkets in general have not acted as gate-openers to local products, as was our hypothesis, there are individual exceptions, developed by innovative entrepreneurs and networks. Our conclusion is that, as the debate on climate change intensifies and the demand for high quality fresh produce increases, the supermarkets will eventually change strategies towards local products, at least on a seasonal basis.","[Ekelund, L.; Tjarnemo, H.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Work Sci Business Econ & Environm Psychol, SE-23053 Alnarp, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Ekelund, L (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Work Sci Business Econ & Environm Psychol, Box 88, SE-23053 Alnarp, Sweden.",,,,,,,,17,2,2,1,12,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-6605-429-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,831.0,,,,,,193.0,200,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAW33,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305708700022,0

The authors propose to assign a degree of pollution risk to each polluting economic unit, such that each of them can control its own optimal production, taking account also the degree of risk assigned to it.

The Web was adopted by extension educators in the mid-1990's because it was a cost effective solution to the dilemma of distributing high quality printed information to clientele quickly and without the associated costs of color printing, inventory maintenance, handling and postage. The capability for 24-7-365 availability of printed educational materials alone resulted in millions of dollars of cost savings to the Web-enabled groups. \ With the advent of modern applications driven largely by the commercial segment of the Web, extension specialists and educators made rapid strides in the adoption of technology for fulfilling their mission to educate their students and clientele. Wikis, blogs, podcasting, Web conferencing, and other advanced tools have changed teaching and extension Web sites, and in fact, have allowed these professionals to expand their missions. An unspoken truth has begun to cloud a story that would be rated otherwise an unqualified success. Fewer professional horticultural educators are employed in extension and university positions, academic horticulture departments are decreasing in number worldwide, and the shortage in the number of horticulturists with production-oriented training is both real and critical. The development of collaborative teaching and extension programs that allow for distance-independent creation, maintenance and delivery of extension information and academic instruction represents an asset as well as a driving force to insure future technological advancements in the field of horticulture. However, significant barriers including traditional funding paradigms and ownership threaten to undermine potential advancements, but these threats can and 'must' be overcome.","Texas A&M Univ, Dept Hort Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Lineberger, RD (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Hort Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-6605-429-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,831.0,,,,,,15.0,20,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAW33,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305708700001,0

Fruit samples were bought monthly from Hungarian groceries and supermarkets during three consequtive years. Apple fruit samples from Austria, Argentina, Chile, Hungary and South Africa were involved in this study. Authors also evaluated fruit quality parameters of above cultivars and compared them to consumer preference. The following fruit quality parameters were measured: fruit weight (g), diameter (mm), height (mm), fruit shape index, skin colour (%), flesh firmness (N), soluble solids content (%). Consumer preference usually represented the quality attributes of the fruit well. It is also concluded that degree of liking of apple cultivars varies through gender and age. Children and young consumers preferred 'Royal Gala', 'Granny Smith' and 'Braeburn', mostly. In spite of 'Idared' being one of the cultivars grown in the largest area in Hungary, the lowest preference ratings were given for it in both gender categories. Middle-aged consumers (between 25 and 50 years of age) preferred crispy apples with red or blemished skin color ('Royal Gala', and 'Jonagold'). 'Jonagold' and 'Idared' were the most preferred cultivars for the consumers above the age of 50 likely because of their relatively low price, as price plays a significant influencing role in the purchase of these consumers. The relatively expensive and soury 'Granny Smith' appeared not really preferred by this age group. In spite of the significant differences in instrumentally measured fruit quality parameters among 'Granny Smith' fruit samples from different countries, consumers did not give significantly different preference rating scores for those.","[Racsko, J.; Miller, D.

According to the FAO the number of undernourished people rises to 963 million compared with 923 million in 2007. Hunger (and poverty as well) is concentrated in the developing countries in agriculture and rural areas. Therefore economic growth is needed to decrease the level of undernourished population (e.g., increasing the level of food security). It should be connected with agricultural development and international trade liberalisation within the globalisation process and the scarcity of natural resources. The article discusses the WTO agricultural negotiation and its effect on developing countries. The agenda of agricultural trade liberalisation, which was established on the Uruguay Round, did not fulfil the expectations of poor countries. Liberalisation itself was not a sufficient factor to spur trade. The additional barriers were placed for example in agricultural policy of the developed countries, the imperfect agricultural market and the lack of infrastructure and institutions. In the process of creating new world trade regime people have to consider evolution of the world agriculture, motives and levels of agricultural sector support, implementation of new technology and climate changes. The trade liberalisation should be accompanied by coherent policies both at national and international level.","[Sapa, Agnieszka] Poznan Univ Econ, Fac Econ, Dept Macroecon & Agr Econ, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,,,,,,,,,21,2,2,0,8,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-9937-2-0,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2009,,19,,,,,288.0,293,,,,,,6,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BUR80,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290182700038,0

However, most of the physical methods are manual. Therefore, development of a robotic weeding system is necessary to practice efficient weed control. The objective of this study was to develop a pixel discriminant model for image segmentation between crop and weed using hyperspectral imaging. A hyperspectral image was processed pixel by pixel. First, every pixel spectrum was extracted from the image. Next, each pixel spectrum was classified into soil and plant. If the pixel spectrum was identified as plant, it was classified into crop and weed. In the pixel discriminant model for soil and plant, simple NDVI thresholding was employed. The pixel discriminant model for crop and weed consisted of a normalizer, an explanatory variable generator and the discriminator. Development of the explanatory variable generator was tried with two different methods (RAW or PCA). Development of discriminator was also tried with two different methods (LDA or NN). In this study, four types of models (RAW-LDA, RAW-NN, PCA-LDA and PCA-NN) were developed for discrimination between crop and weed and validated. Finally, segmented images for crop, weed, and soil were generated from the images by applying these models. Pixel discrimination between soil and plant was performed with high accuracy. In the pixel discrimination between crop and weed, success rates of all discriminant models were more than 85%. As for the accuracy of the models, NN models were superior to LDA, and the PCA method was superior to RAW. However, with respect to processing speed, the RAW method was superior to PCA. As a result of image segmentation, most of pixel spectra in the images were identified correctly. In conclusion, this study showed the possibility for weed detection by using hyperspectral imaging.","[Suzuki, Y.] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Okamoto, H.; Kataoka, T.] Hokkaido Univ, Res Fac Agr, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan",Hokkaido University; Hokkaido University,"Suzuki, Y (通讯作者)，Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.",,,,,,,,14,3,3,0,9,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-6605-370-0,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,824.0,,,,,,67.0,73,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAV48,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305621100007,0

The results show that students undertaking the intermediate exam perform better both in terms of the probability of passing the exams and of grades obtained. High ability students appear to benefit more from the treatment. The experiment design allows us to disentangle workload division or commitment effects from feedback provision effects. We find that the estimated treatment impact is due exclusively to the first effect, while the feedback provision has no positive effect on performance.

Owing to compositional differences across regions, the horizontal measures are found to amplify existing disparities. It is argued that under certain conditions, relating to wider spatial imbalances in the country, this can trigger cumulative divergence processes that may be hard to address in the future. To correct this, it is proposed that revenue-generating efforts should concentrate more on tackling tax evasion and increasing tax progressivity; while the reduction in public consumption should be compensated by targeted increases in public investment. Facilitating the early release of already earmarked European Union funds can be central for such a strategy.","London Sch Econ, European Inst & Hellen Observ, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Monastiriotis, V (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, European Inst & Hellen Observ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",v.monastiriotis@lse.ac.uk,", Vassilis/AAI-9243-2021",", Vassilis/0000-0003-3709-3119",,,,,29,48,49,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

This paper analyzes a spatial dynamic model with two production technologies for residential development-municipal sewer service for suburban development and septic systems for exurban development. In outlying agricultural areas, the additional sewer extension costs can significantly reduce the value of agricultural land in suburban use. Exurban development, while at lower density, can occur immediately and requires only the onsite conversion costs of septic systems. Hence, the willingness to pay for exurban use from households with higher preferences for lot size may exceed the agricultural landowner's reservation price on future suburban use for a range of distances from the city boundary. This results in a feasible zone for exurban leapfrog development and another fundamental reason for scattered development in the urban-rural fringe. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Numerous studies document that higher levels of education are positively associated with longer life and better health throughout the lifespan. But measuring the causal links between education and health is a more challenging task. Aside from the typical econometric concerns about measurement error, functional form, and sampling properties, measuring the causal impact of education on health is confounded by the likely causal effect of health on education, and vice versa. Concerns about 'missing' variables that affect both the accumulation of human capital and the health capital - such as measures of individual discount rates - also make causality difficult to measure. Despite the difficulties, there has been a marked surge over the last decade in the number of empirical studies attempting to estimate the causal links between education and health. This survey reviews recent empirical evidence on the topic. Following the bifurcation in the literature, we split the survey into two pieces. First, we review the evidence of the effect of education on health. The vast majority of work in this area focuses on schooling up through college and its effect on adult health, including longevity. Second, we review the evidence of the effect of health on education, including health shocks in the womb and their effects on educational attainment. Rather than attempting a comprehensive review, our focus is to highlight relatively recent research. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Although previous studies consistently find that subsidy receipt is associated with increased employment among single mothers, there is currently no evidence on the influence of these benefits on the decision to invest in human capital. Using data from the Kindergarten cohort of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, this paper examines the impact of child care subsidy receipt on the likelihood of engaging in education and job training activities. We identify the impact of subsidy receipt by exploiting plausibly exogenous geographic variation in the distance that parents must travel from home in order to reach the nearest social service agency that administers the subsidy application process. Results suggest that child care subsidies encourage single mothers to engage in human capital investment. In particular, our instrumental variables estimates imply that subsidy receipt increases the likelihood that a single mother enrolls in courses at a school or university by 13 percentage points and participates in a job training program by 8 percentage points.

I examine the validity of those critiques, focusing in particular on the accuracy of the portraits given of Ken Wilber and his contribution to integral theory. I also examine the claims of epistemological pluralism to determine whether it is a more appropriate framework for futures inquiry and practice.

Specifically, the findings reveal that in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, second-generation Turkish students had significant disadvantages in terms of allocated resources at home and in school. More often than not, these disadvantages were found to have significantly negative effects in terms of second-generation Turkish students' test outcomes relative to their native peers.

Scenarios considered include: anti-evolution activists will continue to attempt legal maneuvers to leverage creationism into public science classrooms, creationists will concede to secular instruction in public schools and focus their attentions on informal mis-education, and that the teaching of evolution will improve despite challenges. Also, noting that tactics employed by American creationists are being exported to other countries, international challenges to the teaching of evolution are discussed with special attention paid to potential futures regarding evolutionary science within Islamic cultures.

On the basis of official ownership records for all nonfinancial firms over a six-year period (1999-2004), we explore the factors responsible for the concentration of ownership and for the dissolution of the multiple blockholder structures that these firms were assigned at privatization. We observe significant path dependence: patterns of ownership and control are in part determined by the persistence of the initial privatization owners (state funds, privatization investment funds, employees, and managers) as firm blockholders. We also find that ownership concentrates less in larger, riskier, and better-performing firms. Multiple blockholders remain present in the firms in which the two largest owners are of the same type, which presumably makes it easier for them to control in coalition.","[Gregoric, Aleksandra] Copenhagen Business Sch, Ctr Corp Governance, Dept Int Econ & Management, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Masten, Arjana Brezigar] Univ Primorska, Fac Management Nat Sci & Informat Technol Koper, Primorska, Slovenia; [Zajc, Katarina] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Law, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia",Copenhagen Business School; University of Primorska; University of Ljubljana,"Gregoric, A (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Ctr Corp Governance, Dept Int Econ & Management, Copenhagen, Denmark.",agr.int@cbs.dk; brezigar.arjana@upr.si; katarina.zajc@pf.uni-lj.si,,,,,,,51,2,2,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Then we use conditional standard deviations of inflation and output to proxy nominal and real uncertainty, respectively, and perform Granger causality tests. Our results suggest that inflation rate induces uncertainty about both inflation rate and output growth rate, which is detrimental to real economic activity.

Subsequent to the panel and the discussion, the presenters and the Chair of the Panel wrote up their comments in the form of short essays which are collected together in this forum. The first two contributions by Helleiner and Seabrooke address directly problems with the efforts at reform. Helleiner draws attention to the need for macro-prudential regulation and for tackling global imbalances through developing the International Monetary Fund system of Special Drawing Rights. Seabrooke focuses on the difficulties faced in learning from the crisis and developing innovative ways of dealing with problems in the financial architecture when there are high levels of transparency to markets, effectively disallowing the sorts of confidential debates and discussions necessary for learning. As a result he identifies what he describes as a 'learning impasse' in regulatory reform. The third contribution by Erturk et al. attempts to characterize the forces which generated the crisis in order to suggest a different direction of reform from that currently being undertaken; the final contribution by Morgan also suggests that the current direction of reform is based on assumptions about the nature of finance and regulation that misdiagnose the global nature of the crisis and the capacities for international regulation and underestimate the role to be played by national governments.

It throws up new concepts and issues. For example, no one foresaw what Mark Zuckerberg would create in terms of on-line social networks with the Face Book project. Predicting the functionality and utility of the Internet is a mug's game and yet it can be extremely profitable for those who 'guess right' and are able to influence the future applications and organisational forms of the network society. Next Generation Access (NGA) broadband is promoted strongly by policy makers as underpinning future economic growth. NGA can be thought of as a potential future placeholder, the content and structure of which, while remaining tantalizing, is occupying many contemporary minds. In this paper we describe a process (Imagine/Triple Task Method) and an event structure IBZL (or Infinite Bandwidth Zero Latency), which explores potentially novel applications of NGA and provide some ideas as to the key components of the future inter-networked landscape. In this paper we present the context of the IBZL initiative, review the 'Imagine' process as an effective method for 'futurescaping' and present some initial outcomes of the project.

We follow the career paths of a cohort of almost 25,000 classroom teachers during the 2001-2002 school year for seven subsequent years. Our results confirm that effective teachers are more likely to become assistant principals or principals and less likely to be reassigned to a low-stakes teaching position. The tendency of highly effective teachers to continue teaching in high-stakes grades and subjects is strongest in schools receiving low ratings from the state's school accountability system.

This study focussed on decisions about the initial price and reimbursement status of innovative drugs and discussed the consequences for market access and cost. Four countries were studied: Germany, The Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom. These countries have operated one, or both, of the two policies at certain points in time, sometimes in parallel. Drugs in four groups were considered: cholesterol-lowering agents, insulin analogues, biologic drugs for rheumatoid arthritis and atypical drugs for schizophrenia. Compared with HTA, reference pricing is a relatively blunt instrument for obtaining value for money from pharmaceuticals. Thus, its role in making reimbursement decisions should be limited to drugs which are therapeutically equivalent. HTA is a superior strategy for obtaining value for money because it addresses not only price but also the appropriate indications for the use of the drug and the relation between additional value and additional costs. However, given the relatively higher costs of conducting HTAs, the most efficient approach might be a combination of both policies.","[Drummond, Michael] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Joensson, Bengt] Stockholm Sch Econ, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden; [Rutten, Frans] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Stargardt, Tom] Helmholz Zentrum, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Munich, Germany",University of York - UK; Stockholm School of Economics; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health,"Drummond, M (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Alcuin A Block, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",md18@york.ac.uk,"Livingstone, Norma/A-6389-2012",,,,,,25,41,45,1,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

F.; Rodriguez-Vicente, V.",,,Factors determining forest management by farmers in northwest Spain: Application of discriminant analysis,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Agroforestry; Discriminant Analysis (DA); Farmer; Non-industrial private forest (NIPF) owner,OWNERS; CLASSIFICATION; MOTIVATIONS; COOPERATION; HARVEST,"Farmers have come to play an important role in multiple-use forestry and have been identified as some of the most important and universal non-industrial private forest (NIPF) owners on a global scale. In Galicia (NW Spain), more than two-thirds of forest land belongs to more than 670,000 NIPF owners, who are mainly identified as active and retired farmers. The aim of the present study was to differentiate and obtain a profile of farmers involved in forestry (forest farmers) and those not involved in forestry (non-forest farmers) by assessment of practical factors associated with land management. This will allow efficient development of priority guidelines for forest research and of policies to encourage forestry and improve decision-making related to agroforestry. Data were collected by a survey (personal questionnaire) of more than 4300 Galician farmers in 2004. In a random sample of 49% of the completed questionnaires, Discriminant Analysis (DA) was used to examine the land holding attributes and socioeconomic landowner characteristics - and the combinations of these - that provide the most accurate differentiation between forest farmers and non-forest farmers. The predictive discriminant model for classifying farmers was then tested by a cross-validation procedure in the remaining landowner population surveyed in the region. The results indicated that the annual investment in agroforestry improvement, the number of plots on and size of the farm holding, the landowner's experience in farm management and the number of members in the family unit were key determinants in the involvement of farmers in forestry and their commitment to the practice. It was concluded that the discriminant model may be a useful method for identifying and characterizing NIPF landowner profiles in the region and may help academics and decision-makers in order to develop and plan better policy programs for supporting and encouraging forestry among farmers.

The handling of uncertainty in health economics was used as a point of reference for addressing the uncertainty in a BIA. This overview shows that standard methods of sensitivity analysis, which are used for standard data set in a health economic model (clinical probabilities, treatment patterns, resource utilisation and prices/tariffs), cannot always be used for the input data for the BIA model beyond the health economic data set for various reasons. Whereas in a health economic model, only limited data may come from a Delphi panel, a BIA model often relies on a majority of data taken from a Delphi panel. In addition, the dataset in a BIA model also includes forecasts (e.g. annual growth, uptakes curves, substitution effects, changes in prescription restrictions and guidelines, future distribution of the available treatment modalities, off-label use). As a consequence, the use of standard sensitivity analyses for BIA data set might be limited because of the lack of appropriate distributions as data sources are limited, or because of the need for forecasting. Therefore, scenario analyses might be more appropriate to capture the uncertainty in the BIA data set in the overall BIA model.","[Nuijten, M. J.

We specifically looked at adaptation projects in the Dutch Climate changes Spatial Planning programme. Based on the four decision failure criteria neglect of internal information, bounded rationality, insufficient expansion of existing mental models and stickiness and lack of friction of information and knowledge, it was concluded that in these projects, socio-economic scenarios appear to generate useful data, but that their full potential to reduce decision failure is not likely to be exploited. Therefore adaptation options suggested by these studies may not be 'future-proof': they may be appropriate in some future societies, but fail in others. We believe similar results would be obtained in other contexts. Possible decision failures are caused by neglecting socio-economic developments, limiting the number of storylines generated by scenario studies to one or two, lack of stakeholder involvement in the scenario development and ignoring discontinuities.

The development of profitability and growing stock is similar for both species in the forestry sector of this region. Specifically, we observe that forest owners decide to accumulate growing stock in spite of decreasing profitability, due to the evolution of prices and costs. In this study, we attempt to explain statistically the forest owners' behavior using the Granger causality test and an analysis based on the cross-correlation functions. The statistical analysis between timber supply and market prices shows opposite results for both species. The increasing growing stock is due to a decrease in wood prices in the case of Pinus pinaster. Lower prices and less timber supply resulted in a higher accumulation of growing stock. On the contrary, this result does not hold for Eukaliptus globulus. In this case, a decrease in price does not statistically cause a reduction in timber supply. This may suggest that the accumulation of growing stock could be a consequence of subsidies, forest abandonment, and rapid natural regeneration of this species. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The findings confirmed not only that sufficient resources and capacity for forest policy execution are crucial for attaining policy objectives, but also that innovative arrangements for promoting, verifying, and enforcing policy compliance can compensate for limited resources and processes. Such arrangements incorporate a mixture of policy tools and actors that go beyond the traditional command-and-control approach, including the establishment of positive fiscal incentives for sustainable forest management, provision of technical assistance, participation of private-sector forest stewards, and support from nongovernmental organizations. The results also shed light on the mitigating effects of local-level inducements and constraints to governmental and nongovernmental forest policy adoption and compliance, such as forest size and composition, available resources, technical capacity, and attitudes toward forest policy and implementers.

The theoretical bases for analysing policy networks, project networks, and operational networks overlap in a random fashion. This paper reviews and compares the theoretical approaches utilised in analysing networks and their perspectives on learning. Policy, project and operational networks are exemplified in the context of integrating biodiversity conservation into forest policy in Finland. Information flow and appreciation among network organisations are analysed with the aim of understanding how the formality and openness of information exchange shape learning mechanisms, and the capacity of the networks to adapt to the policy demand for biodiversity conservation. The policy, project and operational networks generate partly different mechanisms for learning. While project networks utilise both direct and open access to up-to-date research-based understanding of biodiversity conservation and bridge across sector-boundaries, policy networks are more strongly reliant on formal patterns of information exchange and communicate interests at a level distanced from practice. Operational networks on the other hand, have strong informal contacts but their biodiversity conservation learning relies on information flows through conduit-like closed links. Reliance on channels and allowing spill-overs can improve adaptation and explorative learning. Where information exchange is formally defined, informal ties can ease the tackling of emerging issues.

The wealth-related health inequalities are measured using the popular concentration index. We then implement the decomposition method of the indices and evaluate the contribution of the various determinants of health introduced in interval regression models. Health is measured using self-assessed health and country-specific cut-points that correct observed differences in self-report due to cross-cultural differences in reporting styles. This paper uses data for ten European countries from the first wave of the 2004 SHARE. The study highlights significantly higher wealth-related health inequalities in the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany. These social inequalities of health in Europe are explained largely by individuals' current social conditions, particularly wealth. Nevertheless, our analysis attests the existence of a long-term influence of initial conditions in childhood on health in middle-aged and beyond, independently of current social characteristics, which contribute to differences in health status across social groups. This article contributes to the identification of social determinants, which are important determinants of health and follows recommendations suggested to help 'close the gap' in various health inequities.","[Tubeuf, Sandy] Univ Leeds, Leeds Inst Hlth Sci, Acad Unit Hlth Econ, Leeds LS2 9LJ, W Yorkshire, England; [Jusot, Florence] Univ Paris 09, LEGOS, F-75775 Paris 16, France",University of Leeds; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire d'Etudes en Geophysique et oceanographie spatiales; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine,"Tubeuf, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Leeds Inst Hlth Sci, Acad Unit Hlth Econ, Charles Thackrah Bldg,101 Clarendon Rd, Leeds LS2 9LJ, W Yorkshire, England.",s.tubeuf@leeds.ac.uk; florence.jusot@dauphine.fr,"Tubeuf, Sandy/J-5688-2019","Tubeuf, Sandy/0000-0001-9001-1157",,,,,37,18,19,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Using data from the School and Staffing Survey (SASS) and a more recent data set, the Teacher Rules, Roles and Rights (TR3), we find that collective bargaining has a significant impact on all aspects of current, qualification-specific salary schedules. Further, we find some evidence that bargaining impacts the design of performance pay plans. Specifically, unions tend to encourage teacher bonuses that are based on additional qualifications or duties, but discourage bonuses that directly reward improved student test scores.

It examines data compiled from an experiment conducted in 2005-6 in which two qualitatively identical applications, one with a woman's name on it and the other with a man's name, were sent to employers advertising positions in Stockholm and Gothenburg (the two largest labor markets in Sweden). The study adds to previous international field experiments by providing additional analysis of the Swedish labor market to determine whether hiring discrimination is a primary cause of occupational gender segregation. The results show that, on average, women have a somewhat higher callback rate to interview in female-dominated occupations, while in male-dominated occupations there is no evidence of gender difference. These findings suggest that the bulk of the prevailing gender segregation in Sweden cannot be explained by discrimination in hiring.","Linnaeus Univ, Linnaeus Sch Business & Econ, S-39182 Kalmar, Sweden",Linnaeus University,"Carlsson, M (通讯作者)，Linnaeus Univ, Linnaeus Sch Business & Econ, S-39182 Kalmar, Sweden.",magnus.carlsson@lnu.se,,"Carlsson, Magnus/0000-0002-5620-4745",,,,,32,53,60,4,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The study is based upon field surveys of cane farmers classified on the basis of cane cultivated area - Group I (below five acres), Group II (five to ten acres) and Group III (above ten acres). Across the three groups of cane growers little variation has been observed in their farm asset positions except for land size and cane cultivable practices. All cane growers enter into informal verbal contracts with several upstream chain partners to lease land, hire labour and purchase operational inputs. In contrast, they all enter into formal written contracts with their downstream chain partners i.e. sugar mills for cane disposal. Upward chain coordination ensures that farmers have sufficient land to achieve some economies of scale for the optimal utilization of complementary farm assets, timely availability of labour and timely availability of other operational inputs. However, owing to frequent and unexpected power cuts, farmers turn to diesel operated pump sets to ensure timely irrigation and open markets for the purchase of fertilizers because cooperative societies are not always able to ensure timely and adequate supplies. Downward chain coordination ensures timely cane disposal for farmers while regular and timely cane supplies to mills. However, cooperative sugar mills often fail to make timely cane payments to farmers. Thereupon, Group II and III sized cane farmers have a propensity to shift to private sugar mills for cane disposal and to divert some part of their land holdings to alternative field crops i.e., paddy/cotton. In contrast, Group I farmers shift to the cultivation of alternative crops.","Punjab Agr Univ, Ludhiana 141004, Punjab, India",Punjab Agricultural University,"Goel, V (通讯作者)，Punjab Agr Univ, Ludhiana 141004, Punjab, India.",,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-66050-89-1,ACTA HORTIC,,,2011,895.0,,,,,,129.0,136,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BGR09,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000323845300016,0

However, many scholars in China analyse social responsibility of multinational corporations from the policy perspective, and few have considered the imperfection of laws. The legislation of the social responsibility of multinational corporations has become the common choice. For the above-mentioned reasons, China should improve the legislation of the social responsibility of multinational corporations. And by canceling super national treatment, perfecting the relevant substantive laws and procedural laws, through strengthening the administrative enforcement, and by enhancing law-abiding consciousness of multinational corporations, all those will help urge the multinational corporations to fulfill their social responsibilities.","[Li Meixiang] Shandong Univ Technol, Sch Law, Zibo 255049, Peoples R China",Shandong University of Technology,,potato913@163.com,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,6,ST PLUM-BLOSSOM PRESS PTY LTD,DOCKLAND,"7 POINT PARK CRESCENT, DOCKLAND, VIC 3008, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-646-56777-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,135.0,+,,,,,,2,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BZX98,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303279700020,0

However, poor conservation outcomes have forced planners to reconsider the role of the forest community in resource use and conservation. Presence of a deep-rooted economic, social. cultural and ethical difference between members of Forest Protection Committee (FPC) constrains group behaviour and their capacity to modify regulations governing resource use. This paper studies the forest policy regimes of India in detail and seeks to investigate the influence of emerging socio-economic issues towards formulating a more robust and sustainable future forest policy by selecting the district of Bankura in West Bengal, India, as a study area, where forest protection regime is practiced rigorously for nearly two decades. The exercise reveals that tribal populations are reluctant to be non-workers and prefer to protect the forest by being a stakeholder in the process of Joint Forest Management (JFM). Thus formulating a more egalitarian distributive JFM mechanism for sharing of benefits fairly across the resource users requires cognizance of collective-choice rule used and the type of heterogeneity existing in the community.

As a result, 43% in these surveyed farmers approved of the assistant-insurance mode that commercial insurance company is the single insurer by the business assistance of forestry sector, but governments' administration intervention in rating at forest insurance products has been one of the key issues which determine low efficiency of the assistant-insurance mode. On the basis of above studies, the operation framework of policy-related forest insurance was constructed by the comparison of advantages among government, forestry sector and commercial insurance company. This paper concludes that the assistant-insurance mode consists with China's developing need of forest insurance; however, the government's advantage of institutional supply must be exerted to effectively guard against government failure and market failure; meanwhile, the cooperation of commercial insurance company and forestry sector should also been strengthened to make the both advantages complement.","[Zhang Changda] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",Beijing Forestry University,,zhangchangdacq@126.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,ST PLUM-BLOSSOM PRESS PTY LTD,HAWTHORN EAST,"STE 4, LEVEL 3, 695 BURKE RD, HAWTHORN EAST, VC 3123, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-646-55641-3,,,,2011,,,,,,,166.0,171,,,,,,6,Economics; Environmental Studies; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BBI15,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306935700027,0

From the point of view in the region, the economic zone in central city group contributes greater to total difference, compared with Western Liaoning coastal economic zone, the Liaodong Peninsula coastal economic zone. The characteristics of regional financial development difference presented above correlate tightly with the development difference of regional economy, the deepening of the market-based reform, the involvement of the local government in the financial development, and the coordinated development policies implemented by central authorities.","[Zhao Fulu; Li Haihua] Liaoning Tech Univ, Sch Business Adm, Huludao 125105, Peoples R China",Liaoning Technical University,,haihua130@163.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,ST PLUM-BLOSSOM PRESS PTY LTD,DOCKLAND,"7 POINT PARK CRESCENT, DOCKLAND, VIC 3008, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-646-56777-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,106.0,112,,,,,,7,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BZX98,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303279700016,0

It redefines the debate on deskilling which ran through the 1970s and 1980s by expanding the focus beyond simple job quality to issues of current policy interest, notably the contribution of skill to innovation and productivity. To map this kind of dynamism it is necessary to use a metric capable of capturing change over short periods. This is achieved by adding a third dimension, skill-intensity, to Spenner's classic definition of skill in terms of two loosely related constructs, worker autonomy/control and substantive job complexity. Data drawn from the first eight waves of HILDA are analysed to demonstrate that this metric is capable of capturing statistically significant change in the average skill content of jobs over much shorter periods than was possible with the metrics used in earlier decades. The broadly parallel aggregate trendlines for skill-intensity and autonomy/control suggest that these two dimensions are linked in the way Spenner suggests, even though major discrepancies appear between them in some industries and occupations.","Univ New S Wales, Ind Relat Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Fraser, D (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Ind Relat Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",doug.fraser@tassie.net.au,,,,,,,25,4,4,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

This article focuses on the sensitivity of value added to test score ceiling effects. Test score ceilings are increasingly common in testing instruments across the country as education policy continues to emphasize proficiency-based reform. Encouragingly, we show that over a wide range of test score ceiling severity, teachers' value-added estimates are only negligibly influenced by ceiling effects. However, as ceiling conditions approach those found in minimum-competency testing environments, value-added results are significantly altered. We suggest a simple statistical check for ceiling effects.","[Koedel, Cory] Univ Missouri, Dept Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Betts, Julian] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Betts, Julian] Natl Bur Econ Res, Dept Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of California System; University of California San Diego; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Koedel, C (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Dept Econ, 118 Profess Bldg, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",koedelc@missouri.edu; jbetts@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,27,53,77,0,16,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"238 MAIN ST, STE 500, CAMBRIDGE, 02142-1046 USA",1557-3060,,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

The paper uses repeated cross-sectional adolescent survey data from a Swedish region, collected in 1988, 1991, 1995, 1998, 2002 and 2005, and merges this with data on local unemployment rates for the same time periods. Individual level frequency of alcohol use as well as experience of binge drinking is connected to local level unemployment rate to estimate the relationship using multilevel modeling. The model includes municipality effects controlling for time-invariant differences between municipalities as well as year fixed effects controlling for municipality-invariant changes over time in alcohol use. The results show that the unemployment rate is negatively associated with adolescents' alcohol use and the experience of binge drinking. When the unemployment rate increases, more adolescents do not drink at all. Regular drinking (twice per month or more) is, on the other hand, unrelated to the unemployment rate. Examining gender-differences in the relationship, it is shown that the results are driven by behavior in girls, whereas drinking among boys does not show any significant relationship with changes in the unemployment rate.","[Svensson, Mikael] Univ Orebro, Swedish Business Sch, Dept Econ, Orebro, Sweden; [Svensson, Mikael; Hagquist, Curt] Karlstad Univ, Ctr Res Child & Adolescent Mental Hlth, Karlstad, Sweden",Orebro University; Karlstad University,"Svensson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Orebro, Swedish Business Sch, Dept Econ, Orebro, Sweden.",mikael.svensson@oru.se,"PAN, ZEQIANG/X-6341-2018; Svensson, Mikael/P-2108-2014","Svensson, Mikael/0000-0003-1113-7478",,,,,27,15,16,0,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

While complete output equality is not feasible, the extent to which a policy achieves output equality depends on the society's choice, and is likely to cost more.

We find that these rebates led to a large increase in the market share of hybrid vehicles. In particular, we estimate that 26% of the hybrid vehicles sold during the rebate programs can be attributed to the rebate, and that intermediate cars, intermediate SUVs and some high performance compact cars were crowded out as a result. However, this implies that the rebate programs also subsidized many consumers who would have bought either hybrid vehicles or other fuel-efficient vehicles in any case.

We use a statistical data envelopment analysis (DEA)-bootstrap approach with quasi-fixed inputs to estimate the precision of our measure. To do so, we developed a statistical model serving as the foundation of the data generation process (DGP). The DGP is constructed such that we can implement both smooth homogeneous and heterogeneous bootstrap methods. Bootstrap simulations were used to estimate and correct the bias, and to construct confidence intervals for the efficiency measures. The simulation results show that the efficiency measures are subject to sampling variations. The adjusted measure reveals that high schools with residence services would have to give up less than 12.1% of their resources on average to be efficient. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis shows (a) that countries have different types of regulatory environments varying by the degree of state regulation of economic activity and the degree to which the state implements and enforces the existing regulations and (b) that this variation helps explain why some nations have more informal economic activity than others. The findings also suggest that (c) contrary to what the neoliberal orthodoxy has prescribed over the past few decades, decreasing the degree of state regulation in the economy will not necessarily formalize the economy. The degree of regulation seems to have a significant association with the size of the informal economy only in nations with effective law enforcement. Where this is not the case as in many developing nations-deregulatory policies are likely to be counter-productive in formalizing the economy.","Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Kus, B (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",bkus@princeton.edu,,,,,,,43,31,39,1,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The aim of this study was to develop accurate HS descriptions for severe chronic pain requiring intrathecal (IT) therapy and to derive utility weights that describe the health-related quality of life (HRQL) impact of chronic pain associated with malignant (MP) and non-malignant (NMP) aetiologies. Eight visual analogue scale pain index (VAS-PI) HSs were defined using ranges 0-40, 41-60, 61-80 and 81-100 applied to both MP and NMP. Additionally, eight HSs representing common adverse events associated with IT therapy were identified. The content and description of the HSs were ascertained by interviews with five United Kingdom clinical experts. In total, 16 HSs were compiled. These HS descriptions and HS questionnaires were administered to 102 members of the public, utilising a time trade off (TTO) approach to estimate utilities for the HSs. Participants generally were well matched to the general public in England and Wales, with some differences in mean age, race and education. A substantial decline in utility was observed with more severe VAS-PI values. The mean TTO utility values also decreased from mild pain to severe pain. Participants were able to differentiate between the side effects. The study shows a clear decrement in utility moving from different severity levels of severe chronic pain.","[Verdian, L.; Maclaine, G.] Eisai Global Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, London, England; [Eldabe, S.] James Cook Univ Hosp, Dept Pain & Anaesthesia, Middlesbrough, Cleveland, England; [Lloyd, A.; Dewilde, S.] Former United BioSource Corp, London, England; [Meguro, M.] United BioSource Corp, London, England",Eisai Co Ltd; James Cook University Hospital; United Biosource Corporation; United Biosource Corporation,"Verdian, L (通讯作者)，Eisai Global Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, London, England.",lara_verdian@eisai.net,,,,,,,36,9,9,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Our study found a more significant female dominance than in U.S. studies: even though boys gradually caught up during middle school, especially in Math and Science, and the gender achievement gap decreased over the distribution of test scores, girls outperformed boys throughout primary and middle school and in each quartile of the performance distribution. As well, girls had a more positive school experience than boys, and boys had a higher dropout rate by the end of middle school. Despite significant gender differences in various important characteristics that have explained the gentler achievement gap in the U.S., in our study, primary school test scores seemed to be the only significant source of the gender achievement gap at the end of middle school, indicating the importance of early intervention.

Initial emphasis on the role of government - through coordinated fiscal measures to stimulate the economy, cushion job losses and support vulnerable groups - was effective in averting another Great Depression, despite widening public deficits. However, a policy mistake was made by bailing out banks without reforming the dysfunctional financial system that triggered the crisis: concern over the financial markets' reaction to growing public indebtedness has shifted policy towards a more traditional, market-oriented approach focusing on fiscal consolidation, smaller government and weak social protection.

While previous research has focussed on the possibility that such anomalies relate to position in the sequence of choice tasks, our research reveals that the particular order of tasks matters. Using a novel experimental design that allows us to test our hypotheses using simple nonparametric statistics, we observe ordering anomalies in CE data similar to those recorded in the dichotomous choice contingent valuation literature. Those ordering effects operate in both price and commodity dimensions and are observed to compound over a series of choice tasks. Our findings cast serious doubt on the current practice of asking each respondent to undertake several choice tasks in a CE while treating each response as an independent observation on that individual's preferences.

One method that has proven successful for the authors is to connect theoretically sophisticated material with actual data. This enables students to see how the theory relates to the real world, allowing for a deeper understanding of both. The authors developed a simple and insightful empirical application of the Solow growth model that can be used in an undergraduate macroeconomics or economic growth course. The exercise uses a data set on perception of corruption levels by country to look at the relationship between corruption and the level and rate of growth of output per worker across 70 countries. The results not only allow students to see for themselves the impact that corruption has on gross domestic product per worker but also improve their understanding of the distinction between level effects and long-run growth effects.","[Elmslie, Bruce T.] Univ New Hampshire, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Tebaldi, Edinaldo] Bryant Univ, Smithfield, RI USA",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; Bryant University,"Elmslie, BT (通讯作者)，Univ New Hampshire, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",bte@cisunix.unh.edu; etebaldi@bryant.edu,"Tebaldi, Edinaldo/D-6065-2019","Tebaldi, Edinaldo/0000-0003-3670-3245",,,,,24,10,12,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0485,,,J ECON EDUC,J.

Finally, we explore a wide array of remuneration measures for crew and conclude that both seasonal and daily employment remuneration increased substantially for many crew in the post-rationalization fishery, while remuneration per unit of landings declined as a result of a combination of increased crew productivity and the necessity of paying for fishing quota in the new system.","[Abbott, Joshua K.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Garber-Yonts, Brian] NOAA Fisheries, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Wilen, James E.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Abbott, JK (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, POB 875502, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",Joshua.K.Abbott@asu.edu; brian.garber-yonts@noaa.gov; wilen@primal.ucdavis.edu,,,NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center,NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"The authors thank Ron Felthoven, Gunnar Knapp, Tim Fitzgerald, and participants at the 2009 Forum of the North American Association of Fisheries Economists and the PERC 2009 Workshop on Innovations in Property Rights for Fisheries Management for helpful comments.

We examine a number of scenarios about carbon prices. urban development rates, and potential future land transfers between forestry and agriculture to provide information about the potential effectiveness of policies to address climate change in the U.S. Because large areas of land can move between forestry and agricultural uses, we used the Forest and Agriculture Sector Optimization Model-Greenhouse Gases model to examine responses between sectors as part of GHG policy analysis. The model projects changes in land uses, has full carbon accounting for both forestry and agriculture, and can examine a broad range of adaptation and climate change mitigation options. Modeling results suggest that receipt of carbon-related payments by landowners in forestry and agriculture can have substantial impacts on future land use patterns, levels of terrestrial carbon sequestration, forest resource conditions, agricultural production trends, and bioenergy production.

Time poverty is thus understood as the lack of enough time for rest and leisure after accounting for the time that has to be spent working, whether in the labor market, doing domestic work, or performing other activities such as fetching water and wood. The study applies the concepts used in the traditional poverty literature to measure time poverty defined in this new way to analyze its determinants in Guinea from 2002 to 2003.

The recent strength of the Tunisian economy and historically low rates of inflation have sparked considerable debate among economists. Indeed, after 1986, econometric tests reject the hypothesis that capacity utilization rates can provide any information about changes in inflation. In order to better explain the recent behavior of inflation, some observers have raised the concept of a non-accelerating inflation capacity utilization rate (NAICU). In this study, we present a new methodology to estimate the NAICU. A simple structural vector autoregression, including consumer price index, capacity utilization rate, and the long-run real interest rate, is used to identify production capacity. Results show that production capacity is consistent with stable trend inflation. Using simple Phillips curves, out-of-sample forecast exercises show that the capacity utilization rate generated by the methodology presented in this paper seems to outperform the same result to autoregressive model.","Fac Econ & Management SFAX, Sfax, Tunisia",Universite de Sfax,"Kamel, H (通讯作者)，Fac Econ & Management SFAX, Sfax, Tunisia.",Kamel.Helali@fsegs.rnu.tn,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,2,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

This paper examines the impact of this collapse on one particular section of the financial markets that concerned with credit default swaps. This paper shows how and why the markets for these products expanded and why they were integral to the financial crash. The consequence of the crash was a huge loss of legitimacy for these markets. This paper examines the processes whereby this legitimacy is being reconstructed. In particular, it distinguishes between the re-establishment of pragmatic legitimacy, which is the primary concern of the market participants, and the re-establishment of broader political legitimacy, which concerns governments and regulators. It argues that these two forms of re-establishing legitimacy work in different ways and proceed at different rates. It explores the tensions to which this leads in terms of reconstructing the financial system.","Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Morgan, G (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",glenn.morgan@warwick.ac.uk,,,,,,,78,46,49,0,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Based on a synthesis of contributions from different fields of transnational governance, it is suggested that a perceived lack of fit between the regulators' legitimacy claims and the addressees' expectations, if expressed as protest and criticism by the latter, can lead transnational governance institutions to adjust to demands for more inclusiveness, expertise and procedural fairness. However, the rising level of expertise required from participants, stake-holders and publics to meet normative criteria for greater participation and procedural fairness creates new and yet unresolved problems.","Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Cologne, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Quack, S (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Cologne, Germany.",quack@mpifg.de,,,,,,,41,67,73,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Traditionally. a linear relation between knowledge production and application was postulated which would lead, with more and better science, to better policies. Empirical studies in Science and Technology studies have essentially demolished this idea. However, it is still powerful, not least among practitioners working in fields where decision making is based on large doses of expert knowledge. Based on conceptual work in the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) I shall examine two cases of global environmental governance, ozone layer protection and global climate change. I will argue that hybridization and purification are important for two major forms of scientific expertise. One is delivered though scientific advocacy (by individual scientists or groups of scientists), the other through expert committees, i.e. institutionalized forms of collecting and communicating expertise to decision makers. Based on this analysis lessons will be drawn, also with regard to the stalling efforts at establishing an international forestry regime. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In response, WTO members are negotiating to clarify and improve the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. Yet significant legal challenges constrain this ongoing effort because fisheries conservation and management matters are often addressed by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, instruments of the Food and Agriculture Organization, and other legal regimes to which some WTO members have not consented. This article analyses modes of learning and information exchange within the WTO regime, and compares the proposed use of standards, benchmarks, and peer review in the draft fisheries subsidies rules with existing arrangements between the WTO and organizations such as the OECD and product standard-setting bodies. It argues that novel deliberative strategies of regime interaction are more important in resolving the challenges posed by international law's fragmentation than adherence to strict mandates or legal hierarchies.","Univ Melbourne, Sch Law, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Young, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Sch Law, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",m.young@unimelb.edu.au,,"Young, Margaret/0000-0002-3033-5990",,,,,14,39,41,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2009,8.0,4,,,,,477.0,515,,10.1017/S1474745609990140,0.0,,,39,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,507TG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000270877200001,0

There are information asymmetries over the actions chosen by administrators. Because non-profit constraints limit the financial stake of trustees there may be insufficient monitoring of administrators and, consequentially, shirking. It is conceivable that faculty will serve as delegated monitors given the proper incentives. Faculty monitoring will most likely benefit a university when: (1) monitoring costs are low and (2) administrators cannot impose significant punishment costs on faculty. The practices of organized faculty participation in governance and tenure naturally achieve such ends. Empirical evidence from a sample of colleges and universities in the United States supports the hypothesis that features of a faculty's employment have significant effects on a university's financial performance.

Decreasing fertility rates threaten economic growth, while government budgets have to accommodate more pension and health services, as the number of adults of working age who contribute to older generations' pensions diminishes. In addressing the dilemma of low fertility in Europe, we are inevitably confronted with a combination of institutional and human factors: while governments can attempt to put into place institutions and policies that will encourage childbirth (such as Subsidies for children, family leave policies, and day care facilities), population reproduction is fundamentally a micro-level decision. The crux of the matter is that women and men must choose to have children; no number of institutional configurations will by themselves result in the birth of babies. Rather, it is the combination of systems of welfare provision, people's ability to provide for their well-being, and the choice of women and men to conceive children, that will likely result in increased fertility rates across Europe. This article examines several factors that influence the makeup of state, market, and family decisions, surveying literature in the field of work and family reconciliation and fertility decisions. The article concludes by highlighting several issues of societal polarization that are related to family policy and indicates avenues for future research on fertility and government policies.","Univ N Carolina, Dept Polit Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Vos, AE (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Polit Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA.",avos@unc.edu,,,,,,,50,19,22,1,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The article finds that neither trade nor financial compensation will do much to resolve the prominent criticisms of trade retaliation while also finding both options would add several uncertainties to the system and, far from increasing compliance with the rulings and recommendations of the DSB, could in fact increase the instances of noncompliance.","Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Mercurio, B (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",b.mercurio@cuhk.edu.hk,"Mercurio, Bryan/AAH-8011-2021","Mercurio, Bryan/0000-0002-1192-1791",,,,,41,18,18,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2009,8.0,2,,,,,315.0,338,,10.1017/S1474745609004273,0.0,,,24,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,449YE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000266366200002,0

The incidence of teacher absences is regressive: when schools are ranked by the fraction of students receiving free or reduced price lunches, teachers in the lowest income quartile average almost one extra sick day per school year than teachers in the highest income quartile, and schools with persistently high rates of teacher absence were much more likely to serve low-income than high-income students. In regression models incorporating teacher fixed effects, absences are associated with lower student achievement in elementary grades. Finally, we present evidence that the demand for discretionary absences is price elastic. Our estimates suggest that a policy intervention that simultaneously raises teacher base salaries and broadens financial penalties for absences could both raise teachers' expected incomes and lower districts' expected costs.","[Clotfelter, Charles T.; Ladd, Helen F.; Vigdor, Jacob L.] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Clotfelter, CT (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Box 90245, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",charles.clotfelter@duke.edu; hladd@duke.edu; jacob.vigdor@duke.edu,,,,,,,21,34,86,0,3,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",1557-3060,,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

However, the scale taken today by studies and research on such dynamics creates a new challenge for futurists and environmental scientists, as many set patterns of thought or research in both communities will have to be re-examined. For futurists, it will be necessary to go beyond attempts to standardize Futures Studies methods. The alternative is to promote theoretical and methodological reflexion within the rapidly expanding life-size (and not workshop size) fora of scholarly and policy debate. It will also mean overcoming the regime of metonymical hustle whereby once and again, a new school of thought tries to redefine the entire field and reduce it to its own purpose, concepts and toolkit. This paper proposes an open framework as a guide for each study on futures to make explicit the specific and fundamental choices it rests on. It is meant as an invitation to step back and consider new beginnings in a workspace open to the widest possible diversity and scale of approaches, as will be necessary if studies on futures are to rise to the challenges of research for sustainable development.

I show that this is not a valid instrument since it is endogenous to private school competition and suggest using instead the local share of Catholics in the population in 1890 and its squared term. These instruments are very strong and are also exogenous to both student achievements and private school competition. I further show that using the current Catholic share as an instrument results in seriously flawed estimates of the effect of private school competition on math test scores and on educational attainment, to the extent that significant positive effects of private school competition on these outcome measures do not hold when the historical Catholic share in 1890 is used as an alternative instrument.

Geriatric nursing home patients are used as a case. These care recipients cannot enforce their legal right to quality service; their quality-effective demand is low. Formal economic analyses often characterize the weak position of the care recipient as an information asymmetry problem. An additional obstacle, however, is the recipient's inability to safeguard her personal interest due to physical, mental, or social incapacities; that is, limited consumer sovereignty. Incapacitated individuals cannot enforce quality even when quality information is available. This creates a fundamental incentive problem in the monitoring of quality. They also depend on services that are complex and non-verifiable, making external monitoring difficult.

The system consisted of aluminum housing, a 3CCD progressive scan digital color camera, and four halogen lamps for illumination. The housing was built to hold the lamps and the camera for image acquisition, and also to keep the sunlight from going in the conveyor belt when images are acquired. With the system, images were acquired from a testing bench as well as from a commercial canopy shake and catch harvester. The images were divided into calibration and validation sets. For accurate yield estimation, an algorithm was developed to identify the citrus fruit in the images. The colors of fruit and background pixels in the calibration images were investigated in different color spaces (RGB, HSI, YIQ, and YCbCr) and threshold values were determined to separate fruit from background. Simple image processing steps were implemented to obtain a clean binary image. A marker-controlled watershed method was used to separate clusters of fruit. The number of fruit, area, and diameter were calculated and compared with the actual number of fruit. The R-2 value between the actual number of fruit and the number of fruit counted by the algorithm was 0.956 for the test bench testing and 0.642 for the harvester testing. When fruit diameter measured from calibration images was used, the R-2 value between the actual number of fruit and the number of fruit estimated by the fruit diameter was 0.874 for the test bench testing and 0.906 for the harvester testing.","[Lee, Won Suk; Chinchuluun, R.] Univ Florida, IFAS, Agr & Biol Engn Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Ehsani, R.] Univ Florida, Agr & Biol Engn Dept, Citrus Res & Educ Ctr, IFAS, Lake Alfred, FL USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Lee, WS (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, IFAS, Agr & Biol Engn Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",,"Lee, Won Suk/A-9824-2013","Lee, Won Suk/0000-0002-9420-4789",State of Florida's Emerging Citrus Industry Technologies,State of Florida's Emerging Citrus Industry Technologies,"Thanks to the State of Floridas Emerging Citrus Industry Technologies for funding; Drs.

In a commercial peat pot experiment under green house conditions in 2007, lettuce plants were exposed to the possible causes of tipburn, i.e., salinity (3.0 dS m(-1)), late N application and high night temperature during head formation. The effect of two improvement strategies, i.e., inoculation of root rhizosphere with Bacillus subtilis FZB24 and supplemental Ca foliar sprays were evaluated. Results showed that high night temperature ranked first in reducing total yield (g/head) followed by salinity and late N application. However, dry matter percentage was not altered by any of the studied stress treatments. Salinity increased rate of tipburn most, followed by high night temperature and late N application, had the least effect compared to control (non-stressed plants). NO3 and Ca contents were decreased by salinity, while N was increased by high night temperature and late N application. Both supplemental Ca and inoculation with Bacillus subtilis showed a positive effect in increasing Ca content in outer leaves of the saline-stressed plants and control treatments.

Logistic regression models developed to assess urbanization's effect on forestland for the mid-Atlantic and southern states found that population density was the best predictor of reduced commercial harvest opportunity. We applied similar methodologies in central New York to assess urbanization's impact on sustained yield management. We surveyed professional foresters in a five-county area and asked them to rate the potential for sustained yield management by township. We utilized those expert opinions to develop a logistic regression model that predicted the probability of sustained yield management in central New York while exploring the factors that influence sustained yield management. We found that road density was the primary variable influencing the likelihood of sustained yield management in central New York. Population density, which is highly correlated with road density, also proved to be a strong determinant of sustained yield management The results suggest that the potential for sustained yield management approaches 10% at a road density of 3 mi/mi(2), 50% at 2.5 mi/mi(2), and 90% at 2 mi/mi(2). The corresponding figures for population density were 150 people per square mile (ppsm), 75 ppsm and 25 ppsm, respectively. In addition, we determined that the probability of sustained yield management approaches 100% for a property that is approximately 30 acres and drops to 50% fora parcel that is between 15 and 20 acres. This study provides resource managers and land use planners a guide in which to effectively gauge the cumulative effect of urbanization on the forest resource in central New York. Unlike other regions of the United States. central New York's growth pattern is characterized by stagnant population growth (declining in some places) combined with continued urbanization and lowdensity sprawl. Because growth patterns vary regionally, different indicators may be needed to accurately assess the urbanizing forested landscape across the United States. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We find no statistically significant or economically significant impacts of weekly recess or PE time on student learning for kindergarteners through fifth graders. For example, in kindergarten, adding an hour a week of recess reduces the average test score gain in reading by a statistically insignificant 0.01 standard deviations. An additional 49 min per week of PE in kindergarten improves reading test score gains by a statistically insignificant 0.05 standard deviations.

I then show that when a nation's average test scores and average schooling attainment are included in a national income model, both measures explain income differences, but schooling attainment has greater statistical significance. The high correlation between a nation's average schooling attainment, cumulative investment in schooling, and average tests scores indicates that average schooling attainment implicitly measures the quality as well as the quantity of schooling.

The strong import competition created by the rapid opening of China's domestic market and the continued state involvement in its industry could conceivably generate domestic pressure on the Chinese government to use AD measures intensively and possibly illegally. Moreover, since its exports are a primary global target of AD actions, China might be expected to retaliate by levying questionable AD measures on imports. Despite factors conducive to a more protectionist bias and possible non-compliance, I argue that China is not only complying with AD rules but also demonstrating domestic restraint, and to a certain extent, a pro-liberalization interpretation of the rules. This policy along with, China's Doha Round negotiating proposals on AD suggests what is characterized in this article as a compliance-plus policy. The fact that China has chosen to pursue such a policy is not trivial, taking into account the more protectionist paths taken by other key WTO members. On a broader level, this case study aims at contributing to the contemporary debate regarding China's changing role in the global arena. By complying with WTO rules, China is demonstrating that it is accepting, following, and becoming increasingly vested in their maintenance.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Int Relat, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Harpaz, MD (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Int Relat, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",marcia_h@netvi-sion.net.il,,,,,,,89,2,2,0,16,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The implementation of WorkChoices legislation in 2006 posed a further challenge to Victorian low-paid workers. Our research found that the impact of WorkChoices on the Victorian low-paid has been largely insidious, surfacing primarily as an increased wage-effort ratio, with people working more unpaid hours and at an increased pace. The implications of this are that these hidden effects are more likely to linger, even with the replacement of WorkChoices with the Fair Work Act, 2009.

As there is currently no cure for patients with multiple myeloma, primary objectives of treatment are to extend survival at the best possible quality of life. In this study, physicians' beliefs about patients' preferences regarding the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) were explored in a direct assessment and a discrete choice experiment (DCE), and were compared to the previously explored patients' views. How much do physicians know about their patients' preferences? In a preceding study with German multiple myeloma patients, relevant attributes of an ideal multiple myeloma treatment were collected by reviewing the literature and by conducting a qualitative study with focus groups. The attributes were analyzed using both a direct measurement (16 items on a five-point Likert scale) and a DCE (eight pairs with eight characteristics). For the present study, 30 German physicians reviewed the treatment attributes from the previous study for completeness. A total of 243 physicians participated in the study (including the 30 participants in the pre-test). The direct assessment and the DCE covered four major preference dimensions that both the literature review and the focus groups revealed: Aspects of medical effectiveness (including prolonged life expectancy, effectiveness and long duration of effect), side effects, quality of life (including social, physical and emotional quality of life) and flexibility (breaks in therapy and further treatment options). In the direct measurement of patients' preferences, physicians rated physical quality of life (specified as reduced mobility or good mobility), rare side effects and effectiveness aspects (duration of effect, maximal prolonged life expectancy and effectiveness) as the most important attributes from the patients' perspective, followed by emotional quality of life (specified as Not always think of the disease) and therapy-free intervals. Especially further treatment options and dosage were more important to patients than physicians believed. In this case, the physicians had quite obviously underestimated the importance of these attributes from the perspective of those affected. Physicians ranked prolonged life expectancy as relatively the most important and significantly more important than all other treatment attributes. Further treatment options were the second most important attribute and significant compared to the attributes breaks in therapy and physical quality of life, whereas the patients ordered these two attributes in reverse order. Similarly, the patients gave the opposite relative importance to the next two priorities: self-application of treatment and emotional quality of life. Asking patients or physicians about the multiple myeloma patients' treatment preferences, the combination of direct assessment and DCE proves to be a valid survey technique. Over a broad range of treatment attributes, the physicians' perceptions of preferences were very close to those of multiple myeloma patients. Both the direct assessment of importance in order to rank the patient perceptions and the DCE provide important insights into the preference structure of patients with multiple myeloma. The findings can subsequently be used as a basis for tailoring health care services for multiple myeloma patients in reference to their preferences.","[Muehlbacher, Axel C.] Hsch Neubrandenburg, Inst Gesundheitsokonomie & Medizinmanagement IGM, D-17033 Neubrandenburg, Germany; [Nuebling, Matthias] GEB mbH, Emprir Consulting Gesell Empir Beratung, D-79017 Freiburg, Germany",,"Mühlbacher, AC (通讯作者)，Hsch Neubrandenburg, Inst Gesundheitsokonomie & Medizinmanagement IGM, Brodaer Str 2, D-17033 Neubrandenburg, Germany.",muehlbacher@hs-nb.de; nuebling@empirische-beratung.de,"Mühlbacher, Axel/AAZ-6577-2020","Mühlbacher, Axel/0000-0003-4402-9211",,,,,19,54,58,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Reality Check, as the exercises were called, were a daylong set of activities using tools that encouraged stakeholder participation to develop scenarios focused on long-term regional sustainability. The paper draws upon planning theory, participant reactions, media reports, post-exercise outcomes and author's experiences of shaping the process. It illustrates how the model was adapted to multiple scales and contexts, and variations in desired technical complexity. The paper concludes that such processes have an inherent value in capturing the issues of the future and in creating awareness and knowledge. It argues that certain considerations such as early strategic engagement of stakeholders, flexibility of technical tools and diversity among organizers, all played a role in enhancing the dialogue. Furthermore, it suggests that when timed with favorable external conditions and designed within suitable institutional frameworks, they have the potential to provide a foundation from which tangible regional benefits can be realized.

Here we consider a new class, the 'feral'; which are expectations that things might be made worse by risk-based actions. The type case is the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island, where operatives assumed that what was unfolding was of a sort described in their manual, and discovered too late that responses based on that assumption were making the situation worse. In this paper we review the idea of 'feral' and how it applies to futures, and discuss the different modes of engagement (or non-engagement) with feral futures. To make feral futures manageable, we suggest two ideas from other spheres of activity. Zen is a practice and philosophy which enables us to drop our preconceptions and thereby to respond to emerging, unprecedented situations.

Overall, our results suggests that need is not being met on the extensive margin and that enrollment levels actually fall with the introduction of targeted aid. However, the enrollments of more-needy students tend to fall less and students matriculating to aid-innovating institutions tend to have more financial need after the introduction of income-targeted aid. This suggests that along the intensive margin income-targeted aid may still be benefiting the most needy. We also find that institutions that introduce income-targeted aid subsequently enroll more-geographically distant students, suggestive of improved matching.

J,"Hauge, KH",,,,"Hauge, Kjellrun Hiis",,,Uncertainty and hyper-precision in fisheries science and policy,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TROPHIC CASCADES; TRANSPORT; ECOSYSTEM; ADVICE,"This essay discusses various uncertainty aspects of advice on fish quotas in the North-East Atlantic provided by ICES (the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea). A key conclusion is that while the epistemic uncertainties may be considerable, the advisory framework does not account for these, but sets considerable limitations on what issues, expertise and knowledge is relevant for quota advice. The uncertainty is treated as if it were quantifiable, i.e. a technical problem without epistemic uncertainty. However, since estimates and predictions of stock states are presented with hyper-precision, not even the technical uncertainty is reflected adequately. The inadequate handling of uncertainty is value-laden as the risks and the risk bearers change with different choices of theoretical models. Yet, the ICES framework for quota advice advocates a strict division between science and policy. ICES's claim of producing unbiased advice and the managers' demand for scientific advice without interference with policy can be regarded as attempts to defend a clear-cut division. Further, the hyper-precision can be seen as a symptom of a sub-optimal management system and can be understood as an attempt to deny that the situation is one of post-normal science.

Employment-promotion policies directed toward low-income mothers since the late 1980s have successfully increased their time in the labor force. However, low wages and insufficient employer-based benefits often leave employed single mothers with inadequate material resources to support families and less time to care for their children. The lack of consideration given to the value of poor women's time in both the administration and benefit levels of antipoverty government support, as well as the measures used to calculate poverty, place more binds on poor and low-income mothers' time. Ignoring these binds causes researchers and policymakers to overestimate single mothers' well-being and reduces the effectiveness of the policies.","Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02139 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston,"Albelda, R (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, 100 Morrissey Blvd, Boston, MA 02139 USA.",randy.albelda@umb.edu,,,,,,,77,23,35,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,,,FEM ECON,Fem.

As part of this study, we administered an on-site non-market valuation survey of beach visitors, in which observed and contingent trips to the beach were used to estimate the potential welfare benefits of the restored wetlands. The data were analyzed using three versions of the multivariate Poisson-lognormal (MPLN) model, a random effects count data model. We conclude version one, with flexible covariance structure and vehicle costs of $0.25 per mile, is the preferred version and use it to estimate an average annual willingness to pay (WTP) of $166 to construct wetlands and improve water quality.

However, there is a general lack of understanding about how to describe and assess the complex and dynamic nature of emergency management tasks and how knowledge integration help managers improve emergency management task performance. This paper describes a research project that aims at (1) developing the concepts of complexity of emergency management tasks and (2) testing the mediating role of knowledge sharing and knowledge integration between emergency management task characteristics and performance. The overall research agenda, approaches, challenges and the advantages of utilizing a virtual Emergency Operations Center (vEOC) are discussed. The complexity aspect of emergency management tasks can be analyzed from two broad perspectives: structural complexity and dynamic complexity. Structural complexity, which refers to the inherent complexity of the task, consists of two dimensions: component complexity and interactive complexity. Dynamic complexity refers to aspects of task complexity that incorporate the decision-maker and it consists of three dimensions: task non-routineness, task difficulty, and task significance. In this research, we develop and test a research model that focuses on the mediating and/or moderating role of knowledge integration and knowledge sharing. In this article we focus on two aspects of the knowledge sharing strategy: one that refers to the purpose for knowledge sharing (exploration vs. exploitation) and the second that refers to the mechanism used for knowledge sharing (personal interactions vs. written documents). Our observations are drawn from a multi-year multi-method collaborative research project between Florida International University and the Miami-Dade EOC in Florida. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected through interviews, field observations, participations in field training and practice drills, and surveys.Our observations indicated that, while emergency management tasks are highly complex, the Miami-Dade EOC is successful in effectively and efficiently responding to emergency situations. The EOC's success can be largely attributed to its personnel's utilizations of appropriate knowledge sharing strategies according to the complexity nature of the emergency management tasks.","[Becerra-Fernandez, Irma; Xia, Weidong; Gudi, Arvind; Rocha, Jose; Meadey, Gregory; Prietula, Michael; Nikolai, Cynthia] Florida Int Univ, Notre Dame, IN USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University,,becferi@fiu.edu,,,,,,,11,2,2,1,5,"EDITURA UNIV TRANSILVANIA BRASOV, ROMANIA",BRASOV,"B DUL IULIU MANIU 41A, BRASOV, 500091, ROMANIA",2502-0226,2558-9652,978-973-598-940-8,PR INT C BUS EXCELL,,,2011,,,,,,,1.0,6,,,,,,6,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEH82,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000316634500001,0

This study analyzes whether this change in the labor force participation rate of Spanish women has substantially modified strategies for meeting household needs. Using the 2002-3 Spanish Time Use Survey, this study examines the total (paid and unpaid) work time devoted to satisfying the direct care needs of individuals and the determinants of women's and men's participation in housework. These findings are compared with the hypotheses advanced in the literature. The results show that the new social conditions have only slightly modified men's behavior, but that the care strategies women adopt have changed substantially. Although still responsible for care, women now externalize part of this commitment either via the market if their wages permit or by seeking help inside the family. The study concludes by discussing the public policy implications of the findings.","[Carrasco, Cristina] Univ Barcelona, Dept Teoria Econ, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Dominguez, Marius] Univ Barcelona, Dept Sociol & Anal Org, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona,"Carrasco, C (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Teoria Econ, Av Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",cristinacarrasco@ub.edu; mariusdominguez@ub.edu,"Dominguez Amoros, Marius/D-1452-2015","Dominguez Amoros, Marius/0000-0003-2225-4987",,,,,45,21,22,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The Heckman procedure was used in stage three to remove the possible bias in the parameter estimates brought about by zero consumption. The magnitude of both price and income elasticities varies across different fish types and income quartile groups, indicating the relevance of estimation specific to fish types and quartiles. Except for assorted small fish, the other seven fish types included in the study were found to have positive income elasticity for all income levels.

Cooperatives are expected to contribute 5% of the GDP in 2013 and 10% by 2020. However, in 2008, cooperatives contributed just 1% of the GDP. The majority of cooperatives are small and their turnover is less than RM200,000 per annum. One of the possible reasons for their small turnover is their inability to manage their supply chains. This study will analyze the elements of agricultural cooperative supply chain management and its influence on performance. The study will explore the influence of individuals, suppliers, quality, logistics and governance on supply chain performance. Performance is evaluated using four measures: customer satisfaction, board satisfaction, members' satisfaction and financial performance. A conceptual model is examined with data collected from 252 agricultural cooperatives in Malaysia. The results indicate that quality, technology and logistics have a positive significant impact on customer satisfaction, board satisfaction and cooperative members' satisfaction and financial performance.","[Idris, N.; Arshad, F.

In this article, we investigate the use of fixed price contracts for Norwegian salmon exports to France based on all export transactions between the two countries. Our analysis shows that almost 25% of these exports were traded using fixed price contracts and contract prices were renegotiated at different intervals, including as infrequently as once a year. Some contracts allow the contracting parties to adjust contract prices when the export price moves significantly. Benchmark analysis, which shows a marginal 0.5% difference between average unit revenue for the year from spot sales relative to contract sales, indicates that contracts primarily change revenue time profiles. The use of contracts creates a wedge between salmon export prices and spot prices in periods of price volatility which in turn reduces price transmission.","[Larsen, Thomas A.] Univ Tromso, Sch Business, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Asche, Frank] Univ Stavanger, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; Universitetet i Stavanger,"Larsen, TA (通讯作者)，Univ Tromso, Sch Business, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",thomas.a.larsen@uit.no; frank.asche@uis.no,"Asche, Frank/AAG-9920-2020","Asche, Frank/0000-0002-1540-9728",Norwegian Research Council,Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"The authors thank an anonymous reviewer, Ragnar Tveteras, and Oystein Myrland for helpful comments.

They also offer tourist attractions in shape of many kilometers of routes in the most beautiful nature spots of our country. These tasks, however, should be properly financed. Till the end of 2010, the state budget covered the financial requirements to a small extent - only 10-12%. The remaining amount was financed from non-budget means and revenues of auxiliary enterprises. The reform of public finance deprived national parks of revenues generated by their auxiliary enterprises, decreasing their budgets below the minimum level. New regulations do not guarantee maintaining the current level of financing parks. We should remember that the tasks assigned to parks have not changed. Maybe another system of financing could help parks overcome these difficulties. In September 2010, the government developed a project of amending the Act on Nature Protection, introducing the regulation stipulating that a national park will become a so-called state legal person, which will result in ability to retain revenues and to allocate them for statutory purposes. Any disturbances in realization of tasks assigned to national parks may negatively influence various spheres of economic and social life.","[Pater, Beata] Cracow Univ Econ, PhD Program, Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Pater, B (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, PhD Program, Krakow, Poland.",,"Pater, Beata/X-3127-2018","Pater, Beata/0000-0003-4209-241X",,,,,10,0,0,0,1,WYZSZA SZKOLA BIZNESUNATL-LOUIS UNIV,NOWY SACZ,"ZIELONA 27, NOWY SACZ, 33-300, POLAND",2543-540X,2543-5388,978-83-88421-79-2,BUS NON-PROFIT ORGAN,,,2011,10.0,,,,,,430.0,440,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE4CM,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000371503100030,0

The Panzar and Rosse (1987) model is implemented on bank-level data. In particular, the unscaled revenue equation is employed to assess market structure. Country-specific empirical results suggest a wide variation in the competitive conditions of the banking systems in the sampled countries. Nineteen banking systems are characterized as monopolistically competitive, nine as monopolies or perfectly colluding oligopolies, and two as perfectly competitive over the sample period. This study also investigates whether competition conditions changed over the sample period, using 2001 as an endogenously determined break year. The empirical evidence reveals that banking systems became less competitive after that time.","Dokuz Eylul Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Business, TR-35210 Alsancak, Turkey",Dokuz Eylul University,"Kasman, A (通讯作者)，Dokuz Eylul Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Business, TR-35210 Alsancak, Turkey.",adnan.kasman@deu.edu.tr,"Kasman, Adnan/ABF-6942-2020","Kasman, Adnan/0000-0001-9361-982X",,,,,30,13,14,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Most studies that point to a negative correlation between hours of television watching and cognitive outcomes, fail to establish causality. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) we study young children between 5 and 10 years of age during late 1990s and early 2000s. We find strong evidence of negative correlations between hours of television watched and cognitive test scores. However, once parent's characteristics and unobserved child characteristics are taken into account these correlations go away. We find that hours of television viewed per se do not have any measurable impact on children's test scores. Our results are robust to different model specifications and instrumental variable estimates. We conclude that despite the conventional wisdom and the ongoing populist movement, proactive policies to reduce children's television exposure are not likely to improve children's cognitive development and academic performance.

Using longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) for the period 1984-2006, we estimate life satisfaction equations using a fixed-effects model for working-age males (aged 21-58). The results show that disability has a significant negative effect on life satisfaction, but, in time, hedonic adaptation will return disabled males to life satisfaction levels registered by those who have not become disabled. These findings contribute to supporting the idea within psychology literature that individuals bounce back from painful events or adversities (such as the onset of disability) to achieve initial life satisfaction scores.","Univ Malaga, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Aplicada Estruct Econ, E-29071 Malaga, Spain",Universidad de Malaga,"Pagán-Rodríguez, R (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Aplicada Estruct Econ, Plaza El Ejido S-N, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.",rpr@uma.es,"Pagan, Ricardo/AAF-4906-2020","Pagan Rodriguez, Ricardo Braulio/0000-0002-7391-5127",,,,,55,36,42,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

More specifically, an increase in innovation effectiveness lowers the optimal emissions cap, and leads to relaxed price controls unless the slope of the marginal environmental damage curve is small. Because of the decrease in the emissions cap, innovation in abatement technologies can lead to a higher expected carbon price, so as to provide sufficient incentives for private R&D investments. The expected carbon price decreases once innovative technologies are widely used. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This policy generated a large discontinuity in the rate of post-midterm attendance at the median of the midterm score. We estimate that near the policy threshold, the post-midterm attendance rate was 36 percentage points higher for those students facing compulsory attendance. The discontinuous attendance policy is also associated with a significant difference in performance on the final exam. We estimate that a 10 percentage point increase in a student's overall attendance rate results in a 0.17 standard deviation increase in the final exam score without adversely affecting performance on other classes taken concurrently.

This paper examines economic development and growth in Turkish provinces. It first discusses local government reforms throughout the history of Turkey with the focus on recent reform efforts. It then empirically analyzes the effects of recent decentralization reforms in Turkish provinces using cross-sectional and panel data approaches as well as spatial econometrics. The panel data set consists of sixty-seven provinces from 1976 to 2001. Using the number of local governments per capita and number of local governments per square kilometer of land to indicate decentralization, the analysis examines whether variations in local decentralization across these provinces and across time have significantly affected economic development and growth in those provinces. The findings suggest a weak negative economic effect of decentralization through a number of municipalities per capita. However, the findings do not show any significant effect from the creation of new provinces by separation from the existing ones.","[Tosun, Mehmet Serkan] Univ Nevada, Coll Business, Dept Econ, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Yilmaz, Serdar] World Bank, Social Dev Dept, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; The World Bank,"Tosun, MS (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Coll Business, Dept Econ, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",tosun@unr.edu; syilmaz@worldbank.org,"Yilmaz, Serdar/E-9988-2015","Yilmaz, Serdar/0000-0003-4105-709X",,,,,33,9,11,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The paper reviews developments in this, particularly as regards potential crediting for reduced forest degradation in places such as the Sahel, given that degradation in the tropical dry forests and savanna woodlands is a considerable source of carbon dioxide emissions. It then presents field data from sites in Guinea Bissau, Mali and Senegal where the Kyoto: Think Global Act Local project has been working for a number of years. In these sites, the local communities had been managing their forests under a variety of different programmes before KTGAL started. The purpose of KTGAL was to record the carbon outcomes of typical community forest management regimes, and to assess whether local communities were capable of making carbon stock measurements themselves. The results indicate that carbon savings range from 5 to 14 tons carbon dioxide per hectare, if both avoided degradation and increased biomass due to forest enhancement are included. They also show that communities can be trained relatively easily to make stock (and thus carbon) assessments, at a much lower cost than employing professional forest surveyors. It is not clear yet whether both reduced degradation and enhanced stock will be rewarded under REDD, nor is it sure how much of the financial reward might potentially be claimed by the communities, but even if only 10% of the financial value of the carbon were to filter back to the communities, this would still represent a considerable incentive for participation.

In this article, the authors illustrate the generality of monotone comparative statics relative to the implicit function approach. For example, to sign the effect of a discrete policy shift on a choice variable, the marginal returns will increase with the policy parameter.

For this purpose, a total of 96 villages are selected fully covering two counties in the Bartin province located in the Western Black Sea Region of Turkey, which is among the provinces with the lowest per capita income and the highest share of village population. 36 variables which characterise the level of development in villages are developed. These variables are measuring environmental, economic and socio-cultural dimensions and the relationships among them. Principal component and regression analyses are applied determining that there are 12 factors affecting development of the villages. These are (1) geographical location, (2) size of a village, (3) productivity of land, (4) type of land use, (5) active population. (6) poplar production areas, (7) proximity to a river, (8) housing comfort, (9) characteristics of drinking water, (10) productive fruit areas, (11) cooperativization and (12) social infrastructure investments. Based on these 12 factors, a development index (DI) is developed consisting of the 12 variables with the highest factor loading in each derived factor. Villages are divided into three groups based on (1) the DI values and (2) 36 variables used in a discriminant analysis, showing that the proposed DI is a reliable index to measure variation in development. According to these results, development strategies for each village group are put forth. Subsequently, the methodology developed in this paper can be used to monitor village development and to assist in effective use of resources for sustainable forestry and development in Turkey.

In fact, The increase labor cost-abiding businesses is very limited, and the increase labor cost of not law-abiding enterprises is not more than 2.44% of the total cost which will not bring too much pressure to the businesses.","[He Qin] Beijing Union Univ, Sch Management, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China",Beijing Union University,,ldtheqin@buu.edu.cn,,,,,,,12,1,1,0,9,ST PLUM-BLOSSOM PRESS PTY LTD,MELBOURNE,"LEVEL 5-11 QUEENS RD,, MELBOURNE, VC 3004, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-646-54629-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,394.0,402,,,,,,9,Economics; Industrial Relations & Labor,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYS99,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300067800062,0

The majority of the previous studies on this subject have relied mainly on a bivariate causality framework, and may therefore suffer from the omission of variable bias. The current study addresses this shortcoming by including savings as an intermittent variable in the finance-growth causality, thereby creating a simple trivariate causality framework Using cointegration and error-correction mechanism, the study finds a distinct unidirectional causal flow from economic growth to bank-based financial development. In addition, the study finds a unidirectional causality from savings to bank-based financial development and a prima-facie bidirectional causality between savings and economic growth. The study, therefore, concludes that growth matters for financial development in Lesotho. The study reiterates that the positive role of financial development in economic growth has been largely oversold by the proponents of the supply-leading hypothesis. Other results show that there is a unidirectional causal flow from savings to financial development and a prima-facie bidirectional relationship between savings and economic growth.","Univ S Africa UNISA, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Odhiambo, NM (通讯作者)，Univ S Africa UNISA, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa.",nmbaya99@yahoo.com,,"Odhiambo, Nicholas .M./0000-0003-4988-0259",Organisation for Social Science Research in Eastern and Southern Africa (OSSREA),Organisation for Social Science Research in Eastern and Southern Africa (OSSREA),The author wishes to acknowledge financial support from the Organisation for Social Science Research in Eastern and Southern Africa (OSSREA).

In particular, we test the hypothesis that the commercial banks with low risk levels prefer to issue subordinated debts more than high-risk banks do, and we reject the hypothesis. We conclude that the application of subordinated debt is not a mature channel for providing market discipline for commercial banks in Taiwan.

We find that whether or not trade has a beneficial effect on the environment varies depending on the pollutant and the country. Trade is found to benefit the environment in OECD countries.

Drawing upon social constructivist science studies and public sphere theories in international relations, the paper traces the communicative contexts in which state actors have struggled to bring meaning to the sink concept and hereby translated the production and validation of knowledge claims into political authority. In particular focus are instances of. epistemic chaos when the lack of consensual knowledge and shared normative commitments has forced states to publicly interpret and justify what counts as credible carbon cycle expertise and good terrestrial carbon management. The empirical tracing of such justificatory arguments begins at the third conference of the parties (COP3) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Kyoto in 1997, and ends at COP 10 in Buenos Aires in 2004. Although scientific expertise emerges a central avenue for political bargaining in this negotiation process, the paper does not interpret expert politics as a mere reflection of material power and dominant state interests. Rather. when approaching authoritative knowledge as a product of social relations, the course and outcome of global climate governance appear more inclusive and open-ended. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The paper explains the historic industrial epocils that have led to the demographic layering and cultural division of labor, the development Of tourism from its beginnings in the 1950s, and to present-day concerns about over-development and migration behind the setting up of a National Tourism Council (NTC) in 2001. The basic issues confronted by the NTC were set within the overarching question of how far and how fast tourism in Aruba could or should expand. Following oil from three exploratory scenarios, the Framework prepared by the authors makes proposals for expansion of tourism in distinctive Culture regions and corresponding tourism products over the next two generations of Arubans at a pace that matches emerging needs, but below the carrying capacity of the Island.

While the government has historically promoted the development of forest plantations through economic incentives, state involvement with natural forests has focused on regulation. Over 1 million km(2) in the Legal Amazon have been identified as suitable for the production of forest goods and services and other resource-based activities (Verissimo et al., 2000. p. 6). Only recently, however. has the state taken action to harness the potential this vast public resource holds for promoting sustainable development. In March 2006, the Public Forest Management Law was passed by the government of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. A key feature of this law is a framework for creating forest concessions on public lands. With the goal of establishing up to 13 million ha of forest concessions by the end of the decade, such an initiative for the development of the forest sector is unprecedented in Brazilian history, marking the state's recognition of the Amazon's vocation as one of forest-based development. A static computable general equilibrium (CCE) model is developed to evaluate the short-run socio-economic and environmental implications of implementing forest concessions in the Brazilian Amazon. Results indicate that household income and private consumption increase with the implementation of forest concessions. With the expansion of natural forest management in the north, forest plantations contract significantly in all regions and to a lesser degree, natural forest management in the north east and center west. As forest plantations demand less agricultural land for production, the price of agricultural land decreases and the excess supply is taken up by the agricultural sector which pays less for the land and consequently produces more of a less expensive product. The implementation of forest concessions results in a 3.8% increase in legal deforestation with the largest increase in the north, followed by the north east and center west. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A cost analysis was conducted using a prospective cohort of children born between 2000 and 2003 in the Greater London, Oxford, Portsmouth and Bristol areas of England. Unit costs were applied to estimates of the health and social resource use made by 138 infants diagnosed with GBS disease and 305 non-GBS controls matched for birth weight and hospital stay and time of birth. The health and social care costs for infants exposed to GBS disease were analysed in a multiple linear regression model. The mean health and social care cost over the first 2 years of life was estimated at A 11,968.9 pound for infants with GBS, compared to A 6,260.7 pound for the non-GBS controls; a mean cost difference of A 5,708.1 pound (bootstrap 95% CI A 2,977.1 pound, A 8,391.2 pound, P = 0.03). After adjusting for gestational age and other potential confounders in a multiple linear regression, mean societal costs was A 6,144.7 pound higher among GBS cases than among non-GBS controls (P < 0.001). This study shows that the health and social care costs for infants with GBS disease is, on average, two-fold higher during the first 2 years of life than for infants without GBS disease. These data should be used to inform policy decisions regarding the cost-effectiveness of prevention and treatment strategies for GBS disease during early childhood.","[Schroeder, Elizabeth-Ann; Petrou, Stavros; Edamma, Oya] Univ Oxford, Natl Perinatal Epidemiol Unit, Oxford OX3 7LF, England; [Balfour, Gail; Heath, Paul T.] Univ London, Div Child Hlth, London SW17 0RE, England",University of Oxford; University of London,"Schroeder, EA (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Natl Perinatal Epidemiol Unit, Old Rd Campus,Old Rd, Oxford OX3 7LF, England.",liz.schroeder@npeu.ox.ac.uk,"Petrou, Stavros/ABD-8323-2021; Lamagni, Theresa/I-4115-2019","Petrou, Stavros/0000-0003-3121-6050; Schroeder, Elizabeth-Ann/0000-0003-0236-2833; Heath, Paul/0000-0002-7540-7433; Lamagni, Theresa/0000-0002-3965-8323",Medical Research Council [G0501681] Funding Source: researchfish; Medical Research Council [G0501681] Funding Source: Medline; MRC [G0501681] Funding Source: UKRI,Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),,,30,18,21,2,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

However, which component of socioeconomic status affects health most and how that relationship should be measured remains an open question. The aim of this study was to compare material and social deprivation indexes in order to determine which better explains health inequalities within an urban area. Following a review of the literature on small area deprivation indexes, a case study of the Italian city Genoa is presented. The city of Genoa is split into 71 small areas [urbanistic units (UU)], each of which has about 9,500 inhabitants. For each small area, socioeconomic indicators were extracted from the 2001 Census, whereas health indicators were computed from the death registry for 2001-2003. Factorial analyses was used to choose the deprivation variables, which were utilised to create two distinct deprivation indexes referring to material and social deprivation, respectively. Both deprivation indexes are positively correlated with health status proxied by standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) under 65. The material index, however, correlates more highly with SMRs than the social index, and thus the material index is the more suitable measure to explain variations in premature mortality within an urban area. Moreover, the two indexes must be kept distinct.","[Testi, Angela; Ivaldi, Enrico] Univ Genoa, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Genoa, Italy",University of Genoa,"Ivaldi, E (通讯作者)，Univ Genoa, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Via Vivaldi 5, Genoa, Italy.",Ivaldi@economia.unige.it,"Testi, Angela/AAC-6690-2022; Ivaldi, Enrico/AAI-7178-2020","Ivaldi, Enrico/0000-0001-6687-9378; TESTI, ANGELA/0000-0002-9082-3996",,,,,31,42,43,2,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Drawing freely on Habermas' Between Facts and Norms, the article argues that coordination through deliberation is unlikely to occur in formal settings, where discourses are mostly about the accommodation of existing interests, and is more likely to be found in the informal public sphere, where the preferences of citizens are still malleable and where it is possible for civil society groups to build communicative power by articulating moral arguments that motivate and mobilize the public. This form of power can then be used by civil society groups to counterbalance other forms of (non-communicative) power that impinge on the formal decision-making sphere.","[Baccaro, Lucio] MIT, Inst Work & Employment Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Papadakis, Konstantinos] Int Labor Org, Int Inst Labour Studies, Geneva, Switzerland",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Baccaro, L (通讯作者)，MIT, Inst Work & Employment Res, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",baccaro@mit.edu,,"Baccaro, Lucio/0000-0001-6410-6179",,,,,89,18,23,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

I study a quasi-experiment generated by a law introduced in Portugal: out of the 12 paragraphs in the law that dictated the costly procedure required for dismissals for cause, eight did not apply to small firms. Using matched employer-employee longitudinal data and difference-in-differences methods, I examine the impact of that differentiated change in firing costs upon several variables. The results do not indicate robust effects on job or worker flows, although some estimates suggest an increase in hirings. However, firms that gain flexibility in their dismissals exhibit sizable increases in their relative performance. This finding suggests that reducing firing costs of the type studied here increases workers' effort.","[Martins, Pedro S.] Queen Mary Univ London, London, England; [Martins, Pedro S.] CEG IST, Lisbon, Portugal; [Martins, Pedro S.] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of London; Queen Mary University London; Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Martins, PS (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, London, England.",,"Martins, Pedro S./B-6059-2009; Martins, Pedro/GWC-7702-2022","Martins, Pedro S./0000-0001-9323-5252;",,,,,35,53,56,2,17,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0734-306X,,,J LABOR ECON,J.

Ordinary least squares estimates show a significant positive relationship between modest hours of school-year employment and grade point average. However, the inclusion of individual fixed effects diminishes the relationship substantially, suggesting that much of the positive correlation can be explained by individual heterogeneity.

As a result transaction costs of global system functioning increase and a coordination mechanism is needed - especially in agro-food sectors. There exists a crucial question whether a land factor is still capable to generate economic rents which would be the determinants of comparative advantages? On the one hand, D.Ricardo's land rents are vanishing, H.George's rents are provoking financial crisis, monetarists assumptions are becoming insufficient, while on the other hand, the land factor gains new environmental applications and there is still a hope that land rents have its origins in a real value. This paper aims at presenting the evolution of the land rents theory starting from classical economics. One makes an attempt to find the most adequate conception of land rent creation at present day, searching for new sources of comparative advantages in the institutional factors. One argues that Ricardian land rents are vanishing and the institutional rent is the only durable economic rent in the European agricultural sector regarding chosen direction of the CAP evolution. The institutional rent comes from the reduction of the transaction costs by contractual integration process in agro-food sector that however requires a retransfer of financial means from the integrator to the farming producers. In the non-integrated structures drainage of value added by the market mechanism intensifies along with the increase of production specialisation and market risk.","[Czyzewski, Bazyli] Poznan Univ Econ, Dept Macroecon & Agr Econ, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,,,"Czyżewski, Bazyli/Y-4679-2019","Czyzewski, Bazyli/0000-0002-6324-2723",,,,,20,1,2,1,5,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-9937-2-0,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2009,,19,,,,,83.0,90,,,,,,8,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BUR80,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290182700010,0

Heterogeneous harvest values are included by incorporating time-specific harvest costs and a cumulative-harvest effect into fishers' profit functions. I also allow for strategic interaction among fishers via ex-vessel price dynamics. The equilibrium harvest strategies of the differential games are solved numerically through the use of a genetic algorithm. It is demonstrated how different harvesting sector environments lead to varying degrees of ex-vessel price increases when IFQs are implemented. The primary result shows that possible margins for competition among fishers, other than competition for a greater share of the TA C, can exist even under IFQ management and this competition, especially when combined with noncompetitive processors, may be substantial enough to prevent sizeable rent transfers from the processing sector to the harvesting sector",,,,fell@rff.org,,"Fell, Harrison/0000-0002-5749-3040",,,,,28,12,14,0,12,"MRE FOUNDATION, INC",KINGSTON,"PO BOX 1828, KINGSTON, RI 02881 USA",0738-1360,,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

This lack of diversification is most surprising since the potato has had an important role in the Swedish dietary customs for about 200 years. During the last forty years, consumption has decreased and other products (staple carbohydrates) such as pasta, rice and bulgur have gained market shares from the potato. Our material is based on ten phone interviews and was conducted in September 2007. The information is also received in contacts with the industry and through participation at several meetings with industry representatives. Despite recent development towards an increased assortment our results show that half of the responding managers believe that the potato consumption will decrease even more in the near future. But the results also imply that a continuing development of the product is necessary since many consumers ask for more convenient alternatives. A majority of the interviewed managers believe that a development within this segment could increase the sales volume and they especially point out the urge to improve the design of the packages. The recent introduction of new products may be constrained by the fact that the existing situation, dominated by unpacked potatoes, is regarded as superior. The development is also restrained by the retailers' low expectations and the fact that potato is considered as a bulk product. This attitude among retailers is reflected by the very limited marketing efforts concerning potatoes. Extra sales activities are very rare and they are primarily concentrated to national holidays. If the potato industry wants to increase the profitability they probably need to differentiate the product.

With high amounts of precipitation or irrigation, leaching of N below the root zone may constitute an environmental risk, especially when available soil N exceeds plant uptake, which is often the case early in the season. The recommendation in Quebec is a split application of 85 kg N/ha at transplanting and 50 kg/ha at sidedressing (four to five weeks later). The sidedressing application can be adjusted based on a prior test of N sufficiency. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of N rate and irrigation on the sensitivity of different tests, including the Dualex, a new instrument measuring the status of leaf polyphenolics (Phen). Experimental fields were established in 2005 and 2006 at the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada experimental farm of L'Acadie (Quebec). The crop was fertilized with 0, 105, 135, 165, 195, or 225 kg N/ha and provided, or not, with supplementary irrigation after crop establishment. Sap NO3, leaf epidermis Phen, and chlorophyll contents (Chl) were determined periodically using the Nitrachek reflectometer, the Dualex, and the SPAD-502 chlorophyll meter (chlmeter) respectively. Yields of marketable heads increased in a curvilinear matter with N rate, with a tendency to plateau at high rates. There was low mineral N available in the soil at harvest, regardless of irrigation, but the level was linearly related to N rate. Dualex readings were generally not affected by irrigation and quick to react to N application, generally in a linear manner. They compared well to both the sap test and the SPAD meter. The ratio of chlorophyll meter to Dualex readings (Chl/Phen) was particularly sensitive to seasonal N requirements.","[Tremblay, N.; Belec, C.; Jenni, S.] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Hort Res & Dev Ctr, St Jean, PQ, Canada; [Fortier, E.] Laval Univ, Hort Res Ctr, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Mellgren, R.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Crop Sci, Alnarp, Sweden",Agriculture & Agri Food Canada; Laval University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Tremblay, N (通讯作者)，Agr & Agri Food Canada, Hort Res & Dev Ctr, St Jean, PQ, Canada.",,,"Tremblay, Nicolas/0000-0003-1409-4442",,,,,39,21,22,0,9,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-6605-370-0,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,824.0,,,,,,121.0,131,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2009.824.13,0.0,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAV48,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305621100013,0

Previous research has shown that hospital provision of research and education interferes with patient care routines and inflates the costs of health care services, turning university hospitals into outliers in comparative productivity and efficiency analyses. The organisation of patient care, medical education and clinical research as well as available data at the university hospital level are highly similar in the Nordic countries, creating a data set of comparable decision-making units suitable for a cross-country cost efficiency analysis. The results demonstrate significant differences in university hospital cost efficiency when variables for teaching and research are entered into the analysis, both between and within the Nordic countries. The results of a second-stage analysis show that the most important explanatory variables are geographical location of the hospital and the share of discharges with a high case weight. However, a substantial amount of the variation in cost efficiency at the university hospital level remains unexplained.","[Medin, Emma; Rehnberg, Clas] Karolinska Inst, Med Management Ctr, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Anthun, Kjartan S.] SINTEF Hlth Res, N-7465 Trondheim, Norway; [Hakkinen, Unto; Linna, Miika] Natl Inst Hlth & Welf, Ctr Hlth & Social Econ, Helsinki 00271, Finland; [Kittelsen, Sverre A.

However, the empirical evidence on the effects of child labor on educational attainments is mostly limited to static measurements. This paper assesses the consequences of child labor on schooling outcomes over time by employing a three-year longitudinal household data set from Nicaragua. The potential endogeneity of past child labor and school outcomes is addressed through instrumental variables. The time a child dedicates to work is found to have harmful consequences on subsequent educational achievements, even after controlling for previous human capital accumulation and other factors. In particular, working over three hours a day is associated with school failure in the medium term. A distinction by type of work shows that time spent in market production has larger negative effects on school outcomes than time spent performing household chores. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The effect is localized to lower-resource families, for whom a $10,000 increase in housing wealth increases enrollment by 5.7 percentage points.

This study examines the time path of teacher salaries in Appalachian and non-Appalachian Kentucky using a novel teacher-level administrative data set. Our results suggest that the Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA) provided a salary boost for all Appalachian teachers, resulting in a wage premium for teachers of low and medium experience and equalizing pay across Appalachian and non-Appalachian districts for teachers of high experience. However, we find that Appalachian salaries fell back to the level of non-Appalachian teachers roughly a decade following reform, at which point the pre-KERA remuneration patterns re-emerge.","[Butler, J.

The use of onsite sampling usually reflects data or budgetary constraints, but can lead to two primary forms of bias in site choice models. First, the strategy entails sampling site choices rather than sampling individuals-a form of bias called endogenous stratification. Under these conditions, sample choices may not reflect the site choices of the true population. Second, exogenous attributes of the individuals sampled onsite may differ from the attributes of individuals in the population-the most common form in recreation demand is avidity bias. We propose addressing these biases by combining two the existing methods: Weighted Exogenous Stratification Maximum Likelihood estimation and propensity score estimation. We use the National Marine Fisheries Service's Marine Recreational Fishing Statistics Survey to illustrate methods of bias reduction, employing both simulated and empirical applications. We find that propensity score based weights can significantly reduce bias in estimation. Our results indicate that failure to account for these biases can overstate anglers' willingness to pay for improvements in fishing catch, but weighted models exhibit higher variance of parameter estimates and willingness to pay.

Most recently, China's restrictions of its exports of certain minerals and rare earth metals have led to heated debates. The United States (US), European Union (EU), and Mexico have already filed a WTO dispute case against China on this matter. This paper describes the policy objectives and the global welfare implications of export restrictions. It summarizes the relevant WTO regulation, and offers a detailed analysis of the China Raw Materials case which is before the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB). It argues that although export restrictions is arguably an area of 'under-regulation' or 'regulatory deficiency' in the WTO law, it is strongly biased against the late accession Members, including China. Yet, the way that China institutes its export restrictions raises serious questions about its role in the multilateral trading system, which it relies on for its economic prosperity. Hence, this is an area where China is likely to feel the implications of its so-called `WTO-plus' commitments on its domestic and trade policies.","Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Karapinar, B (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",baris.karapinar@wti.org,,"Karapinar, Baris/0000-0003-4423-9139",,,,,40,18,19,2,38,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JUL,2011,10.0,3,,,,,389.0,408,,10.1017/S1474745611000218,0.0,,,20,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,783XB,,Green Published,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000292116700005,0

Where access to the forests is free, and when the property rights to the products that can be picked from the ground are not clearly assigned, forest owners bear a cost, in the form of forest damage by pickers, and receive no benefit. These owners therefore have little incentive to provide the public with more or better forests, however socially desirable this would be. If the value of this environmental service to society was known, an appropriate policy could be applied. The first step in assessing this value (evaluation) is illustrated here in a case study in central Catalonia, Spain. A travel cost method was applied to a sample of mushroom pickers over three years. The results show an estimated recreational surplus of (sic)39 per journey. The second step (policy) was explored by asking mushroom pickers for their views on various different payment schemes. The results suggest that paying for this environmental service would be supported to varying degrees depending on how the policy is designed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Instead, the direct employers of low wage workers operate in far more competitive markets that create conditions for non-compliance. We examine this evolution in employment and its implications for public policy in the US, discuss the factors driving fissured employment and sketch its main features and outcomes. We then look at the traditional methods used for labour standards enforcement in the US and discuss why they are poorly suited to address fissured workplaces. Finally, we survey how public policies might better address the realities of the modern workplace, including efforts in this regard by the Obama administration.","[Weil, David] Boston Univ, Sch Management, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Weil, David] Harvard Kennedy Sch Govt, Transparency Policy Project, Boston, MA USA",Boston University,"Weil, D (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Sch Management, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",davweil@bu.edu,,"Weil, David/0000-0002-1092-6056",,,,,43,51,64,1,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

The necessity of forest planning and the challenge to it are composed by rapid evolutions both in the way societies view forests and in technological and economic pressures on them. The paper proposes to review contemporary issues in the field of forest planning education and research. The comfort zone of classical approaches - techno-economic approaches concentrating on maximizing fluxes in the forest - is challenged in three directions. First, the foundations of forest planning are increasingly spread across different disciplinary fields. Second, the list of issues encompassed is rapidly expanding, for instance to risk analysis, public participation, biodiversity, new technologies and uses of wood, climate change, etc. Third, forest planning has to find its relevance in very contrasted societal needs and views regarding forests. By reviewing and attempting to order the multiple combinations between these various concepts of, and expectations from. forest planning, the paper attempts to map the landscape of a rapidly diversifying field.

Villagers, foresters, park employees, entrepreneurs and environmentalists were surveyed. A fuzzy-logic based possibility schema for evaluation of forest stakeholder attitudes is developed, and empirically used to investigate stakeholder attitudes towards these alternative forest regimes in Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. Non-parametric statistical analysis is used to draw statistical inferences. The three regimes are ranked based on efficiency, justice, and (un)certainty criteria. The results indicate that the conventional bureaucratic forest regime is falling out of favor in the interests of multi-stakeholders forest management. Due to strategic significance of Mount Kilimanjaro forest resources, and diverse interests of multi-stakeholders (local to global), complete devolution of power to local communities did not gunner an overall favorable social acceptability, either, among the surveyed stakeholders. The findings, however, support a strong desire for increased societal participation in the form of collaborative multi-stakeholder forest management. This outcome calls for significant policy changes to increase participation, as well as harmonization of values and institutions of different stakeholders as a pre-requisite for negotiation among the stakeholders in Mount Kilimanjaro who seek to co-ordinate their activities for sustainable forest management.

We studied possible differences in public providers' performance (price, intensity of services, service mix-curative medical services/prevention, productivity and revenues) according to the competitiveness of the market. The Finnish Institute of Occupational Health (FIOH) collected data on clients, services and personnel for 1992, 1995, 1997, 2000 and 2004 from occupational health services (OHS) providers. Employers defray the costs of OHS and apply for reimbursement from the Social Insurance Institution (SII). The SII data was merged with FIOH's questionnaire. The unbalanced panel consisted of about 230 public providers, totalling 1,164 observations. Local markets were constructed from several municipalities based on commuting practices and regional collaboration. Competitiveness of the market was measured by the number of providers and by the Herfindahl index. The effect of competition was studied by ordinary least square regression analysis and panel models. The more competitive the environment was for a public provider the higher were intensity, productivity and the share of medical care. Fixed panel models showed that these differences were not due to differences and changes in the competitiveness of the market. Instead, in more competitive markets public providers had higher unit prices and higher revenues.","[Kankaanpaa, Eila; Linnosmaa, Ismo; Valtonen, Hannu] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Hlth & Social Management, Kuopio 70711, Finland; [Kankaanpaa, Eila] Finnish Inst Occupat Hlth, Kuopio, Finland",University of Eastern Finland; Finnish Institute of Occupational Health,"Kankaanpää, E (通讯作者)，Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Hlth & Social Management, POB 1627, Kuopio 70711, Finland.",eila.kankaanpaa@uef.fi,"Kankaanpää, Eila/AAY-7015-2021","Kankaanpää, Eila/0000-0001-5719-5783",,,,,42,5,6,0,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

By this integrative approach, the field of art and culture can be linked to, as well as profit from, other fields where systems-theoretical approaches have been influential, such as sociology, psychology, communication theory and the natural sciences. We show that systems models help to describe and conceptualize essential phenomena characteristic of the fine arts, such as pattern formation, reduction of complexity, and self-reference. Pattern formation can be observed in emerging artistic styles, fashions and trends. The property of self-reference becomes tractable by using the concept of endosystems, i.e. systems that include participating observers and second circularity feedback. The consequences of such dynamics are uncertainty, destabilization, and diversification. Endosystemic modeling promises to capture core properties not only of contemporary art, laying an emphasis on novelty and self-reference. Endosystems are appropriate models of further social systems, especially markets systems, which pose problems for foresight. Within the horizon of foresight that is at all possible in endosystems, three futures scenarios are worked out for the art system. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Empirical analysis shows, first, that population groups are still spatially segregated due to the legacy of apartheid, which implies that, given the positive correlation between school quality and school fees, quality education is concentrated in formerly white, coloured and Indian schools in areas where the majority is non-African. Second, school quality, measured by the learner-educator ratio, improves as school fee and government subsidy increase. In this sense, school fee can be decreased with an increase in government subsidy to maintain school quality. It is also shown that government subsidy is allocated to schools with lower quality and fees, increasing the number of subsidized teachers. To address the current imbalance, financial support to disadvantaged locales and schools should be strengthened further. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Many studies conclude that building and upgrading roads increases pressure on forests but some find that new and better roads may reduce the rate of deforestation. In this paper we use satellite remote sensing images of forest cover in Jiangxi Province, China, to test whether the existence and the size of roads (ranging from expressways to tertiary roads) in 1995 affected the level of forest cover in 2000 or the rate of change between 1995 and 2000. To account for road access for each of our 1 km(2) (pixel) units of forest cover we measure whether or not and what type of roads penetrate the watershed in which the pixel lies. These watersheds allow more plausible measures of accessibility than do traditional crowfly distance measures that ignore topography. To account for possible confounding we also use 12 additional covariates: geographic and climatic variables (e.g., elevation, slope, rainfall, temperature, soil properties); demographic and economic variables (e.g., local population and GDP per square kilometer); and distance variables (e.g., distance to the nearest provincial capital). Although simple univariate OLS regressions show that forest levels are lower and deforestation rates higher either when there is a road, or when there is a higher quality road, these results are not robust. Controlling for all of the covariates and also using recently developed covariate matching techniques to estimate treatment effects, we find that roads in China's Jiangxi Province can most safely be described as having no impact on the level of forests and no impact on the rate of deforestation.

The awareness campaign mainly consisted of nine meetings with the forest owners and nine workshops with all stakeholders, i.e. representatives of the forest inspectorates, county headquarters of the national forest administration, mass media, forest landowners, forest managers, logging companies and local authorities, including police and gendarmerie. The discussions, facilitated in each meeting by the three authors, were recorded and the minutes produced there have been further used for diagnosing the main interaction bottlenecks occurred between stakeholders. These discussions have been examined through the transactional analysis method in order to find out the main communication problems needed to addresses at national, regional and local level by the representatives of the public authorities in charge with implementing and supervising the forest policy. The main results of this analysis consist of a list of problems supposed to generate conflicts of various kinds (legal, technical, managerial and communicational) in Romanian forestry. The study has also revealed some important and frequent pitfalls that jeopardize the communication between prevailing stakeholders. Explaining them and their root causes could be a very useful input for further PR training programs and for the academic curricula. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Students respond more if they are first-term freshmen, or if the course is a major requirement. Men, students with light course loads, and students with low cumulative grade point average or low course grade are less likely to evaluate the course and the instructor. A matched-pairs test that effectively eliminates class- and instructor-invariant student characteristics confirms that students who do better in a course are more likely to participate in SET. In addition, students who are more likely to have strong opinions, identified by early participation, hold, on average, positive views toward the course. These results do not support the idea that SET attracts disproportionally more unhappy students. Given the widely documented positive correlation between grades and ratings, these findings suggest that SET ratings can be biased upward.","Amer Univ Sharjah, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates",American University of Sharjah,"Kherfi, S (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Sharjah, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.",skherfi@aus.edu,"Kherfi, Samer/AAI-5615-2021",,,,,,13,14,17,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0485,,,J ECON EDUC,J.

China's obligations under TRIPS to ensure that its customs authorities be empowered to dispose properly of confiscated goods that infringe intellectual property rights; 3. whether China's volume and value of goods thresholds for application of criminal procedures and penalties with respect to trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy comply with TRIPS requirements for application of criminal procedures and penalties. International trade agreements are generally intended to cause states to internalize policy externalities. The policy externalities that arise from domestic decisions regarding intellectual property protection may deprive foreign intellectual property owners of the monopoly profits that they would otherwise derive from intellectual property protection. In connection with intellectual property protection, even a state that lacks 'traditional' market power on world markets may be able to impose terms-of-trade externalities on other states by reducing its protection of intellectual property below the global optimum. For this reason, and because of the international public-goods aspects of intellectual property, states have incentives to undersupply intellectual property protection. At least in part, TRIPS seems to be an attempt to reduce these policy externalities. All contracts, and all international treaties, are incomplete. This case involves some good examples of treaty incompleteness. Incompleteness can arise from circumstances of uncertainty regarding the possible tradeoffs, and the optimal balance, between different goals, including state autonomy in censorship on the one hand and internalizing policy externalities in intellectual property protection on the other. We analyze the possibility that it might be efficient to allow states broad discretion over censorship. Alternatively, in connection with the requirement for criminal penalties, incompleteness can arise from uncertainty regarding the particular industry structure that might be involved, and what would constitute production of 'commercial scale' for that industry. We also question the rationale for the limitation on the use of nonviolation complaints in connection with the TRIPS, since nonviolation complaints may be used to reduce the possibility that states will use discretion, such as that granted with respect to censorship, in a manner that is inconsistent with the rationale for that discretion so as to defect from the general commitment to provide copyright or other intellectual property rights.","[Saggi, Kamal] So Methodist Univ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA; [Trachtman, Joel P.] Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch Law & Diplomacy, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Southern Methodist University; Tufts University,"Saggi, K (通讯作者)，So Methodist Univ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA.",ksaggi@smu.edu; joel.trachtman@tufts.edu,"Saggi, Kamal/B-1756-2012; Trachtman, Joel/AAN-8482-2020",,,,,,13,2,2,0,26,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JAN,2011,10.0,1,,,SI,,63.0,86,,10.1017/S1474745610000455,0.0,,,24,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,759XU,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290283700005,0

Both increases and reductions in the STT rate result in significant increases in market volatility. In addition, increases in the SIT rate have mixed effects on market efficiency, either improving or curbing it. Reductions usually either make the market less efficient or have no effect on it.

When China joined the WTO in November 2001, it was not clear how China would behave in the WTO dispute settlement. At first, China proved to be a conciliatory defendant and reluctant complainant. Recently, however, China's profile in dispute settlement has shifted to a more proactive one, leading some observers to label its behaviour 'aggressive'. I argue that China's behaviour should be viewed in a different light. From totally rejecting international third party adjudication in the past, China by permitting WTO panels to determine its fate in trade disputes has started to exhibit new willingness to accept binding international adjudication. In this context, China is demonstrating respect for international rules as well as its faith in western legal norms and institutions. Through more intense participation in WTO dispute settlement, China is also becoming increasingly vested in the maintenance of WTO norms and rules, and consequently, the WTO dispute settlement system is playing an important role in socializing China.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Int Relat, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Harpaz, MD (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Int Relat, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",marcia_h@netvision.net.il,,,,,,,85,31,35,0,10,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

In an earlier paper in this journal, I argued that the same principle (internal consistency) that has been applied to the discussion about future non-medical costs should also be applied to the case when survival is not affected. Internal consistency in this case implies that a cost should only be included if its corresponding utility is also included. As Quality-Adjusted Life-Years can rarely be considered to be consistent with a broad definition of utility, I built a case for recommending to not including the costs for changes in consumption and absence from work (whereas changes in the productivity at work may still be included) when applying a welfare theoretic foundation. As one of several parts of building this case, and to further highlight the elements of importance, I constructed a simple welfare theoretic model. Unfortunately, this model did not take the envelope theorem into account (which was correctly pointed out by Prof. Friedrich Breyer). However, most of the arguments still hold and the policy implications are actually even confirmed in the analysis by Prof. Friedrich Breyer. Building on these results, a related and equally interesting question is what the implications are on the so-called societal perspective. It seems as if a societal perspective in CEA may not be consistent with a welfare theoretic foundation. However, even if such a foundation is not seen as important, it may still be of interest-for reasons of internal consistency-to take a societal perspective on both costs and benefits.","[Liljas, Bengt] AstraZeneca, S-43183 Molndal, Sweden; [Liljas, Bengt] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Lund, Sweden",AstraZeneca; Lund University,"Liljas, B (通讯作者)，AstraZeneca, S-43183 Molndal, Sweden.",bengt.liljas@astrazeneca.com,,,,,,,6,1,1,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

A retrospective chart review within-subject mirror-image study using actual practice chart review data was used to compare annual hospital bed-days and annual hospital episodes for adults with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder before and after switching to Risperdal Consta in the period 1 January 2003 to 30 June 2005. Secondary endpoints included mean length of hospital stay per episode, the cost of hospitalization, and the cost of antipsychotic treatment. The base case analytical approach allocated all hospital episodes overlapping the switch date entirely to pre-switch treatment. In order to investigate the impact of inpatient care ongoing at the time of the switch, the change in bed-days per year was also estimated using an alternative analytical approach inspired by economic modelling. One-hundred sixty-four patients were enrolled at nine geographically diverse sites. The switch to Risperdal Consta was associated with a significant reduction in mean annual days in hospital from 39 to 21 days per year (45%), which was linked to a significant reduction in the number of hospitalizations from 0.86 to 0.63 per year (27%). The alternative modelling-inspired estimate of the reduction in mean annual days in hospital was also 27%. A naturalistic mirror-image study found that switching to long-acting injectable risperidone led to sizeable reductions in inpatient resource use.

A promising approach for handling these complex situations is to integrate participatory planning and multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The objective of this paper is to analyze strengths and weaknesses of such an integrated approach, focusing on how the use of MCDA has influenced the participatory process. The paper outlines a model for a participatory MCDA process with five steps: stakeholder analysis, structuring of the decision problem, generation of alternatives, elicitation of preferences, and ranking of alternatives. This model was applied in a case study of a planning process for the urban forest in Lycksele, Sweden. In interviews with stakeholders, criteria for four different social groups were identified. Stakeholders also identified specific areas important to them and explained what activities the areas were used for and the forest management they wished for there. Existing forest data were combined with information from interviews to create a map in which the urban forest was divided into zones of different management classes. Three alternative strategic forest plans were produced based on the zonal map. The stakeholders stated their preferences individually by the Analytic Hierarchy Process in inquiry forms and a ranking of alternatives and consistency ratios were determined for each stakeholder. Rankings of alternatives were aggregated; first, for each social group using the arithmetic mean, and then an overall aggregated ranking was calculated from the group rankings using the weighted arithmetic mean. The participatory MCDA process in Lycksele is assessed against five social goals: incorporating public values into decisions, improving the substantive quality of decisions, resolving conflict among competing interests, building trust in institutions, and educating and informing the public. The results and assessment of the case study support the integration of participatory planning and MCDA as a viable option for handling complex forest-management situations. Key issues related to the MCDA methodology that need to be explored further were identified: 1) the handling of place-specific criteria, 2) development of alternatives, 3) the aggregation of individual preferences into a common preference, and 4) application and evaluation of the integrated approach in real case studies.

The similarity pertains to the argument related to the gradual weakening of nation-states, which also constitutes the main theme of the globalization debate. The civilizational approach and political Islam signify new efforts to reach a much larger political community and organization in world politics. Both of them argue that the formation of new political actor(s) is replacing the old nation-states across religious and cultural affinities. The terrorist organization Al-Qaeda is trying to legitimize its political violence by manipulating the weakness of the nation-states and the utopia of the formation of a much more comprehensive political community and political organization through Islam. Huntington's clash of civilizations thesis indirectly provides a base for Al-Qaeda's rhetoric and a certain type of justification for its terror activities, since the theory argues for the inevitability of the conflict between civilizations, regardless of their political regimes (liberal or totalitarian) with civilizations being determined by their cultural and religious differences a theme that is used by the ideologues of political Islam.

Since the definition and measurements of social policy and the welfare state are subject to change depending on the specific historical, political and economic context, the welfare underdevelopment thesis deserves scrutiny. In Japan, Korea and Taiwan, agricultural protection and enterprise welfare, among others, have been surrogates of conventional welfare policies. As a way of critically engaging in the debate over the East Asian welfare model, this paper focuses on these two areas of surrogate social policy and explores their empirical basis with the OECD data on Japan and Korea. The result shows that surrogate social policy measures such as producer support estimates for agricultural protection and mandatory private social spending for enterprise welfare add up to make a difference between the East Asian countries and the other OECD members. This suggests a distinct political-economic model for East Asian social welfare.","Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Sociol, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Kim, PH (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Sociol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",pkim@ssc.wisc.edu,,,,,,,75,29,30,1,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

We also used the data collected from the survey to examine the relationship between the stated preferences, subjective judgements, and the observed and planned timber fellings. Our aim was to determine as to what extent the NIPF owners' harvesting behaviour was consistent with their preferences and subjective judgments. The result shows that a majority of the NIPF owners who responded to the survey were risk-neutral or risk-prone. There were no statistically significant correlations between a forest owner's attitudes toward risk and the size of forest property. However, risk preferences have significant impacts on the decision to fell: the more a forest owner likes to take risks, the more likely it is that he/she conducts final felling. The result also shows large variations among NIPF owners with respect to the subjective judgements of the return and risk of the alternative investments. For each respondent we elicited the most preferred investment alternative based on the stated risk preferences and the subjective judgements of the return and risk of the alternative investments. Owners whose preferred investment alternative is the mature forest are on average significantly less active in harvesting than owners with other preferred investment alternatives. However, there are no significant differences in the felling intensity and the growing stock of timber among the different groups of NIPF owners. The examination of NIPF owners' harvesting behaviour, risk preferences and subjective judgments reveals strong indications of the difficulties for NIPF owners to make rational decisions when faced with uncertainties.

We describe how traditional microeconomic producer theory can be used to design a theoretical model enabling the choice of efficient wildfire suppression strategies. Along with linear programming techniques, GIS based data, and computer simulation programs, the efficient theoretical model enables those responsible to gain answers to some key questions arising throughout the course of wildfire process management, and particularly wildfire combat management.

Patients with prescriptions for statins in 2004 were observed for 1 year before and 1 year after the policy change, which went into effect on 1 January 2005. Data on outpatient and inpatient visits, pharmaceutical consumption, and cost to the sickness fund were collected from a sickness fund with more than 5.8 million insured members in 2005. Compared to patients who were not affected by the policy change, patients treated previously with atorvastatin experienced higher non-adherence and increased discontinuation of treatment (P < 0.0001). Compared to patients who continued treatment with atorvastatin (non-switchers), patients who switched to another statin were hospitalised more often (P = 0.0439). However, difference-in-differences in hospitalisation due to coronary heart disease (P = 0.8751) and emergency visits (P = 0.5624) did not differ significantly between the two groups. Patients who switched more than once experienced a significant increase in hospital visits (P = 0.0061) and hospital visits due to cardiovascular disease (P = 0.0096) compared to non-switchers. Difference-in-differences in outpatient healthcare utilisation did not differ between non-switchers and switchers. Total savings resulting from the policy change ranged from a,not sign 94.4 million to a,not sign 108.7 million. Although manufacturers usually comply with reference pricing by reducing their retail prices to the reference price, regulators have to be aware of the consequences in cases where manufacturers react as in this situation.","[Stargardt, Tom] Univ Munich, Munich Sch Management, Dept Hlth Serv Management, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Stargardt, Tom] Helmholtz Zentrum Muenchen, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany",University of Munich; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health,"Stargardt, T (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Munich Sch Management, Dept Hlth Serv Management, Schackstr 4, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",Tom.Stargardt@helmholtz-muenchen.de,,,,,,,30,32,36,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Censored ordered probit regressions are used to estimate the determinants of years of schooling. Child nutritional status, as measured by height-for-age Z-scores, and household income have positive effects on completed years of schooling. Mothers' education and attitudes toward children's education also have strong effects. Children of mothers with 6 years of primary education will go to school 1.4 years longer than their counterparts whose mothers who have no education. Science labs in lower secondary schools appear to have positive impacts; providing a science lab is estimated to extend years of schooling by 1.8 years. Finally, teachers' experience in lower secondary schools also has a strong positive impact on school attainment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Even more important is the far deeper problem of defining the we and what we in fact do. Futures studies not only considers wickedly complex problems, but it is itself a wicked entity, with many puzzles and contradictions. To illustrate, a taxonomy of 12 types of futurists, first articulated in 1985, is revisited, with special emphasis on the relative handful of Synoptic Generalists, the larger category of Specialized Futurists, the still larger entity of Futurized Specialists, and the largest entity of Closet Futurists who think about futures-often in a leading-edge way-but do not identify at all with futures studies, or are seen as futurists. Most contributors to Futures and other futures journals, as well as listees in the 2000 Futurist Directory, appear to have a secondary futurist identity at best. The fuzzy entity of futures studies is thus quite unlike any field or discipline, because it is easily entered by specialists who identify with the entity weakly, while many of the most important futures-thinkers are outside the entity. Instead of denying this paradox, the reality should be acknowledged, and an alterative paradigm for futures studies should be seriously considered. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Integral futures as defined by Slaughter and Riedy loses sight of this strength. Instead of an interpretive dialogue, the Integral Extension seeks to frame and define causal layered analysis (CLA) within its own terms. Its proponents do so by constructing their version of Integral as above-more evolved, higher, more... and CIA as lower. Integral, in Riedy and Slaughter's terms, appears to inhabit the totalizing linear modernist paradigm, not to mention the straightjacket of the masculinist discourse. Their strategy is the classic defining of the other within the terms of the person who seeks to define. Riedy's piece in particular makes a strange series of errors in that it: (1) confuses Vedanta with Tantra; (2) misreads subjectivity-arguing that subjectivity does not exist for the poststructural, instead of seeing how the self is contextualized with structure and genealogy (as in Foucault's work); (3) misses the entire work around inner CLA; (4) adopts the Orientalist discourse of constructing CLA as cultural (instead of recognizing that it seeks to move up and down layers of data, systems, worldviews and myths), and (5) is not grounded in the practice of conducting layered analysis with varied groups. This essay concludes by arguing that there is no need for this battle. We do not need to be either for or against Integral or CLA.

This phase is of utmost importance since it provides the foundation for everything that follows. The most important processes are then transformed into hypotheses that either come to be or do not, one of the central points of the approach, before establishing a matrix of the influences of each hypothesis on the others. Breaking down these hypotheses into clusters of hypotheses that are more closely related among themselves than to the others allows us to build microscenarios. The idea of a scenario is discussed.

We express cost-effectiveness alternatively in terms of incremental cost per additional week with minimal or no anxiety, and incremental cost per QALY gained [in 2007 Euros (sic)].

This paper estimates innovation efficiency using the instrument developed by the European Commission known as the European Innovation Scoreboard (EIS), for different years in order to introduce time lags between inputs and outputs. A nonparametric technique referred to as Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and bootstrap technique are used to estimate the efficiency scores for some countries included in the EIS. Our results include the estimates of the efficiency scores, the bias corrected estimates and also the 95percent confidence intervals for DEA estimators.

While previous research has identified the importance of transnational supply chain pressure and of NGOs' direct targeting campaigns in diffusing and upgrading standards, this paper stresses the role of public comparison and environmental benchmarking that contributed to an upgrading of industry standards via competition between the Forest Stewardship Council and rival industry-sponsored schemes. The paper explores how transnational and national actors created important moments of public comparison in which substantive as well as accountability standards were ratcheted up while they diffused more broadly across industry.

However, interstate migration is only a small part of the total student migration. Public institutions generally get most of their students from within their state; for example, 88 percent of first-time freshmen who enrolled in University System of Georgia institutions in 2002 graduated from Georgia schools. Such intrastate migration is seldom considered. This paper examines intrastate college student migration, using data for Georgia. Aside from such traditional measures of benefits and costs like tuition, financial aid, and school quality, a crucial explanatory variable in our analysis is the distance from a student's home to the different Georgia state institutions. Our empirical results indicate that student intrastate migration is strongly discouraged by greater distance, but with effects that differ across types of higher education institutions.

The scenario explores how human systems failures could parallel a suite of natural processes that bring about humanity's extinction by accelerating global warming and removing its nominal temperature range and ecological niche.

Under this exception, a producer in a Party may send materials to a non-Party for outward processing and re-import the processed goods for finishing. Final products can then enjoy the PTA preference in the importing Party provided that relevant conditions are met. This article examines various outward processing schemes under current FTAs concluded by, inter ails, Israel, the EU, European Free Trade Association (EFTA), Singapore and South Korea, and compares them with neighbouring regimes (i.e., third-country content and third-country materials rules).This article also assesses the scheme from economic-political and legal viewpoints.

The simulation approach circumvents the complex mathematics so that undergraduates can master the most important lessons of general equilibrium models.","[Nicholson, Walter; Westhoff, Frank] Amherst Coll, Amherst, MA 01002 USA",Amherst College,"Nicholson, W (通讯作者)，Amherst Coll, Amherst, MA 01002 USA.",wenicholson@amherst.edu,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0485,2152-4068,,J ECON EDUC,J.

As most conventional household surveys do not incorporate income from environmental sources, substantial gaps exist in our understanding of the actual functioning of rural economies and the extent of rural poverty and inequality. Using data from 360 randomly sampled rural households from 12 villages in Tigray (northern Ethiopia). we measure forest environmental resource use with a monetary yardstick and compares the value of FEPs with other household economic activities. We found that products from environmental sources represent an important component in rural livelihoods. Our analyses indicate that in the study area income from forest environmental sources occupies the second largest share in average total household income next to crop income. Poverty and inequality analyses show that incorporating forest environmental incomes in household accounts significantly reduces measured rural poverty and income inequality. Therefore, we suggest that sustainable forest management schemes should be adopted to maintain and enhance the flow of economic benefits to the surrounding communities without damaging the natural resource system.

These include the direct money price and the money value of the time needed to consume each good. This important conclusion has generally been ignored in textbooks. The present author calls attention to this topic by deriving Becker's conclusions within a simple two good framework. Then, he extends his work by showing that Becker's first order conditions are unlikely to be relevant if one drops Becker's strong assumption that time spent working (and, thus, money income) and time available for consuming are chosen endogenously by consumers.","Miami Univ, Oxford, OH 45056 USA",University System of Ohio; Miami University,"Miller, NC (通讯作者)，Miami Univ, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,1,HELDREF PUBLICATIONS,WASHINGTON,"1319 EIGHTEENTH ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-1802 USA",0022-0485,,,J ECON EDUC,J.

It focuses on three potential explanations for the price spread between these two classes of stock: the control contest model of the voting premium, the inferior liquidity of preferred shares, and the risk of expropriation of preferred shareholders as a class. The regression analysis, based on data from 1997 to 2005, supports the control contest explanation and the liquidity argument. The hypothesis of expropriation of preferred shareholders as a class receives limited support, and only in the early period of the Russian stock market's development. The paper addresses the issue of structural breaks in the evolution of the price differential, related to the 1998 financial crisis and to improvements in investor protection in Russia in the early 2000s.

The objective of this study was to understand the farmers' decision to adopt hybrid tomato variety (Permata) and chilli (TM-999) and the impact of that decision on the farmers' income and livelihood. Data was collected from extensive focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews conducted in five selected locations, for each hybrid variety, in the main production centres of West Java. The results showed that the main factors which influenced the farmers' decision to adopt hybrid seed of both Permata and TM-999 were the high yield, tolerance to wilt diseases, high quality of the fruit, the ability of the fruit to meet the market demand and good storability. Despite a higher production cost, the income for those farmers who chose to adopt Permata and TM-999 were higher than the income of non adopters who chose to grow the local variety. The adopters of both Permata and TM-999 claimed that their profit before and after adoption increased more than 2 times. About 30% of adopters reported that they had significantly improved their livelihood in terms of increasing their farm capital, the size and comfort of their houses, vehicles and social status. Nonetheless, adopters of Permata and TM-999 did not always make a profit from growing the hybrids. Due to the low selling price as a result of an over supply at harvest or to a low yield related to severe pest infestation during the growing season, about 27% of the farmers who adopted Permata and 30% of the farmers who adopted TM-999 made a loss.","[Basuki, R.

The approach is illustrated with data from the headboat fishery for red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico. The initial data analysis finds that effort and harvest are cointegrated series and that effort appears to respond somewhat to past changes in harvest. This suggested a structural vector error correction model specification. Model estimation results indicate that seasonal closures directly influence both harvest and effort, whereas bag and minimum size limits only affect harvest directly. Also, climate activity has a moderate influence on this fishery, mainly via changes in effort. Model forecasts are evaluated relative to a more naive specification using out-of-sample data and the use of the model for policy analysis is demonstrated.","[Carter, David W.] NOAA, SE Fisheries Sci Ctr, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Carter, David W.; Letson, David] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Miami,"Carter, DW (通讯作者)，NOAA, SE Fisheries Sci Ctr, 75 Virginia Beach Dr, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",david.w.carter@noaa.gov; dletson@rsmas.miami.edu,"Carter, David W/G-7472-2016","Carter, David W/0000-0001-8960-7236; Letson, David/0000-0002-9674-6186",,,,,46,4,5,0,11,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

Indiana's farmers' markets have increased at double the rate in the same time frame. Despite the increase in farmers' markets, little information is known about the structure of these markets in Indiana. The primary objective is to establish a benchmark of information from Indiana markets by collecting market locations and examining who (e. g., producers, consumers, community revitalization) influences the market's existence, and determining operational issues that need improvement. An internet and mail census was sent to market managers to create a benchmark for the organizational structure of Indiana's farmers' markets. All markets sold vegetables and nearly all sold fruit (95.9%). Most markets (over 50%) had public restrooms and hand washing facilities. A great deal of respondents (70%) stated there was an equal demand and supply of products. Results show that there is no difference in organizational structure between large and small markets except for insurance and access to utilities, which was an issue for smaller markets.","[Hofmann, C.; Dennis, J.

The Project has introduced more than 140 different kinds of vegetables and now supports over 3,000 households covering an area of 1,200 ha. The Royal Project has emphasized modern technology, the use of F1 hybrid seed, post-harvest technology, GAP and GMP, protected cultivation and fertigation, to increase the yield and quality per unit area.

The detrimental effect of soil tillage on soil structure has forced science to look for alternatives to slow down the process of soil degradation. Zero tillage practices are the most efficient practices for the purposes of soil and water conservation. These practices minimize soil disturbance and maintain as much residue cover as possible in order to conserve soil moisture by reducing surface runoff and evaporation, protect the soil surface from both water and wind erosion, and reduce the energy resource inputs. A zero tillage crop production system was initiated at Hokkaido University Farm in season 2006. Based on the experimental results of season 2006, further evaluation of the system performance on various soil strengths was needed. Therefore, the major objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of the initial soil strength on the establishment of soybean crop. Three plots of soil strength representing the three treatments (tilled field, medium soil strength, and high soil strength) were applied. Edible soybean (Soya hispida) (Japanese variety, Tasty) was used as the test crop. The results showed no significant differences in the population rate and plant height between the three treatments. Furthermore, the results showed no significant differences in the soybean yield dry weight, the number of pods per plant, the number of seeds per pod, the number of seeds per plant, and the shoot dry weight per plant. In summary, the results indicated that the establishment of soybean was not significantly influenced by the initial soil strength for the tested field conditions. Further research work on the performance of a zero tillage seeding machine is highly recommended.","[Tola, E. H.

The analysis finds that women helped moderate the decline in the aggregate wage share. The reduction in gender pay disparity overwhelmed the negative effect of women's growing share of market work on the wage share. However, in (one-digit) sectors where wage shares fell, women did not contribute to restraining the fall, indicating that the aggregate outcome was the net result of distinct sectoral trends in women's employment conditions. We argue that the perverse process of labor productivity falling faster than the real wage in the service sector may have played a key role in shaping the aggregate outcome.

It is demonstrated that all appropriate publications providing data on incident cases of leukaemia and on the underlying population or rates of incidence with confidence intervals had been included.

The empirical analysis focuses on the Federal Republic of Germany's policy concerning EU-Russian relations, especially regarding energy policy. The extent to which liberal intergovernmentalism (LI) furthers our understanding of state behaviour in the context of the EU Presidency is questioned. The findings suggest that LI adequately explains the formation of German positions prior to assuming office, as its policy objectives are chiefly influenced by domestic producers' interests. However, LI cannot satisfactorily account for German governmental action after taking on the Presidency role, during which time it largely downplayed domestic preferences. Instead, Presidency norms dominated its action. In this article, institutionalist approaches are drawn upon for a significantly enhanced understanding of governmental behaviour during the Presidency. Rational choice institutionalism (RCI) highlights Germany's restraint from defending its original domestic preferences due to rational calculation embedded in normative Presidency constraints. Sociological institutionalism (SI) accounts for the reprioritization of objectives through the 'taken-for-grantedness' of thoroughly internalized Presidency norms.","[Verhoeff, Emma C.] Royal Dutch Embassy, Berlin, Germany; [Niemann, Arne] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, D-6500 Mainz, Germany",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Verhoeff, EC (通讯作者)，Dutch Embassy, Klosterstr 50, D-10179 Berlin, Germany.",EC.Verhoeff@minbuza.nl,,,,,,,54,10,11,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The policy surprises are measured by both the surprise changes to the target federal funds rate (the target factor) and surprises in the future direction of the Federal Reserve monetary policy (the path factor). The results show that most international securitized real estate markets have significantly positive responses to surprise decrease in current or future expected federal funds rates, though such responses vary greatly across countries. Also, while the U.S. securitized real estate market reacts mainly to the target factor, foreign securitized real estate markets react to the path factor. Furthermore, we find that the cross-country variation in the response to the target factor is correlated with the country's exchange rate regime and its degree of real economic and particularly financial integration, while the cross-country variation in the response to the path factor is mainly related to the country's degree of financial integration.","[Yang, Jian] Univ Colorado Denver, Sch Business, Denver, CO 80217 USA; [Xu, Pisun] Univ Denver, Reiman Sch Finance, Denver, CO 80208 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; Children's Hospital Colorado; University of Denver,"Yang, J (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado Denver, Sch Business, POB 173364, Denver, CO 80217 USA.",pxu@du.edu; Jian.Yang@ucdenver.edu,"Yang, Jian/J-5089-2013","Yang, Jian/0000-0002-4073-9796",,,,,26,18,18,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Results show that minimal feedback information leads to a myopic learning algorithm, while additional feedback induces non-myopic learning and increases the impulse with which players respond to payoff differences.

Three locations were used for data collection: the border gate with mainland China, the Macau ferry terminal and Macau International Airport. Tourists who were married, had a higher education background and household income and were in a large party tended to spend more on total travel-related expenditures. Distance to Macau turned out to be another important variable affecting tourists' travel expenditure patterns. Compared to tourists from mainland China or Hong Kong, long-haul foreign tourists to Macau spent more on lodging and shopping.

Macro and micro evidence,EMPIRICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Corruption; Bank; Financial development,STOCK MARKETS; DETERMINANTS; GROWTH; CREDIT; LAW,"The aim of this paper is to analyze the effect of corruption in bank lending. Corruption is expected to hamper bank lending, as it is closely related to legal enforcement, which has been shown to promote banks' willingness to lend. Nevertheless the similarities between the consequences for bank lending of law enforcement and corruption are misleading, as they consider only judiciary corruption. Corruption can also occur in lending and may then be beneficial for bank lending via bribes given by borrowers to enhance their chances of receiving loans. This assumption may be validated particularly in the presence of pronounced risk aversion by banks, resulting in greater reluctance on the part of banks to grant loans. We perform country-level and bank-level estimations to investigate these assumptions. Corruption reduces bank lending in both sets of estimations. However, bank-level estimations show that the detrimental effect of corruption is reduced when bank risk aversion increases, even leading at times to situations wherein corruption fosters bank lending. Additional controls show that corruption does not increase bank credit by favoring only bad loans. Therefore, our findings show that while the overall effect of corruption is to hamper bank lending, it can alleviate firm's financing obstacles.","[Weill, Laurent] Univ Strasbourg, F-67082 Strasbourg, France; [Weill, Laurent] Strasbourg Business Sch, F-67082 Strasbourg, France",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Weill, L (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, 47 Ave Foret Noire, F-67082 Strasbourg, France.",laurent.weill@unistra.fr,,"Weill, Laurent/0000-0002-8630-1351",,,,,32,35,38,0,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Behavioral studies that aim to evaluate the role of risk attitudes in contexts of this type, therefore, require tools for measuring individual risk tolerance. Recent developments in decision theory provide such tools. However, the methods available can be time consuming. As a result, some practitioners might have an incentive to prefer fast and frugal methods to clean but more costly methods. In this article, we focus on a tractable procedure initially proposed by Holt and Laury (2002) to elicit risk attitude. We generalize this method to measure utility and risk aversion as follows. First, we allow measurement of probabilistic risk attitude through violations of expected utility due to probability weighting. Second, we use the outcome scale rather than the probability scale in the menu of choices. Third, we compare sure payoffs with lotteries instead of comparing non-degenerate lotteries. A within-subject experimental study illustrates the gains in tractability and bias minimization that can result from such an extension.","[Abdellaoui, Mohammed; L'Haridon, Olivier] Greg HEC, HEC Paris, F-78501 Jouy En Josas, France; [Abdellaoui, Mohammed] CNRS, Paris, France; [Driouchi, Ahmed] Al Akhawayn Univ, Ifrane, Morocco; [L'Haridon, Olivier] Univ Paris 04, Paris, France",Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC) Paris; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Al Akhawayn University; Sorbonne Universite,"L'Haridon, O (通讯作者)，Greg HEC, HEC Paris, 1 Rue Librat, F-78501 Jouy En Josas, France.",lharidon@greg-hec.com,"L'Haridon, Olivier/GYU-3062-2022","L'Haridon, Olivier/0000-0001-8786-4765",,,,,38,52,57,1,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JUL,2011,71.0,1,,,SI,,63.0,80,,10.1007/s11238-009-9192-9,0.0,,,18,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,777VJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291652900005,0

The three types of information are quantitative information only (the predominant approach in existing studies), verbal information only, and both quantitative and verbal information. The five distributional principles are equal division among recipients, Rawlsian maximin, total benefit maximization (TBM), equal benefit (EB) for recipients, and allocation according to relative need (RN) among recipients. We find important informational effects on judgments of the fair division of each of two health-related goods (pain-relief pills and apples consumed to obtain an essential vitamin): judgments based on quantitative information only are consistent with previous research; changing to verbal descriptions causes a notable shift in support among principles, and in particular greater support for the principle of TBM; judgments based on both quantitative and verbal information match more closely those made with only quantitative information. The pattern of judgments is consistent with the hypothesis that subjects do not fully understand the relationship between the conceptual meaning of the principles (as described verbally) and their implied quantitative divisions. We also find evidence of modest differential judgments across goods (pills vs. apples), sample effects (university vs. community), and sex effects, and little support for a non-zero allocation principle.","[Hurley, Jeremiah; Cuff, Katherine; Cameron, David] McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada; [Hurley, Jeremiah; Giacomini, Mita; Cameron, David] McMaster Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ & Policy Anal, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Hurley, Jeremiah; Giacomini, Mita] McMaster Univ, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Hamilton, ON L8N 3Z5, Canada; [Buckley, Neil J.] York Univ, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",McMaster University; McMaster University; McMaster University; York University - Canada,"Hurley, J (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, 1280 Main St W, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada.",hurley@mcmaster.ca,,,,,,,45,12,13,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUL,2011,37.0,2,,,,,341.0,372,,10.1007/s00355-010-0487-0,0.0,,,32,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,775SI,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291483300007,0

However, the empirical analysis reveals that the bigger part of the companies observed (Limited liability companies with 500 to 2000 employees active in the West-German service sector) does not satisfy the law. This fact has strong impact on research questions in the co-determination field: Many studies have tried to analyze the economic consequences of the German co-determination laws (all examining the 1976 Co-determination Act). However, as the regulations are compulsory, compelling results are difficult to obtain. The bigger part of the studies compares companies that fall into the scope of different co-determination laws. This implies that mainly big companies are contrasted to smaller ones. It is not difficult to see that a comparison of such kind entails further irregularities. The study presented allows better analysis. The data is taken from two sources: the commercial Hoppenstedt Database and official German statistics. Due to the special kind of data it is possible to compare companies of same size, same legal form, active in the same sector that only differ in the existence or non-existence of a supervisory board. Therefore, the study at hand provides more accurate evidence of the economic consequences of the German 2004 Co-determination Act.","Univ Luneburg, Inst Econ, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg,"Boneberg, F (通讯作者)，Univ Luneburg, Inst Econ, Scharnhorststr 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany.",boneberg@uni.leuphana.de,,,,,,,45,1,1,0,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

J,"Landis, F",,,,"Landis, Florian",,,Second-Order Sensitivity in Applied General Equilibrium,COMPUTATIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Sensitivity analysis; Out-of-sample behavior; CGE; Flexible functional forms,FLEXIBLE FUNCTIONAL FORMS; ECONOMIC-PERFORMANCE,"In most policy applications of general equilibrium modeling, cost functions are calibrated to benchmark data. Modelers often choose the functional form for cost functions based on suitability for numerical solution of the model. The data (including elasticities of substitution) determine first and second order derivatives (local behavior) of the cost functions at the benchmark. The functional form implicitly defines third and higher order derivatives (global behavior). In the absence of substantial analytic and computational effort, it is hard to assess the extent to which results of a particular model depend on third and higher order derivatives. Assuming that a modeler has no (or weak) empirical foundation for her choice of functional form in a model, it is therefore a priori unclear to what extent her results are driven by this choice. I present a method for performing second-order sensitivity analysis of modeling results with respect to functional form. As an illustration of this method I examine three general equilibrium models from the literature and demonstrate the extent to which results depend on functional form. The outcomes suggest that modeling results typically do not depend on the functional form for comparative static policy experiments in models with constant returns to scale. This is in contrast to an example with increasing returns to scale and an endogenous steady-state capital stock. Here results move far from benchmark equilibrium and significantly depend on the choice of functional form.","ETH, CEPE, ZUE EI, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Landis, F (通讯作者)，ETH, CEPE, ZUE EI, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",landisf@ethz.ch,,,GAMS,GAMS,This research was supported by the GAMS Applied General Equilibrium Research Fund.

We approach this question through an examination of the new management practices debate, principally in the labour movement where a distinctive and critical view of NMP developed in the late 1980s. Second, we argue that there is a link between this debate and the wider politics of labour process discussion both within and beyond the labour movement which has witnessed a shift away from an earlier engagement with worker interventions. In response we suggest the need to re-evaluate the nature of academic engagement with labour thus reanimating a closer engagement with labour-in-work and collective worker narratives.","[Stewart, Paul] Univ Strathclyde, Dept HRM, Glasgow G1 1XQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Martinez Lucio, Miguel] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, HRM Employment Relat & Employment Law Grp, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Strathclyde; University of Manchester,"Stewart, P (通讯作者)，Graham Hills Bldg,50 Richmond St, Glasgow G1 1XU, Lanark, Scotland.",paul.stewart.100@strath.ac.uk,,"Martinez Lucio, Miguel/0000-0001-7090-9007",,,,,45,21,23,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

As a practice, economic development is an essential component of local policy and governing and a perceived driver of success and vitality for cities and regions alike. The notable distinction between practice and theory may explain the lack of scholarly consensus and the ambiguity in effectiveness of the practice of development. Using a three-tiered approach, we undertake a comparative analysis of the way in which practitioners and scholars undertake economic development. Through a study of Economic Development Quarterly journal keywords and a review of nine cities' economic development initiatives, we assess the most frequent topics and initiatives within the discipline. Using the International Economic Development Council best practice awards, we look at what is generally viewed as successful.

Projected or realized gains have been broken down by wage levels, household income levels, and race. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the distribution of gains by gender. In parallel, the gender literature has recognized the distribution of economic development activity by income group but not by vacancies. The authors present an evaluation approach-the job chains model-that combines the two. Occupations with a high proportion of women are identified and isolated at each wage level. The authors estimate the proportion of job chain vacancies induced by new female jobs and their welfare impacts. Findings suggest that women are underrepresented in welfare gains associated with both male and female high-wage jobs. The applicability of the authors' approach for evaluating alternative industrial targets is demonstrated.","[Felsenstein, Daniel] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Urban & Reg Studies, IL-91900 Jerusalem, Israel; [Felsenstein, Daniel] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Geog, IL-91900 Jerusalem, Israel; [Persky, Joseph] Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL USA",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Felsenstein, D (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Urban & Reg Studies, IL-91900 Jerusalem, Israel.",msdfels@mscc.huji.ac.il,"Felsenstein, Daniel/JME-1462-2023",,,,,,27,0,1,0,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Using the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics data set and the 2000 decennial census, we investigate the home and work locations of different census block residents in the Twin Cities (Minneapolis-St. Paul) metropolitan area. Our aim is to investigate if people who share a residence neighborhood also share work locations to a degree beyond what would be explained by distance and opportunities around them. Using quadratic assignment procedure we find a significantly higher joint home and work location choice among residents in eight areas selected for this investigation. Further, using data for the entire metropolitan area, we show what socio-demographic variables are associated with higher levels of home-work co-location. We hypothesize that a possible reason for the observed patterns is the role neighborhood level and work place social networks play in locating jobs and residences respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Its focus is the European market for wheat, rye and candles from the middle of the eighteenth century to the eve of the first globalization. Price dispersion for cereals remained constant until the outbreak of the French Wars, then it increased abruptly. It began to decline after the end of the wars, and the process continued steadily until an all-time low was reached in the 1860s. Domestic and international integration contributed in roughly the same proportions to integration in the long run, but the latter was much more important in accounting for medium-term changes. These results suggest that the level of integration was determined for most of the period by war and political events, with a substantial contribution from a fall in transport costs in the second quarter of the nineteenth century. By contrast, there is very little evidence of integration in the market for candles.","European Univ Inst, Robert Schumann Ctr, I-50144 Florence, Italy",European University Institute,"Federico, G (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Robert Schumann Ctr, Via Badia de Roccettini 9, I-50144 Florence, Italy.",Giovanni.Federico@eui.eu,"Federico, Giovanni/J-5310-2014","Federico, Giovanni/0000-0002-2683-683X",,,,,78,37,39,1,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

These resources are then used by the party candidates to enhance the electoral perception of their quality or valence. We construct an empirical model of the United States presidential election of 2008 and employ the electoral perception of the character traits of the two candidates. We use a simulation technique to determine the local Nash equilibrium, under vote share maximization, of this model. The result shows that the unique vote-maximizing equilibrium is one where the two candidates adopt convergent positions, close to the electoral center. This result conflicts with the estimated positions of the candidates in opposed quadrants of the policy space. The difference between estimated positions and equilibrium positions allows us to estimate the influence of activist groups on the candidates. We compare this estimation with that of Israel for the election of 1996, and show that vote maximization leads low valence parties to position themselves far from the electoral origin. We argue that these low valence parties in Israel will be dependent on support of radical activist groups, resulting in a degree of political fragmentation.","[Schofield, Norman; Claassen, Christopher; Ozdemir, Ugur] Washington Univ, Ctr Polit Econ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Zakharov, Alexei] State Univ Higher Sch Econ Moscow, Moscow, Russia",Washington University (WUSTL); HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Schofield, N (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Ctr Polit Econ, 1 Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",schofield.norman@gmail.com; claassen@wustl.edu; uozdemir@artsci.wustl.edu; 3ax@mail.ru,"Ozdemir, Ugur/AAW-9738-2020","Ozdemir, Ugur/0000-0001-6736-7008; Claassen, Christopher/0000-0001-5149-0001",,,,,57,14,16,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,APR,2011,36.0,3-4,,,,,483.0,518,,10.1007/s00355-010-0507-0,0.0,,,36,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,726TZ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287750400006,0

Scholars have investigated when and how employees articulate voice and when and how they will opt for silence. While offering many insights, this analysis is inherently one-sided in its interpretation of silence as a product of employee motivations. An alternative reading of silence is offered which focuses on the role of management. Using the non-union employee representation literature for illustrative purposes, the significance of management in structuring employee silence is considered. Highlighted are the ways in which management, through agenda-setting and institutional structures, can perpetuate silence over a range of issues, thereby organising employees out of the voice process. These considerations are redeployed to offer a dialectical interpretation of employee silence in a conceptual framework to assist further research and analysis.","[Donaghey, Jimmy] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Ind Relat Res Unit, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Cullinane, Niall] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Management, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Dundon, Tony] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, Galway, Ireland; [Wilkinson, Adrian] Griffith Univ, Ctr Work Org & Wellbeing, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",University of Warwick; Queens University Belfast; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Griffith University,"Donaghey, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Ind Relat Res Unit, Social Sci Bldg, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",jimmy.donaghey@wbs.ac.uk,"Wilkinson, Adrian/B-5048-2008; Dundon, Tony/F-4679-2011","Wilkinson, Adrian/0000-0001-7231-2861; Dundon, Tony/0000-0003-1308-5333; Donaghey, Jimmy/0000-0002-5453-8223",ESRC [RES-062-23-1139-A] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [RES-062-23-1139-A] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,65,132,150,6,92,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

In response, governments often adopt innovative institutions that aim to attract greater flows of international investment and trade by changing the institutional environment and limiting the risk to outside investors. One primary example of this is the Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT), aimed specifically at increasing the flow of foreign direct investment (FDI) to developing countries. Yet the literature in political science and economics is inconclusive about whether or not BITs do indeed stimulate FDI, and it provides conflicting theoretical reasoning for the claimed connection. This article argues that BITs do attract FDI to developing countries, but the story is a complicated one. Two important factors must be taken into account. First, BITs cannot entirely substitute for an otherwise weak investment environment. Countries must have the necessary domestic institutions in place that interact with BITs to make these international commitments credible and valuable to investors. Second, as the coverage of BITs increases, overall FDI flows to developing countries increase. However, although remaining positive, the marginal effect of a country's BITs on its own FDI may fall because of heightened competition for FDI from other BIT countries. Using data from 97 countries for 19842007, we provide empirical evidence consistent with both of these theoretical claims.","[Tobin, Jennifer L.] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Rose-Ackerman, Susan] Yale Univ, Sch Law, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Georgetown University; Yale University,"Tobin, JL (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",jlt58@georgetown.edu; susan.rose-ackerman@yale.edu,,,,,,,69,134,155,0,56,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

Focusing on the price for cable modem Internet access, with or without DSL competition, and using the standard deviation of education attainment as a proxy for preference diversity, we find empirical support for these results. In markets where cable competes with DSL, the cable Internet price increases with preference diversity.

We analyze the effectiveness of these mechanisms in promoting safe driving. We derive their theoretical properties with respect to contract time and accumulated demerit points. These properties are tested empirically with data from the Quebec public insurance plan. We find evidence of moral hazard, which means that drivers who accumulate demerit points become more careful because they are at risk of losing their license. An insurance rating scheme introduced in 1992 reduced the frequency of traffic violations by 15%. We use this result to derive monetary equivalents for traffic violations and license suspensions.","[Dionne, Georges; Maurice, Mathieu] HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Pinquet, Jean] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre, Paris, France; [Pinquet, Jean] Ecole Polytech, F-91128 Palaiseau, France",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; Universite Paris Nanterre; Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"Dionne, G (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",,"Dionne, Georges/AAL-6781-2020","Dionne, Georges/0000-0002-0578-1083; PINQUET, JEAN/0009-0007-1399-7806",,,,,19,31,36,1,27,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Forecasting recessions being very important though challenging, recessions in the selected countries are modeled recursively 1-10 quarters ahead out-of-sample using ANNs in conjunction with macroeconomic time series for all the countries. The out-of-sample forecast results show that in general no single macroeconomic variable employed appears to be useful for predicting recessions in any of the series. However, for Armenia, the treasury bill rate, industrial production, money supply, and the spread (the yield curve) are candidate variables for predicting recessions 1-10 quarters ahead. For Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan, the treasury bill rate and money supply series are candidate variables for predicting recessions 1-10 quarters ahead.","Univ Nottingham, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",University of Nottingham Ningbo China,"Kiani, KM (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",mkkiani@yahoo.com,,,,,,,102,5,6,1,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

This hinges on the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis, which sees growth as stemming from improvements in traded sector productivity and associated rises in wages and non-traded prices. Yet, despite extraordinary growth after the mid-1990s China's real exchange rate showed no tendency to appreciate until after 2004. We use a dynamic general equilibrium model to simulate the economy and show that, during this period, trade reforms and a rising national saving rate were offsetting forces in the presence of elastic labour supply. We then examine the possible determinants of the striking transition to real appreciation thereafter, noting mounting evidence that an improved rural term of trade has tightened China's labour market. We show that should the Chinese government bow to international pressure by appreciating the renminbi either via an extraordinary monetary contraction or via export disincentives, the consequences would be harmful for both Chinese and global interests.","[Tyers, Rod; Zhang, Ying] Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia; [Tyers, Rod] Australian Natl Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",University of Western Australia; Australian National University,"Tyers, R (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia.",,,"Tyers, Rodney/0000-0003-3080-0415",,,,,74,17,19,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2011,34.0,2,,,,,265.0,297,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01319.x,0.0,,,33,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,723UR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287533300005,0

A comparison to local appreciation rates shows that in an environment of very low owner occupancy public (re)development projects are opposed the more residents associate them to an increase in area valuation. This effect is, however, not strong enough to explain the localized resistance.

An Examination Across 119 Country Corridors,WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION; BANKING SERVICES; ACCESS; COST,"Remittances are a substantial source of external financing for developing countries that influence many aspects of their development. Though research has shown that remittances are both expensive and price sensitive, little is known about what explains their price. Newly gathered data across 119 country pairs or corridors are used to explore the factors associated with the price of remittances. Corridors with larger numbers of migrants and more competition among providers are found to exhibit lower prices for remittances, when average prices across all types of remittance service providers are considered. Corridors with lower barriers to access banking services and broader regulation of remittance service providers also have lower prices. Remittance prices are higher in richer corridors and in corridors with greater bank participation in the remittance market. Few significant differences emerge when results are compared across banks and, separately, across money transfer operators. However, estimations for Western Union, a leading player in the remittances business, suggest that its prices are less sensitive to competition.

J,"Bosetti, V; Victor, DG",,,,"Bosetti, Valentina; Victor, David G.",,,Politics and Economics of Second-Best Regulation of Greenhouse Gases: The Importance of Regulatory Credibility,ENERGY JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Compared with economically ideal policies, actual limits on global warming gases are likely to be second-best in many ways. Most studies focus on second-best approaches such as delaying emission controls in developing countries, constraining international emission trading, or regulating gases piecemeal by sector rather than equally across the whole economy. We show that another second-best approach-lacking of regulatory credibility-imposes up to six times the extra costs on the economy when compared with all other second-best factors combined. When regulatory rules are not believable then firms and other agents become short-sighted and unable to make optimal investments in research and development as well as long-lived technologies. Although analysts have largely ignored this issue, low credibility is commonplace when governments tackle international problems because international institutions such as treaties are usually weak and fickle. Governments can help solve credibility problems with strategies such as pre-committing regulations into domestic law that is usually more credible than international commitments. We show that China, for example, can justify unilateral, emission controls because such pre-commitment would encourage Chinese firms to invest with a clearer eye to the future.","[Victor, David G.] Univ Calif San Diego, Lab Int Law & Regulat ILAR, Sch Int Relat & Pacif Studies, San Diego, CA USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,,valentina.bosetti@feem.it; david.victor@ucsd.edu,,"bosetti, valentina/0000-0003-4970-0027",BP; Electric Power Research Institute; Climate Impacts and Policy Division of the EuroMediterranean Center on Climate Change,BP; Electric Power Research Institute; Climate Impacts and Policy Division of the EuroMediterranean Center on Climate Change,We thank three reviewers as well as participants at seminars at the IEFE-FEEM series and the Harvard Kennedy School of Government.

Two measures of prenatal health utilization are used to measure healthcare input-the number of prenatal visits and the quality index of health care. Endogeneity in prenatal healthcare utilization is controlled by 2SLS regression. Selection bias of probability of child being weighed is controlled by a binomial probit regression. We found that prenatal healthcare does improve child birthweight. The results of the 2SLS suggest that an additional prenatal visit increases birthweight by about 26 g. or approximately 0.8% of the raw mean of birthweight in the country. Likewise, a unit increase in quality of prenatal healthcare increases birthweight by 21 g or by approximately 1.3% of the birthweight. In general, the magnitude of prenatal care impact in Azerbaijan is comparable with that in other countries. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Although the EPA process has generated widespread critical commentary, few analysts have stopped to consider the motives of individual ACP countries and regions in their approach to the talks. In this article we consider the question of motives in relation to the CARIFORUM-EU EPA. Specifically, it asks why did CARIFORUM feel it necessary or desirable to sign a 'full' EPA, containing numerous provisions not actually mandated by the WTO, when the rest of the ACP was content to sign far less ambitious 'goods only' interim agreements? In order to address this question, the article goes beyond the extant EU-ACP trade literature to build on wider international political economy (IPE) scholarship, which has analysed the actions of developing countries in relation to a whole range of 'WTO-plus' North-South regional and bilateral FTAs. On this basis, the article stands back from the complex details of the agreement to analyse its wider significance, especially in terms of the presumed trade-off between the immediate economic benefits of improved and more secure market access, against the longer term costs of sacrificing the regulatory autonomy, or policy space, deemed necessary to pursue the type of trade and industrial policies deployed successfully in the past by both developed and (some) developing countries. Put simply, the article seeks to ascertain why ultimately CARIFORUM signed an agreement, what it gained from the negotiations and at what cost.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Heron, T (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",,,"Heron, Tony/0000-0002-1237-2624",ESRC [ES/G000255/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G000255/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,46,38,39,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

This is no easy task given the prolific and controversial nature of his life work. His main distinction is as a paradigm breaker and a paradigm maker. Frank is one of the founders of contemporary world system theory. He coined some memorable expressions such as the 'development of underdevelopment' and 'Re-Orient'. Indeed, these two concepts highlight two distinct phases in his work. His first phase is characterised by his writings on dependency theory and his initial understanding of world system theory broadly in line with Amin, Arrighi and Wallerstein. His second phase is distinguished by what he considers to be the 'Eurocentric' interpretation of world system theory of Wallerstein and others as well as by his critique of his own earlier work. While some of Frank's analyses and assertions proved to be wrong, he provided much inspiration to a new generation of scholars and activists, some of whom provided the necessary empirical evidence and theoretical rigour lacking in parts of Frank's work. But he excelled in his mission of providing the big picture, asking the unimaginable questions and exploring hitherto inconceivable interrelationships.","Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, NL-2502 LT The Hague, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Kay, C (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, POB 29776, NL-2502 LT The Hague, Netherlands.",kay@iss.nl,"Kay, Cristóbal/F-7454-2014","Kay, Cristóbal/0000-0002-9727-7596",,,,,53,13,19,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1356-3467,,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

'Rasthali', AAB, Silk subgroup) is highly susceptible to Fusarium wilt, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) race 1. This cultivar is facing extinction in its natural habitat. Transgenic plants of the cultivar were developed by transformation with the antimicrobial peptide (AMP) gene cloned from onion seeds and with constructs developed in pCAMBIA 2301. Apical meristems from in-vitro micropropagated plantlets were microwounded with naked gold particles, followed by co-cultivation with Agrobacterium containing the AMP gene. Rigorous selection in kanamycin 200 mg(-1) took place for 8 months. Around 10% of the transformants that regenerated on the selection medium were further established. Integration of the genes npt II and AMP was confirmed by PCR, RT-PCR and Dot-blot technique. Plants regenerated from the suckers of these plants also tested positive for the presence of the gene by the above procedures. Regeneration and transformation percentage was 10% and 3%, respectively. The non-destructive, rapid bioassay developed by Companioni et al. (2003) was validated and used to screen for Fusarium resistance. Lesion development on leaves from sterile culture filtrates obtained from different incubation periods were studied, and an incubation period of 8 days was found to give maximum lesion development after inoculation. Leaves tested from 10-months old transformed plants had a lesion area of 1.61 mm(2) +/- 0.48 compared to controls with a lesion area of 6.24 mm(2) +/- 0.92. Transformants are being further multiplied for large-scale root challenging with Foc and further selection.","[Mohandas, S.; Manjula, R.; Ajay, K. M.; Sowmya, H.

The first of these agreements was signed with South Korea in October 2010. This article asks how the Commission's Directorate-General (DG) for Trade could successfully conclude this agreement in the aftermath of the Financial Crisis. Given a strong mobilisation of protectionists with access to policy-makers, this liberal policy outcome cannot be explained purely in terms of institutional insulation, as in much of the literature on EU trade policy, nor be simply 'read off' from the material interests of societal actors. This article, therefore, develops a constructivist framework which broadens our understanding of the power of strategically invoked economic discourses. By developing a novel analytical strategy to determine the intentional invocation of such discourses, it is able to show how DG Trade constructed an ideational imperative for liberalisation in Global Europe, enabling it to overcome opposition to the EU-Korea FTA. Beyond its contribution to constructivist scholarship, this article draws attention to the neglected dimension of ideas in trade policy and highlights the continued purchase of neoliberalism after the crisis.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Sheffield S10 2TU, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Siles-Brügge, G (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Northumberland Rd, Sheffield S10 2TU, S Yorkshire, England.",g.siles-brugge@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Siles-Brugge, Gabriel/0009-0004-6340-3218",,,,,86,39,40,1,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

'Yueyoukang 1' (AAA, Cavendish) is a cultivar highly resistant to Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense race 4, but its yield is lower and its growth cycle longer than other commercial cultivars. In this study, an embryogenic cell suspension (ECS) of this cultivar was mutated with chemical mutagenic agents sodium azide (NaN3) and ethyl methane sulphomate (EMS). This was followed by plant regeneration via somatic embryogenesis. The aim was to optimise the dosage (concentration and duration) of the agents for obtaining desirable mutants with higher yield potential and shorter growth cycle. The effects of treatment duration of EMS (0.2%, v/v) and the concentration of NaN3 (treatment duration was 30 min) on the plant regeneration capacity of ECS were investigated. The plant regeneration capacity decreased with an increase in NaN3 concentration. When the concentration of NaN3 was 5.42 mmol/L, the plant regeneration capacity of treated ECS was 50% of that obtained in the control (LD50 of NaN3 = 5.42 mmol/L). The effect of EMS treatment on the plant regeneration capacity of ECS was also remarkable. When the ECS was treated with 0.2% EMS for 10 minutes, the plant regeneration capacity was even higher than that of the control. But the plant regeneration capacity decreased with increasing treatment duration. The amount of plants obtained per gram of ECS treated with 0.2% of EMS for 18.1 min was 50% of that obtained in the control (LD50 of EMS = 18.1 min). The dosages at LD50 are suggested to be used for the generation of mutants with improved yield and growth cycle.","[Xu, C. X.; Xiao, J.; He, J. G.; Hu, G. B.; Chen, H.

The study uses a linear mixed model to demonstrate that many of the factors influencing attendance hold true with respect to television demand. Furthermore, many of the factors influencing demand for the aforementioned leagues hold true for the National Football League. Team quality, tenure in the market, and games contested in primetime all increased ratings, while income and sharing a market were negatively associated with ratings.

Inside the domain defined by all these possible outcomes, we apply the axiomatic theory of bargaining and select the Nash solution of cooperative games. The solutions vary according to the objective functions adopted by the trade negotiators. When real income is the objective and services are excluded, or when optimising terms of trade is the objective, the Nash solution is the status quo. Trade liberalisation is feasible only when the negotiators focus on national exports or gross domestic product (GDP). Our assessment of some possible solutions reveals that excluding members having a GDP below a certain threshold improves the bargaining process, regardless of the governments' objective. Formation of coalition, such as the G20, constitutes an option for its members to block outcomes imposed by rich members. We also find that side payments may be a solution, but represent a very high share of the global income gain.","[Bouet, Antoine; Laborde, David] IFPRI, Washington, DC USA; [Bouet, Antoine] Univ Pau, Ctr Analyse Theor & Traitement Donnees Econ, Pau, France",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Universite de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour,"Bouet, A (通讯作者)，IFPRI, Washington, DC USA.",,"Laborde, David/D-6408-2015","Laborde, David/0000-0003-3644-3498; Bouet, Antoine/0000-0002-8020-8877",,,,,30,6,6,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2010,33.0,11,,,,,1486.0,1516,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01302.x,0.0,,,31,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,685GB,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284616100006,0

By application of a standard panel regression approach and a quasi-experimental research design, we find no compelling evidence for a significant impact of the introduction as well as the weakening of the legislation on revenues of bars and restaurants. Consumption pattern has either not changed at all or any reduction in spending by smokers is compensated for by a corresponding increase by non-smokers. These findings support the German and similar non-smoking legislations in the sense that positive externalities resulting from reduced health care cost are likely to outweigh the risk to businesses in the hospitality sector.","[Ahlfeldt, Gabriel M.] LSE, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AR, England; [Maennig, Wolfgang] Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, Chair Econ Policy, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Hamburg,"Ahlfeldt, GM (通讯作者)，LSE, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AR, England.",g.ahlfeldt@lse.ac.uk; w.maennig@econ.uni-hamburg.de,,"Maennig, Wolfgang/0000-0002-7590-6793; Ahlfeldt, Gabriel/0000-0001-5664-3230",,,,,35,8,8,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

A centerpiece of current research is the identification of rules that individuals invoke when processing information in stated choice (SC) experiments. These rules may be heuristics used in everyday choice making as well as manifestations of ways of coping with the amount of information shown in choice experiment scenarios. In this paper, using the latent class framework, we define classes based on rules that recognise the non-attendance of one or more attributes, as well as on the addition and the parameter transfer of common-metric attributes. These processing strategies are postulated to be used in real markets as a form of cognitive rationalization. We use a SC data set, where car driving individuals choose between tolled and non-tolled routes, to translate this new evidence into a willingness to pay (WTP) for travel time savings, and contrast it with the results from a model specification in which all attributes are assumed to be attended to and are not added up with parameter preservation. We find that the WTP is significantly higher, on average, than the estimate obtained from the commonly used full relevance and attribute preservation specification.","[Hensher, David A.] Univ Sydney, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Fac Econ & Business, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Greene, William H.] NYU, Stern Sch Business, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA",University of Sydney; New York University,"Hensher, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Fac Econ & Business, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",davidh@itls.usyd.edu.au; wgreene@stern.nyu.edu,,"Hensher, David/0000-0003-0058-2242",,,,,30,124,135,0,19,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Officials admit that certain sectors experienced substantial price increases, but they claim that the overall inflation rate did not increase. This paper investigates whether inflation in 15 European countries experienced a structural break after the euro was introduced using new powerful and serial correlation robust test statistics. We find evidence that the European Monetary Union (EMU) countries experienced a positive break in inflation after 1999. Our results demonstrate that inflation just after the introduction of the euro was higher relative to the inflation just prior to the introduction of the euro. Additionally, we find no evidence of positive breaks for the non-EMU countries when the euro was introduced.","Trent Univ, Dept Econ, Peterborough, ON K9A 4S6, Canada",Trent University,"Shiamptanis, C (通讯作者)，Trent Univ, Dept Econ, 1600 W Bank Dr, Peterborough, ON K9A 4S6, Canada.",cshiamptanis@trentu.ca,,,,,,,30,3,3,0,8,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Careers and job shifts now follow a 'de-standardised' pattern, they argue, in which people incessantly switch between divergent occupations, education, training and benefits, all propelled by a socially-induced reflexivity that knows no class bounds. Empirical assessments of this bold assertion have, so far, been far from supportive but, being chiefly quantitative in orientation, leave many important questions unanswered. This paper, starting out from a theory of class indebted to the late Pierre Bourdieu, draws on a qualitative research project examining the life histories of 55 individuals to fill in the gaps and demonstrate how work trajectories, despite changes that have taken place, are still driven along class tracks by class motors.","Univ Bristol, Dept Sociol, Bristol BS8 1UQ, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Atkinson, W (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Dept Sociol, 12 Woodland Rd, Bristol BS8 1UQ, Avon, England.",w.atkinson@bristol.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/G026947/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G026947/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,32,60,72,1,37,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Parameterizing both the degree of ambiguity and the degree of pessimism allows one to examine how the two interact to impact choice, which is useful regardless of the application. Applying this model to religious choice is a move beyond subjective expected-utility theory, allowing us to show that a change in either the degree of ambiguity or the degree of pessimism can lead a decision maker to convert from one religion to another.","[Melkonyan, Tigran; Pingle, Mark] Univ Nevada, Reno, NV 89557 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno,"Melkonyan, T (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",tmelkonyan@cabnr.unr.edu,"Melkonyan, Tigran/ISR-9270-2023",,,,,,34,4,5,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,SEP,2010,69.0,3,,,,,417.0,438,,10.1007/s11238-009-9164-0,0.0,,,22,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,627WL,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280074600005,0

The knowledge of consumption process is fundamental either to the firm - in order to improve commercial strategies - or to competition authorities - with the purpose of implementing more effective policies. From the analysis carried out it emerges that flowers and ornamental plants consumption in the Mezzogiorno regions is characterised by a high penetration index and - just with regard to some commodities - by a low purchase frequency. Purchase - mainly in specialized flower shops - is made both to satisfy personal requirements and as a present for special occasions. With the only exception of flowers, consumption is not tied to specific occasions. In the Mezzogiorno regions this sector is actually showing a good growth potential in both productive and consumption terms. It is of primary importance to carry out actions consisting in an improvement of information and awareness among consumers about flowers and ornamentals, and a more diversified supply of products in order to get into the modern distribution chains.","[Schimmenti, Emanuele; Asciuto, Antonio; Galati, Antonino; Valenti, Marco] Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Econ Sistemi Agro Forestali ESAF, I-90133 Palermo, Italy",University of Palermo,"Schimmenti, E (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Econ Sistemi Agro Forestali ESAF, I-90133 Palermo, Italy.",,"Asciuto, Antonio/ABB-3819-2020; Asciuto, Antonio/IAM-2785-2023; Galati, Antonino/H-5838-2012; Schimmenti, Emanuele/L-8917-2015","Galati, Antonino/0000-0003-0753-2934; Schimmenti, Emanuele/0000-0001-7376-7606",,,,,28,10,10,0,1,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,SEP,2010,9.0,3,,,,,36.0,46,,,,,,11,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,703PC,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285989700006,0

However, broader tests of why and when states delegate are not possible without a clear means for objectively identifying and measuring delegation. This paper develops a metric for delegation based upon the services the agent provides to its principals and the resources and autonomy it has to provide those services. This numerical metric is continuous and generalizable to a wide variety of principal-agent relationships. This paper then demonstrates the face validity of the measure with case studies of delegation to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The paper concludes with a test of Realist and Institutionalist hypotheses for cooperation using the delegation metric, demonstrating the complexity of the underlying reasons we observe delegation.","Temple Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Brown, RL (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",brownrl@temple.edu,,,,,,,92,36,37,1,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

We evaluate forecast performance using out-of-sample predictions from 1996 to 2004. We find that the Edo model can provide forecasts that are competitive with those of Federal Reserve staff. Taken together with the fact that the Edo model has also proved useful in answering a range of policy questions, this suggests a significant and broad role for richly specified DSGE models in the toolbox of central bank models.

A significant contribution of this paper is that we are, for the first time, able to break down FDI by country of origin to observe whether the behaviour of MNEs differs by region of origin. We find that sunk entry costs and firm characteristics are important factors in explaining a firm's decision to export. Another important determinant is the ownership structure of the firm, with foreign-owned firms having a higher probability of exporting than domestically owned firms, although this differs across country of ownership with potentially important policy implications. Export platform FDI is used to explain the behaviour of foreign firms that invest in Thailand. Using three measures of total factor productivity, we also find that highly productive firms self-select into the export market. The implication for governments of developing countries is the need to think carefully about how and to whom they target their inward FDI policies as a means of growth. The heterogeneous behaviour of multinationals from different nations means that policies targeting specific regions or countries may be preferable to general tax concessions or the implementation of special economic zones that are open to all.","[Cole, Matthew A.; Elliott, Robert J.

Typically in North America, a state of provincial transportation department controls freeways while another agency at the municipal or city level controls the nearby arterials. While the different segments of the corridor fall under different jurisdictions, traffic and users know no boundaries and expect seamless service. Common lack of coordination amongst those authorities due to lack of means for information exchange and/or possible bureaucratic 'institutional grid-lock' could hinder the full potential of technically-possible integrated control. Such institutional gridlock and related lack of timely coordination amongst the different agencies involved can have a direct impact on traffic gridlock. One potential solution to this problem is through integrated automatic control under intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Advancements in ITS and communication technology have the potential to considerably reduce delay and congestion through an array of network-wide traffic control and management strategies that can seamlessly cross-jurisdictional boundaries. Perhaps two of the most promising such control tools for freeway corridors are traffic-responsive ramp metering and/or dynamic traffic diversion possibly using variable message signs (VMS). Technically, the use of these control methods separately might limit their potential usefulness. Therefore, integrated corridor control using ramp metering and VMS diversion simultaneously might be synergetic and beneficial. Motivated by the above problem and potential solution approach, the aim of the research presented in this paper is to develop a self-learning adaptive integrated freeway-arterial corridor control for both recurring and non-recurring congestion. The paper introduces the use of reinforcement learning, an Artificial Intelligence method for machine learning, to provide optimal control using ramp metering and VMS routing in an integrated agent for a freeway-arterial corridor. Reinforcement learning is an approach whereby the control agent directly learns optimal strategies via feedback reward signals from its environment. A simple but powerful reinforcement learning method known as Q-learning is used. Results from an elaborate simulation study on a key corridor in Toronto are very encouraging and discussed in the paper. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that the long-run development of housing markets is determined by real disposable percapita income, the real long-term interest rate, population growth, and urbanization. The differential development of real housing prices in Canada and Germany is attributed to the fundamentals in these two countries. Canada and Germany are characterized by relatively low average growth rates of real disposable income and relatively high interest rates, resulting in depressed housing prices over a long period of time. Institutional structure accentuates these tendencies. Given the importance of housing wealth for private consumption, our paper aims at drawing the attention of policymakers to the necessity of preventing not only overheating but also overcooling of the housing market that entails lower economic growth rate.","[Kholodilin, Konstantin A.] DIW Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Menz, Jan-Oliver] Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ & Polit, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Siliverstovs, Boriss] ETH, KOI Swiss Econ Inst, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; University of Hamburg; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Kholodilin, KA (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",kkholodilin@diw.de; janmenz@web.de; boriss.siliverstovs@kof.ethz.cb,"Kholodilin, Konstantin/ABA-7108-2021; Kholodilin, Konstantin/AAI-9535-2020; Siliverstovs, Boriss/T-2405-2019","Kholodilin, Konstantin/0000-0001-7165-0228;",,,,,42,8,9,0,15,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

A growing body of empirical evidence suggests that this ad hoc approach performs quite well. It has previously been argued that such a procedure works because it amounts to a sophisticated interpolation tool. We show that this is the case in a formal, asymptotic sense. In addition, we conduct some simulations which allow us to examine the importance of the sample size, the order of the polynomial, and the recalibration frequency in controlled settings. We also apply the ABS approach to daily S&P 100 index options to show that the procedure outperforms the Black-Scholes formula in valuing actual option prices out-of-sample.","Univ Houston, Houston, TX 77004 USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston,"Berkowitz, J (通讯作者)，Univ Houston, Houston, TX 77004 USA.",jberkowitz@uh.edu,,,,,,,17,8,8,0,11,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1081-1826,,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

Being different from the empirical results of the conventional unit root tests without structural breaks, the empirical results of the endogenous two-break LM unit root test support the existence of ripple effects for each city in Taiwan except Taipei City. Shocks to regional house prices of Taipei City cannot ripple out across the nation, because Taipei City is a regional global city which has resulted in higher house prices, but does not affect the house prices of the entire area. Furthermore, the empirical evidence demonstrates the breakpoints and presents real estate policies, financial crises, and natural disease that can cause structural breaks of regional house prices.","Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan",National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology,"Chien, MS (通讯作者)，Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci, Dept Finance, 415 Chien Kung Rd, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan.",cms@cc.kuas.edu.tw,,,,,,,45,52,56,0,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

We use a secondary panel data food consumption of urban residents at the provinces (municipalities) level to examine the trends in FAFH during 2000-2008. Particularly, we use fixed effects regression model to analyze the main factors through which people's food-away-from-home expenditure and regional propensity to consume are affected. We find that, nowadays income is the most important socio economic factors that determine the food-away-from-home consumption of urban residents, and people's FAFH consumption is highly elastic, the income elasticity of FAFH is higher in the low income group than that in the medium and high income group. Additionally, people's consumption propensity towards dining out in western China is somewhat higher than that in eastern and central regions in China.

Uncertainty about parameters describing preferences and technology implies uncertainty about the model's dynamics, utility-based welfare criterion and the natural rates of output and interest that would prevent absent nominal rigidities. We estimate the degree of uncertainty regarding natural rates due to parameter uncertainty. We find the optimal Taylor rules under parameter uncertainty respond less to the output gap and more to price inflation than would be optimal absent parameter uncertainty. We also show that policy rules that focus solely on stablilizing wages and prices yield welfare outcomes very close to the first-best. (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons.

Only towards the end of the examined period have Romania's export patterns begun to resemble those of the more advanced Central and East European countries, reflecting the more important role played by intra-industry exports of differentiated products, the gradual transition from labour intensive, low valued-added exports to more technology-intensive ones and the improvement in product quality.","Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Haar, LN (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Booth St W, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England.",laura.n.haar@mbs.ac.uk,"xue, zhe/C-2203-2012","Haar, Laura/0000-0001-6800-2801",,,,,55,8,8,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0966-8136,,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2010,62.0,5,,,,,779.0,805,PII 922843658,10.1080/09668136.2010.481386,0.0,,,27,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,609VO,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000278686200003,0

A wide-ranging 'liquidity crisis' is typically traced to the collapse of prices in markets for assets backed by or derived from the repayments of American subprime mortgagors, while public authorities are said to have responded by 'restoring liquidity' to markets in these now 'distressed' and 'toxic assets'. Here the category of performativity is developed to enable a critical investigation of liquidity. The performance of liquidity in booming subprime markets is shown to have turned on the affirmation and exemplification of wider norms present in wholesale asset markets, and upon specific calculative and emotional valuations of risk through underwriting procedures, bond rating and hedging. However, the performance of liquidity contained its other, illiquidity, and this surfaced in subprime markets because asset prices symbolised risk valuations which could not capture incalculable future uncertainties. As the crisis broke, talk of liquidity and illiquidity licensed particular policy responses and closed down wider political debate.","Northumbria Univ, Dept Social Sci, Sch Arts & Social Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England",Northumbria University,"Langley, P (通讯作者)，Northumbria Univ, Dept Social Sci, Sch Arts & Social Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England.",paul.langley@northumbria.ac.uk,,"Langley, Paul/0000-0002-1924-7711",,,,,64,33,38,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

We value the fuel flexibility of PHEVs by representing the purchase of the battery as the purchase of a strip of call options on the price of transportation. We use a Kalman filter to obtain maximum likelihood estimates for three gasoline price models applied to a U.S. municipal market. We find that using a real options approach instead of a discounted cash flow analysis does not raise the retail price at which the battery pays for itself by more than $50/kWh (or by more than 15%). A discounted cash flow approach often provides a good approximation for PHEV value in our application, but real options approaches to valuing PHEVs' battery capacity or role in climate policy may be crucial for other analyses.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Lemoine, DM (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, 310 Barrows Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",dlemoine@berkeley.edu,,"Lemoine, Derek/0000-0002-1298-9472",National Science Foundation; Dennis J.

Furthermore, the concept and model of ecological footprint pressure index (EFPI) as well as the grade system of regional ecological security was put forward based on ecological footprint so as to analyze the regional ecological security, and some measures to slow down the growth of the ecological footprint and maintain the regional ecological security were put forward at last. The following results were obtained. (1) It is feasible to analyze regional ecological security based on EFPI, which can reflect the degree of ecological security from two respects of carrying capacity and pressure. (2) Among 10 years from 1995 to 2004, the per capita ecological capacity of Shandong province appears to be a reducing tendency, the per capita ecological footprint shows an increasing tendency. The per capita ecological deficit appears an increasing tendency.

Single-family home sales from January 2004 to August 2006 are collected and used in a hedonic price function to estimate the changes in the value of amenities, and structural, neighborhood and geographic characteristics, including the mean elevation of each property. Elevation, which buyers did not know for certain prior to the storm, but may now be inferred from water level marks in most neighborhoods, is found to have a positive relationship with selling prices. Results indicate that pre-Katrina, there was a premium of only 1.4% per foot in flood-prone areas, and was insignificant in areas not subject to flooding. This increased to 4.6% for flooded areas after Katrina. These findings are attributed to not only the perceived risk of flooding, but also to the potential of higher compliance costs associated with rebuilding under more stringent National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) guidelines.","[McKenzie, Russell] SE Louisiana Univ, Coll Business, Hammond, LA 70402 USA; [Levendis, John] Loyola Univ, Dept Econ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA",University of Louisiana System; Southeastern Louisiana University; Loyola University New Orleans,"McKenzie, R (通讯作者)，SE Louisiana Univ, Coll Business, SLU 10813, Hammond, LA 70402 USA.",russell.mckenzie@selu.edu; jlevendi@loyno.edu,,,,,,,24,40,51,0,40,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Classically, individual differences have been investigated using personality tests but, recently, neuroscience methods are providing a novel point of view through which this aspect can be better understood. Here, we present a study in which participants play a gambling task by choosing between a first option that constantly yielded a small gain and a second option that provided either a larger gain or a loss. While participants performed the task, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in order to investigate brain activity during the gambling task. Two groups were analysed post hoc: The first group was more risk-prone, while the second group was more risk-averse. The Feedback Related Negativity (FRN) occurring between 250 and 450 millisecond after decision outcomes, was differentially affected in the two groups. In addition, source analyses indicated that distinct brain areas are responsible for such a difference: Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) is more activated in risk-prone group, while Dorso-Lateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) is more activated in risk-averse group. Our results show that risk-taking behaviour is related to differential activations in the brain.

The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) ushered in a new era of high standards of intellectual property protection, requiring profound and costly domestic institutional changes in many, many countries. International market regulation has increasingly penetrated domestic regulatory environments in ways that have compromised domestic political bargains. Historical institutionalism can help to explain the emergence of a global regime for intellectual property protection as a product of institutional change in the US.

Hirai's work is important because he frees the transition from the 'Keynesian' interpretation, under which Keynes is thought to discover the rationale for fiscal policy and move to 'output adjustment' from 'price adjustment'. I go further and argue that previous interpretations have greatly misunderstood the nature of the General Theory. Keynes was primarily concerned with the cause of economic malfunction, and monetary measures for its prevention. The processes central to both the Treatise and the General Theory concerned interest, investment and saving. The transition concerned the abandoning of the classical and long-run equilibrium relationship that underpinned the Treatise and the move to the psychological propensities - the marginal propensity to consume, the marginal efficiency of capital and the schedule of liquidity preference - that were foundation to the General Theory. The steps that led to this discovery are detailed and the importance of the contributions of Keynes's colleagues are re-evaluated in the light of the reduced emphasis on fiscal considerations.",,,,Geoff.Tily@hmtreasury.gsi.gov.uk,,,,,,,49,3,3,0,5,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

We conjecture that China's accession into the World Trade Organization (WTO) has not enhanced the prospect of Chinese firms successfully defending themselves against antidumping suits initiated by the US for three reasons. First, the rather dramatic expansion in US-China trade and, in particular, in US imports from China, has led US antidumping authorities to more aggressively pursue antidumping cases against China. Second, WTO membership has resulted in increasing US investment in China, thus undercutting the competitive advantage of some small domestic firms relative to those that have invested in the Chinese market, and leading the former to lobby more rigorously for protection from Chinese imports. Third, as China has agreed to the non-market economy (NME) designation in antidumping investigations for up to 15 years upon accession, its NME status has led US antidumping authorities to apply more stringent criteria in antidumping investigations. We support our argument with statistical analyses of the pattern of US antidumping initiation and adjudication against China.","[Zeng, Ka] Univ Arkansas, Dept Polit Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Liang, Wei] Monterey Inst Int Studies, Grad Sch Int Policy Management, Monterey, CA 93940 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Zeng, K (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Dept Polit Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",,,,,,,,38,10,10,1,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

In consideration of the poor knowledge of farmers, the prior short-term objective should be the education of farmers on food safety issues. The extension activities should be started up for the sake of a continuous education and knowledge traffic. The Current farming practices should be inspected by the raw milk buyers; furthermore, as prescribed by law, all stakeholders working in the sector must be systematically inspected by the Ministry of Agriculture.

In spite of criticisms levelled at the Canadian government's decision to float the dollar, the remarkable feature of the behaviour of the exchange rate during the so-called float is the relative stability of the nominal exchange rate, and the small volatility in its movements. This article stresses the impact of foreign exchange intervention in limiting exchange rate appreciations and in moderating exchange rate volatility, using newly found, and heretofore unused, intervention data. Until now, all studies of Canada's experience with the float have relied on official foreign exchange reserves data. A counterfactual experiment also suggests that nominal exchange rate levels, and variability, would have been different had there been no foreign exchange market intervention.","[Siklos, Pierre L.] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 2C5, Canada; [Siklos, Pierre L.] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Viessmann European Res Ctr, Waterloo, ON N2L 2C5, Canada",Wilfrid Laurier University; Wilfrid Laurier University; Viessmann European Research Centre,"Siklos, PL (通讯作者)，Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 2C5, Canada.",psiklos@wlu.ca,,,,,,,50,2,2,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

In the case of excess demand high transaction costs and inefficient allocation resulted from multiple applications. In a decentralized matching market the number of these applications could be reduced by increasing the number of those prospective applicants which are able to calculate their chance of admission as nearly certain or as almost without a prospect. Of special interest for this calculation are the percentage of accepted applicants and the cut off grades of the admissions procedures in the past. A cut off grade will be the more suitable for the purpose of prognosis as the applicant can foresee her or his own performance (e.g. assessed with points) in the admission procedure; and if it can be stated to which extent the cut off grade will react to varying numbers of applicants. The universities should be obliged to publish the relevant key figures, and they should abstain from selection procedures causing high uncertainty to the applicant's endeavours for prognosis.","Univ Karlsruhe TH, Zentrum Informat & Beratung, D-76133 Karlsruhe, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Müller, C (通讯作者)，Univ Karlsruhe TH, Zentrum Informat & Beratung, Zahringerstr 65, D-76133 Karlsruhe, Germany.",christoph.mueller@zib.uni-karlsruhe.de,,,,,,,30,0,0,1,3,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

This paper uses newly available representative longitudinal data covering the years 1995 to 2004 to document for the first time the extent of product diversification in German manufacturing enterprises and the role of single- and multi-product firms. In 2004 about 60 percent of all enterprises were multi-product firms, producing 4.4 products on average. Multi-product firms are more often found among the larger enterprises. In 2004 the share of multi-product enterprises in total sales and total exports was 81 percent and 84 percent, respectively. Enterprises producing a large number of products are a rare species - only about three percent of all firms produce more than ten different products. This extent of product diversification is rather stable over the time period under consideration. The empirical investigation demonstrates that compared to single-product firms multi-product firms are larger, have a higher productivity, and both a higher human capital intensity and research and development intensity. These characteristics of multi-product firms do exist before single-product enterprises turn to multi-product enterprises. Therefore, and in accordance with the resource view, they can be considered as determinants of product diversification at the firm level.","Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Inst Volkswirtschaftslehre, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg,"Wagner, J (通讯作者)，Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Inst Volkswirtschaftslehre, Scharnhorststr 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany.",wagner@leuphana.de,"Wagner, Joachim/D-8156-2012; Wagner, Joachim/AAF-4949-2020","Wagner, Joachim/0000-0001-6058-4536;",,,,,34,4,4,0,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Given the increasing mobility of labour, especially of high-skilled people and expatriates, it is interesting to see to what extent labour income taxes and social security contributions determine migration flows. We collect data on personal income tax profiles for 49 economies and the year 2002. In particular, we determine the component of labour taxes which is borne by employers and that which is borne by employees, following the OECD's Taxing Wages Approach. For the latter, we calculate the progressivity of personal income tax rates between the average wage and five times the average wage. This may be interpreted as the tax progression which is relevant for well-paid workers. Then, we use the personal income tax variables to estimate their effect on bilateral stocks of expatriates into OECD countries and the migration of skilled workers into these countries. Personal income tax rates turn out to have a robust negative effect on cross-border flows of skilled workers in the OECD.","[Radulescu, Doina Maria] Univ Munich, Ctr Econ Studies, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Egger, Peter] GEP Univ Nottingham, Nottingham, England; [Egger, Peter] Oxford Ctr Business Taxat, Oxford, England",University of Munich; Ifo Institut; University of Nottingham; University of Oxford,,,"Radulescu, Doina/R-6762-2018","Radulescu, Doina/0000-0002-9708-2502; Egger, Peter/0000-0002-0546-1207",,,,,17,21,23,2,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,SEP,2009,32.0,9,,,,,1365.0,1379,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01213.x,0.0,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,487YV,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000269316500006,0

This may serve to produce a distorted picture of wage cyclicality. Here, we employ frequency domain methods that allow us to assess the relative contribution of cyclical frequency bands on real wage earnings. Earnings are decomposed into standard and overtime components. We also distinguish between consumption and production wages. Frequency domain analysis is carried out in relation to wages alone and to wages in relation to output and employment cycles. Our univariate analysis suggests that, in general, the dominant cycle followed by output, employment, real consumer and producer wages and their components is 5-7 years. Consistent with previous findings reported in the macro-level literature, our bi-variate results show that the various measures of the wage are generally not linked to the employment cycle. However, and in sharp contrast with previous macro-level studies we find strong procyclical links between the consumer wage and its overtime components and the output cycle, especially at the 5-7 years frequency. Observed real wages are not constant over the cycle, but neither do they exhibit consistent pro- or counter-cyclical movements. This suggests that any attempt to assign systematic real wage movements a central role in an explanation of business cycles is doomed to failure.

It is the first to do so using household level data. The data are unusually detailed, chronicling the movements of household heads from birth to time of enumeration. Using Poisson regression analysis, we are able to investigate the characteristics that influence the number of moves undertaken by the household head. Using the Poisson results, we find that more moves in search of employment lead to less wealth accumulation. Although this result appears to be counterintuitive, it supports theories of migration in less developed countries. We also find that households headed by men are in general less likely to move than those headed by women, which could reflect differential ownership rights implicit in Ugandan law. This finding is reversed, however, when moves are limited to those in search of employment. This suggests that men, being the primary providers when they are the household head, are likely to move more in search of employment.","[Knight, John R.] Univ Pacific, Eberhardt Sch Business, Stockton, CA 95211 USA; [Balihuta, Arsene M.] Makerere Univ, Kampala, Uganda",University of the Pacific; Makerere University,"Knight, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Pacific, Eberhardt Sch Business, 3601 Pacific Ave, Stockton, CA 95211 USA.",bherrin@pacific.edu; jknight@pacific.edu,,,,,,,32,5,5,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Since our setup features internationally mobile firms, trade frictions, and asymmetric country sizes, it offers a convenient framework within which to investigate how differences in market size and deepening international integration affect equilibrium outcomes under competing tax principles. The origin principle, when compared to the destination principle, is shown to exacerbate tax competition and to erode tax revenues, yet gives rise to a more equal spatial distribution of economic activity. This suggests that federations which care about spatial inequality, like the European Union, face a non-trivial choice for their tax principle that goes beyond the standard considerations of tax revenue distribution.

Data constraints in prior investigations have left this an unresolved empirical question in the cash holdings literature. The baseline results show that REIT cash holdings are inversely related to funds from operations, leverage, and internal advisement and are directly related to the cost of external finance and growth opportunities. Cash holdings are also negatively associated with credit line access and use.

In this paper, agents' preferences for neighborhood mix are represented by bid-rent functions, and lots are allocated to the highest bidders. The agent-based simulation model shows that segregation occurs even if households prefer integrated neighborhoods, and the inefficiency of segregation is shown by a lower aggregate willingness to pay for land. The degree of segregation (measured by the dissimilarity index and the entropy index) varies with the share of agents who are indifferent about neighborhood mix. Several public policies-random assignment of agents to lots, minority subsidies, and side payment from neighborhood associations-promote integration and increase the aggregate willingness to pay for land.

However, due to delays in economic reforms, Iranian car exports have not increased as much as production. This paper presents a first estimation of the Iranian export potential in the car industry. Based on new theoretical developments of the gravity equation, an empirical bilateral trade model is proposed. It includes sectoral variables (car production, import tariffs), as well as other original variables, such as expectations and hysteresis. We then develop a dataset which includes the 40 major car-exporting countries in the world, 34 importing countries, a 10-year time period as well as four car production groups. The model is then estimated by using alternative panel data estimators, such as those of Hausman and Taylor and dynamic estimators as well as transformed variables estimators. Export potential is finally calculated from the residuals of the model. Results show that Iranian current car exports are about 100 times less than their fitted values. This indicates that there is a significant export potential for Iran, especially toward India, China, Russia, as well as smaller neighbours (Turkey, Pakistan, Central Asian countries). As a result, Iran could become the major auto supplier in the Middle East. However, this requires the completion and success of ongoing economic reforms.","[Abedini, Javad] Univ Nantes, F-44035 Nantes, France; [Abedini, Javad] Sharif Univ Technol, Tehran, Iran; [Peridy, Nicolas] Univ Sud Toulon Var, Toulon, France",Nantes Universite; Sharif University of Technology,"Abedini, J (通讯作者)，Univ Nantes, F-44035 Nantes, France.",,,,,,,,40,10,10,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2009,32.0,5,,,,,790.0,818,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2008.01153.x,0.0,,,29,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,440QD,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000265713900006,0

Chichilnisky proved that a rational continuous social choice must be discontinuous in her setting. Our paper revisits her theorem to trace the source of this discontinuity. We find that the discontinuity is irrelevant to social aggregation, per se. The main theorem states that there exist a number of continuous social utility maps which are anonymous and satisfy the Pareto condition. As a corollary, we show that there exist corresponding continuous social welfare functions, if singularity is not separated from regular preferences in social preference topology. This extends the possibility result of Jonnes-Zhang-Simpson on linear preferences, to the general ones. The notion of singularity of preferences, relative to the given mathematical structure of an alternative space, is carefully studied.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Math, Taipei 106, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Huang, WHU (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Math, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",yshhng@yahoo.com,,,,,,,12,2,2,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,MAY,2009,32.0,4,,,,,635.0,686,,10.1007/s00355-008-0342-8,0.0,,,52,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,418GG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000264136100005,0

This paper evaluates the impact of one such area-based initiative on employment, The New Deal for Communities (NDC) program aids financially residents of 39 of the most deprived neighborhoods in the country to design and implement policies that could tackle unemployment and improve their living conditions. Using the difference-indifference method the paper shows that the program increased the probability of jobless individuals entering employment in NDC areas compared to residents living in similar deprived areas used as control group. The program had the greatest effect on those who were in job-training, full time education and in receipt of incapacity benefit before the program began. If the NDC program increased the supply of skilled labor and encouraged inactive individuals to join the labor force, individuals in NDC areas already in employment could as a result be displaced into unemployment or less well paid jobs. However, the evidence presented here shows that the program did not cause displacement effects among those residents who were already employed in NDC areas before the program began.

The overall data are related to 20 benchmark European cities, but also include brief comparisons with other cities around the world. The tool used to obtain the information was a web searcher with similar characteristics to a travel agency, which allows booking via the Internet. The amount of data thus collected was much greater than could have been produced from any other available information source, enabling a more robust and detailed analysis. 'Yield management', as used by airlines, especially as it relates to price discrimination and 'peak load pricing', drives hotel prices. An overview of differences among the main types of customer is provided, distinguishing mainly between those travelling for financial reasons and those travelling for pleasure. The results reveal that 'sun-and-beach' destinations, especially abundant in southern European countries, and in particular in Spain, usually offer cheap prices. However, the best-known southern cities present prices in accordance with the price lists of the rest of Europe and, in some cases, their prices are even higher than those in some Nordic cities.

Firstly, management transplantation and the relationship between parent and subsidiary companies were defined in this paper, and the dimensions of the relationship between parent and subsidiary companies were developed on the basis of relevant theories including the structure of,property rights, cultural compatibility, the control mechanism, trust degree and the subsidiary role. Then the relationship between the parent-subsidiary relationship and the management transplantation was analyzed, and on the basis of which the model of the relationship between the parent-subsidiary relationship and the management transplantation was built. At last, we found that the structure of property rights, cultural compatibility, control mechanisms, trust degree and the subsidiary role have a direct impact on the management transplantation, and the relationship between the parent-subsidiary relationship and the management transplantation is moderated by the absorptive capacity of the subsidiary and the characteristics of management knowledge.","[Cao Zhoutao; Yuan Xiaoting] S China Univ Technol, Sch Business Adm, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China",South China University of Technology,,,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,3,SICHUAN UNIV PRESS,CHENGDU,"29 WANGJIANGLU, JIUYANQIAO, CHENGDU, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5614-4376-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,843.0,849,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BKP51,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268879300123,0

The goal of the paper is to find out if the growth in export is of intensive or extensive type. We follow methodology of Kehoe and Ruhl (2002) and use detailed trade statistics on the value of trade flows by commodity according to Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) codes. We find out that the goods that were traded the least in the benchmark year account for disproportionate share in trade after liberalization and reduction of trade barriers. The most significant increase was found in Hungary. The set of goods which accounted for only ten percent of trade in 1993 accounts for about forty percent of trade following the liberalization. Similar patterns were identified also in other Visegrad countries. The countries thus began to export goods that they had not been previously trading. This is growth on the extensive margin and it should be reflected in models of international trade.,"[Hlousek, Miroslav] Masaryk Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,,hlousek@econ.muni.cz,"Hlousek, Miroslav/G-8508-2013","Hlousek, Miroslav/0000-0001-9118-6792",,,,,7,3,3,0,0,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-1963-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,125.0,130,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BNO76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275146900022,0

These coefficients are evaluated in the years 2000 and 2006. The technology for evaluation of regional competitiveness is based on application of two methods of multi-criteria decision making. The first one is the classical Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) where relevance of criteria's significance is determined by the method of Ivanovic deviation. The second method - FVK is a multiplicative version of AHP. The results of both methods are compared with the simple averaging.

The article seeks to account for this paradoxical divergence in state responses to financial crisis conditions and in so doing help compensate for the paucity of crisis response studies in the literature; it seeks to explain why states with numerous similarities are nonetheless responding differently. The evidence appears to confirm that EMs are more likely to implement a significant range of reforms where the 'antecedents of good governance' are positive (see below); conversely, where the antecedents of EM governance are negative, attempts to implement the requisite regulatory changes have foundered. In either case, an interaction effect with degree of democracy is discernable with respect to each of the antecedents of good governance. Without the domestic forms called for here, not to mention necessary reforms of the international financial architecture, a contagion of even global proportions is not only possible but probable.","Tulane Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA",Tulane University,"Stacey, J (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",,,,,,,,93,2,2,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

I follow the revenue from gift, inheritance and estate taxes in Sweden over more than a century. Second, I focus on a unique episode during the second half of the 1940s when gifts and gift tax revenue exploded. I have access to aggregate tax revenue data since 1884. Moreover, I have constructed a rich micro-data set of all gifts reported during the period 1942-9 in one county. A first main result is that gifts, inheritances and estates were never important sources of tax revenue. Tax revenue as a share of GDP and total government revenue had already reached peaks in the 1930s. The role of these taxes has instead primarily been equity and to provide integrity for other tax bases. Second, expectations were important. Gift tax revenue during the 1940s started to increase long before a new estate tax and increased wealth taxation were decided and implemented. The increase began even before the legislative process started. Third, economic power and economic control were important. Parents gave to their children to avoid taxes, but only when the expected gain became large enough and in ways that left them with as much economic power as possible.","[Ohlsson, Henry] Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Ohlsson, Henry] UCFS, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Ohlsson, H (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, Box 513, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden.",henry.ohlsson@nek.uu.se,"Ohlsson, Henry/A-7017-2008","Ohlsson, Henry/0000-0001-8826-0410",,,,,19,12,12,1,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1361-4916,,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

This increase has been attributed to a desire by these countries to self-insure themselves against financial shocks. The rise in reserves may also reflect their concerns about the size of their IMF quotas, which set limits on the amount of credit that countries could draw from the IMF, and the conditionality associated with borrowing from the IMF. We offer a model of the choice by central banks between quotas and reserves to demonstrate that emerging markets will choose to hold relatively more reserves than advanced economies. We then investigate the impact of IMF quotas on reserve holdings for a panel of countries during the period of 1980-2006. In addition to finding evidence of precautionary and mercantilist motives for holding reserves in emerging markets, we also find that reserves in these countries have been inversely related to their IMF quotas.","[Joyce, Joseph P.] Wellesley Coll, Dept Econ, Wellesley, MA 02481 USA; [Razo-Garcia, Raul] Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",Wellesley College; Carleton University,"Joyce, J (通讯作者)，Wellesley Coll, Dept Econ, 106 Cent St, Wellesley, MA 02481 USA.",jjoyce@wellesley.edu; raul_razo-garcia@carleton.ca,,,,,,,41,3,4,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

The amount of wheat produced was analysed with respect to the production amount of the previous period, to the land devoted to wheat production and the producer price. The dynamics of the long-run equilibrium led to the incorporation of a cointegration modelling. The findings indicated that farmers are not responsive to the price changes and the wheat supply is shaped according to structural characteristics of wheat production. The short-run equilibrium is offset by more than 90% in the current period, which was shaped by the past decisions on price, production amount and production lands. This means that the long-run equilibrium is reached by more than 90% in the period concerned.","[Ozkan, Burhan; Ceylan, R.

We consider three kinds of models: the deterministic and the stochastic growth model and a simple heterogenous agent model. Each model is solved with six different algorithms: (1) simple value function iteration as compared to (2) smart value function iteration neglects the special structure of the problem. (3) Full and (4) modified policy iteration are methods to speed up convergence. (5) linear and (6) cubic interpolation between the grid points are methods that enhance precision and reduce the size of the grid. We evaluate the algorithms with respect to speed and accuracy. Accuracy is defined as the maximum absolute value of the residual of the Euler equation that determines the household's savings. We demonstrate that the run time of all algorithms can be reduced substantially if the value function is initialized stepwise, starting on a coarse grid and increasing the number of grid points successively until the desired size is reached. We find that value function iteration with cubic spline interpolation between grid points dominates the other methods if a high level of accuracy is needed.","[Heer, Burkhard] Free Univ Bolzano Bozen, Sch Econ & Management, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy; [Maussner, Alfred] Univ Augsburg, Dept Econ, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano; University of Augsburg,"Heer, B (通讯作者)，Free Univ Bolzano Bozen, Sch Econ & Management, Piazza Univ, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy.",Burkhard.Heer@unibz.it; alfred.maussner@wiwi.uni-augsburg.de,,,,,,,17,0,1,0,8,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

However, the recent collapse of housing prices and the resulting negative impact on local government budgets suggest that it may be opportune to rethink this strategy. In this paper we document the overall decline in property values in the United States in recent years, and we find that the impact is in the aggregate negative but that the impact varies significantly by state and by locality. We also examine the impact on local government revenues, and we again find substantial regional and local variation. Indeed, our data indicate that substantial numbers of local governments seem to have avoided the significant and negative budgetary impacts seen most clearly for state and federal governments, at least to date. We then focus specifically on the State of Georgia, in order to determine the ways in which local governments have responded to the economic recession. Our empirical analyses indicate that there are several factors causing changes in property tax revenues, but the dominant factor is changes in housing prices, with some significant lags. We conclude that local government reliance on the property tax has in fact been an advantage for many local governments in the current economic environment, and that such reliance is likely to - and should - continue in at least some form for the immediate future.

The focus is on the practice of the monitoring committees (MCs), the primary institutional expression of partnership in the distribution of Structural Funds. The main findings are that in each country NGO participation in the MCs remained contentious, the working of the committees was rather formalistic, and the bodies' purpose and role conceptions were ambiguous. The implication is that partnership as currently practised does not live up either to normative expectations suggested by the EU regulation of the committees or to the expectations of civil society partner organizations themselves.","[Batory, Agnes] Cent European Univ, Dept Publ Policy, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary",Central European University,"Batory, A (通讯作者)，Cent European Univ, Dept Publ Policy, Nador 9, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary.",batorya@ceu.hu,"Batory, Agnes/J-7014-2019",,,,,,34,24,24,0,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

State governments have the ability to alter funding to higher education mostly through general fund contributions and earmarked revenue. This paper examines trends in state higher education appropriations, with a specific focus on the relationship between these two funding sources. We find that on average, total appropriations have actually increased over the past decade, and moreover, earmarked revenue has constituted an increasing share of higher education funding, while general fund contributions have been declining. Our regression analysis suggests that the magnitude of the fungibility between the two sources is substantial, but somewhat surprisingly, does not differ across recessions and expansions.

One facet of the recession is the precipitous fall in housing values that is expected to have long-lasting effects on local government finance. Throughout the United States and Europe, local officials have not experienced challenges of this magnitude in generations. How might we expect local government finances to respond/evolve in the wake of the crisis? We gain insight on this question by studying city finance in a state that has struggled for years. In particular, many Michigan cities have experienced significant and ongoing fiscal challenges for at least a decade and acute crisis over the last several years. We examine how expenditure patterns have changed in response to these challenges. Using data for most cities in Michigan for years 2005 through 2009, we find that expenditures in the General Government, Public Works, and Parks and Recreation categories were responsive to fiscal stress, and Capital Expenditures have been particularly vulnerable. However, expenditures in essential services such as Public Safety were generally not adversely affected. Our research offers insights regarding the likely implications of the real estate crisis for cities in the United States as well as in Europe that have, until very recently, enjoyed relative economic prosperity and limited fiscal challenges.

Invoking the two trader types of fundamentalists and chartists, it comprises four features: price determination by excess demand; a herding mechanism that gives rise to a macroscopic adjustment equation for the population shares of the two groups; a rush towards fundamentalism when the price misalignment becomes too large; and, finally, differently strong noise components in the demand per chartist and fundamentalist trader, which implies a structural stochastic volatility in the returns. The estimation is performed using the method of simulated moments. Combining it with bootstrap and Monte Carlo methods, it is found that the model cannot be rejected by the empirical daily returns from a stock market index and a foreign exchange rate. Measures of the matching of the single moments are satisfactory, too, while the behavioural parameters are well identified and are able to discriminate between the two markets.","[Franke, Reiner] Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Westerhoff, Frank] Univ Bamberg, Bamberg, Germany",University of Kiel; Otto Friedrich University Bamberg,"Franke, R (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany.",franke@iksf.uni-bremen.de,"Westerhoff, Frank/GSN-6357-2022; Westerhoff, Frank/F-2933-2015; Westerhoff, Frank/ABG-4984-2021","Westerhoff, Frank/0000-0003-1666-4103; Westerhoff, Frank/0000-0003-1666-4103;",,,,,24,39,39,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Interventions to change transport behaviour, and especially to reduce car use, could reduce CO2 emissions from road transport more quickly than technological measures. It is unclear, however, which interventions are effective in reducing car use and what the likely impact of these interventions would be on CO2 emissions. A two-stage systematic search was conducted focusing on reviews published since 2000 and primary intervention evaluations referenced therein. Sixty-nine reviews were considered and 47 primary evaluations found. These reported 77 intervention evaluations, including measures of car-use reduction. Evaluations of interventions varied widely in the methods they employed and the outcomes measures they reported. It was not possible to synthesise the findings using meta-analysis. Overall, the evidence base was found to be weak. Only 12 of the 77 evaluations were judged to be methodologically strong, and only half of these found that the intervention being evaluated reduced car use. A number of intervention approaches were identified as potentially effective but, given the small number of methodologically strong studies, it is difficult to draw robust conclusions from current evidence. More methodologically sound research is needed in this area. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigate whether neighborhoods with high levels of income dispersion attract economically diverse in-migrants. If recent in-migrants to mixed-income neighborhoods exhibit high levels of income dispersion, this is consistent with stable mixed-income neighborhoods. If, however, mixed-income neighborhoods are comprised of homogenous low-income (high-income) cohorts of long-term residents combined with homogenous high-income (low-income) cohorts of recent arrivals, this is consistent with neighborhood transition. Our results indicate that neighborhoods with high levels of income dispersion do in fact attract a much more heterogeneous set of in-migrants, particularly from the tails of the income distribution. Our results also suggest that the residents of mixed-income neighborhoods may be less heterogeneous with respect to lifetime income. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This new scenario requires an increased level of information, innovation and technology if tourism firms are to remain competitive. In particular, information and communication technologies (ICTs) can provide competitive advantages by improving a firm's knowledge of its own internal structures and of the milieu in which it is operating. This study therefore identifies and analyses the critical external factors that influence innovation and ICT investment in hotel businesses by evaluating the impact of hotel investment strategies. The methodological approach taken is an adaptation of the PESTEL model to the particular case of hotel management. This model identifies the factors (political, economic, social, environmental, technological and legal) that affect any given organization. The authors also apply Porter's 'five forces model', which assesses the competitive environment in which firms act, taking into account the power of buyers, intermediaries, current and potential competitors and substitutive products. The study area is the region of Madrid (MAC), since this has only lately emerged as a major tourist destination and its hotel market is recent and of medium to high quality.","[Pulido Fernandez, Juan Ignacio] Univ Jaen, Dept Econ, Jaen 23071, Spain; [Saez Cala, Antonia] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Econ Struct & Dev Econ, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Figueroa Domecq, Cristina] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Dept Enterprise Econ, Madrid 28032, Spain",Universidad de Jaen; Autonomous University of Madrid; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Fernández, JIP (通讯作者)，Univ Jaen, Dept Econ, Campus Las Lagunillas S-N, Jaen 23071, Spain.",jipulido@ujaen.es; antonia.saez@uam.es; cristina.figueroa@urjc.es,"Figueroa-Domecq, Cristina/J-6067-2017","Figueroa-Domecq, Cristina/0000-0002-1225-2825; Pulido-Fernandez, Juan Ignacio/0000-0002-9019-726X",,,,,54,28,34,5,85,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Aggregate cross-country data show that tourism specialisation is likely to be associated with higher per capita GDP growth rates than those observed in industrialised countries. However, this evidence ignores the importance of institutional quality and results are likely to be biased by omitted variable problems. In this paper we frame our starting question within the general debate about the importance of good/bad institutions as fundamental determinants of economic growth (Acemoglu et al., 2001) and ask whether previous positive results of tourism on growth are in fact driven by the presence of growth-enhancing institutions. Our empirical analysis exploits newly available datasets and controls the robustness of previous results on growth and tourism in the presence of several institutional quality variables. By means of descriptive statistics and some simple cross-country regressions we confirm that the quality of institutions is important for growth. Yet our results strongly suggest that the weight of tourism in an economy is an independent and robust predictor of higher-than-average growth.","[Brau, Rinaldo] Univ Cagliari, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy",University of Cagliari,"Brau, R (通讯作者)，Univ Cagliari, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy.",,"Brau, Rinaldo/P-9157-2019","Brau, Rinaldo/0000-0002-6032-0773",,,,,44,17,17,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2011,34.0,3,,,,,444.0,472,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01320.x,0.0,,,29,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,737CM,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288546100006,0

We assume that agents use different behavioral rules prescribing how to play the game conditionally on the outcome of previous rounds. We update the fraction of the population using each rule by means of a general class of evolutionary dynamics based on imitation, which contains both replicator and logit dynamics. Our model is analyzed by a combination of formal analysis and numerical simulations and is able to replicate results from the experimental and computational literature on these types of games. In particular, irrespective of the specific evolutionary dynamics and of the exact behavioral rules used, the dynamics of the aggregate participation rate is consistent with the symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, whereas individual behavior clearly departs from it. Moreover, as the number of players or speed of adjustment increase the evolutionary dynamics typically becomes unstable and leads to endogenous fluctuations around the steady state. These fluctuations are robust with respect to behavioral rules that try to exploit them.","[Dindo, Pietro] Scuola Super Sant Anna, LEM, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Tuinstra, Jan] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Quantitat Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Tuinstra, Jan] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business, CeNDEF, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; University of Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam,"Dindo, P (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Sant Anna, LEM, Piazza Martiri della Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.",p.dindo@sssup.it; J.Tuinstra@uva.nl,"Tuinstra, Jan/H-4197-2011; Dao, Rock/E-5736-2014; Dindo, Pietro/GLT-2286-2022; DINDO, Pietro/U-4679-2017","DINDO, Pietro/0000-0002-8563-8630; Tuinstra, Jan/0000-0001-6156-4940",European Commission [CIT3-CT-2005-513396],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"We thank Cees Diks, Cars Hommes, Bill Sandholm, Yang Zhang and an anonymous referee for constructive comments and Peter Heemeijer for providing us with the experimental data used in Sect. 2.

In 1994, a major tax reform was undertaken and central-local sharing arrangements were deeply modified; the evolutions of regional public expenditure in the years following the reform deserve to be analysed. The issue is relevant for two additional reasons. First, income inequality is becoming a relevant issue and it is therefore important to understand whether the Chinese government is pursuing some kind of redistribution policy. Second, an analysis of the local expenditure dynamics might provide some important information concerning the objectives and the behaviour of the Chinese government. The article considers a set of structural, political and socio-economic variables to analyse the determinants of local public expenditure in 30 Chinese regions over the period 1995-2007. The results reveal that redistribution seems not to be a priority for the Chinese government: expenditure is higher in richer and more internationally open regions, and the only redistribution evidence that emerges is related to urban-rural disparities.","[Guggiola, Gabriele] Univ Insubria, Varese, Italy; [Guggiola, Gabriele] Ctr Ric & Documentaz Luigi Einaudi, Turin, Italy",University of Insubria,"Guggiola, G (通讯作者)，Univ Insubria, Varese, Italy.",,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2011,34.0,3,,,,,404.0,423,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01332.x,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,737CM,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288546100004,0

Additional evidence suggests that firm debt capacity varies systematically with the unique operating and financing mechanisms employed by REITs. These results are robust across both aggregate firm debt levels and marginal security issuance decisions.

The article uses the endogenous business cycle theories of Wicksell, Mises, Schumpeter, Hayek and Minsky to show how ostensible counter-cyclical monetary policies are asymmetric, as central banks are less willing to raise interest rates in booms than cut them when bubbles collapse. After interest rates have fallen towards zero, fiscal policy is called on which sooner or later becomes bounded by extraordinary debt to GDP ratios. Central banks hesitate to raise interest rates even in the face of a partial economic recovery because the cost of public debt service would become prohibitive. The economies then languish at very low interest rates that encourage low productivity real investments and a continual threat of bubbles in asset and raw material markets. This makes them unable to deal with further macroeconomic shocks.","[Hoffmann, Andreas; Schnabl, Gunther] Univ Leipzig, Inst Econ Policy, Leipzig, Germany",Leipzig University,"Hoffmann, A (通讯作者)，Univ Leipzig, Inst Econ Policy, Leipzig, Germany.",,,,,,,,26,25,26,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2011,34.0,3,,,,,382.0,403,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01334.x,0.0,,,22,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,737CM,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288546100003,0

Holding constant total compensation, standard reasoning suggests that supplemental savings should depend negatively on the sum of the employer and employee pension contributions. Contrarily, we find that the supplementary savings of professors are significantly more sensitive to employee contributions than to employer contributions. This asymmetry is consistent with different marginal propensities to save out of the salary and pension components of compensation.

In this paper we use a broad sample of forecasts of German GDP and its components to analyze the impact of institutions and information on forecast accuracy. We find that forecast errors are a linear function of the forecast horizon, which serves as an indicator of the information available at the time a forecast is produced. This result is robust over a variety of different specifications. As better information seems to be the key to achieving better forecasts, approaches for acquiring reliable information early seem to be a good investment. By contrast, the institutional factors tend to be small and statistically insignificant. It has to remain open, whether this is the consequence of the efficiency-enhancing competition among German research institutions or rather the reflection of an abundance of forecast suppliers.","[Doehrn, Roland; Schmidt, Christoph M.] RWI, D-45128 Essen, Germany; [Doehrn, Roland] Univ Duisburg Essen, Duisburg, Germany; [Schmidt, Christoph M.] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Bochum, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen; Ruhr University Bochum,"Döhrn, R (通讯作者)，RWI, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.",doehrn@rwi-essen.de; schmidt@rwi-essen.de,,,,,,,13,13,13,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

In particular, the EU Stability and Growth Pact contains the obligation to formulate stability programmes over four years, covering a general economic outlook as well as the projected development of public finances. However, the current practice of performing medium-term economic projections is unsatisfactory from a methodological point of view as the applied methodology has been developed for short-run forecasting and it is questionable whether these methods are useful for the medium term. In particular, currently medium-term projections are mostly based on the neoclassical So low growth model with an aggregate production function with labour, capital and exogenous technological progress. It might be argued, however, that for medium-run projections endogenous growth models might be better suited. In this paper we give an overview of currently used methods for medium-term macroeconomic projections. Then we analyse the performance of medium-term forecasts for Austria to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the typical approach. In particular, the five-year projections of real GDP growth, inflation and the unemployment rate are investigated.

Existing combination approaches typically obtain combined forecasts by linearly weighting individual forecasts. The approach presented here instead uses survey forecasts in the estimation stage of a time series model. Thus an estimate of the model parameters is obtained that reflects two sources of information: a history of realizations of the variables that are involved in the time series model and survey expectations on the future course of the variable that is to be forecast. The idea at the estimation stage is to shrink parameter estimates towards values that are compatible (in an appropriate sense) with the survey forecasts that have been observed. It is exemplified how this approach can be applied to different autoregressive time series models. In an empirical application, the approach is used to forecast the three-month Euribor at a six-month horizon.","[Krueger, Fabian; Pohlmeier, Winfried] Univ Konstanz, Fachbereich Wirtschaftswissensch, D-78464 Constance, Germany; [Mokinski, Frieder] ZEW, Abt Int Finanzmarkte & Finanzmanagement L 7, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany",University of Konstanz; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Krüger, F (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Fachbereich Wirtschaftswissensch, Univ Str 10, D-78464 Constance, Germany.",Fabian.Krueger@uni-konstanz.de; Mokinski@zew.de; Winfried.Pohlmeier@uni-konstanz.de,,"Kruger, Fabian/0000-0002-5112-9037",,,,,27,1,1,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

The analysis reveals that membership in a union was significantly correlated with well-integrated markets. We also examine whether currency unions were endogenous. Our results indicate that where unions were established, markets had been significantly better integrated already in the preceding period. In addition, we show that currency unions created by autonomous merchant towns were better integrated than unions implemented by territorial rulers. The overall implication is that monetary diversity was a corollary of weakly integrated markets in late Medieval Central Europe. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In order to operate effectively, public institutions must also inspire confidence in those they serve. We use data from the Gallup World Poll, a unique and very large global household survey, to document a quantitatively large and statistically significant negative correlation between corruption and confidence in public institutions. This suggests an important indirect channel through which corruption can inhibit development: by eroding confidence in public institutions. This correlation is robust to the inclusion of a large set of controls for country and respondent-level characteristics. Moreover we show how it can plausibly be interpreted as reflecting at least in part a causal effect from corruption to confidence. Finally, we provide evidence that individuals with low confidence in institutions exhibit low levels of political participation, show increased tolerance for violent means to achieve political ends, and have a greater desire to vote with their feet through emigration.","[Clausen, Bianca; Kraay, Aart] World Bank, Dev Econ Res Grp, Washington, DC USA",The World Bank,"Kraay, A (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Econ Res Grp, Washington, DC USA.",bclausen@worldbank.org; akraay@worldbank.org; znyiri@gmfus.org,,,,,,,53,87,104,1,47,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

Annual time series estimates are provided not only by country but also, for the region, by commodity and by policy instrument. The findings reveal the considerable extent of policy reform over the past two decades, especially through reducing export taxation; but they also reveal that national policies continue to reduce trade and economic welfare much more in Sub-Saharan Africa than in Asia or Latin America.","[Croser, Johanna L.; Anderson, Kym] Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Anderson, Kym] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA",University of Adelaide; The World Bank,"Anderson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",johlou@gmail.com; kym.anderson@adelaide.edu.au,"Anderson, Kym/G-7292-2012","Anderson, Kym/0000-0002-1472-3352",,,,,18,0,0,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

The classification of species and clones is hampered by the traditional morphology-based taxonomy, with limited knowledge on specific molecular characteristics of individual taxons. The phylogeny of the Musaceae has never been fully resolved, and the accuracy of the current classification system is a common point of debate among the scientific community. Different types of molecular markers have been used to investigate the diversity at various taxonomic levels within Musa species and have reached various degrees of success in terms of phylogenetic reconstruction. The phylogenetic history of Musaceae as a part of the order Zingiberales was investigated in previous studies (Kress et al., 2001). However, within the family Musaceae itself, few papers have addressed this question (Lescot et al., 2008; Boonruangrod et al., 2008) and the evolutionary relationships remain fuzzy. This paper is an overview of molecular-based approaches that have been employed by our research group in an attempt to shed more light on Musaceae diversity and evolutionary relationships, and thereby serve for the classification and development of reliable markers for unambiguous banana species identification.","[Nemcova, P.; Hribova, E.; Valarik, M.; Dolezel, J.] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Expt Bot, Lab Mol Cytogenet & Cytometry, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Experimental Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Nemcová, P (通讯作者)，Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Expt Bot, Lab Mol Cytogenet & Cytometry, Prague, Czech Republic.",,"Valárik, Miroslav/F-6129-2014; hribova, eva/F-7291-2014; Dolezel, Jaroslav/B-7716-2008","Valárik, Miroslav/0000-0003-0143-6853; Hribova, Eva/0000-0002-6868-4344",,,,,27,1,1,0,3,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-66051-38-6,ACTA HORTIC,,,2011,897.0,,,,,,139.0,142,,,,,,4,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BGR16,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000323851200014,0

The Evolution of Global Bilateral Migration 1960-2000,WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Global matrices of bilateral migrant stocks spanning 1960-2000 are presented, disaggregated by gender and based primarily on the foreign-born definition of migrants. More than one thousand census and population register records are combined to construct decennial matrices corresponding to the five census rounds between 1960 and 2000. For the first time, a comprehensive picture of bilateral global migration over the second half of the 20th century emerges. The data reveal that the global migrant stock increased from 92 million in 1960 to 165 million in 2000. Quantitatively, migration between developing countries dominates, constituting half of all international migration in 2000. When the partition of India and the dissolution of the Soviet Union are accounted for, migration between developing countries is remarkably stable over the period. Migration from developing to developed countries is the fastest growing component of international migration in both absolute and relative terms. The United States has remained the most important migrant destination in the world, home to one fifth of the world's migrants and the top destination for migrants from some 60 sending countries. Migration to Western Europe has come largely from elsewhere in Europe. The oil-rich Persian Gulf countries emerge as important destinations for migrants from the Middle East and North Africa and South and Southeast Asia. Finally, although the global migrant stock is predominantly male, the proportion of female migrants increased noticeably between 1960 and 2000. The number of women rose in every region except South Asia.

The bulk of these studies pertain to industrial countries or global economic issues. However, the human, environmental and financial impact of market deregulation is arguably more devastating in the 'developing' countries than in the core. A question thus arises: do Polanyi's reflections on progressive alternatives to liberalism clarify contemporary debates on development alternatives in the Global South? I contend that democratic socialism - Polanyi's preferred remedy to the 'demolition' of society and nature occasioned by market civilisation - is problematical in light of what we have learned from the twentieth century, but his framework for evaluating alternatives - featuring the re-embedding of economy in society - remains as powerful as ever, I support this argument with an exploration of socialism and social democracy - as well as community - based alternatives arising from 'reciprocity'.

A few Musa schizocarpa and Australimusa accessions were included as outgroups. The domestication of edible bananas involves three taxonomic groups: M. acuminata ssp. banksii/errans, M. acuminata ssp. malaccensis/microcarpa/zebrina/burmanica/siamea group and M. balbisiana. Plantains (AAB) and several ABB bananas most likely originated through a hybridisation event between M. acuminata ssp. errans (or more generally the M. acuminata ssp. banksii group) and M. balbisiana. Most AAB bananas such as 'Mysore' and some BBA bananas such as 'Pisang Awak' are the result of hybridisation between M. acuminata ssp. non-banksii and M. balbisiana. Most edible sweet bananas (AA and AAA dessert) are derived from hybridisations between subspecies within the M. acuminata non-banksii group. Several unique SNPs have been identified in these bananas and East African highland bananas (AAA) that so far have not been found in any of the wild M. acuminata accessions in the International Transit Center (ITC) collection. A search for these SNPs in the wild Musa populations would shed light on the original location of the hybridising populations that gave rise to the edible bananas. The variable contribution of parents at different genetic loci indicates that most edible bananas are not direct hybrids, but have gone through a few or several generations of backcrossing. Some diversity has been found in M. balbisiana. The M. balbisiana involved in the origin of plantains, other AAB bananas and ABB 'Monthan' group is distinct from the M. balbisiana involved in the origin of BBA 'Pisang Awak' group. A thorough study of the genetic diversity within M. balbisiana throughout its area of distribution is deemed necessary. The implications for breeding of edible bananas are discussed.","BIOTEC Natl Sci & Technol Dev Agcy, Khlongluang 12120, Pathumthanee, Thailand",National Science & Technology Development Agency - Thailand; National Center Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology (BIOTEC),"Volkaert, H (通讯作者)，BIOTEC Natl Sci & Technol Dev Agcy, Thailand Sci Pk, Khlongluang 12120, Pathumthanee, Thailand.",,"Volkaert, Hugo Alfried/J-2430-2019",,,,,,24,3,5,1,9,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-66051-38-6,ACTA HORTIC,,,2011,897.0,,,,,,143.0,152,,,,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BGR16,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000323851200015,0

Viewing a tourist destination as a brand, the CBBE model has been applied recently to tourism studies and incorporates the notions of perceptual brand equity and behavioural brand equity from the marketing literature. This study proposes the destination brand equity model by incorporating various antecedents, including perceived service quality, destination awareness and destination image as the perceptual brand equity, and destination loyalty as the behavioural brand equity. A relationship model between perceptual brand equity components, tourist satisfaction and destination loyalty is constructed and applied to Mongolia as a tourist destination. The study's results in general confirm the causal relationship between perceptual brand equity and behavioural brand equity. More specifically, a relationship path is identified: destination awareness -> destination image -> perceived quality -> satisfaction -> destination loyalty.

We use a data set encompassing all A, AA, and AAA minor league teams from 1992 to 2006 and find a positive relationship between a minor league team's winning percentage and attendance. We also find evidence that minor and MLB are substitutes as increased ticket prices for the nearest MLB team lead to higher minor league attendance if that team is within 100 miles. Similarly, we find that during the MLB strike, minor league attendance increased. Finally, we find that a local or regional MLB team's winning percentage only has a positive impact on minor league attendance when they are affiliated clubs.","[Gitter, Seth R.; Rhoads, Thomas A.] Towson Univ, Dept Econ, Towson, MD 21252 USA",University System of Maryland; Towson University,"Rhoads, TA (通讯作者)，Towson Univ, Dept Econ, Towson, MD 21252 USA.",trhoads@towson.edu,,,,,,,18,40,48,0,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Conditionality may give rise to a commitment problem: once the proffered benefits are granted, the target's incentive for continued compliance declines. In this paper, I document a mechanism by which conditionality may induce compliance even after these benefits are distributed. If conditionality alters the composition of domestic interest groups in the target state, it may induce permanent changes in the target government's behavior. I construct a dynamic model of lobbying that demonstrates that conditionality can reduce long-term levels of state capture. And I test the model's predictions using data from the accession of Eastern European countries to the EU.","NYU, Wilf Family Dept Polit, New York, NY 10012 USA",New York University,"Hollyer, JR (通讯作者)，NYU, Wilf Family Dept Polit, 19 W 4th St,2nd Floor, New York, NY 10012 USA.",james.hollyer@nyu.edu,,,,,,,57,6,7,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

We define core dimensions and determinants of Neighbourhood Europeanization and implement this analytical framework for the case of Ukraine. The analysis clearly demonstrates substantial asymmetries in ENP policy across the three dimensions we chose - democracy promotion, economic co-operation and JHA, which clearly reflect the inconsistency of the ENP concept: top-down formulation of EU interests combined with weak conditionality. ENP inconsistencies could however be overcome through widening linkages and improving financial support to mobilize and strengthen positive local support of EU demands and rewards.","[Schweickert, Rainer] Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Gawrich, Andrea; Melnykovska, Inna] Univ Kiel, D-24098 Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Kiel,"Schweickert, R (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Hindenburgufer 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",Rainer.schweickert@ifw-kiel.de,,"Gawrich, Andrea/0000-0002-2132-5619",,,,,49,63,70,1,45,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Our SWRs satisfy Fixed-step Anonymity. First, we characterize them by using the consistency, called Weak Fixed-step Indifference Consistency, which links indifference for infinite utility streams to indifference for their truncated vectors that are taken periodically. Second, we characterize another utilitarian extension, called S-overtaking SWR, by replacing the consistency with Fixed-step Anonymity. The S-overtaking SWR is a subrelation of the fixed-step overtaking SWR. Meanwhile, the leximin counterpart of the S-overtaking SWR coincides with the fixed-step W-leximin SWR, and we obtain its alternative characterization using Fixed-step Anonymity. Finally, we generalize the impossibility of combining Fixed-step Anonymity with the catching-up SWR by showing the Pareto and strong consistency axioms satisfied by the catching-up SWR come in conflict with Fixed-step Anonymity.","[Kamaga, Kohei; Kojima, Takashi] Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1698050, Japan",Waseda University,"Kamaga, K (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Shinjuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishi Waseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan.",k-kmg@ruri.waseda.jp; tkojima@ruri.waseda.jp,,"Kamaga, Kohei/0000-0001-8281-7193",,,,,34,10,10,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,SEP,2010,35.0,3,,,,,377.0,392,,10.1007/s00355-010-0445-x,0.0,,,16,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,637MI,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280821700002,0

We mitigate the small-sample problem, which is especially acute for the NMS, by using a Bayesian estimation that combines information across countries. The impulse responses in the NMS are broadly similar to those in the euro area countries.

For the Prussian province of Westphalia, we estimated a translog production function to determine the contribution of intensification and technical change from 1830 to 1880. Additionally, we present evidence on the impact that neutral and biased technical change had on growth. Furthermore, we examine whether spatial differences can be identified concerning the sources of agricultural growth and whether they followed a von Thuenen pattern around the demand centre of the rising industrial belt on the Ruhr River. In addition, we explain why, under the conditions of pre-industrial agriculture, regions with the highest output growth did not necessarily have to exhibit the most dynamic TFP-growth, even if they contributed, on average, the most to output growth.","[Kopsidis, Michael; Hockmann, Heinrich] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Kopsidis, M (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Theodor Lieser Str 2, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany.",kopsidis@iamo.de; hockmann@iamo.de,", IAMO/G-2328-2012",,,,,,62,7,9,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

The analysis proceeds in three steps. First, longitudinal data on workers are used to estimate time-varying individual income risk parameters in various manufacturing sectors. Second, the estimated income risk parameters and data on trade barriers are used to analyze the relationship between trade policy and income risk. Finally, a simple dynamic incomplete-market model is used to assess the corresponding welfare costs. In the implementation of this methodology using Mexican data, we find that trade policy changes have a significant short-run effect on income risk. Further, while the tariff level has an insignificant mean effect, it nevertheless changes the degree to which macroeconomic shocks affect income risk.","[Krebs, Tom] Univ Mannheim, D-6800 Mannheim 1, Germany; [Krishna, Pravin] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",University of Mannheim; Johns Hopkins University,"Krebs, T (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, D-6800 Mannheim 1, Germany.",,,"Krebs, Tom/0000-0002-2500-4118",,,,,35,13,16,0,8,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

The answer to this central question can be found in a framework of the interaction of university products and necessary factors for technology-based economic development. The bundled nature of university products makes it impossible to separately assess the impact of universities on their regional economies. The National Science Foundation's ranking of top research universities and retrospective data on academic R&D expenditures are used in regression models to measure universities' long-term effects over the phases of the latest business cycle. The pattern of statistical significance and the signs of the regression coefficients suggest that the presence of research universities has a positive effect on metropolitan economies above cyclical economic changes. The effect differs depending on the scale of university R&D expenditures and suggests that the most prominent research universities have a stronger impact on their regional economies.,"Cleveland State Univ, Maxine Goodman Levin Coll Urban Affairs, Ctr Econ Dev, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA",University System of Ohio; Cleveland State University,"Lendel, I (通讯作者)，Cleveland State Univ, Maxine Goodman Levin Coll Urban Affairs, Ctr Econ Dev, 2121 Euclid Ave,UR 355, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA.",iryna.lendel@gmail.com,,,,,,,50,52,63,2,50,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

In our attempt to answer that question, time series data in the Penn World Table 6.1 are aggregated across countries to obtain a measure of world trade and output, and the total number of GATT/WTO member countries is employed as an explanatory variable to account for the impact of multilateral trade agreements, such as the Kennedy Round, Tokyo Round, and the Uruguay Round, on the trade-growth nexus. We then examine the relationship between world trade and the post-war GDP per worker across the world through the multivariate cointegration and error correction modeling and the Granger causality test. The results suggest that, at the global level, the post-war liberalization of multilateral trade has promoted both GDP and trade activities. There is also evidence that supports the export-led growth hypothesis in the world economy.","[Chan, Kenneth S.] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, Jiulong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Dang, Vinh Q.

In the first, structural approach we use a physical model of solar radiation to measure the amount of energy collected by a vineyard and then to establish the econometric relation between energy and vineyard quality. Coupling this hedonic function with the physics of heat and energy permits a calculation of the impact of any temperature change on vineyard quality (and prices). In a second approach, we measure the effect of year-to-year changes in the weather on land or crop values in the same region and use the estimated hedonic equation to measure the effect of temperature change on prices. The empirical results of both analyses indicate that the vineyards of the Mosel Valley will increase in value under a scenario of global warming, and perhaps by a considerable amount.","[Ashenfelter, Orley] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Storchmann, Karl] Whitman Coll, Walla Walla, WA USA; [Storchmann, Karl] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",Princeton University; Whitman College; New York University,"Ashenfelter, O (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,,,,,,49,66,74,2,39,M I T PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"238 MAIN STREET, STE 500, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1046 USA",0034-6535,,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

In a laboratory controlled experiment, participants made a long series of binary route-choice trials relying on real-time information and learning from their personal experience reinforced through feedback. A discrete choice model with a Mixed Logit specification, accounting for panel effects, was estimated based on the experiment's data. It was found that information and experience have a combined effect on drivers' route-choice behavior. Informed participants had faster learning rates and tended to base their decisions on memorization relating to previous outcomes whereas non-informed participants were slower in learning, required more exploration and tended to rely mostly on recent outcomes. Informed participants were more prone to risk-seeking and had greater sensitivity to travel time variability. In comparison, non-informed participants appeared to be more risk-averse and less sensitive to variability. These results have important policy implications on the design and implementation of ATIS initiatives. The advantage of incorporating insights from Prospect Theory and reinforced learning to improve the realism of travel behavior models is also discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Wheat output never recovered in this region despite the introduction in 1885 of tariff measures, such as the 1892 Meline Tariff. This paper analyses the response of Mediterranean wheat growers to changes in local rainfall and to variations of the duty on imported grains. It uses regional level data for nine administrative divisions located on or near the Mediterranean and assesses the impact of rainfall on yields. It argues that an interplay of protectionist policies and environmental conditions explain the decline of wheat production.","[Bassino, Jean-Pascal] Univ Aix Marseille 2, F-13284 Marseille 07, France; Univ Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Bassino, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Aix Marseille 2, F-13284 Marseille 07, France.",,,,,,,,21,3,3,0,4,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0004-8992,,,AUST ECON HIST REV,Aust.

Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) and the Young Adults of the NLSY79, associations between the weight status of women and their children are measured when both generations are between the ages of 16 and 24. In the entire sample, the measured intergenerational correlation of BMI is significantly different from zero and equal to 0.35. This result differs by gender with a BMI correlation between female children and their mothers of 0.38, compared to a significantly lower BMI correlation of 0.32 between mothers and their sons. Measures of this relationship across the distribution of BMI using quantile regression and quadrant dependence techniques indicate that the intergenerational persistence of EMI is strongest at higher levels of BMI. Strong dependence across generations is found when categorical outcomes of obesity and overweight are implemented. These results provide evidence of the strong persistence of weight problems across generations which may affect economic mobility within families. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The study tests these hypotheses on the formal and informal collaborative networks formed between seventeen IOs engaged in anti-corruption work.

Aggregating data from more than 200,000 women in 28 sub-Saharan African countries, we use mean height as an indicator of net nutritional status and find that the nutritional status of 1960 birth cohorts was relatively high. This situation, however, was not sustained. In almost all countries examined, mean heights were stagnating or decreasing after the 1970 cohorts. Using regression analysis we model human growth from birth to maturity, and find that economic growth had a significant and robust influence on final adult height at two distinct periods of the life cycle: (1) in the first years of life and (2) at puberty. We conclude that the economic difficulties of the late 1970s and 1980s contributed to the decline or stagnation in heights. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

To address this question we elicit risk preferences from the same pool of subjects at two different moments in time. To interpret the results, we use a Fechner stochastic choice model in which the revealed preference of individuals is governed by some underlying preference, together with a random error. We take cumulative prospect theory as the underlying preference model (Kahneman and Tversky, Econometrica 47:263-292, 1979; Tversky and Kahneman, Journal of Risk and Uncertainty 5:297-323, 1992). We observe that the aggregate pattern of preferences is very similar in both sessions, and it matches the results reported in the literature. Most subjects are risk averse for gains, and risk seeking for losses. However, the subjects that jointly agree with the reflection effect of prospect theory are around 50%. The percentage of individuals that change their responses across sessions is quite high, 63%. Estimating the stochastic choice model we find that 72% of the subjects have an underlying preference which agrees with the reflection effect of prospect theory. The remaining 28% are mainly classified as risk averse for both gains and losses. The results reinforce the empirical validity of the reflection effect. Deviations from the reflection effect can be attributed to noise, as well as to the existence of a fraction of risk averse subjects.","[Baucells, Manel] IESE Business Sch, Barcelona, Spain; [Villasis, Antonio] IDE Escuela Direcc Empresas, Quito, Ecuador",University of Navarra; IESE Business School,"Baucells, M (通讯作者)，IESE Business Sch, Barcelona, Spain.",mbaucells@iese.edu; avillacis@alumni.unav.es,"Baucells, Manel/D-7219-2013","Baucells, Manel/0000-0003-0266-3644",,,,,41,45,55,2,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,FEB,2010,68.0,1-2,,,,,193.0,211,,10.1007/s11238-009-9153-3,0.0,,,19,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,545RX,,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273755400011,0

The reduced VAT for food of 7 % has been is kept but it is often debated. The issue in debate is whether distributional effects between different groups of households occur if the VAT of food is increased up to 19 %. The objective of this analysis is to quantify the welfare effects of an increase of the VAT for different German household groups. Furthermore budget effects are calculated, which look upon household expenditures before and after the VAT increase. The methodical basis of this analysis is the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) estimated with cross sectional data of 11,831 German households. Two aspects have to be taken into account with the use of cross-sectional data: insufficient price information and zero expenditures. To derive quality adjusted prices an approach of Cox/Wohlgenannt (1986) is applied. To take censoring of the dependent variables into account a procedure of Shonkwiler/Yen (1999) was employed. The results show that low income households and households with children will have comparatively high welfare losses.","Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Inst Ernahrungswirtschaft & Verbrauchslehre, D-24098 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Thiele, S (通讯作者)，Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Inst Ernahrungswirtschaft & Verbrauchslehre, Olshausenstr 40, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.",sthiele@food-econ.uni-kiel.de,,,,,,,31,4,4,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

We study the interaction between a monopoly firm providing a high-speed scheduled service and private transportation (i.e., car). Interestingly, the carrier chooses to increase the frequency of service on longer routes when competing with personal transportation because by providing higher frequency (at extra cost) it can also charge higher fares which can boost its profits. However, in line with the results of earlier studies, frequency decreases for longer flights when driving is not a viable option.

It shows that the nationalisation of party systems in post-communist democracies is closely related to the territorial structure of social divisions, except for cases where the electoral systems provide for a high degree of nationalisation, or where super-presidentialism inhibits the creation of strong nationalised parties.","Cent European Univ, Ctr Study Imperfect Democracies, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary",Central European University,"Bochsler, D (通讯作者)，Cent European Univ, Ctr Study Imperfect Democracies, Nador Utca 9, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary.",bochslerd@ceu.hu,,,,,,,71,36,38,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2010,62.0,5,,,,,807.0,827,PII 922856780,10.1080/09668136.2010.481387,0.0,,,21,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,609VO,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000278686200004,0

In this paper we explore more flexible CAViaR models that allow VaR prediction to depend upon a richer information set involving returns on an index. Specifically, we formulate a time-varying CAViaR model whose parameters vary according to the evolution of the index. The empirical evidence reported in this paper suggests that our time-varying CAViaR models can do a better job for VaR prediction when there are spillover effects from one market or market segment to other markets or market segments.","[Huang, Dashan] Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Yu, Baimin] Univ Int Business & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lu, Zudi] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Fabozzi, Frank J.] Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Fukushima, Masao] Kyoto Univ, Kyoto 6068501, Japan",Washington University (WUSTL); University of International Business & Economics; University of Adelaide; Yale University; Kyoto University,"Huang, DS (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",huangdas@wustl.edu; bmyu@amss.ac.cn; zudi.lu@adelaide.edu.au; fabozzi321@aol.com; sergio.focardi@edhec.edu; fuku@i.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Lu, Zudi/HMO-6720-2023; Fukushima, Masao/D-1483-2012; HUANG, Dashan/H-6815-2013","Fukushima, Masao/0000-0002-4372-6376; Lu, Zudi/0000-0003-0893-832X; Huang, Dashan/0000-0003-2951-7997",,,,,18,8,9,0,10,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1081-1826,,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

This paper distinguishes between what Smith taught and meant in his Lectures on Rhetoric, Theory of Moral Sentiments, Wealth of Nations, and History of Astronomy, and what is taught about the Invisible-Hand metaphor within the modern consensus. Paul Samuelson's Economics: an introductory analysis (1948) linked Smith's use of the Invisible Hand metaphor to perfect competition and, later, claimed that it signalled Smith's anticipation of general equilibrium and the modern welfare theorems. Samuelson misread Smith to assert that individual selfishness led to the best good of all. Samuelson's justified prestige and widespread influence on economic teaching for five or more decades led to the acceptance of this error by the profession. It concludes by tracing throught the 19 editions of Samuelson's Economics, how he adjusted his original 1948 misstatements about Adam Smith's use of the metaphor to fit midern economic theories.","Heriot Watt Univ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",Heriot Watt University,"Kennedy, G (通讯作者)，Heriot Watt Univ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",gavin@negweb.com,,,,,,,52,9,10,0,9,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

The probability of squatting is shown to be largest in peripheral areas with good access to surface water, where soils are of good quality, and where many households from targeted tribes previously lived.

It argues that recent transformations in the world development order warrant a rethinking of the concept of social reproduction, towards acknowledging the increasingly apparent role of transnational governance institutions in organizing social reproduction processes, particularly in peripheral countries. To substantiate this argument, the article interrogates the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper development approach, the most visible policy tool of the post-Washington Consensus. In the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper process, the World Bank has started to link debt relief administered through the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC II) initiative to the delivery of basic social services to the poor, and directly finances human capital investments through conditional cash transfer programs. While conditionalities attached to Bank funding continue to promote the privatization of various state functions associated with social reproduction, especially in the areas of health care and education, the Bank, at the same time, funds 'social inclusion' programs that directly absorb some of these functions. This signals the emergence of a new social reproduction regime of 'conditional inclusion' under World Bank leadership.","Univ Ottawa, Sch Polit Studies, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Ruckert, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Sch Polit Studies, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,65,22,29,1,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Typical values for sustainable potential of bio-energy production are around 50-150 EJ in 2050 and 200-400 EJ in 2100. Higher bio-energy potential requires a development path with high agricultural yields, dietary patterns with low meat consumption, a low population and/or accepting high conversion rates of natural areas. Scenario analysis using four different models shows that low stabilization levels may be achieved with a bio-energy potential of around 200 EJ p. a.

For developing the analysis we will adopt the menu approach (Terluin and Venema, 2004). We will analyze three main steps which have to be taken in applying this method: (1) identification of rural development priorities; (2) selection of rural development measures coherent with these rural development priorities; and (3) allocation of financial means to these rural development measures.

The tour operator then sells these two types of admission ticket in the target market. A Stackelberg game model is proposed to formulate the leader-follower relationship, with HKD leading and the tour operator following. The equilibrium prices are derived by backward induction. The theoretical results show that HKD can coordinate with the tour operator through a quantity discount schedule.

The question is how small can the unequivocal majority be and still permit the Nash-implementability of the social choice rule; i.e., its Maskin-monotonicity. We show that the smallest unequivocal majority compatible with Maskin-monotonicity is n - left perpendicular n-1/m right perpendicular, where n >= 3 is the number of agents and m >= 3 is the number of alternatives. This value is equal to the minimal number required for a majority to ensure the non-existence of cycles in pairwise comparisons. Our result has a twofold implication: (1) there is no Condorcet consistent social choice rule satisfying Maskin-monotonicity and (2) a social choice rule satisfies k-Condorcet consistency and Maskin-monotonicity if and only if k >= n - n - left perpendicular n-1/m right perpendicular.","Univ Malaga, Dept Teor & Hist Econ, Malaga 29013, Spain",Universidad de Malaga,"Amorós, P (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, Dept Teor & Hist Econ, Campus Ejido, Malaga 29013, Spain.",pag@uma.es,"Amoros, Pablo/K-6620-2014","Amoros, Pablo/0000-0001-7269-6981",,,,,9,5,5,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,NOV,2009,33.0,4,,,,,521.0,532,,10.1007/s00355-009-0377-5,0.0,,,12,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,509BH,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000270985500001,0

We treat the functional form of the habit as unknown, and estimate it along with the rest of the model's finite dimensional parameters. Using quarterly data on consumption growth, assets returns and instruments, our empirical results indicate that the estimated habit function is nonlinear, that habit formation is better described as internal rather than external, and the estimated time-preference parameter and the power utility parameter are sensible. In addition, the estimated habit function generates a positive stochastic discount factor (SDF) proxy and performs well in explaining cross-sectional stock return data. We find that an internal habit SDF proxy can explain a cross-section of size and book-market sorted portfolio equity returns better than (i) the Fama and French (1993) three-factor model, (ii) the Lettau and LUdvigson (2001b) scaled consumption CAPM model, (iii) an external habit SDF proxy, (iv) the classic CAPM, and (v) the classic consumption CAPM.

Accusations ran from free riding on Western debt relief over violation of governance standards and unfair company competition to fragmentation of aid delivery. At the same time, there was a tendency to neglect the diversity of SSA in terms of resource endowments, trade links and industrial development. It was time then to promote African voices from various backgrounds to reflect Africa's heterogeneity. The introductory section presents a summary of findings about the economic impact of the two Asian giants in SSA countries by Africa-based economists, with three practical conclusions. First, African countries should favour strategies that minimise areas of direct competition with the Asian giants. Second, industrialisation strategies are required to exploit opportunities complementary to the Asian development path. Third, sectors of mutual interest should be identified in order to develop long-term views on how to cooperate with China and India and these views should be mainstreamed into national development plans.","[Reisen, Helmut] OECD Dev Ctr, Paris, France; [McCormick, Dorothy] Univ Nairobi, Inst Dev Studies, Nairobi, Kenya",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); University of Nairobi,,,,,,,,,4,4,4,0,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2009,32.0,11,,,,,1538.0,1542,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01248.x,0.0,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,528KV,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272445000002,0

This research project further contributes to an understanding of the interlocal cooperative interactions that exist between and among local governments. The author uses a qualitative approach using in-depth interviews conducted in 2006-2007 of participants within selected regions of Missouri, Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee. In 2002, communities participated in cooperative efforts, understood the benefits of cooperation, and expressed a willingness to cooperate in regional economic development efforts, however, the myriad obstacles to cooperation significantly curtailed cooperative efforts; now, the communities examined in Missouri, Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee have moved to actual cooperative action. Interviewees recognize that they must cooperate to be successful in economic development efforts suggesting perhaps that economic development previously perceived as an inherently win-lose game has become a win-win arrangement.","Western Kentucky Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA",Western Kentucky University,"Gordon, V (通讯作者)，Western Kentucky Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 306 Grise Hall,1906 Coll Hts Blvd,11060, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA.",victoria.gordon@wku.edu,,,,,,,8,20,23,2,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

The historical context of the relationships, however, has differed. While Senegal already enjoyed a long-lasting and stable relationship with India, relations with China have been more erratic, in particular on account of Dakar's recognition of the Republic of China. We analyse trade and investment patterns with the Asian Drivers and how Senegal can form a relationship with these two superpowers that can contribute to its national development objectives. Contrary to other countries in Africa, Senegal is not a large producer of natural resources other than phosphates and fisheries and its consumer market is also rather limited. We find scarce evidence of large-scale FDI flows and the amount of official development assistance is similarly anecdotic. For China and India, Senegal is of some interest as a logistical and commercial centre, rather than a production base for regional or foreign markets. Over the longer run, as these two countries are likely to become more important for Senegal simply on account of their increasing relevance on the world stage, we argue that it is essential that the authorities take these factors into account in developing policies that cater for economic development and social priorities.","[Anouan, Alexis Aka] Enda Prospect Dialogues Polit, Paris, France; [Pinaud, Nicolas] OECD Dev Ctr, Paris, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),,,,,,,,,7,5,5,0,10,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2009,32.0,11,,,,,1563.0,1585,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01250.x,0.0,,,23,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,528KV,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272445000004,0

The rise of Asian competition (locally, regionally and on third-country markets), partly due to the erosion of trade preferences for clothing and footwear, has raised fresh policy challenges. The specific relevance of the clothing industry in the analysis of China's and India's impact on Africa is manifold: this is a low-skilled labour-intensive industry, and hence an avenue for African economies' diversification; the competition from Asian producers vis--vis the SSA clothing industry is felt at the local, regional and global level (on third-country markets): it is therefore direct and indirect; also, the Asian Drivers' impact on African clothing industries has both a trade and investment dimension while being competitive and complementary.","[Kamau, Paul; McCormick, Dorothy] Univ Nairobi, Inst Dev Studies, Nairobi, Kenya; [Pinaud, Nicolas] OECD Dev Ctr, Paris, France",University of Nairobi; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Kamau, P (通讯作者)，Univ Nairobi, Inst Dev Studies, Nairobi, Kenya.",,,,,,,,38,5,5,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2009,32.0,11,,,,,1586.0,1612,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01251.x,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,528KV,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272445000005,0

This analysis utilizes a rich longitudinal data set (PSID) to provide insight into the reasons why older households make housing transitions. Because of the richness of the data, this analysis is able to control for life transitions, a household's income and wealth, and connection to one's children in predicting when a homeowner makes a housing transition. The results demonstrate that age is not related directly to housing tenure choice for older households. Instead, having lower health Status and being a single head of household is the important predictor of housing tenure transitions. At the same time, very few life changing events immediately lead a homeowner to become a renter. although they do influence the decision to downsize or consumer home equity. Finally, living next to one's children lowers the probability of becoming a renter or downsizing, and having richer children increases the probability of downsizing and thereby consuming one's housing wealth.

While there is a rather large literature on misreporting of self-assessed disability, evidence regarding register data is scant. It seems to be a widely held view among researchers that, since individuals out of work are inclined to respond towards poor health, it would be best to have official data provided by the relevant administrative bodies. But we argue that such administrative data should be regarded with some suspicion, since the administrators also may have incentives to misreport.

Consequently, she erroneously argues that emotional labour is commodified only when transformed into commercial service work. However, emotion workers experience commodification of their labour power as wage-labour, irrespective of the nature of their product. Bolton also argues that Hochschild's notion of workers undergoing a 'transmutation of feelings' renders them 'crippled actors' in the grip of management control. Hochschild, however, theorizes transmutation as a contradictory and unstable condition albeit in an under-developed form. While Bolton correctly argues for a theory of emotion work that captures the complexity and contradictory nature of the emotional workplace, it is not necessary to reject the emotional labour concept. Rather, it needs to be more fully theorized and integrated within Labour Process Analysis.","Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Manchester M1 3GH, Lancs, England",Manchester Metropolitan University,"Brook, P (通讯作者)，Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Aytoun Bldg,Aytoun St, Manchester M1 3GH, Lancs, England.",p.brook@mmu.ac.uk,,"Brook, Paul/0000-0002-3007-8728",,,,,45,81,93,0,43,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

This artical examines the skills and rewards of early years workers, the organizational processes through which their skills are measured and rewarded and the institutional and organizational influences on grading and pay systems. The article does so at an important juncture when the importance and regulation of the 'early years' sector has increased significantly and following pay equality initiatives. It concludes that while the application of more systematic forms of skill and job measurement has improved the relative rewards of nursery nurses, gendered constructions of their caring skills contaminate evaluation of their educational role such that undervaluation of their work persists.

They then examine a unique enterprise development program in central Appalachia that uses a system of blended personal and peer group coaching to develop the skills of its client entrepreneurs. By triangulating the results of in-depth interviews with entrepreneurs, coaches, and the managers of the program, the research reported here creates a set of comparative case studies that sheds light on how coaching can affect the way entrepreneurs learn.

Identification is based on a randomized targeted intervention that grants a cash subsidy conditional on school attendance to a subgroup of eligible children within small rural villages in Mexico (PROGRESA). This policy change spills over to ineligible children if social interactions are relevant. Results indicate that the eligible children tend to attend school more frequently, and the ineligible children acquire more schooling when the subsidy is introduced in their local village. Moreover, the overall effect of PROGRESA on eligible children is the sum of a direct effect due to cash transfers and an indirect effect due to changes in peer group schooling. Interestingly, the social interactions effect is almost as important as the direct effect.","[Lalive, Rafael] Univ Lausanne, IEW, CESifo, IZA, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Lausanne,"Lalive, R (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, IEW, CESifo, IZA, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",,,"Lalive, Rafael/0000-0003-1938-692X",,,,,43,54,65,1,14,M I T PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"238 MAIN STREET, STE 500, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1046 USA",0034-6535,,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

The large majority of evidence for predictors of height, and its health consequences, comes from observational studies. While genetic predisposition is a major determinant of height, secular rises in childhood and adult stature across successive birth cohorts suggest that early life environment also has an important impact. Plausible non-genetic determinants of height include nutrition, illness, socioeconomic status, and psychosocial stress. Evidence for an association between height and a series of health endpoints is accumulating. Thus, shorter people appear to experience increased risk of CHD, and these associations appear to be independent of socioeconomic position and other potentially confounding variables. For stroke, and its sub-types, findings are less clear. In contrast to CHD, some cancers. such as carcinoma of the colorectum, prostate, breast (in women), central nervous system, skin, endometrium, thyroid and blood (haematopoietic) are more common in taller people. While height may be negatively related to the risk of completed suicide, conclusions about the links between stature and other health endpoints is problematic given the paucity of evidence, which should be addressed. Ultimately, for want of better data, investigators in this area have used height as a proxy for a range of pre-adult exposures. In future, research should aim to explore the predictive capacity of direct measures of diet, psychosocial stress, childhood chronic illness and so on, rather than focus on height or its components. The problem is that extended follow-up of child cohorts with such data are required, and studies which hold these data are not currently available, although several are either maturing to the point where they offer sufficient clinical outcomes to facilitate analyses or are in the advanced planning stage.

We first show that, compared to a competitive labour market environment, wage bargaining may lead to substantially different optimal transport taxes. Second, bargaining implies that exogenous increases in congestion levels and in transport taxes raise negotiated wages and reduce employment levels; the strength of these effects depends on the union's attitude towards transport issues. Third, we show that the optimal uniform transport tax positively depends on the impact of congestion on negotiated wages, and negatively on the wage effects of the congestion tax itself. Using a standard specification for union preferences, the optimal transport tax exceeds the marginal external congestion cost to the extent that transport flows include demand by people who have no employment. Finally, if taxes can be differentiated according to trip purpose, the tax structure implies shifting the tax burden away from the employed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This evidence supports the advocacy of smart growth strategies to alter individuals' travel behavior. However, the observed differences in travel behavior may be more of a residential choice than a travel choice. Applying the seemingly unrelated regression approach to a sample from Northern California, we explored the relationship between the residential environment and nonwork travel frequencies by auto, transit, and walk/bicycle modes, controlling for residential self-selection. We found that residential preferences and travel attitudes (self-selection) significantly influenced tripmaking by all three modes, and also that neighborhood characteristics (the built environment and its perception) retained a separate influence on behavior after controlling for self-selection. Both preferences/attitudes and the built environment itself played a more prominent role in explaining the variation in non-motorized travel than for auto and transit travel. Taken together, our results suggest that if cities use land use policies to offer options to drive less and use transit and non-motorized modes more, many residents will tend to do so.

Prior research has documented that ail estimate of realized volatility is more precise when based upon intraday returns rather than daily returns. Using the framework of a professional investment manager who wishes to track the S&P 500 with the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks, we find that the benefits Of using high-frequency data depend upon the rebalancing frequency and estimation horizon. If the portfolio is rebalanced monthly and the manager has access to at least the previous 12 months of data, daily data have the potential to perform as well as high-frequency data. However, substantial improvements in the portfolio optimization decision from high-frequency data are realized if the manager rebalances daily or has less than a 6-month estimation window.

According to our findings, the Creative Class is attracted by favorable economic conditions as indicated by employment growth or an increasing wage bill.","[Moeller, Joachim] IAB, IZA, Inst Employment Res, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany; [Moeller, Joachim] Univ Regensburg, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany; [Tubadji, Annie] IAB, Inst Employment Res, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany",IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Regensburg,"Möller, J (通讯作者)，IAB, IZA, Inst Employment Res, Univ Str 31, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany.",Joachim.Moeller@iab.de; Annie.Tubadji@iab.de,"Tubadji, Annie/IUP-4828-2023",,,,,,55,22,24,0,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

The paper IS founded on the work of Sharif (1986, 1991, 2000), who questioned the definition of subsistence and argued that, in certain conditions, the initial slope of the Curve would be downwards. The authors ask whether tourism development could provide these particular conditions. An important distinction is made between the perception of management of the market being in surplus or abundance. If the downward-sloping supply curve is the case, then the distress selling of tabour that it implies would have implications for the quality of tourism products and for the capacity of tourism to alleviate poverty.","[Riley, Michael; Szivas, Edith] Univ Surrey, Fac Management & Law, Sch Management, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England",University of Surrey,"Riley, M (通讯作者)，Univ Surrey, Fac Management & Law, Sch Management, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England.",m.riley@surrey.ac.uk; e.szivas@surrey.ac.uk,,,,,,,29,13,14,4,18,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"COLERIDGE HOUSE, 4-5 COLERIDGE GARDENS, LONDON NW6 3QH, ENGLAND",1354-8166,,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Using a panel dataset of bilateral export flows from 12 EU countries to 20 OECD trading partners over the period 1992-2003, the trade effect of European regional integration, denoted by an EU dummy, is examined across a number of fixed effects (FE) specifications, each of which has been claimed as the correct econometric specification of the gravity model. Typically parsimonious in (time-varying) economic variables and abundant in fixed effects, the FE specifications allow for varying degrees of heterogeneity in the gravity model. Two gravity models are estimated: a gravity model of traditional trade determinants and a gravity model of new trade theory (NTT) determinants. Both gravity models provide reasonable coefficient estimates, although they vary somewhat across the FE specifications for the traditional gravity model. Both gravity models are congruent in suggesting that the coefficient of the EU dummy declines in magnitude and becomes insignificant as an increasing degree of heterogeneity is admitted into the model. This suggests the fundamental importance of the econometric specification when evaluating trade policy effects within a gravity framework.","Univ Loughborough, Loughborough, Leics, England",Loughborough University,"Stack, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Loughborough, Loughborough, Leics, England.",,"Stack, Marie/JOZ-9126-2023","Stack, Marie/0000-0002-9213-7607",,,,,28,28,31,3,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2009,32.0,5,,,,,772.0,789,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01180.x,0.0,,,18,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,440QD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000265713900005,0

Consider, for example, a completed monopoly merger in linear Cournot oligopolies with 10 symmetric firms. The method shows that its transaction costs are at most 25% (78%) of total premerger profits if there is zero (100%) excess capacity. Such estimations can be extended in a straightforward manner to other mergers and other oligopoly models. The estimation is based both on the profitability precondition, and on the non-empty core precondition, which postulates that the split of a merger's profits be in its core. The article shows that the core in linear Cournot oligopolies has a non-empty interior, and indicates that the non-empty core precondition also sheds new lights on understanding important issues such as the stylized fact that mergers are likely to occur in markets plagued by excess capacities; why profitable mergers might not be formed; and why completed mergers might break up in the future.","Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Econ, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A5, Canada",University of Saskatchewan,"Zhao, JG (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Econ, 9 Campus Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A5, Canada.",j.zhao@usask.ca,,,,,,,33,7,8,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,APR,2009,66.0,4,,,,,373.0,399,,10.1007/s11238-007-9071-1,0.0,,,27,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,411IT,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000263643800005,0

The author considers and compares different pricing alternatives for managing nature reserves (NRs) and applies them to two NRs in Israel. He compares four pricing strategies: free entrance, maximum revenue pricing, cost recovery pricing and differential pricing. These strategies were implemented both to the existing situation and to a development scenario in which an upgrade in the NR was considered. The two NRs analysed are the Darga Nature Reserve, an open reserve where no entrance fee is charged, and the Gamla Nature Reserve, a closed reserve where an entrance fee is charged. Benefits were derived using the travel cost method (TCM). The results show that differential pricing is the most cost-effective policy. It recovers costs in both policy scenarios with the least dead-weight loss (DWL). The consequence of the differential pricing, however, is that there is a cross-subsidy of the Gamla reserve of 45-80%, depending on the scenario analysed. It is shown that there are conditions in which only a cross-subsidy can make a development plan sustainable. Usually, policymakers differentiate pricing according to visitor characteristics. Differential pricing among reserves provides another tool that can be consistent with cost recovery while minimizing DWL. Another advantage is that site differentiating causes less social tension, because pricing is tailored not to a person but to a site.","Tel Hai Coll, Dept Econ & Management, IL-12210 Upper Galilee, Israel",Tel Hai Academy College,"Becker, N (通讯作者)，Tel Hai Coll, Dept Econ & Management, IL-12210 Upper Galilee, Israel.",nbecker@telhai.ac.il,,,,,,,35,8,9,0,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The results suggest that demand for the five broad commodity aggregates - accommodation, food, transport, shopping and entertainment - representing the key consumption by tourists, is price-inelastic, implying that all goods are necessities from the tourist's point of view. This result is consistent with the empirical reality that, once he or she has arrived in a destination, a tourist is bound to consume the available goods and services. A second important finding is the apparent complementarity of demands. This indicates that tourists tend to purchase a bundle of goods and services, all of which are necessary for the maximization of utility from visitation. The analysis also suggests that the underlying price elasticities exhibited through cross-price elasticity values have important implications for how price sensitivities can be better understood.","Victoria Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia",Victoria University,"Divisekera, S (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, POB 14428 MC, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia.",Sarath.Divisekera@vu.edu.au,,,,,,,15,15,17,1,7,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"COLERIDGE HOUSE, 4-5 COLERIDGE GARDENS, LONDON NW6 3QH, ENGLAND",1354-8166,,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The traditional way to tackle the difficulty has been control function approaches with selection correction terms. This paper examines relatively new approaches: sensitivity analyses-sensitivity to unobservables-in Rosenbaum (Biometrika 74:13-26, 1987), Gastwirth et al. (Biometrika 85:907-920, 1998) and Lee (J Appl Econ 19:323-337, 2004). These sensitivity analyses are applied to the data used in Lee and Lee (J Appl Econ 20:549-562, 2005) to see how the assumption of no unobserved difference in matching affects the findings in Lee and Lee, to compare how the different sensitivity analyses perform, and to relate the sensitivity parameters in the different sensitivity analyses to one another. We find (i) the conclusions in Lee and Lee are weakened in the sense that only the strong ones survive, (ii) the sensitivity analysis in Rosenbaum (Biometrika 74:13-26, 1987) is too conservative (and inferior to Gastwirth et al.'s), and (iii) Gastwirth et al.'s and Lee's approaches agree on some findings to be insensitive, but the two approaches also disagree on some other findings.","[Lee, Myoung Jae] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Sang Jun] Korea Res Inst Vocat Educ & Training, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University,"Lee, MJ (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",myoungjae@korea.ac.kr; sjlee@krivet.re.kr,"Lee, Sang-Jun/A-3892-2015","Lee, Myoung-jae/0000-0002-3935-7491",,,,,22,7,9,0,3,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Container shipping between Yokohama to New York and St. Johns, Newfoundland is simulated by VSLAM for the two routes using bluewater ships for the Panama Canal and identically sized Canadian Arctic Class 3 (CAC3) ships for the Northwest Passage. Each route is broken into a series of logical legs, and environmental conditions and wait times are assigned. Ice conditions are modeled from historical records. Average speed through the Northwest Passage shows little seasonal variation. Round trips per year are higher through the Northwest Passage. The required freight rate (RFR) to recover all costs including capital recovery is calculated. RFR is slightly lower for the St. Johns to Yokohama transit using the Northwest Passage, and higher for the New York to Yokohama route, as compared to the Panama Canal. Possible future thinning of Arctic ice would further improve the economics of the Northwest Passage. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The volatility is modelled as a convex combination of unobserved GARCH components where the combination weights are time varying as a function of appropriately chosen state variables. In order to make inference on the model parameters, we develop a Gibbs sampling algorithm. Adopting a fully Bayesian approach allows to easily obtain medium and long term predictions of relevant risk measures such as value at risk.

One contentious issue is the effect that these fees have on local economic development. While some scholars have argued that impact fees attract jobs by reducing developers' uncertainty, the development community maintains that they operate as an excise tax, reducing commercial development and driving away jobs. We use Florida county level panel data, from 1990-2005, to investigate the relationship between private employment and different types of impact fees. We find that commercial fees and school fees have countervailing effects, with the former repelling jobs and the latter attracting jobs. These results are consistent with our theory driven expectations. Our investigation also suggests that differences between our results and those obtained in prior studies can be attributed to two factors: the latter studies' violation of the condition of strict exogeneity required for consistent estimation and a failure to account for differential employment effects across various types of impact fees.

The main stochastic properties of the model are analyzed and necessary and sufficient conditions for weak and strict stationarity are derived.

We find that main weaknesses in managing financial risk in Romanian leasing companies are deficiencies in selecting financial demands. More attention on debtor quality is required. This paper focuses on analysing financial risk in the creditor point of view, knowing that all financial companies engage debtors in one or another liquidity category generated by quantifiable or non quantifiable criteria.","[Popa, Daniela] Romanian German Univ, Sibiu, Romania",Romanian-German University of Sibiu,,,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,5,NICOLAE BALCESCU-LAND FORCES ACADEMY,SIBIU,"3-5 REVOLUTIEI STREET, SIBIU, 550170, ROMANIA",1843-6722,,,KNOWL BAS ORGAN INT,,,2009,3.0,,,,,,128.0,132,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BOQ14,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277294300020,0

This novel experience resulted from the structure of Russia's economy in the 1990s, the limited role of financial intermediation in the Russian economy and rising oil prices. Consequently, the chief outcome of crisis has been political, the renewal of central political authority and a reining in of major economic interests. This has helped to solve the problem of state finances, which was the source of the 1998 crisis, but neither economic growth nor increased central political authority have managed to deal with the problem of capital deficiency in Russia so that it remains dependent on energy exports to continue growing. Potentially, this leaves Russia exposed to 'resource curse' problems. While these have been avoided so far, the absence of constraints on political leaders might lead to such problems in the future.","Univ Limerick, Dept Polit & Publ Adm, Limerick, Ireland",University of Limerick,"Robinson, N (通讯作者)，Univ Limerick, Dept Polit & Publ Adm, Limerick, Ireland.",,"Robinson, Neil/A-7054-2009","Robinson, Neil/0000-0001-5799-696X",,,,,77,9,12,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

However, an innovation must often be implemented with complementary inventions whenever it is exercised and its benefits are realized. In such cases, an innovation's value depends, in part, on the ownership structure of the related inventions. This paper makes its contribution by examining how an innovation's social value is affected when it must be applied in concert with other essential inventions.

I study how substantial changes in the economy affect the stability of firm capital structure in transition countries.

It finds that liberalisation of agriculture and food could increase global extreme poverty by 0.2 per cent and lower moderate poverty by 0.3 per cent. Beneath these small aggregate changes, most countries witness a substantial reduction in poverty, while South Asia where half of the worlds poor reside experiences an increase in extreme poverty incidence owing to high rates of protection afforded to unskilled-intensive agricultural sectors. The distributional changes are likely to be mild but exhibit a strong regional pattern.

Because of this failure, some countries are now inclined to act unilaterally and minilaterally, in many cases by imposing trade restrictions against third parties. Such actions are likely to invite retaliation. They could even ignite an escalating trade war. The best way to avoid such conflicts is not to limit the use of trade restrictions, but to make international climate negotiations effective. Ironically, success in addressing climate change multilaterally may require incorporating trade restrictions in a new kind of climate agreement. Trade restrictions have been used successfully in other international agreements. But in these agreements, the primary purpose of the restrictions has been to encourage participation. That is, their primary purpose has been to enforce the agreement. This is the role trade restrictions ought to play in a new climate treaty. But for them to play this role, the design of climate treaties must change. If climate treaties are designed strategically, the threat to restrict trade will suffice to enforce the agreement; and if the threat to restrict trade is credible, and the punishment associated with the restriction severe, trade restrictions will not actually have to be used. By incorporating trade restrictions in this way, greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced without putting at risk the gains from multilateral cooperation in trade.","Columbia Univ, Lenfest Earth Inst Prof Nat Resource Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Barrett, S (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Lenfest Earth Inst Prof Nat Resource Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,,,,,,27,25,25,1,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2011,34.0,11,,,SI,,1863.0,1882,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01420.x,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,864SE,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298259500003,0

This study uses data from the American Community Surveys, 2004 to 2007 and compares the locational patterns of highly educated individuals coming from abroad with that of highly educated individuals migrating internally. The study finds that the locational choices of highly educated newcomers from abroad are similar to those of highly educated domestic migrants but that there are some important differences. Gateway states are substantially more successful in attracting human capital from abroad than domestic human capital; foreign human capital is more strongly attracted to existing human capital agglomerations than domestic human capital; and a manufacturing-based industry is a deterrent for the attraction of both foreign and domestic highly educated in-migrants, but the deterrent effect is stronger for domestic human capital than for human capital from abroad.","Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Waldorf, B (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Krannert Bldg 572, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",bwaldorf@purdue.edu,,,,,,,37,7,9,0,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

In that framework, CPT fails to accommodate both gambling and insurance behavior. We suggest replacing the weighting functions generally proposed in the literature by another specification which respects the following properties: (1) to solve the paradox, the slope at zero has to be finite. (2) to account for the fourfold pattern of risk attitudes, the probability weighting has to be strong enough.","Univ Strasbourg, EM Strasbourg Business Sch, LaRGE Res Ctr, F-67085 Strasbourg, France",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Pfiffelmann, M (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, EM Strasbourg Business Sch, LaRGE Res Ctr, 61 Ave Foret Noire, F-67085 Strasbourg, France.",m.pfiffelmann@unistra.fr,,,,,,,22,8,11,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,SEP,2011,71.0,3,,,,,325.0,341,,10.1007/s11238-009-9191-x,0.0,,,17,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,791HQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000292656200002,0

Forty-six participants were required to make investment decisions under four levels of time pressure. In each decision, participants were presented with experiential cues which were either congruent or incongruent with the analytical information. The congruent/incongruent conditions allowed us to examine how many decisions were based upon the experiential versus the analytical information, and to see if this was affected by the varying degrees of time pressure. As expected, the overall accuracy was reduced with greater time pressure and accuracy was higher when the experiential and analytical cues were congruent than when they were incongruent. Of great interest was the data showing that under high time pressure participants used more experiential cues than at other time pressures. We suggest that the dynamic reasoning paradigm has some future potential for predicting the effects of experiential biases in general, and specifically under time pressure.","[Fraser-Mackenzie, Peter A.

Bureau of Economic Analysis, we estimate the impact on U. S. manufacturing employment of changes in foreign affiliate wages. We show that the motive for offshoring and, consequently, the location of offshore activity, significantly affects the impact of offshoring on parent employment. In general, offshoring to low-wage countries substitutes for domestic employment. However, for firms that do significantly different tasks at home and abroad, foreign and domestic employment are complements. These offsetting effects may be combined to show that offshoring by U.S.-based multinationals is associated with a quantitatively small decline in manufacturing employment.","[Harrison, Ann] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA USA; [Harrison, Ann; McMillan, Margaret] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [McMillan, Margaret] Tufts Univ, Medford, MA 02155 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; Tufts University,,,,"Harrison, Ann/0000-0002-1873-2432",,,,,26,111,129,3,26,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

The paper presents a sequential equilibrium that supports cooperation in which a player unilaterally reports the play of a partner with strict incentives for truth-telling.

Counter to conventional wisdom, the price of gasoline and unemployment were unrelated to the reported level of attendance. Furthermore, NASCAR broadcasts lose audience when competing against other high-interest sporting events and declines in both television ratings and audience size during the NASCAR season were not unique to 2009.

Tourism has been known to generate goods and services directly and indirectly, attract foreign currency, stimulate employment and provide opportunities for investment. It has also been recognized as an important means of achieving economic development. Substantial research has been conducted to evaluate the role of international tourism, and its associated volatility, within and across various economies. This paper applies several recently developed models of multivariate conditional volatility to investigate the interdependence of international tourism demand, as measured by international tourist arrivals, and its associated volatility in the four leading destinations in ASEAN, namely Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. Each of these countries has attractive tourism characteristics, such as significant cultural and natural resources. Shocks to international tourism demand volatility could affect, positively or negatively, the volatility in the tourism demand of neighbouring countries. The empirical results should encourage regional cooperation in tourism development among ASEAN member countries and also mobilize international and regional organizations to provide appropriate policy actions.","[Chang, Chia-Lin] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Dept Finance, Taichung 40227, Taiwan; [Khamkaew, Thanchanok; Tansuchat, Roengchai] Maejo Univ, Fac Econ, Chiang Mai, Thailand; [Mcaleer, Michael] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Inst Econometr, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Mcaleer, Michael] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands",National Chung Hsing University; Maejo University; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Chang, CL (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Dept Finance, Taichung 40227, Taiwan.",changchialin@nchu.edu.tw,"McAleer, Michael/K-8780-2019; McAleer, Michael/A-2407-2008; Chang, Chia-Lin/B-2679-2010","Chang, Chia-Lin/0000-0001-8835-760X",,,,,50,25,28,2,43,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

We define being a secondary issue in terms of the intensity of preferences over this issue rather than in terms of the proportion of voters who care for the environment. Equilibrium policies are the outcome of an electoral competition game between endogenous parties. We obtain the following results: (i) The Pigouvian tax never emerges in an equilibrium; (ii) The equilibrium environmental tax is larger when there is a minority of green voters; (iii) Stable green parties exist only if there is a minority of green voters and income polarization is large enough relative to the saliency of the environmental issue. We also study the redistributive policies advocated by green parties.,"[De Donder, Philippe] Toulouse Sch Econ, GREMAQ CNRS, Toulouse, France; [De Donder, Philippe] Toulouse Sch Econ, IDEI, Toulouse, France; [Anesi, Vincent] Univ Nottingham, CEDEX, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Anesi, Vincent] Univ Nottingham, CPE, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham,"De Donder, P (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, GREMAQ CNRS, Toulouse, France.",philippe.dedonder@tse-fr.eu,,"Anesi, Vincent/0000-0003-4424-2581",,,,,29,3,3,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,APR,2011,36.0,3-4,,,,,519.0,546,,10.1007/s00355-010-0506-1,0.0,,,28,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,726TZ,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287750400007,0

This paper provides a statistical methodology to unveil such nonlinear features with respect to returns on benchmark risk portfolios. We estimate a portfolio of options that best approximates the returns of a given hedge fund, account for this search in the statistical testing of the nonlinearity, and provide a reliable test for a positive valuation of the fund. We find that not all fund categories exhibit significant nonlinearities, and that only a few strategies provide significant value to investors. Our methodology helps identify individual funds that provide value in an otherwise poorly performing category. Copyright.

Excess returns on three portfolios are regressed against the excess returns on the value-weighted Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) portfolio. Lodging REITs provide the highest returns between the two different types of investment portfolios (resorts and casinos and C-corporations), as well as the market benchmark (the overall market portfolio). As an investment vehicle, lodging REITs command respectable returns with relatively low volatility in comparison with stock investments. The excess returns of lodging REITs were not found to be significantly different from zero during the three subperiods of 1995-2005: growth, recession and recovery. Investors who are interested in increasing their share of real estate investments may find lodging REITs a relatively attractive investment vehicle that could be added to their portfolios.","[Kim, Woo Gon] Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Dedman Sch Hospitality, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Kim, Woo Gon] Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul 130701, South Korea; [Jackson, Leonard A.] Univ Memphis, Fogelman Coll Business & Econ, Kemmons Wilson Sch, Memphis, TN 38152 USA; [Zhong, Jun] Oklahoma State Univ, Sch Hotel & Restaurant Adm, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; Kyung Hee University; University of Memphis; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Kim, WG (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Dedman Sch Hospitality, 288 Champions Way,UCB 4116, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",wkim@cob.fsu.edu; ljcksn11@memphis.edu,,"Kim, Woo Gon/0000-0002-5898-7528",,,,,34,8,9,0,25,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

For that purpose, we apply Choquet integral-based multiattribute value theory to the elicitation, from rankings of multiattribute hypothetical societies, of individual preferences on different dimensions of living conditions. A simple application of the proposed approach highlights that preferences on multiattribute societies cannot, in general, be represented by an additive value model, as there exist complementarities and redundancies between different dimensions of standards of living. Our elicitation exercise reveals also a strong heterogeneity of individual preferences on hypothetical societies. Finally, we explore how elicited preferences can be used to cast a new light on the ranking of actual societies.","[Meyer, Patrick] TELECOM Bretagne, Inst TELECOM, CNRS, Lab STICC,UMR 3192, F-29238 Brest 3, France; [Meyer, Patrick] Univ Europeenne Bretagne, Bretagne, France; [Ponthiere, Gregory] Ecole Normale Super, Paris Sch Econ, F-75014 Paris, France",IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; IMT Atlantique; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Bretagne Occidentale; Universite de Bretagne Occidentale; Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Paris School of Economics,"Meyer, P (通讯作者)，TELECOM Bretagne, Inst TELECOM, CNRS, Lab STICC,UMR 3192, Technopole Brest Iroise CS 83818, F-29238 Brest 3, France.",patrick.meyer@telecom-bretagne.eu; gregory.ponthiere@ens.fr,,,,,,,40,16,17,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.
