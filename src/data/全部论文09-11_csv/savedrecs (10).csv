Some studies find that if workers grow older there is an increasing gap between productivity and wages, i.e. wages increase with age while productivity does not or does not increase at the same pace. However, other studies find no evidence of such an age related pay-productivity gap. We perform an analysis of the relationship between age, wage and productivity using a matched worker-firm panel dataset from Dutch manufacturing covering the period 2000-2005. We find little evidence of an age related pay-productivity gap.","[van Ours, Jan C.] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [van Ours, Jan C.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [van Ours, Jan C.] CentER, Tilburg, Netherlands; [van Ours, Jan C.] CEPR, London, England; [van Ours, Jan C.] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [van Ours, Jan C.] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Stoeldraijer, Lenny] Stat Netherlands, The Hague, Netherlands",Tilburg University; University of Melbourne; Tilburg University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Ifo Institut; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"van Ours, JC (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",vanours@uvt.nl; lenny_stoeldraijer@hotmail.com,"van Ours, Jan C/O-6197-2015; van Ours, Jan C/N-2579-2016","van Ours, Jan C/0000-0002-0144-9956;",,,,,24,88,96,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,JUN,2011,159.0,2,,,SI,,113,137,,10.1007/s10645-011-9159-4,0.0,,,25,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,781QG,,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291948000003,0
J,"Vandenberghe, V",,,,"Vandenberghe, V.",,,Boosting the Employment Rate of Older Men and Women An Empirical Assessment Using Belgian Firm-Level Data on Productivity and Labour costs,ECONOMIST-NETHERLANDS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Ageing; Labour productivity; Panel data analysis,WAGES; PARTICIPATION; RETIREMENT; WORKFORCE,"European countries need to expand employment among older individuals. Many papers have examined this issue from different angles. However, very few seem to have considered its gender dimension properly, despite evidence that lifting the overall senior employment rate requires significantly raising that of women older than 50. The key issue examined by this paper is whether employers are willing to employ more older workers, in particular older women. The answer depends to a large extent on the ratio of older individuals' productivity to their cost to employers. To address this question we tap into a unique firm-level panel of Belgian data to produce robust evidence on the causal effect of age/gender on productivity and labour costs. We take advantage of the panel structure to identify age/gender-related differences from within-firm variation. Moreover, inspired by recent developments in the production function estimation literature, we address the problem of endogeneity of the age/gender mix, using a structural production function estimator (Olley and Pakes in Econometrica 64(6): 1263-1297, 1996; Levinsohn and Petrin in Rev Econ Stud 70(2): 317-341, 2003) alongside IV-GMM methods where lagged value of labour inputs are used as instruments. Our results indicate a small negative impact of larger shares of older men on the productivity-labour cost ratio. An increment of 10%-points of in their share causes a 0.17-0.69%-point contraction. However, the main result is that the equivalent handicap with older women is larger, ranging from 1.3 to 2.0%-points. This is not good news for older women's employability. And the vast services industry does not seem to offer working conditions that mitigate older women's disadvantage, on the contrary.","Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain,"Vandenberghe, V (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, 3 Pl Montesquieu, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.",vincent.vandenberghe@uclouvain.be,"Vandenberghe, V./L-9544-2013","Vandenberghe, V./0000-0002-1645-1127",,,,,33,13,16,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,JUN,2011,159.0,2,,,SI,,159,191,,10.1007/s10645-011-9164-7,0.0,,,33,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,781QG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291948000005,0

It also shows that competitive R&D creates too much research on easy innovations, and too little research on the difficult ones.

We do so by priming participants with religious words in a scrambled sentence task before they make a dictator game and a prisoner's dilemma game decision. Priming religious words significantly increased prosocial behavior in both games: participants in the treatment group were more generous and cooperative than participants in the control group. The priming effect was present regardless of participants' self-reported religiosity. Self-reported religiosity was not correlated with generosity or cooperation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We modify a heterogeneous firm model to allow for an intermediary sector. The model predicts that firms will endogenously select their mode of export - either directly or indirectly through an intermediary - based on productivity. The model also predicts that intermediaries will be relatively more important in markets that are more difficult to penetrate. We provide empirical confirmation for these predictions using the firm-level census of China's trade, and generate new facts regarding the activity of intermediaries.

A panel cointegration analysis of internal migration in Italy,ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,International migration; Domestic migration; Panel cointegration; Italy,,"This paper examines the impact of the immigration of foreigners on domestic labor mobility. Since David Card's seminal study on the regional labor market impact of the Mariel Boatlift it is controversial whether domestic labor mobility equilibrates economic conditions across regions. However, there is little or no evidence that natives leave destinations where migrants tend to cluster. In this paper we reconcile the existing evidence by taking another route: we analyze whether the immigration of foreigners replaces domestic mobility from poor to rich regions. We focus on Italy, which is characterized by large North-South wage and unemployment differentials, and apply panel cointegration methods. The main finding is that, conditional on unemployment and wage differentials, the presence of foreign workers in the labor force of the destination regions discourages internal labor mobility significantly. As a consequence, spatial correlation studies which use the variance of the foreigner share across regions for identifying the wage and employment effects of immigration, tend to understate the actual impact of foreign immigration.

Stochastic volatility models are applied to weekly crude oil, corn, and wheat futures prices from November 1998 to January 2009. Model parameters are estimated using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Speculation, scalping, and petroleum inventories are found to be important in explaining the volatility of crude oil prices. Several properties of crude oil price dynamics are established, including mean-reversion, an asymmetry between returns and volatility, volatility clustering, and infrequent compound jumps. We find evidence of volatility spillover among crude oil, corn, and wheat markets after the fall of 2006. This can be largely explained by tightened interdependence between crude oil and these commodity markets induced by ethanol production. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The direct forbearer of this paper is the Giordani and Soderlind (2004) study. It begins with the origin, purpose and theoretical grounds of robust control, indicating that it is one way to face model uncertainty, as an alternative to the Bayesian approach. In the middle section, we seek to obtain the course of the model's main variables: interest rates, inflation and output. The model constructor also wants the participating agents to have the same doubts that he has regarding its validity; therefore, robust control is considered as a fine-tuning of the rational expectations approach. The impulse-response functions are obtained, with the monetary authority acting as a Stackelberg-type leader, affected by a perturbation on the supply side. The two relevant equilibria are obtained and compared in robust control with dynamic economy (the reference equilibrium and the worst possible case equilibrium) with that obtained when operating with rational expectations. The alternative course for the reference model set forth in the paper by Dennis (2008) is also analysed. We mainly find that the different results depend on the behaviour of the law of motion of the state variables, specifically the shadow prices that influence the private sector's expectations. Lastly, the paper relates the recent monetary policy performance when facing the financial crisis that began in the summer of 2007. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast to other transitional countries, China's structural break did not happen immediately, but rather it experienced a long transition period (1977-1992) which shows that China's economic development has a strong growth inertia.","[Hu, Angang; Lu, Jie] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Zhengyan] Renmin Univ China, Ctr Appl Stat, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Renmin University of China,"Lu, J (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",anganghu@tsinghua.edu.cn; lujie@tsinghua.edu.cn; zhengyanxiao@gmail.com,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,8,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

In the paper, we show that the possibility of indeterminacy is positively affected by dependence on income tax financing and is negatively affected by consumption tax financing. Under balanced budget rules, a key determinant for indeterminacy is a revenue source for providing public services (i.e. income tax financing) rather than the presence of productive government spending.

Using a regime-switching model, we found evidence of the existence of housing price bubbles throughout the sample period, with the exception of 1998 when Korea suffered from a financial crisis. Using a Kalman filter technique, we estimated the size of housing price bubbles for the sample period. Finally, using generalized impulse response function analysis and variance decompositions, we found that housing price bubbles increased with household lending and industrial production, whereas they decreased with interest rate; this latter effect is relatively small, however. Policy implications include the importance of preemptive intervention on household lending in order to contain housing price bubbles, but interest rates appear to be a less effective policy tool.

Pesaran's approach is based on the computation of the percentage ratio of output gaps which fulfil a given convergence criterion. A high ratio will be interpreted in favour of convergence. In a first step, we define stochastic convergence between two regions as level stationarity of their output gap. Deviations from its equilibrium value will only have a temporary effect. Results from several usual unit root or stationarity tests show us that the percentage ratio of level stationary output gaps is low, which stands against this definition of convergence. However, this convergence criterion excludes the possibility of changes in output gap equilibrium value or catching up between regions. To fit these cases, we combine the pair-wise approach with unit root or stationarity tests with structural breaks. Structural breaks are modelled by dummies (Zivot and Andrews, 1992; Kurozumi,2002) or as smooth structural breaks (Christopoulos and Leon-Ledesma, 2009). Overall results are not changed as convergence is not accepted more often. Finally, we consider the autocorrelation function approach of Caggiano and Leonida (2009). Autocorrelations and their confidence intervals are estimated for each output gap. Convergence between two regions is accepted if their per capita output gap autocorrelations become nonsignificantly different from zero after some lag. Results show that a high percentage of regions satisfy this convergence criterion. Contrary to the conclusions which could be made from previous results, shocks to output gaps seem to disappear as time passes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The quality of the parallel between the field and the lab crucially depends on whether being informed of the actual field price influences a consumer's willingness to pay for a good or not. We show that the elasticity of the WTP revision according to the field price estimation error is significant, positive, and can be roughly approximate to one quarter of the error. We then discuss the normative implications of these results for future experiments aimed at eliciting private valuations through auctions.","[Muller, Laurent; Ruffieux, Bernard] INRA, UMR GAEL 1215, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Muller, Laurent; Ruffieux, Bernard] Univ Grenoble 2, UMR GAEL 1215, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Ruffieux, Bernard] Inst Natl Polytech Grenoble, F-38000 Grenoble, France",INRAE; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble,"Muller, L (通讯作者)，INRA, UMR GAEL 1215, F-38000 Grenoble, France.",laurent.muller@grenoble.inra.fr; bernard.ruffieux@ensgi.inpg.fr,,,,,,,30,21,24,0,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

The conditions under which the canonical form of the BPCG rate can be derived are made explicit and the assumptions scrutinised. It is shown that the presence of non-tradables, substitutability between exportables and importables and incomplete specialisation in expenditure generally dampen the externally-constrained growth rate. These findings help explain why empirical estimates tend to overestimate the BPCG rate.

It investigates how these effects depend on what target groups the subsidies address. Our analysis focuses on policies that are approximately welfare efficient (AWE), i.e. policies that (a) improve employment and welfare, (b) do not raise earnings inequality and (c) are self-financing. We construct a microfounded, dynamic model of hiring and separations and calibrate it with German data. The calibration shows that hiring vouchers can be AWE, while low-wage subsidies are not AWE. Furthermore, hiring vouchers targeted at the long-term unemployed are more effective than those targeted at low-ability workers. (c) 2010 Elsevier BM.

The lack of progress seems surprising, given the significant support for the origin principle in the economic literature. However, there is a contrast between the European Union that contains countries of widely different sizes and productivity levels, and the theoretical literature that has focused on models with symmetrical countries. We extend the modelling of preferences over tax principles to incorporate asymmetries in efficiency and size. We show that asymmetry can cause disagreement among countries over tax principles to be sustained even with close economic integration. Large countries and inefficient countries are shown to prefer the origin principle. In contrast, small countries and efficient countries can have a preference for the destination principle.

We introduce private information into these games and allow for this information to stochastically change over time. This reflects, e.g. how R&D competitors improve their innovations over time and keep these innovations secret before patenting them. The analysis initially appears intractable because of the complexity of the equilibrium updating of beliefs on opponents' information. However, we demonstrate the existence of a class of equilibria and calculate these equilibria in closed form. We find that the expected durations in these equilibria are longer than when players' information is public but, in some cases, shorter than in the collusive outcome. Hence, R&D secrecy slows down innovation disclosure.","[Hopenhayn, Hugo A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Squintani, Francesco] Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Squintani, Francesco] Univ Brescia, I-25121 Brescia, Italy",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Essex; University of Brescia,"Hopenhayn, HA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",,,"Squintani, Francesco/0000-0001-5632-5267",Economic and Social Research Council [RES-538-28-1001] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,33,36,45,1,35,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Using a three-stage oligopolistic model, the paper shows that foreign direct investment (FDI) may trigger consolidation via a merger since the approval of a domestic merger by the antitrust authority is more likely in the case a foreign firm enters via FDI and a firm's incentive for a domestic merger is greater and that, in turn, the possibility to merge and become more efficient modifies the outcome of the game by making FDI compared to exports less likely.","Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Kejzar, KZ (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Kardeljeva Pl 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",katja.zajc@ef.uni-lj.si,,,,,,,26,5,5,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

The main results are as follows: first, no matter whether the trade restriction (tariff) is placed on the non-price instrument or on the good itself, the foreign (domestic) firm prefers to increase (decrease) its use of its pricing tool and give up some of (increase) its use of the non-price instrument.

This principle implies a comparative method and a critique of conventional economics. Besides, the problem of the interrelation between the economic system and other aspects of social life cannot be avoided. On this basis, Polanyi points out the peculiar economic nature of the market-capitalist society and explains the institutional transformations characterizing its history. The opposition embedded/disembedcled, used by Polanyi to distinguish pre-modern economies from the market economy, has been widely adopted in recent times, particularly by economic sociologists, as a key for understanding current complex economic phenomena. However, the reference to Polanyi often presupposes a distorted interpretation of his theory, and a different kind of institutional approach.","Univ Ca Foscari Venezia, Venice, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Cangiani, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ca Foscari Venezia, Venice, Italy.",,,,,,,,56,46,51,1,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

We set up a simple theoretical model where two countervailing forces coexist. On the one hand, public investment raises the marginal productivity of private capital and leads to potential crowding-in of private investment. On the other hand, weak institutions and restricted access to financing could diminish the positive effects cif public investment projects and crowd-out private investment. The empirical results - which exploit both the time series and cross sectional variation in the data using a panel of 116 developing countries with annual observations between 1980 and 2006 - suggest that on average the crowing-out effect dominates. Moreover, we find that this crowing-out effect is dampened (or even reversed) in countries with better institutions - where the marginal productivity of public investment is conceivably higher - and that are more open to international trade and financial flows, such that financing constraints are less binding. journal of Comparative Economics 39 (1) (2011) 65-81.

Based on the two salient characteristics, our positive analysis indicates that if tourism tax revenues are used to provide rebates to local residents, because of the wealth effect, Dutch disease cannot be cured by the consumption tax on tourists. In contrast, if tourism tax revenues are used to provide productive government services for the manufacturing sector, Dutch disease can be treated effectively by taxation tailored for tourism. In a normative analysis, we show that to simultaneously correct the distortion caused by the congestion externality of tourism and generate the revenues from overseas tourism taxation, a government should not only levy a general tax on tourism consumption, but it should also discriminate between domestic and overseas tourism consumption, so that a positive tax surcharge is imposed on foreign tourists. In addition, the key factors that govern the optimal rates of a general tax and tax surcharge are also examined in this article.","[Chang, Juin-Jen] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Chang, Juin-Jen] Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chang, Juin-Jen] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Econ, Tao Yuan, Taiwan; [Lu, Lee-Jung] Tungnan Univ, Dept Leisure Management, Taipei, Taiwan; [Hu, Shih-Wen] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Econ, Taichung 40724, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; Fu Jen Catholic University; National Central University; Feng Chia University,"Chang, JJ (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan.",jjchang@econ.sinica.edu.tw,"Chang, Juin-Jen/ABD-9235-2022",,,,,,37,11,11,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

However, empirical studies have often been unable to confirm it. We argue that this might at least in part be due to measurement errors leading to downward-biased estimates. We test the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis with innovative trade-based variety measures to differentiate between tradables and non-tradables sector productivities that do not suffer from such errors-in-variables.

We hold that these two seemingly conflicting phenomena originally arise from the intertemporal payoff structure of investors and build a consolidated model to systemically explore their underlying mechanisms. Based on individuals' investments, with trend-following and trend-reversing expectation rules, our model exhibits the process in which one expectation rule goes from showing superior performance to being unprofitable, as it is gradually exploited, realized, and taken advantage of. Adding the fundamentalist rule, we find that the fluctuation of fundamentalists' impacts on prices, driven by individuals' real payoffs, is the crucial factor that enables their wished 'pattern' that prices fluctuate around the supposed fundamental value to arise as well as induces this emerging 'pattern' to disappear.

Our empirical results indicate that the relationships between nuclear energy consumption and oil are as substitutes in the U.S. and Canada, while they are complementary in France, Japan, and the U.K. Second, the long-run income elasticity of nuclear energy is larger than one, indicating that nuclear energy is a luxury good. Third, the results of the Granger causality test find evidence of unidirectional causality running from real income to nuclear energy consumption in Japan. A bidirectional relationship appears in Canada, Germany and the U.K., while no causality exists in France and the U.S. We also find evidence of causality running from real oil price to nuclear energy consumption, except for the U.S., and causality running from oil consumption to nuclear energy consumption in Canada, Japan, and the U.K., suggesting that changes in price and consumption of oil influence nuclear energy consumption. Finally, the results observe transitory initial impacts of innovations in real income and oil consumption on nuclear energy consumption.

I will argue that, although there is much insight to be gained from the interaction between neuroscience and economics, the implications of recent developments in neuroscience and neuroeconomics for the deductivist methodology of mainstream economics, and its emphasis on prediction of events, have not been sufficiently addressed. In fact, much research on neuroeconomics has contributed to the formulation of deductivist models aimed at the prediction of events, when the more fruitful use of neuroscience in economics consists rather in the utilisation of its insights for the development of an explanation of social behaviour that moves beyond the mainstream deductivist methodology. The somatic marker hypothesis, developed by Damasio and others working closely with him, will be suggested as an alternative framework for conceptualising the emergence of social behaviour from a neurobiological substrate.","Portuguese Catholic Univ, Sch Econ & Management, P-169005 Porto, Portugal",Universidade Catolica Portuguesa,"Martins, N (通讯作者)，Portuguese Catholic Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Rua Diogo Botelho 1327, P-169005 Porto, Portugal.",nmartins@porto.ucp.pt,"Martins, Nuno/B-6012-2009","Martins, Nuno/0000-0001-7966-6435",,,,,40,17,18,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

A comparative empirical analysis of the results from 132 countries employing the SDI and the ELF Index, suggests that the SDI is more robustly correlated with growth, and does a moderately better job of explaining the effect of exogenous static ethnic diversity.

A speaker attempts to persuade a listener to take an action by presenting evidence. Glazer and Rubinstein (2006) showed that when the listener's decision is binary, neither randomization nor commitment have any value for the listener, and commented that the binary nature of the decision was important for the commitment result. In this paper, I show that concavity is the critical assumption for both results: no value to commitment and no value to randomization. Specifically, the key assumption is that the listener's utility function is a concave transformation of the speaker's utility function. This assumption holds vacuously in the binary model. The result that concavity implies credibility allows us to dispense with the assumption that the listener's decision is binary and significantly broadens the scope of the model.

Both in his academic and policy work, Bernanke has made the case that monetary policy is able to stem deflationary forces largely because of its fiscal components, and that governments such as those in the United States or Japan face no constraints in financing these fiscal components. On the other hand, he has recently expressed strong concerns with the size of the federal budget deficit, calling for its reversal in the name of financial sustainability. This paper argues that these positions are fundamentally at odds with each other and resolves the paradox by arguing on theoretical and technical grounds that there are no fundamental differences in financing conventional government spending programs and what Bernanke considers to be the fiscal components of monetary policy.","Franklin & Marshall Coll, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA",Franklin & Marshall College,"Tcherneva, PR (通讯作者)，Franklin & Marshall Coll, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA.",,,,,,,,34,14,14,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

If the change in defense spending is permanent (gauged by Ramey's defense news variable), the multipliers are higher by 0.1-0.2. Since all estimated multipliers are significantly less than 1, greater spending crowds out other components of GDP, particularly investment. The lack of good instruments prevents estimation of reliable multipliers for nondefense purchases; multipliers in the literature of two or more likely reflect reverse causation from GDP to nondefense purchases. Increases in average marginal income tax rates (measured by a newly constructed time series) have significantly negative effects on GDP. When interpreted as a tax multiplier, the magnitude is around 1.1. The combination of the estimated spending and tax multipliers implies that the balanced-budget multiplier for defense spending is negative. We have some evidence that tax changes affect GDP mainly through substitution effects, rather than wealth effects.

A principal offers one of three possible contract menus to a team of two agents of unknown skill levels, with both agents' participation needed for production. We observe numerous rejections of the more lopsided menus, and principals respond by offering more favorable menus. Apart from rejections, we see almost complete separation in agent choices according to the agent types. Behavior converges towards a consensus in which one of the more equitable menus is proposed and agents accept a contract. The consensus menu differs across two treatments in which we vary the payoffs resulting from a rejection. We find strong evidence of social learning by low-skill agents (but only for low-skilled agents), in that a low-skill agent is more likely to reject a contract menu if her teammate rejected a contract menu in the previous period. In addition, low-skilled agents have a particularly adverse reaction to reduced wage offers. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The ultimate impacts on the economy hinge on current and expected monetary and fiscal policy behavior. Studies that impose active monetary policy and passive fiscal policy typically find that government consumption crowds out private consumption: higher future taxes create a strong negative wealth effect, while the active monetary response increases the real interest rate. This paper estimates Markov-switching policy rules for the United States and finds that monetary and fiscal policies fluctuate between active and passive behavior. When the estimated joint policy process is imposed on a conventional new Keynesian model, government spending generates positive consumption multipliers in some policy regimes and in simulated data in which all policy regimes are realized.

Contrary to the ambiguous results of strategic trade policy for duopolies, it is always optimal to subsidize exports when entry is endogenous, under both quantity and price competition. With homogenous goods the optimal export subsidy is a fraction 1/epsilon of the price, where epsilon is the elasticity of demand (the exact opposite of the optimal export tax in the neoclassical trade theory). Analogously, I show the general optimality of R&D subsidies and of competitive devaluations to promote exports in foreign markets where entry is endogenous.","Univ Venice, Dept Econ & Intert, I-30121 Venice, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Etro, F (通讯作者)，Univ Venice, Dept Econ & Intert, Fondamenta S Giobbe 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy.",federico.etro@unive.it,,"Etro, Federico/0000-0002-7184-8696",,,,,35,32,35,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,1468-2354,,INT ECON REV,Int.

The study's motivation is to shed light on the potential causes of the observed phenomena of voluntary over-compliance among firms. We investigate how assumptions about costs and benefits affect CSR behavior through a stock of goodwill capital. In optimum, the firm must balance marginal costs and benefits of investing in CSR. We characterize the equilibrium and examine comparative statics and dynamics from a parameterized model. Finally, we link some of the model's results to the empirical literature on CSR.","[Lundgren, Tommy] Umea Sch Busniness, Ctr Environm & Resource Econ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Lundgren, Tommy] Umea Sch Business, CERE, Umea, Sweden",Umea University,"Lundgren, T (通讯作者)，Umea Sch Busniness, Ctr Environm & Resource Econ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",tommy.lundgren@usbe.umu.se,,"Lundgren, Tommy/0000-0001-5042-7537",,,,,59,25,29,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,FEB,2011,62.0,1,,,,,69,95,,10.1111/j.1467-999X.2010.04087.x,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,704OE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000286061500004,0

J,"Alas, R; Edwards, V",,,,"Alas, Ruth; Edwards, Vincent",,,Work-Related Attitudes in Asia and Europe: Institutional Approach,INZINERINE EKONOMIKA-ENGINEERING ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,China; Asia; Europe; institutionalism; attitudes,ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES; VALUES; ESTONIA; CHINA,"Research was supported by ETF grant 7537. The differences in attitudes and values in countries with similar cultural roots but different institutional backgrounds were found in a study conducted in three European countries (Alas and Edwards 2007). The differences in work-related attitudes in the three Finno-Ugrian countries, Estonia, Finland and Hungary, are influenced by the respective countries' historical legacy, in particular differences in levels of institutional development (ibid). In order to test this result and to advise companies doing business on different continents, the authors enlarged the sample by adding countries from Europe and Asia. Countries on both continents have been divided into two groups according to their institutional backgrounds. Europe has been divided into two parts according to recent history and developmental level: East European and West European countries. The former group has undergone a transition from planned command economy over the last 20 years, the latter has a long tradition of capitalism and the market economy. Similarly, in Asia Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong have well established market systems, while China has been developing a socialist market economy since the late 1970s (Warner et al., 2005). Managers in Eastern Europe and China have had similar challenges: to focus on organisational efficiency and to change competitive strategies (Alas et al 2009b; Wang, 2007). The main research question is: are there differences in work-related attitudes between employees from countries with different institutional background on two continents and, if so, what are the reasons for these differences? The paper begins with hypotheses development. This is followed by description of the empirical study and finally data collected from empirical studies in four regions (China; Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong ['Asia']; formerly socialist Eastern Europe; and Western Europe) are analysed and the results discussed. An institutional model of differences in attitudes toward society, organisations and work has been developed. The findings indicate both similarities and differences between work-related attitudes in Asia and Europe. Even between East and West European respondents who share a similar culture, there were in certain instances substantial differences in attitudes. The same is true in Asia: attitudes of Chinese respondents differ from attitudes of the three other Asian countries in the survey. At the same time the findings indicate that the institutional framework influences work-related attitudes, as evidenced by the similarities in some of the responses from Chinese and East European respondents. The main conclusion from this study is that the differences in attitudes held toward society, organisations and work by people in Asia and Europe are influenced both by institutional context and cultural background. Both factors, and combinations of both factors, should be considered by owners and managers of multinational corporations. These results may help managers of multinational companies to achieve better work-related attitudes among employees working in plants on different continents.","[Alas, Ruth] Estonian Business Sch, EE-10114 Tallinn, Estonia",Estonian Business School,"Alas, R (通讯作者)，Estonian Business Sch, Lauteri 3 Str, EE-10114 Tallinn, Estonia.",ruth.alas@ebs.ee; adventamus@btinternet.com,,,,,,,32,11,11,0,36,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

It would be useful therefore to have an estimation of students' expectations of the financial returns to higher education. The results which are reported on in this paper provide data concerning the expectations of first year students in three Czech faculties of economics and one English Business School. First year students were surveyed because they had recently entered higher education. The findings show that students in both countries expect higher education to be a profitable investment Expected rates of return are found to vary by gender as well as by country and place of study.

The financial crisis of 2007 worsened and triggered the current Portuguese crisis. We argue that the main problem the economy is facing is its output stagnation due to a kind of Dutch disease that has created high and increasing levels of indebtedness, low and decreasing levels of saving and has reduced Portuguese competitiveness. Moreover, the existence of a dualist labour market and a new wave of emigration produce inefficiency, increasing unemployment of younger workers and the supply of human capital abroad funded by the Portuguese taxpayers. Governance problems such as poor public budget governance and lack of transparency and accountability are also at stake. These governance problems must be solved to allow the economy to return to its long-run growth path.","[Andrade, Joao Sousa; Duarte, Adelaide] Univ Coimbra, GEMF, P-3000 Coimbra, Portugal; [Andrade, Joao Sousa; Duarte, Adelaide] Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, P-3000 Coimbra, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra,"Andrade, JS (通讯作者)，Univ Coimbra, GEMF, P-3000 Coimbra, Portugal.",jasa@fe.uc.pt; maduarte@fe.uc.pt,,"Andrade, Joao/0000-0003-0999-2264; Duarte, Adelaide/0000-0002-6585-2744",,,,,68,25,30,0,17,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2011,58.0,2,,,,,195,218,,10.2298/PAN1102195A,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,818JW,,gold,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000294749000003,0

The two modifications have been proposed to deal with those cases in which the null hypothesis specifies that the time series is near integrated, in the sense that it is very close to the alternative hypothesis of a unit root. It has been shown in the literature that in these cases the KPSS test tends to over-reject the null hypothesis. The modification by Sul et al. (2005) is based on an alternative long-run variance estimator. Harris et al. (2007) propose applying the KPSS test to the filtered series instead of to the original series.

However, in countries such as Spain and Italy, where agricultural insurance is most highly subsidized, it could be that supply is not fully competitive. In this article, we explore the incidence of public subsidies to agricultural insurance premia when supply is noncompetitive. Through the use of a simple empirical model of an insurance market, it is shown that, while in the case of a competitive supply, subsidies to insurance would benefit farmers, a monopolistic supply would capture most of the subsidy, thus eliminating the potential incentive towards wider participation by farmers. The model is applied to a panel of Italian farms for different levels of risk aversion to demonstrate the limited effect that a subsidy to a hypothetical all risk yield insurance would have on farmer participation in the case of monopolistic supply.","[Capitanio, Fabian; Cafiero, Carlo] Univ Naples Federico 2, Dept Agr Econ & Policy, Naples, Italy; [Capitanio, Fabian; Cafiero, Carlo] Ctr Formaz Econ & Polit Sviluppo Rurale, Portici, Italy; [Diaz-Caneja, Maria Bielza] Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, ISPRA, Agr Unit,Inst Protect & Secur Citizen, I-21020 Ispra, Italy; [Adinolfi, Felice] Univ Bologna, Dept Agr Econ, Bologna, Italy",University of Naples Federico II; Italian Institute for Environmental Protection & Research (ISPRA); European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; University of Bologna,"Capitanio, F (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico 2, Dept Agr Econ & Policy, Naples, Italy.",capitani@unina.it,"Capitanio, Fabian/J-2815-2016; Capitanio, Fabian/E-7806-2011","ADINOLFI, FELICE/0000-0002-8181-5492; Cafiero, Carlo/0000-0003-3652-9910; Capitanio, Fabian/0000-0003-0327-8019",,,,,29,16,16,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A seller owns an asset whose common valuation is a deterministic function of the two traders' private signals. We first establish a notrade theorem for this environment, and proceed to study the effect of the asset valuation structure and the trading mechanism on extent to which asymmetric information induces individuals to engage in mutually unprofitable exchange. A laboratory experiment is conducted, where trade is found to occur between 19% and 35% of the time, and this depends in systematic ways on both the asset valuation function and the trading mechanism. Both buyers and sellers adapt their strategy to changes in the asset valuation function and to changes in the trading mechanism in clearly identifiable ways.

We focus on a few types of networks: feed-forward networks with multiple layers, fuzzy adaptive networks, support vector machines.

By deriving closed-form solutions, we identify different demand regimes and show that they are characterized by specific features regarding dynamic stability and monetary policy effectiveness. We also evaluate our model by stochastic simulations obtained from the Bayesian parameters estimates for the Group of Seven (G7) economies.

Building on a theoretical model that decomposes movements in the exchange rate into anticipated and unanticipated components, the empirical investigation traces the effects through demand and supply channels. Anticipated exchange rate appreciation, in line with movements in underlying fundamentals, has significant adverse effects, contracting export growth across many sectors. Random fluctuations in the exchange rate, deviations around steady-state equilibrium, have asymmetric effects on sectoral export growth. The evidence indicates increased contraction of export demand to currency appreciation over time. In contrast, the effect of depreciation in stimulating export growth has lost momentum over time. While exchange rate fluctuations had a positive net effect on export growth before 2003, the net effect is negative for the post-2002 period. The implications are anticipated movement in the exchange rate guides export plans, signaling the importance of managing fundamentals to anchor rational forecasts. Moreover, less variability of the exchange rate is likely to improve sectoral export growth in Turkey over time.","[Dincer, Nergiz] State Planning Org, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey; [Kandil, Magda] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Dincer, N (通讯作者)，State Planning Org, Necatibey Cad 108, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey.",nergiz.dincer@gmail.com,"Dinçer, Nazire Nergiz/G-5682-2018","Dinçer, Nazire Nergiz/0000-0001-9172-0991",,,,,11,21,22,2,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The key advantage of our data is that we are able to identify these events on a quarterly basis rather than on the yearly basis used by previous studies. We find evidence that life events are not randomly distributed, that individuals anticipate major events to a large extent, and that they fully adapt to many events within 12 months. The estimates can be used to calculate monetary values needed to compensate individuals for life events. Using a new valuation methodology that incorporates these dynamic factors produces considerably smaller compensation valuations than those calculated using the standard approach.","[Frijters, Paul; Johnston, David W.] Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Shields, Michael A.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Melbourne,"Frijters, P (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",p.frijters@qut.edu.au; dwjohnston@qut.edu.au; mshields@unimelb.edu.au,,"Johnston, David/0000-0003-3185-2890",,,,,36,154,161,5,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

If private transfers are unresponsive to household income, there is less likelihood of expansions in public social security crowding out private transfers. Most literature finds that private transfers are unresponsive, but this may be because responses have been obscured by the methods that ignore nonlinearities. Threshold regression techniques find such nonlinearity in the Philippines and scope for serious crowding out, with 30-80% of private transfers potentially displaced for low-income households (Cox et al., 2004). To see if these nonlinear effects occur more widely, semiparametric and threshold regression methods are used to model private transfers in four developing countries - China, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Vietnam. The results reported in this article suggest that nonlinear crowding out effects are not important features of transfer behaviour in these countries. The transfer derivatives under a variety of assumptions only range between 0 and -0.08.","[Gibson, John] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand; [Olivia, Susan] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University of Waikato; University of California System; University of California Davis; Stanford University,"Gibson, J (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand.",jkgibson@waikato.ac.nz,"Gibson, John/AAM-6159-2020","Gibson, John/0000-0003-3886-6873; Olivia, Susan/0000-0002-4124-8104",,,,,28,9,12,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Both Wicksell single thinning and harvesting cycle and Faustmann on-going rotation problems are considered. The Wicksell problem is analyzed by first restricting the class of decision times to (thinning, harvesting) pairs that bound the growth away from infinity and imbedding the problem in an infinite-dimensional linear program on a space of triplets of measures. These measures capture the thinning and harvesting decisions along with the behavior of the growth process prior to harvest. An auxiliary linear program then leads to a nonlinear optimization problem for which an optimal value and solution are determined. The values of all the problems are be related through a set of inequalities. The solution of the nonlinear problem determines (random) thinning and harvesting times for the single thinning and harvesting cycle which demonstrate the equality of the values of these various problems. Finally for the Wicksell problem, the unrestricted class of thinning and harvest times is shown to give the same value as the restricted class. The Faustmann ongoing thinning and harvesting rotation problem is reduced to a Wicksell problem which then allows for the characterization of the value as the solution to a different nonlinear optimization problem. The effects of the opportunity to thin the forest are illustrated on a mean-reverting stochastic model. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Are they likely to achieve the varied developmental roles ascribed to education, such as poverty reduction, improvements in child mortality, fertility decrease, increases in tax collection and rising economic growth? While several authors have questioned whether education generally can fulfil its 'magic bullet' role, this article will focus on some specific myths underlying the education MDGs. Two myths are of particular concern. First, these MDGs focus on universal primary education (UPE), ignoring what is known about the benefits of education in sub-Saharan African countries. Second, the MDG education goals are predicated on the concept of 'human capital', which assumes that investment in education can be treated like investment in physical capital and that it will lead to rising worker productivity and economic growth. However, the human capital approach is subject to fundamental weaknesses and is not a useful guide for the way that educational improvements are likely to impact on economic growth in African economies.","London Sch Econ, Sch Oriental & African Studies, London, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); London School Economics & Political Science,"Johnston, D (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Sch Oriental & African Studies, London, England.",dj3@soas.ac.uk,,"Johnston, Deborah/0000-0003-0065-1105",,,,,46,3,3,0,9,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

Using the data from 1996 to 2002, the results show that, while the exchange rate uncertainty significantly reduces trade in the majority of commodity flows, there is evidence that both short-and long-term volatility have positive effect on trade flows of specific commodities.

This work investigates the sources of macroeconomic fluctuations using a structural VEC approach and quarterly data for Argentina's economy, covering the period 1980:1-2009:1. To this effect, the paper imposes short and long run restrictions to the SVEC model, and identifies four structural shocks: term of trade, aggregate supply, aggregate demand and nominal prices. The results show that terms of trade shocks have a positive effect on real GDP, and that the main sources of output fluctuations are aggregate supply shocks. Further, external price shocks and aggregate demand shocks would be, in principle, the most important ones to explain real exchange rate fluctuations.","BCRA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",,"Lanteri, LN (通讯作者)，BCRA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",lnlante@yahoo.com.ar,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,4,CENTRO DE INVESTIGACION Y DOCENCIA ECONOMICAS,LOMAS DE SANTA FE,"CARRETERA MEXICO-TOLUCA 3655, LOMAS DE SANTA FE 01210 D F, MEXICO",1665-2045,,,ECON MEX,Econ.

The Mexican mix of irrigation technologies is dominated by flood techniques, utilized on 93% of irrigated land, while drip and sprinkler systems, both with higher application efficiencies, are utilized on only 7% of irrigated land. This paper examines the extent to which government policies can induce the adoption of alternative irrigation technologies to promote a sustainable pattern of water withdrawals. The framework is an inter-regional input-output model formulated as a linear program that solves for cost-minimizing allocations of output that are constrained by regional factor availability. The model features endogenous choice among alternative agricultural technologies and determines commodity prices based on factor costs and on scarcity rents for limiting factors of production. The study defines and quantifies sustainable endowments of water at the regional level and analyzes scenarios that combine fees or caps on water withdrawals with the availability of alternative irrigation technologies. We find that water policies can induce technology adoption to achieve water sustainability, although the national price of agricultural output rises 5% to 8% relative to baseline levels. Furthermore, pricing water for irrigation can generate enough public revenue for the government to cover the full costs of technology adoption.","[Lopez-Morales, Carlos; Duchin, Faye] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Econ, Troy, NY 12180 USA",Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,"López-Morales, C (通讯作者)，Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Econ, Troy, NY 12180 USA.",caustica@gmail.com,"López-Morales, Carlos A/AAM-6293-2020","Lopez Morales, Carlos Andres/0000-0001-9296-7136",,,,,44,37,42,1,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Specifically, the study examined the negative life events experienced by female and male respondents and how they cope with their challenges. A total of 428 youths (between 16-25 years old) participated in this study. Results showed that there seemed to be differences in the types of negative life events experienced by both female and male respondents. Female respondents seemed to be slightly more affected with emotional problems whereas male respondents seemed to be more prone to substance abuse and truancy. The mean scores of coping abilities of the respondents as a whole were generally fair (M = 3.37, SD = .38) with respondents reporting higher mean scores in Problem-Focused than Non-Productive Coping.

This article examines if variation is systematically related to cross-state differences in smoking prevalence, holding other factors constant that are expected to influence spending. An econometric model is estimated which considers effects of tobacco-settlement revenues, income, unemployment, political party of the governor, state debt and smoking prevalence on tobacco-control spending in all states during 2000-2007. Estimations control for the possibility that spending and smoking prevalence are co-determined to clearly determine the causal link from prevalence to spending. Spending variation is determined to be inconsistent with a 'rational needs' strategy whereby states with higher prevalence choose more funding than states with lower prevalence. This empirical result is consistent with recent studies indicating that spending on tobacco control exerts little to no effect on cigarette sales or smoking prevalence.","Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Econ, Coll Business, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA",California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo,"Marlow, ML (通讯作者)，Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Econ, Coll Business, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA.",mmarlow@calpoly.edu,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

A comparison of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development input-output data in the year 2000 shows that China's labor productivity relative to the United States is the lowest in a sample of 33 diverse countries, although China's capital is more productive than US capital. This in turn demonstrates the importance of a factor-specific rather than factor-neutral productivity adjustment common in much of the HOV literature. The use of value-added data to measure factor usage helps to correct for unobserved differences in factor qualities and differences in productivity across sectors, as is demonstrated for China. China's low average labor productivity reflects the structure of the Chinese economy where most employment is still in the inefficient agriculture and service sectors, with only 11% of employment in the more modern export-oriented manufacturing sector. Due to a trade surplus, China exports both labor and capital but Leamer's (The Journal of Political Economy 1980; 88: 495-503) test for trade-revealed factor abundance confirms that China is labor abundant even after substantial factor-specific productivity adjustments.","Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Orfalea Coll Business, Dept Econ, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA",California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo,"Marshall, KG (通讯作者)，Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Orfalea Coll Business, Dept Econ, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA.",kgmarsha@calpoly.edu,,,,,,,20,5,5,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Income inequality in both countries however increased significantly based on a widely used Gini coefficient and other measures such as income shares in top and bottom deciles and some new measures. It also investigates the relationship between economic development and income inequalities, using various household expenditure survey data and finds that all inequality measures are significantly higher in Bangladesh compared to Australia. Also, the ratio and income share gap between the top and bottom deciles are significantly higher for Bangladesh than Australia.

While there is no evidence that countries that have become more open have reduced their tax rates more, our findings suggest that countries strongly compete over statutory tax rates. A simulation of tax rates in a scenario with no cross-sectional dependence in tax setting suggests that, in the absence of tax competition, the mean statutory tax rate of Western European countries in 2006 would have been about 12.5 percentage points above its actual level.

This economy contains industries of two kinds: monopoly industries with an innovator only, and duopoly industries with an innovator and an imitator. I define patent length as the expected time in which an innovation is imitated, and patent breadth as the innovator's profit share in an industry after a successful imitation. The government can control patent length by the requirements for accepting a substitute for a patented good, and patent breadth by imposing compulsory licensing and royalties for the patentee after a successful imitation. I show that the stronger the externality in production relative to R&D is, the slower the optimal growth rate, the larger the optimal proportion of duopoly industries, and the longer and narrower the optimal patent.","Univ Helsinki, HECER, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Palokangas, T (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, HECER, Arkadiankatu 7,POB 17, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",tapio.palokangas@helsinki.fi,,"Palokangas, Tapio/0000-0002-5367-8849",,,,,18,13,13,0,25,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,,,J ECON,J.

This article presents a method to reveal the extent to which index trader trading activity (volume) might have caused increases in futures price volatility. This approach is useful when position-level data are incomplete or confidential, as with index trader position data. The method is applied to leading agricultural commodity futures data. The impact of index traders is identified during their period of greatest activity, that is, 2005 to 2006, using aggregated volume data that are filtered using wavelet transforms. The filtering decision rule is guided by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) finding that index traders do not engage in short-run trades. A joint model of futures (filtered) volume and (unfiltered) price volatility is estimated by 2SLS to account for the endogeneity of prices and volume. As a robustness check, both log-range and GARCH measures of volatility are used. The evidence provides no support for the claim that index traders have increased price volatility for storable commodities (grains/oilseeds) and only weak support in the case of nonstorable commodities (meats).","[Power, Gabriel J.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Turvey, Calum G.] Cornell Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Cornell University,"Power, GJ (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",gpower@tamu.edu,,"Turvey, Calum/0000-0001-5812-2957",,,,,33,3,3,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The global estimate is around -0.84, which is much smaller in absolute magnitude than what some highly influential studies have reported or used. For the poverty-dense South Asia region, the elasticity is of the order of -0.22, which is a dramatic contrast from the previous estimates. For India, where the number of poor people is by far the largest of any country, and where the poverty rate is higher than even in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the elasticity is of the order of -0.13, which is an even bigger contrast from earlier studies. Policymakers and researchers are urged to keep these estimates in mind while judging the likely effect of income growth on poverty, and to discount poverty-reduction claims based on higher elasticity estimates that have been reported or used in many influential studies. In particular, the elasticities shown in this study for South Asia and India seem to be a grim reminder of how unrealistic the existing estimates might be.","Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61790 USA",Illinois State University,"Ram, R (通讯作者)，Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Campus Box 4200, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",rram@ilstu.edu,,,,,,,25,14,14,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

He showed, with the panel data methods, that globalization has positive growth effect implying that countries with higher globalization grow faster. We argue that 5-year average growth rates, used in many panel data studies, are inadequate proxies for the unobservable Steady State Growth Rate (SSGR). Using the Dreher indices, we extend the Solow (1956) model to derive country-specific estimates of SSGRs for Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, India and the Philippines. Our results show that countries with higher levels of globalization have higher SSGRs but the growth effects on SSGRs are smaller than in many studies.","[Rao, B.

The regimes are divided into low misalignment and high misalignment regimes. The estimated threshold point is 8 percent. Results show that below 8.88 percent, misalignment in terms of overvaluation has no statistically significant effect on exports. Misalignment in terms of overvaluation only affects exports in a negative manner when it is more than 8.88 percent. An important policy implication inferred from this study is that overvaluation of the exchange rate should be kept below 8.88 percent to ensure a conducive exchange rate environment for exports.","[Sidek, Noor Zahirah Mohd] Univ Teknol MARA, Dept Econ, Kedah, Malaysia",,,nzahirah@kedah.uitm.edu.my,"SIDEK, NOOR ZAHIRAH MOHD/AAA-5813-2021",,,,,,30,0,0,0,0,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8867-1,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,7.0,,,,,,5,9,,,,,,5,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX61,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303217600002,0

Although community law defines the basic legal constraints of VAT rules in individual countries, the Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax, as amended, leaves some areas open for the Member States. In the context of the economic crisis, when fiscal interventions of national governments are absorbed by individual economics more perceptively, the current legislative in the area of VAT rates and a relative flexibility in its applying enable to find new opportunities for improving of VAT system performance in EU. This is the reason why value added tax is used as an important: instrument of economic policy in the time period observed.

Good governance affects innovation on several dimensions. Bureaucracy, in the form of permits posing a problem for firms, can deter firms from innovating themselves, moving them towards the licensing of foreign technology, and corruption deters RD. However, there is evidence of a negative impact of good and effective courts on innovation and RD. Although perhaps slightly surprising, this is not inconsistent with much of the literature. In addition regional infrastructure, which is to varying degrees also determined by government policy, is significant in determining innovation.

The semiparametric method yields an estimate of the elasticity between calories and expenditure of 0.39 below the median and 0.28 above. The corresponding estimates of the elasticity of the calorie price are 0.48 below the median and 0.45 above. We also examine the extent to which the expenditure elasticity of the calorie price is explained by substitution between and within major food groups. We find that there is a very high incidence of substitution within cereals (especially for poor households) and that between group substitution explains at most 59% of the income elasticity for food quality.

In this case current traffic flows change current green-times (according to the responsive control policy) and current green-times change current delays and hence drivers' route choices and current flows. Simple networks only are considered; starting with a small symmetrical network with two routes and a traffic signal which follows the equisaturation control policy. The symmetrical equilibrium, with equal flows on both routes, is (under reasonable conditions) unstable. The paper then shows that, within the simple network considered, bottlenecks may be added which makes the symmetrical equilibrium stable for certain steady Origin-Destination loads. Finally the paper considers the stability of a similar asymmetrical network when a special responsive policy is used. Under natural conditions the network is shown to be stable under this policy for all feasible Origin-Destination loads. The stability proof given for this network is designed to generalise so as to apply to a general signal-controlled network under suitable conditions; however such a general stability proof is not included in this paper.","[Smith, Mike] Univ York, Dept Math, York, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Smith, M (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Math, York, N Yorkshire, England.",mike@st-pauls-square.demon.co.uk,,,"Technology Strategy Board, DfT; EPSRC","Technology Strategy Board, DfT; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","While working on this paper Mike Smith was Researcher / Co-Investigator on the FREEFLOW project, which sought to develop decision support tools for network managers.

However, there has been little testing of the accuracy of Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) data collected using self-completion methods, which may actually produce more reliable results because of a reduction in interviewer bias and because respondents are given more time to think. This research, conducted at the South African National Arts Festival (NAF), compares the findings of face-to-face and self-completion surveys using a choice experiment eliciting the willingness of attenders to pay for various attributes of live theatre performances. Results show that attribute coefficients are consistently lower for the self-completion data than for the interview data and, for the model including interaction terms, have lower SEs for the majority of the coefficients. WTP estimates are also lower and, given ticket prices, more realistic, when using the self-completion data.","[Willis, K.

The trading rule profits did not declined over time in the case of the Romanian currency market. Exploring the causes of profitability, it was found that it was closely related to the intensity of manifestation of episodic linear and nonlinear dependencies, the state of the market, and it was not the result of a time varying risk premium.

In the present study it is hypothesized that there are two types of assets: a risk-free and a risky asset. The risk-free asset is assumed to be the physical capital, while at the same time uncertainty is allowed to result from the exogenous random variations in the public debt market, rendering in this way government bonds to act as the risky asset. In the endogenous growth framework with productive public investment, the expected long-run growth rate, the dynamic path of consumption as well as the optimal allocation of investment between a risky and a riskless asset, are analytically derived. This kind of treatment allows us to create a locus for the long-run growth over the various levels of uncertainty. The outcome of the analysis is that a rise in uncertainty impacts negatively upon the long-run growth rate. In order to empirically assess the relationship between growth and uncertainty, we lay our emphasis on the US economy for the period 1957:1 to 2008:4. Within the framework of a bivariate BEKK-GARCH(1,1)-M model a significant negative relationship between uncertainty and economic growth has been established. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Like most other model-based measures, this approach ignores differences in bank product quality and design, as well as the attractiveness of innovations. We measure competition on the lending markets in the five major EU countries as well as, for comparison, the UK, the US and Japan. Our findings indicate that over the period 1994-2004 the US had the most competitive loan market, whereas overall loan markets in Germany and Spain were among the best competitive in the EU.

For 2025, we find that BCAs reduce leakage by up to two-thirds, but result in only modest reductions in global emissions and significantly reduce welfare. In contrast, BCA-equivalent leakage reductions can be achieved by very small emission charges or efficiency improvements in nations targeted by BCAs, which have negligible welfare effects.

Our findings suggest that economic openness and financial market integration have led to increased capital mobility in developed as well as developing countries.

Although research has shown that remittances from migrants and migrants' transnationalism are often considered synonymous with development, the findings are not always so optimistic: some sceptics present migration as an impediment to economic growth. From an actor-oriented perspective, the relation between migration and development is shown to be neither positive nor negative but, instead, ambivalent. The strong migration from the town of Bor a in northern Romania has had a noticeable impact on the local population. The effects on the town's development are assessed by placing these economic changes in the complicated context of the social changes wrought by migration.","Inst Etud Minor Natl, Inst Pentru Studierea Problemelor Moniritatilor N, Cluj Napoca, Romania",,"Anghel, RG (通讯作者)，Inst Etud Minor Natl, Inst Pentru Studierea Problemelor Moniritatilor N, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",remusgabriel@yahoo.com,"Anghel, Remus Gabriel/AAP-2942-2020; Anghel, Remus/K-5991-2015","Anghel, Remus Gabriel/0000-0001-8534-1434;",,,,,41,1,1,0,7,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

Our mechanism allocates a central role to individuals as carriers of useful ideas and to personal contact as an important means of transferring these ideas. It thus implies that disrupting a human life impedes the process of knowledge transmission across time. We derive a simple and intuitive form of the dependence of aggregate knowledge transfer on adult mortality and incorporate it into a model of endogenous growth. We then quantitatively examine the relevance of the proposed link in application to the long-run growth experience of England. Our calibration exercise suggests that the reduction in adult mortality, by improving knowledge transmission across time and encouraging more innovation, was a quantitatively important force behind the takeoff in output per capita.","[Leukhina, Oksana] Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Bar, Michael] San Francisco State Univ, Dept Econ, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; California State University System; San Francisco State University,"Leukhina, O (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",,,"Leukhina, Oksana/0000-0003-0490-3111",,,,,56,25,26,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

Social capital helps entrepreneurs to overcome resource constraints. This is especially important in small communities where we often see a lack of market-oriented institutions such as venture capital firms. Entrepreneurs gain access to social capital via club memberships. Combining differences in the number of individual club memberships with differences in the importance of social capital across communities, we identify a causal small community mark-up effect of individual club memberships on entrepreneurship. Assuming that unobserved heterogeneity that might influence both the individual's selection into clubs and the occupational choice to be an entrepreneur is independent of community size, we find that the effect of club membership on the propensity to be an entrepreneur is 2.6 percentage points larger in small communities than in large communities.

There are some positive signs that this is beginning to happen, but early exit from the labour force, i.e. well before official old-age pension ages, still remains a very common phenomenon in OECD countries. In this paper we first compare recent trends in the labour situation of older workers across OECD countries. This is followed by a discussion of supply-side and demand-side factors that have been driving these trends. In particular, new evidence is presented on incentives to retire that are embedded in pension systems. We conclude that recent reforms in most countries in this area are working in the direction of encouraging later retirement, although in a few countries there are still substantial incentives to stop working early. We then examine to what extent there are barriers on the demand side which may also be discouraging work at an older age such as age discrimination, seniority rules in wage setting, low training participation and employment protection rules. We conclude that countries have also begun to tackle these barriers as well. Nevertheless, while considerable pension reform has undoubtedly strengthened incentives to continue working at an older age, further action is still required on the demand side to ensure that those older workers who wish to work longer can do so.","[D'Addio, Anna Cristina; Keese, Mark; Whitehouse, Edward] OECD, Directorate Employment Labour & Social Affairs, Paris, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"D'Addio, AC (通讯作者)，OECD, Directorate Employment Labour & Social Affairs, Paris, France.",anna.daddio@oecd.org,,,,,,,33,56,58,1,41,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

The presence of labor unions has statistically and economically significant positive effects on firm productivity. Unions' effects on wages are also positive, their magnitude being slightly larger than those on productivity. The decrease in the number of employees is greater at unionized firms than at non-unionized firms.

This article defends modern macroeconomics against its critics arguing that the critics have missed the point of why macroeconomics is carried out in the way it is. It also defends finance from some criticisms, especially of the efficient markets hypothesis. It is claimed that, far from being in a state of crisis as a result of recent events, modern macroeconomics has received a huge stimulus, and that the financial crisis was brought about more by a failure to employ modern macroeconomics than by the failings of macroeconomics.

Yet data limitations still mean relatively little is known about which migrants remit, how much they remit and how their remitting behaviour varies with gender, education, income levels and duration abroad. This paper constructs the most comprehensive remittance database currently available on immigrants in the OECD, containing microdata on more than 12,000 African immigrants. Using this microdata the authors establish several basic facts about the remitting patterns of Africans, and then explore how key characteristics of policy interest relate to remittance behaviour. Africans are found to remit twice as much on average as migrants from other developing countries, and those from poorer African countries are more likely to remit than those from richer African countries. Male migrants remit more than female migrants, particularly among those with a spouse remaining in the home country; more-educated migrants remit more than less educated migrants; and although the amount remitted increases with income earned, the gradient is quite flat over a large range of income. Finally, there is little evidence that the amount remitted decays with time spent abroad, with reductions in the likelihood of remitting offset by increases in the amount remitted conditional on remitting.","[McKenzie, David] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Bollard, Albert] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Morten, Melanie] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",The World Bank; Stanford University; Yale University,"McKenzie, D (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",dmckenzie@worldbank.org,,,,,,,18,23,26,1,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

First, it seeks to identify the key determinants of some policies that have been at the heart of the reforms of the telecommunications industry in developing countries, namely, liberalization, privatization, and the (re)structuring of regulation. Second, it attempts to estimate the extent to which these policies have translated into actual deployment of telecommunications infrastructure. This simultaneous investigation is conducted by means of an econometric analysis of a 1985-1999 time-series-cross-sectional database on 86 developing countries. Sectoral as well as institutional and financial factors are found to be important determinants of the actual reforms implemented. We uncover a positive relationship between the decision to introduce competition in the digital cellular segment and the growth of the fixed-line segment, suggesting that these two segments have benefited from each other. We also find that countries facing increasing institutional risk and financial constraints are more likely to introduce competition in the digital cellular segment and to privatize the fixed-line incumbent, these policies being economically attractive to both investors and governments. In turn, these policies are those that enhance the deployment of fixed-line infrastructure. In contrast, competition in the analogue cellular segment and the creation of a separate regulator seem to be relatively less attractive policies as they are found to be less likely to be introduced in countries facing increasing institutional risk and budget constraints. Their impact on fixed network deployment is found to be negative or non significant. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We use panel-data sets that cover the periods 1980:Q1-2006:Q4 for the EMEs and 1980:Q1-2005:Q4 for the other developing countries. We use two estimation methods generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation and time-varying-coefficient (TVC) estimation. The TVC procedure removes specification biases from the coefficients, revealing the underlying stable parameters of interest. We obtain similar results as previous authors for only the eleven non-EME developing countries we consider. In contrast, our results for the EMEs do not show a negative and significant effect of exchange-rate volatility on the exports of the countries considered. Our findings suggest that the open capital markets of EMEs may have reduced the effects of exchange-rate fluctuations on exports compared with those effects in the cases of other developing countries.

An MNF with a productivity advantage is willing to invest in a host country. The host government wants to capture the MNF's surplus yet cannot observe it due to the MNF's private information about its firm-specific advantage. In contrast, a joint venture (JV) partner might observe this surplus depending on its ownership share. The host government can alleviate its informational constraints by using ownership restrictions to force a JV. This calls into question the wisdom of calls for 'liberalizing' FDI flows by the wholesale elimination of domestic JV requirements. We show that the optimal mechanism involves ownership restrictions that decrease as the size of the MNF's firm-specific advantage increases. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Results show that for the period 1970-2006, activity drove up primary energy use by 227% instead of the actual 133%, while structure and efficiency effects drove it down by 5% and by 90% respectively. The important improvement in Mexican iron and steel primary energy efficiency reduced the gap between best international practice and actual primary energy consumption from 103% in 1970 to only 15% in 2006. CO2 emissions from fuel consumption and production process increased by 134%, and in addition to structure and efficiency, fuel share effect also drove down emissions by 4.2% in the entire period.

I develop the model in the context of aftermarket. With overlapping-generations of consumers, simultaneous product offerings in the primary market and aftermarket establishes a price floor for the primary good. This constraint prevents aftermarket rents from being dissipated by the primary market competition. Duopoly firms earn positive profits despite price competition with undifferentiated products. Nonetheless, government interventions to reinforce aftermarket competition such as a standardization requirement may lead to the partial collapse of the primary market. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

With a focus on Europe, it looks at how these banks' foreign affiliates have been faring during the recent financial crisis. It finds that retail and corporate lending of these foreign affiliates has been stable and even increasing between 2007 and 2009. This pattern is related to the functioning of the internal capital market through which these banks funnel funds across their units. The internal capital market has been an effective tool to support foreign affiliates in distress and to isolate their lending from the local availability of financial resources, notwithstanding the systemic nature of the recent crisis. This effect has been particularly large within the EU integrated financial market and for the EMU countries, thus showing complementarity between economic integration and multinational banks' internal capital markets. In light of these findings, this paper supports the call for an integration of the European supervisory and regulatory framework overseeing multinational banks. The analysis is based on an analytical framework which derives the main conditions under which the internal capital market can perform this support function under idiosyncratic and systemic stresses. The empirical evidence uses both aggregate evidence on foreign claims worldwide, and firm-level evidence on the behaviour of banking groups' affiliates, compared to stand-alone national banks. - Giorgio Barba Navaretti, Giacomo Calzolari, Alberto Franco Pozzolo and Micol Levi.","[Navaretti, Giorgio Barba] Univ Milan, I-20122 Milan, Italy; Univ Bologna, CEPR, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Milan; University of Bologna,"Navaretti, GB (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",,,"Pozzolo, Alberto Franco/0000-0002-3994-2455",,,,,50,34,37,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

Using the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) we find a significant 'raw' gender wealth gap of 50,000euro for married partners. Decomposition analyses reveal that the gap is largely driven by differences in characteristics between men and women (observables), particularly by individual's own income and labour market experience. This is especially true at the bottom and at the top of the wealth distribution, which we show using semi-parametric decomposition techniques.

We decompose the total variance of workers' earnings into a 'permanent' component between workers and a 'transitory' earnings instability component over time for given workers. We then investigate the statistical relationships between these components and indicators for the business cycle. The most marked change in earnings variances in Canada since 1982 is the general rise in total earnings variance, which is essentially driven by a quite dramatic rise in long-run earnings inequality. The patterns across age categories of the two variance components are almost opposite. Long-run earnings inequality generally rises with age, but earnings instability is seen to generally decline with age, so that earnings instability is markedly highest among entry age workers. Unemployment rate effects are positive on almost all variance measures, while higher unemployment is associated with widened long-run earnings differentials and greater short-run earnings instability.","[Gray, David] Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Beach, Charles M.] Queens Univ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",University of Ottawa; Queens University - Canada,"Gray, D (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, 55 Laurier Ave E, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",dmgray@uottawa.ca,,,,,,,35,13,16,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

We show that this conventional wisdom rests on one implicit assumption: that assets cannot be retraded in secondary markets. Without this assumption, foreign asset trade is possible even in the absence of default penalties. This result suggests a broader perspective regarding the origins of sovereign risk and its remedies.

This study builds on the existing literature by employing a data series that includes a sample period of institutional change and recently developed unit root testing procedures. Besides crude oil, natural gas and coal prices are also examined, aiming to further the knowledge of non-renewable energy resource time paths in order to inform future research and update the conclusions of past studies. The unit root tests allow for structural breaks and are based on the procedures developed by Zivot and Andrews (1992), Lumsdaine and Papell (1997) and Lee and Strazicich (2003). Finally, we investigate whether the trend changes signs in the regimes which are bounded by the structural breaks and quantify the prevalence of the trends over the sample period considered. The results show that the trend is not well represented by a single positive or negative trend. The variability of the trend suggests that forecasting energy prices should not typically occur about a single trend. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The explanation is more general since firm-establishing contracts are a sub-set of those society-establishing contracts that are capable of regulating any venture in condition of high uncertainty and potential conflict, and because the constitutional regime adopted (authority-based, democratic, or other) becomes a specification of particular types of firms rather than part of the explanation of the firm.

This paper considers forces responsible for the cyclical pattern of state expenditure and revenue. Annual fluctuations in state personal income are associated with small changes in state spending and significant changes in tax receipts; receipt of federal grants is associated with greater state spending. Tax collections, and to a lesser degree expenditure, of larger states are more closely associated with annual income fluctuations than are the tax collections and expenditure of smaller states. These state size differences may proxy for other state characteristics, such as the extent to which a state faces interstate competition for mobile businesses and individuals, and the quality of state government. The spending and tax revenue of states with less mobile populations closely track income fluctuations, as does spending in states where convictions of public officials for federal corruption crimes are more common. In small states, and in states with more mobile populations and better corruption records, government expenditure and revenue appear to rise and fall less with income, and in that respect more closely resemble the federal government.","Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Hines, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,,,,,,,44,12,17,0,18,BROOKINGS INST,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

This paper uses highly disaggregated Korean import data (from 1992 to 2008) to examine China's penetration of the Korean market in the context of the composition of value (the extensive and intensive margins) and the product type (homogeneous and differentiated) in trade. The increase in Chinese imports has been attributed to the rapid increase in the import of new products (the extensive margin) and of existing products (the intensive margin). However, the growth rate of new products decelerated in the 2000s. The growth in the intensive margin was due to quantity, not price. Chinese imports to Korea did not improve over the period in terms of quality. Although Chinese products became cheaper, they were more differentiated over time. Welfare gains were realized through the expanded introduction of new products from China. However, much of the gains from Korea's Chinese product import boom were realized in earlier years (1992-2000) because even though imported products became more differentiated, the increase in the extensive margin was lower in more recent years (2001-2008).","[Kang, Kichun; Ahn, Byung Chul] Yeungnam Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Gyeongsangbuk Do, South Korea",Yeungnam University,"Kang, KC (通讯作者)，Yeungnam Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Gyeongsangbuk Do, South Korea.",kikang@yu.ac.kr; bahn@yu.ac.kr,,,,,,,32,1,1,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,SEP-OCT,2010,18.0,5,,,,,54,71,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2010.01212.x,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,649UG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000281798800004,0

We use a multivariate generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (MGARCH) model and weekly data (January 1992-June 2009). Based on the results obtained from the mean return equations, we could not find any significant impact on returns arising from the Asian crisis and more recent global financial crises across these four markets. However, both crises significantly increased the stock return volatilities across all of the four markets. Not surprisingly, it is also found that the US stock market is the most crucial market impacting on the volatilities of smaller economies such as Australia. Our results provide evidence of own and cross ARCH and GARCH effects among all four markets, suggesting the existence of significant volatility and cross volatility spillovers across all four markets. A high degree of time-varying co-volatility among these markets indicates that investors will be highly unlikely to benefit from diversifying their financial portfolio by acquiring stocks within these four countries only.","[Valadkhani, Abbas] Univ Wollongong, Sch Econ, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",University of Wollongong,"Valadkhani, A (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Sch Econ, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",abbas@uow.edu.au,"Karunanayake, Indika/B-7771-2012; Valadkhani, Abbas/I-6960-2019","Valadkhani, Abbas/0000-0003-2538-1949; O'Brien, Martin/0000-0002-1728-2564",,,,,31,18,21,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0004-900X,,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

However, this paper argues that the labor share is not an ideal measure of real marginal cost for two reasons: it is countercyclical whereas marginal cost is likely to be procyclical, and it assumes that labor can be costlessly adjusted at a fixed real wage rate. Relaxing this assumption to a more realistic one leads to a measure of marginal cost that does turn out to be procyclical, which when tested produces results that are contradictory to the entire underlying model of the NKPC. Indeed, this paper argues that having procyclical marginal cost precludes us from even having the correct coefficient signs in the NKPC, which highlights a major problem that exists in the model.

As the agent's utility of diversion increases, the allocation in each stage decreases and the project takes more stages to complete. When contracting with agents with high utilities of diversion the optimal contract involves bloated projects and a side payment to the agent upon completion.

However, these gaps decline for all groups throughout compulsory schooling. Language is the single most important factor why ethnic minority pupils improve relative to White British pupils. Poverty, in contrast, does not contribute to the catch-up. Our results also suggest the possibility that the greater than average progress of ethnic minority pupils in schools with more poor pupils may partly be related to teacher incentives to concentrate attention on particular pupils, generated by the publication of school league tables.","[Dustmann, Christian; Machin, Stephen; Schoenberg, Uta] UCL, London, England",University of London; University College London,"Dustmann, C (通讯作者)，UCL, London, England.",,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,30,44,51,1,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

We emphasize the role of reference groups and determine the optimal number of winners and losers in tournaments. To compensate employees for the disutility of low status, a profit-maximizing employer may be reluctant to demote employees and instead reward workers through promotions. This rationalizes the prevalence of compensation systems which reward winners without explicitly identifying losers. Differences in ambition and ability affect contestants' efforts and may result in inefficient promotion outcomes. We analyze how to mitigate these inefficiencies when managing a diverse workforce by using mixed and segregated tournaments. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It turns out that East Asian countries source significant shares of inputs within East Asia. In addition to material offshoring, service offshoring in East Asia has become increasingly common in the era of globalization. We also evaluate the effects of this fast growing offshoring on productivity.

Moreover, evidence in favor of the non-stationarity of the markup is presented, which in turn implies that per capita hours are also non-stationary. Structural vector autoregressions are then constructed that can identify shocks to the markup, technology and the federal funds rate. The results show that (1) inflation responds immediately to shocks to the markup and technology whereas it displays a hump-shaped response to a monetary policy shock, and that (2) per capita hours decline in response to positive shocks to the markup and technology. These empirical findings have important implications for macroeconomic dynamics, including the issues on inflation inertia and the technology-hours debate. The paper also points out that the dynamics of the economy cannot be correctly explained without consideration of the permanent markup shock. Finally, the approach in this paper suggests several ways to identify a wage markup shock using structural vector autoregressions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we investigated the extent to which consumers in Mozambique would be willing to consume new varieties of orange-fleshed sweet potatoes (OFSPs), which are rich in vitamin A, relative to the traditionally consumed white sweet potato varieties. Using data from a choice experiment administered in person with sweet potato shoppers, we find consumers are willing to pay premiums for OFSPs if they can be produced to possess eating quality similar to traditional varieties. Although consumers prefer orange flesh to the white, dry matter content was the most important quality attribute. Thus, for the nutritional benefits of the new varieties to be realised, plant-breeding programmes should focus on improving the dry matter content of the new orange flesh varieties. Finally, our results indicate that preferences for OFSPs are influenced by information about nutritional benefits, whether the questioning format provided incentives for people to think carefully about their responses, and whether people resided in urban or rural locations.","[Naico, Abdul T.

This skill requirement space approach has its merit in computational simplicity as well as ease of interpretation: it allows the model to include hundreds of occupations at the three-digit census classification level without a large number of parameters. Parameter estimates indicate that wages grow with the skill requirements of an occupation and that educated and experienced individuals are better rewarded in a cognitive and interpersonal skill demanding occupation. They also suggest that ignoring self-selection into occupations and individual heterogeneity may result in counter-intuitive and biased estimates of the returns to skill requirements.

We show that equilibrium contracts may be incomplete and assign control rights: they may leave some enforceable future transactions unspecified and instead specify which agent has the right to decide these transactions. Control rights allow the controlling agent to defer time-consuming deliberations on those transactions to a later date, making her less inclined to prolong negotiations over an initial incomplete contract. Still, agents tend to resolve conflicts up-front by writing more complete initial contracts. A more complete contract can take the form of either a finer adaptation to future contingencies, or greater coarseness. Either way, conflicts among contracting agents tend to result in excessively complete contracts in the sense that the maximization of joint payoffs would result in less complete contracts.","[Bolton, Patrick] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Faure-Grimaud, Antoine] London Sch Econ, London, England",Columbia University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Bolton, P (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,,,,,,37,34,42,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Surprisingly, only a few previous studies explore the role of home computers in the educational process. Home computers might be very useful for completing school assignments, but they might also represent a distraction for teenagers. We use several identification strategies and panel data from the two main U.S. data sets that include recent information on computer ownership among children-the 2000-2003 Current Population Survey (CPS) Computer and Internet Use Supplements matched to the CPS basic monthly files and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97)-to explore the causal relationship between computer ownership and high school graduation and other educational outcomes. Teenagers who have access to home computers are 6-8 percentage points more likely to graduate from high school than teenagers who do not have home computers after controlling for individual, parental, and family characteristics. We generally find evidence of positive relationships between home computers and educational outcomes using several identification strategies, including controlling for typically unobservable home environment and extracurricular activities in the NLSY97, fixed effects models, instrumental variables, and including future computer ownership and falsification tests. Home computers may increase high school graduation by reducing nonproductive activities, such as truancy and crime, among children in addition to making it easier to complete school assignments (JEL I2).","[Fairlie, Robert W.; Das, Kuntal K.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Econ, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Beltran, Daniel O.] Div Int Finance, Washington, DC 20551 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Fairlie, RW (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Econ, Engn 2 Bldg, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",rfairlie@ucsc.edu; Daniel.O.Beltran@frb.gov; kkdas@ucsc.edu,"Das, Kuntal/J-2725-2019",,,,,,42,38,52,0,9,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0095-2583,,,ECON INQ,Econ.

Before this coordination game is played, agents decide to whom they reveal their private information about the state. The information transmission occurring in the cheap-talk communication stage is characterized by a strategic communication network whose links represent truthful information transmission. In equilibrium, whether communication takes place between two agents depends not only on the conflict of interest between these agents, but also on the number and preferences of the other agents with whom they communicate. In particular, communication to a large group of recipients may be feasible even though communication to a small subset of that group may not be. We show that agents who are more central in terms of preference tend to communicate more and to have a greater impact on decisions.","[Hagenbach, Jeanne] Univ Mannheim, D-6800 Mannheim 1, Germany; [Koessler, Frederic] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Koessler, Frederic] CNRS, F-75700 Paris, France",University of Mannheim; Paris School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Hagenbach, J (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, D-6800 Mannheim 1, Germany.",,,"KOESSLER, Frederic/0000-0001-7707-4217",,,,,26,60,71,0,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

A negative shock to agents' balance sheets causes them to liquidate assets, lowering prices, further deteriorating balance sheets and amplifying the shock. The second mechanism involves investors' Knightian uncertainty. Unusual shocks to untested financial innovations increase agents' uncertainty about their investments, causing them to disengage from markets and amplifying the crisis. Liquidity provision by the central bank alleviates the crisis in both mechanisms. Ex ante policies such as liquidity/capital requirements may also be beneficial.

In this paper, we survey and evaluate the recent and growing empirical literature on the linkages between housework and the wage rate. The review is motivated by unexplained gender wage gaps across studies, which consider personal and market-related factors. We focus on this less-studied aspect of wage determination. We consider the required modelling framework, and provide standardized estimated effects of housework on the hourly wage across studies. We evaluate how this literature has addressed potential estimation problems, in particular, the endogeneity of housework, concavity of the housework-wage function, threshold effects and work effort effects. We conclude that the evidence across ordinary least squares, instrumental variable, fixed effects and two-stage least squares results casts serious doubt on the idea that the negative female housework-wage relationship is only driven by endogeneity bias or individual-specific characteristics. Yet, much more needs to be done to address modelling and data requirements, and we point out likely and promising future research directions.","[Maani, Sholeh A.; Cruickshank, Amy A.] Univ Auckland, Auckland 1, New Zealand",University of Auckland,"Maani, SA (通讯作者)，Univ Auckland, Auckland 1, New Zealand.",,,"Maani, Sholeh/0000-0001-8205-9687; Cruickshank, Amy Alexandra/0000-0002-0527-6618",,,,,34,20,23,2,22,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0950-0804,,,J ECON SURV,J.

Indeed, such technologies would provide tangible benefits in terms of avoided fossil-fuel costs, which are likely to increase as restrictions on CO2 emissions are imposed. However, a number of challenges need to be overcome prior to market deployment, and the commercialisation of alternative energy technologies may require a staged approach given price and technical risk. We analyse how a firm may proceed with staged commercialisation and deployment of competing alternative energy technologies. An unconventional new alternative technology is one possibility, where one could undertake cost-reducing production enhancement measures as an intermediate step prior to deployment. By contrast, the firm could choose to deploy a smaller-scale existing renewable energy technology, and, using the real options framework, we compare the two projects to provide managerial implications on how one might proceed.

In this paper, we investigate the relationships between emotions, deception, and rational decision-making by means of an experiment on tax evasion. Emotions are measured by skin conductance responses and self-reports. We show that the intensity of anticipated and anticipatory emotions before reporting income positively correlates with both the decision to cheat and the proportion of evaded income. The experienced emotional arousal after an audit increases with the monetary sanctions and the arousal is even stronger when the evader's picture is publicly displayed. We also find that the risk of a public exposure of deception deters evasion whereas the amount of fines encourages evasion. These results suggest that an audit policy that strengthens the emotional dimension of cheating favors compliance.","[Villeval, Marie Claire] Univ Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Coricelli, Giorgio; Joffily, Mateus] Ctr Neurosci Cognit, CNRS, F-69675 Bron, France; [Joffily, Mateus] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, IPUB, BR-22290140 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Montmarquette, Claude] Univ Montreal, CIRANO, Montreal, PQ H3A 2A5, Canada; [Villeval, Marie Claire] CNRS, GATE, F-69130 Ecully, France; [Villeval, Marie Claire] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Villeval, Marie Claire] CCP, Aarhus, Denmark",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Universite de Montreal; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Aarhus University,"Villeval, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France.",coricelli@isc.cnrs.fr; joffily@isc.cnrs.fr; Claude.Montmarquette@cirano.qc.ca; villeval@gate.cnrs.fr,"Osuna, Luis E/A-5858-2010; Joffily, Mateus/H-7457-2017; Villeval, Marie Claire/H-7773-2017","Joffily, Mateus/0000-0003-4073-4562; Villeval, Marie Claire/0000-0001-8578-5449",,,,,54,127,138,2,53,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

In an extension of standard quality-ladder models of endogenous growth, we allow for the possibility that in each period several asymmetric firms (representing an endogenously determined number of past innovators) may be simultaneously active in an industry. Stronger competitive pressure then has conflicting effects on the incentive to innovate, lowering prices but also selecting the more efficient firms. We show that the market selection effect of competition always increases the incentive to innovate and find circumstances in which it can outweigh the traditional negative effect of lower prices.","[Denicolo, Vincenzo] Univ Bologna, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Zanchettin, Piercarlo] Univ Leicester, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of Bologna; University of Leicester,"Denicolò, V (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",,,"Zanchettin, Piercarlo/0000-0003-0559-869X",,,,,32,9,10,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0133,,,ECON J,Econ.

First, NCLB establishes benchmarks based on test score pass rates that schools must meet in order to remain in good standing and avoid sanctions. Since teachers are central to student performance, this accountability component of NCLB is likely to have direct effects on both the demand for and supply of teachers and therefore on both the composition of the stock of public school teachers and the distribution of those teachers among schools. Second, NCLB explicitly requires districts to have highly qualified teachers, and the enunciation and enforcement of such a standard might have an additional effect on the composition of teachers. We will discuss three avenues by which these requirements might affect the quality of teachers. First, we will argue that the requirements for highly qualified teachers are unlikely to have had any perceptible effect on the performance of students. Second, the combination of quality requirements and the more-stringent testing environment could make teaching appear more costly and risky as a profession and thus alter the composition of new entrants, but at least so far, we find no evidence of such effects. Finally, the accountability provisions might change the dynamics of the labor market for teachers, including decisions about hiring and job separation. While not completely understood, this channel might be quite important, especially at low-performing schools where the stress of the accountability requirements is highest. We will provide new evidence from Texas on the relationship between school accountability ratings and teacher transitions both out of schools and out of grades three through eight, the grades subject to NCLB testing requirements. Finally, we offer some observations about potential policy implications and a future research agenda.","[Hanushek, Eric A.] Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Rivkin, Steven G.] Amherst Coll, Amherst, MA 01002 USA; [Hanushek, Eric A.; Rivkin, Steven G.] Univ Texas Dallas, Texas Sch Project, Dallas, TX 75230 USA; [Hanushek, Eric A.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Execut Comm, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; Amherst College; University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Hanushek, EA (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",hanushek@stanford.edu; sgrivkin@amherst.edu,"Mills, Heather E/I-8209-2012","Hanushek, Eric/0000-0002-7090-7535",,,,,43,34,118,0,16,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Participants in the debates disputed whether a standing army or a militia would be the most effective institutional arrangement to guard against threats from abroad and tyranny at home. Both sides of the debate analyzed the effects of a standing army in terms of the incentives that it created for soldiers, citizens, the monarch, and foreign governments.","[Humphrey, Shawn; Hansen, Bradley A.] Univ Mary Washington, Fredericksburg, VA USA",,"Humphrey, S (通讯作者)，Univ Mary Washington, Fredericksburg, VA USA.",shumphre@umw.edu; bhansen@umw.edu,,,,,,,32,3,3,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,,,J I ECON,J.

With tax competition, the host country can enforce exporting instead of FDI. This leads to a Nash equilibrium associated with higher world welfare than harmonized taxes.

Under this model, the appreciation rate of a risky share is modulated by a continuous-time, finite-state hidden Markov chain whose states represent different states of an economy. We consider the general situation where an economic agent cannot observe the true state of the underlying economy and wishes to minimize the variance of the terminal wealth for a fixed level of expected terminal wealth with access only to information about the price processes. By exploiting the separation principle, we discuss the mean-variance portfolio selection problem and the filtering-estimation problem separately. We determine an explicit solution to the mean-variance problem using the stochastic maximum principle so that we do not need the assumption of Markovian controls. We also provide robust estimates of the hidden state of the chain and develop a robust filter-based EM algorithm for online recursive estimates of the unknown parameters in the model. This simplifies the filtering-estimation problem. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The firms face the same set of technologies given by a tradeoff between marginal costs and fixed costs, but depending on trade costs firms may choose different technologies. Market integration may induce a technological restructuring where firms either diversify their technologies or switch to a homogeneous technology. In general, market integration improves welfare. However, a small decrease of trade costs which induces a switch from heterogeneous technologies to a homogeneous technology may locally reduce global welfare. The model also shows that productivity differences lead to intra-industry firm heterogeneity in size and exports similar to the new-new trade models with monopolistic competition.","[Hansen, Jorgen Drud; Nielsen, Jorgen Ulff-Moller] Univ Aarhus, Dept Econ, Aarhus Sch Business, DK-8230 Aabyhoj, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Hansen, JD (通讯作者)，Univ Aarhus, Dept Econ, Aarhus Sch Business, Hermodsvej 22, DK-8230 Aabyhoj, Denmark.",jdha@asb.dk; jum@asb.dk,,,,,,,15,3,3,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Specifically, we show lower bounds that are exponential in the number of players in each one of the following cases: (I) reaching a pure Nash equilibrium; (2) reaching a pure Nash equilibrium in a Bayesian setting; and (3) reaching a mixed Nash equilibrium.

Using a panel of almost 300,000 Australian companies, we estimate a piecewise-constant exponential hazard rate model to examine the relationship between innovation and company survival.

The lessons we have derived have also transformed our perception of banking risks, contagion and its implication for banking regulation. It is now well established that risks were mispriced, accumulated in neuralgic points of the financial system, were amplified by procyclical regulation and the instability and fragility of financial institutions. Yet the implications on the design of post-crisis banking regulation are unclear. In this article we summarize the key issues the new regulatory framework have to consider and how they relate to one another. As the debate over the new financial regulation architecture has evolved, two different views seem to emerge: one views banking crises as an unavoidable phenomenon, so that regulation should provide a framework to cope with its impact. The other considers that crisis could be avoided provided banking regulation is duly modified. We argue that for consistency reasons choosing one view or the other leads to a completely different perspective on the future of banking regulation, as it implies a different view on the banking industry, bank stakeholders' rights, banks' corporate governance and contagion. As a consequence, choosing the incorrect view of banking crises may lead to an inefficient banking industry. --- Xavier Freixas.","[Freixas, Xavier] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University,"Freixas, X (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Freixas, Xavier/F-5579-2012",,,,,,23,13,16,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

In theory, trading in the spot market should erase inefficiencies due to initial mis-allocations. In the experiment, high emitters exercise market power in the spot market, and permit holdings under grandfathering remain skewed towards high emitters. Furthermore, the opportunity costs of free permits are fully passed through. In the auction, the majority of permits are won by low emitters, reducing the need for spot-market trading. Auctions generate higher consumer surplus and slightly lower product prices in the laboratory markets.

This article develops a simple model of entry mode choice and evaluates its main testable implication using data on foreign investors in Eastern European countries and the successor states of the Soviet Union. The model considers competition between two asymmetric foreign investors and captures the following trade-off: while a joint venture (JV) helps a foreign investor secure a better position in the product market vis-a-vis its rival, it also requires that profits be shared with the local partner. The model predicts that the efficient foreign investor is less likely to choose a JV and more likely to enter directly relative to the inefficient investor. Our empirical analysis supports this prediction: foreign investors with more sophisticated technologies and marketing skills (relative to other firms in their industry) tend to prefer direct entry to JVs. This empirical finding is robust to controlling for host country-specific effects and other commonly cited determinants of entry mode.

I use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth whose respondents graduated from college between 1979 and 1989. I estimate the effects of both national and state economic conditions at time of college graduation on labor market outcomes for the first two decades of a career. Because timing and location of college graduation could potentially be affected by economic conditions, I also instrument for the college unemployment rate using year of birth (state of residence at an early age for the state analysis). I find large, negative wage effects of graduating in a worse economy which persist for the entire period studied. I also find that cohorts who graduate in worse national economies are in lower-level occupations, have slightly higher tenure and higher educational attainment, while labor supply is unaffected.

It tests some hypotheses found in the international literature, to determine whether part-time work is precarious, whether hourly payment is smaller, and whether it constitutes a step toward full-time employment. Evidence is found that part-time work is mostly feminine, and can be precarious in that it can be less stable and more informal. However, hourly wage is slightly higher than in full-time jobs. This gap is examined through a decomposition of Oaxaca, which reveals that wage differences cannot be explained by observable factors. It concludes with a Markov chain analysis using the Casen surveys to determine whether part-time jobs are a transition to full-time jobs, and also steady-state part-time participation is projected, as are long-term participation and employment rates. The results show that, given the current dynamics, the relative share of part-time work over total employment will remain stable, and labor participation will attain the level of developed economies in no less than 25 years.","[Rau B, Tomas] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Rau B, Tomas] Univ Chile, Ctr Microdatos, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile; Universidad de Chile,"Rau, T (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile.",,,,,,,,19,5,7,0,7,BANCO CENTRAL CHILE,SANTIAGO,"MORANDE 115 2ND PISO, AUGUSTINAS 1180, SANTIAGO, 6500-590, CHILE",0717-3830,,,ECON CHIL,Econ.

China. The Hong Kong Stock Market has more stringent rules regarding corporate governance and a better system of investor protection than the mainland market. Hong Kong companies generally provide strong incentives to executives via equity-based compensation. Have cross-listed companies learned from Hong Kong firms about adopting these strong executive incentives? The evidence from this study suggests that changes in top executive compensation are more sensitive to sales growth in cross-listed firms than they are in mainland firms without cross-listing. However, compared to Hong Kong firms. cross-listed firms are less sensitive to stock returns. Further, this study shows that it is necessary to differentiate between state-owned companies and private companies, as cross-listing may have a greater impact on executive incentives in state-owned companies than it does in private companies.

I will apply the tools of organization theory to an area almost completely neglected in law and economics, forensic science. Posner points us to tools we should make use of; I am pointing to an application we have neglected. Forensic science today is characterized by a twofold monopoly. First, evidence is typically examined by one crime lab only. Second, that same lab will normally be the only one to offer an interpretation of the results of the examination it performs. Crime labs today are typically organized under law enforcement agencies, which may create conscious and unconscious biases in favor of police and prosecution.

Our regression analysis of 35 US manufacturing and service industries over the period 1998-2006 supports aggregate and firm-level studies showing that offshoring is associated with a higher share of corporate profit in total value added. But the 'dynamic' gains from offshoring have not been fully realised because firms have purchased financial assets-especially share buybacks and higher dividend payments-to raise shareholder value, rather than investing in productive assets that raise productivity, growth, employment and income. Despite the corporate sector's contribution to national savings over the past decade, the offshoring-financialisation linkage reduces the capacity of non-financial corporations to act as a driver of the recovery from the economic crisis that emerged in 2008.","[Milberg, William] New Sch Social Res, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA",The New School,"Milberg, W (通讯作者)，New Sch Social Res, Dept Econ, 6 East 16th St, New York, NY 10003 USA.",milbergw@newschool.edu,,,,,,,53,84,90,1,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Providing subjects with information about the earnings Of their peers leads to significantly less cooperation and lower efficiency compared to a treatment in which Subjects receive information about the contributions of their peers. This is despite the fact that the feedback format does not affect incentives. The data Suggest that this happens because the feedback format acts as a coordination device which influences the contribution standards that groups establish. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The conditions are: (a) essential superadditivity-an option open to a group of players is to partition into smaller groups and realize the worths of these groups and (b) small group effectiveness (SGE)-almost all gains to collective activities can be realized by cooperation only within members of some partition of players into relatively small groups. Another condition, small group negligibility (SGN), is introduced and shown to be equivalent to SGE. SGN dictates that small groups of players cannot have significant effects on average (i.e., per capita) payoffs of large populations; thus, SGN is a analogue, for games with a finite player set, of the condition built into models with a continuum of player that sets of measure zero can be ignored. SGE implies per capita boundedness (PCB), that the supremum of average or per capita payoffs is uniformly bounded above. Further characterization of SGE in terms of its relationship to PCB is provided. It is known that if SGE does not hold, then approximate cores of many-player games may be empty. Examples are developed to show that if SGE does not hold and if there are players of scarce types (in other works, players with scarce attributes) then even if there is only a finite lost; moreover, even players of abundant types may be treated asymmetrically by the core.","Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Econ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",Vanderbilt University,"Wooders, M (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Econ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",myrna.wooders@vanderbilt.edu,,,,,,,40,5,5,0,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

Occupational choices are not only driven by the material rewards associated with the various occupations, but also driven by the esteem that they confer. We propose a model of endogenous growth in which occupations carry a symbolic value that makes them more or less attractive; the evolution of symbolic values is endogenously determined by purposive transmission of value systems within families. The model sheds light on the interaction between cultural and economic development and identifies circumstances under which value systems matter for long-run growth. It shows the possibility of culturally determined poverty traps and offers a framework for thinking about the transition from traditional to modern values. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that the second source is formally analogous to the producer gain from new goods, with a constant-elasticity transformation curve for the economy.

There has been less interest in modeling the policy choices made in historic and cultural landmark preservation. This article builds an economic model of a landmark designation that highlights the tensions between the interests of owners of cultural amenities and the interests of the neighboring community. We perform empirical tests by estimating a discrete choice model for landmark preservation using data from Chicago, combining the Chicago Historical Resources Survey of over 17,000 historic structures with property sales, Census, and other geographic data. The data allow us to explain why some properties were designated landmarks (or landmark districts) and others were not. The results identify the influence of property characteristics, local socio-economic factors, and measures of historic and cultural quality. The results emphasize the political economy of implementing preservation policies.","[Noonan, Douglas S.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Publ Policy, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Krupka, Douglas J.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA; [Krupka, Douglas J.] IZA, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Noonan, DS (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Publ Policy, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",doug.noonan@gatech.edu,"Noonan, Douglas/AAX-6942-2021","Noonan, Douglas/0000-0003-4654-9077",,,,,19,17,20,5,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,,,J CULT ECON,J.

The prospect of rising carbon prices raises concerns in these nations about the effects on the competitiveness of their own energy-intensive industries and the potential for carbon leakage, particularly leakage to emerging economies that lack comparable regulation. In response, certain developed countries are proposing controversial trade-related measures and allowance allocation designs to complement their climate policies. Missing from much of the debate on trade-related measures is a broader understanding of how climate policies implemented unilaterally (or subglobally) affect all countries in the global trading system. Arguably, the largest impacts are from the targeted carbon pricing itself, which generates macroeconomic effects, terms-of-trade changes, and shifts in global energy demand and prices; it also changes the relative prices of certain energy-intensive goods. This paper studies how climate policies implemented in certain major economies (the European Union and the United States) affect the global distribution of economic and environmental outcomes and how these outcomes may be altered by complementary policies aimed at addressing carbon leakage.","[Boehringer, Christoph] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, D-2900 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Boehringer, C (通讯作者)，Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, D-2900 Oldenburg, Germany.",christoph.boehringer@uni-oldenburg.de; fischer@rff.org; knut.einar.rosendahl@ssb.no,"Fischer, Carolyn/JCD-8689-2023; Fischer, Carolyn/M-4362-2016","Fischer, Carolyn/0000-0001-6179-1377",,,,,34,68,72,1,33,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Savings rates increased across all demographic groups, and the age profile of savings has an unusual pattern in recent years, with younger and older households having relatively high savings rates. We argue that these patterns are best explained by the rising private burden of expenditures on housing, education, and health care. These effects and precautionary motives may have been amplified by financial underdevelopment, including constraints on borrowing against future income and low returns on financial assets.

To investigate the extent and reason the output growth in China has been influenced by these policies, an error-component model is employed to decompose the importance of sectoral and regional shocks to variations in national output. The results show that both sectoral specific shocks common across regions and regional specific shocks common across sectors are important in explaining the disturbance of national output in China. Specifically, sectoral specific shocks consistently explain relatively more disturbance of Chinese output than regional specific shocks do. Our empirical results are somewhat different from Stockman (1988) and Costello (1993), since they show almost equal explanatory power of sectoral and national shocks in accounting for national outputs in OECD countries.","[Ying, Yung-Hsiang] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Interdisciplinary Studies, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan; [Chang, Koyin] Ming Chuang Univ, Dept Healthcare Informat & Management, Tao Yuan 333, Taiwan; [Wilson, Dennis P.] Western Kentucky Univ, Dept Econ, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA; [Ying, Yung-Hsiang] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Humanities & Social Sci Ctr, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan; [Kim, Yoonbai] Univ Kentucky, Dept Econ, Lexington, KY 40506 USA",National Sun Yat Sen University; Western Kentucky University; National Sun Yat Sen University; University of Kentucky,"Ying, YH (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Interdisciplinary Studies, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.",yying@mail.nsysu.edu.tw,,"Chang, Koyin/0000-0001-8045-9521",,,,,24,0,1,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This article modifies and extends the Scharfstein and Stein (2000) model that explains SICM. The major modification is to abstract from rent-seeking behaviour - a central ingredient that is used by most SICM models and has the side effect of overturning SICM when the underlying rent-seeking game is slightly perturbed. It is shown that when division managers' private benefits are not exactly propotional to their division's production profit, as assumed by Scharfstein and Stein (2000), SICM arises due to the CEO's incentive to extract gain from the trade of capital between his division managers by equalizing their marginal private benefits, instead of accommodating rent-seeking. Furthermore, we show that 'diversification discounts' exist, increase in diversity and decrease in CEO ownership. The results are robust to endogenizing the investors' choice of the total capital provided to the firm, which allows the conditions for aggergate underinvestment or overinvestment to be determined.","Natl Tring Hua Univ, Dept Econ, Hsinchu, Taiwan",,"Chou, ESW (通讯作者)，Natl Tring Hua Univ, Dept Econ, Hsinchu, Taiwan.",swchou@mx.nthu.edu.tw,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The main purpose is to assess the convergence of the main components of tax revenue -income and profits, social security contributions, property, general taxes on goods and services, taxes on specific goods and services- taking as references Germany, the United Kingdom and the European average. The analysis is carried out from two complementary perspectives: the tax burden and the tax structure. Using unit roots and stationarity tests with a structural change, and also analyzing beta-convergence, the results show little evidence of tax convergence. Convergence appears with similar intensity with respect to the three benchmarks, and in the years previous to the structural break which, in general, was situated endogenously at the end of the 1980s or at the beginning of the 1990s. Moreover, tax convergence is basically centred on income and profits, and goods and services taxation. The empirical evidence shows that the autonomy of the countries, their different economic structures and political preferences regarding the degree of public intervention, prevail over the idea of fiscal equalization in the EU.","[Delgado, Francisco J.; Jose Presno, Maria] Univ Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain",University of Oviedo,"Delgado, FJ (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.",fdelgado@uniovi.es; mpresno@uniovi.es,"Delgado, Francisco J./B-6773-2008; Presno, Maria Jose/K-7594-2014","Delgado, Francisco J./0000-0002-5086-7011; Presno, Maria Jose/0000-0002-8691-4027",,,,,67,11,11,0,15,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,2340-4264,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

In addition to analysing particular problems related to rural housing, urban housing and housing finance, I argue that (1) more decentralised reconstruction planning might be needed for rural housing reconstruction, which is decentralised by nature; (2) the homeowners association may not be an efficient vehicle for urban housing reconstruction; (3) writing off all remaining mortgage balances is not fair to everybody. I also discuss three general themes related to post-disaster property rights. First, post-disaster reconfiguration may be an important opportunity for major change in the property rights regime, including the decline of informal or communal property rights. Second, the reconstruction approach is path-dependent and the trade-off between liability rules and property rules depends critically on how eminent domain is executed. Third, the well known 'safe development paradox' may also have a property rights dimension.","[Deng, Feng] Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Deng, Feng] Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Res Ctr Econ Upper Reaches Yangtze River, Chongqing, Peoples R China",Chongqing Technology & Business University; Chongqing Technology & Business University,"Deng, F (通讯作者)，Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Chongqing, Peoples R China.",dengfengf@gmail.com,,,,,,,35,2,3,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2010,22.0,2,,,,,193,206,PII 922455284,10.1080/14631371003740688,0.0,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,600SB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000278006500005,0

Since the early 1980s, the rationale underlying Singapore's labour policies towards temporary migrant workers has been that of maximizing economic benefits while simultaneously minimizing social and economic costs. But adopting this position has been increasingly difficult because of the persistent abuses these migrants experience. Closer scrutiny of the immigration policies and practices for unskilled women migrants over the last two decades reveals a gradual shift by the Singapore State towards greater seriousness in addressing temporary women migrant worker issues. This paper argues, however, that the resulting policies tend to reinforce placement procedures more than they help to ensure the actual protection and empowerment of these migrant workers. Moreover, any shift in labour policies and practices towards unskilled migrant workers tends mainly to benefit first the State, then the employer and, only last, the worker.","Inst SE Asian Studies, Singapore 119164, Singapore",,"Devasahayam, TW (通讯作者)，Inst SE Asian Studies, 30 Heng Mui Keng Tce, Singapore 119164, Singapore.",theresa@iseas.edu.sg,,,,,,,45,35,37,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

The authors have advanced a hypothesis that the research methods of trends of an abrupt plunge and subsequent stabilistation of equity prices that were clearly discernable during the 1987 crisis are also pointfull for the current financial crisis. The present research was conducted on the basis of the following assumptions: both crises affected financial markets of several nations; a characteristic feature for the inception of the crises is an abrupt fall in equity prices; indications of stabilisation in financial markets become observable before financial experts conclude the end of the financial crisis. To confirm the hypothesis on the similarities of the general trends during the two major international financial crisis, the authors employed empiric tests developed on the basis of Granger causality tests. Based on the precedent survey of the financial crisis of 1987 (Malliaris and Urrutia 1992), the authors of the present article chose to use the Granger causality testing methodology. To be able to apply the Granger causality test first it was necessary to verify the degree of cointegration of the indices of the main equity markets in each of the country (OMX Vilnius, OMX Riga, OMX Tallinn, RTS). For that purpose the authors used the Dickey-Fuller and Johansen testing methodology. Both methodologies demonstrated a strong cointegration between the changes in the indices of all equity markets irrespective of the period analysed (i.e., pre-crisis, during the crisis, post-crisis). In all cases the T-statistics exceeded the critical value. The strongest cointegration was observable in the crisis period, and the weakest - after the crisis. The results showed that in view of the financial crisis the Latvian market showed the greatest degree of slow-down despite it being most active in the pre-crisis times, likewise, Estonian market also showed a somewhat higher degree of passiveness. Thus, it was the Latvian and Estonian markets that the financial downturn had the most painful impacts upon. While the Lithuanian and the Russian markets were, on the contrary, much more active and therefore outlived the equity crash period with least painful after-effects, thus producing confirmation that in the face of a crisis the interests and expectations of most investors are largely related to major markets normally viewed as more reliable and showing a higher degree of resilience.","[Dubinskas, Petras; Stunguriene, Stanislava] Vilnius State Univ, Int Business Sch, LT-10225 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Dubinskas, P (通讯作者)，Vilnius State Univ, Int Business Sch, Sauletekio Al 22, LT-10225 Vilnius, Lithuania.",petrasd@tiscali.it; ststunguriene@centras.lt,,,,,,,48,14,16,0,11,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-8619,,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Interestingly, this result is robust to the various considered approaches. Moreover, it seems that the housing sector long-term trend possesses its own dynamics, quite different from the aggregate French economic activity. Thus, in a second part, we review various structural factors that could drive housing market developments in France in the future.","[Ferrara, Laurent; Vigna, Olivier] Banque France, Direct Gen Etud & Relat Int, F-75049 Paris 01, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France,,laurent.ferrara@banque-france.fr; olivier.vigna@banque-france.fr,,,,,,,26,2,2,0,3,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-642-15339-6,,,,2010,,,,,,,39,60,,10.1007/978-3-642-15340-2_3,0.0,,,22,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYS93,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300025200003,0

This paper explores alternative market incentives that could be used instead. We solve for second-best combinations of uniform taxes on gasoline, engine size, and vehicle age. For 1,261 individuals and cars in the 1994 Consumer Expenditure Survey, we record the car's model, year, and number of cylinders. We then seek a corresponding car in data from the California Air Resources Board that shows the car's engine size, fuel efficiency, and emissions per mile. We calculate the welfare improvement from a zero-tax scenario to the ideal Pigovian tax, and we find that 71 percent of that gain can be achieved by the second-best combination of taxes on gas, size, and vintage. A gas tax alone attains 62 percent of that gain. These results are robust to variation in the elasticity of substitution among goods.","[Fullerton, Don] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [West, Sarah E.] Macalester Coll, St Paul, MN USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Macalester College,"Fullerton, D (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",dfullert@illinois.edu; wests@macalester.edu,,,,,,,41,8,8,0,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We use a stochastic optimization technique, in which utility is maximized subject to a self-financing portfolio constraint. The papers in literature have estimated the errors of Euler equations using data from financial markets. It has been shown that it is sufficient to test the first order Euler equation implied by the model. However, they all assume a constant consumption-wealth ratio that constrains the boundary conditions, hence influencing the coefficient of the risk premium. The main contribution of our article is that we drop the assumption of a constant consumption-wealth ratio. We have an analytical solution using a utility maximization model with a stochastic self-financing portfolio. We introduce a terminal condition of wealth with and without bequests. We also simulate the stochastic optimization with a self-financing portfolio, distinguishing risk neutral investors (-low) from high risk averse investors (-high). We show that the model with bequest has a higher level of wealth and a smoother decline of consumption over time than the model with no bequest at the end of the period. The model with no bequest has the same level of consumption and a sharp fall at the end of the period. Risk averse agents with high return assets have a higher amount of wealth than risk-neutral agents with lower return assets.","[Gazioglu, Saziye; Bastiyali-Hayfavi, Azize] Middle E Tech Univ, Inst Appl Math, TR-0653 Ankara, Turkey; [Gazioglu, Saziye] Univ Aberdeen, Dept Econ, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland",Middle East Technical University; University of Aberdeen,"Gazioglu, S (通讯作者)，Middle E Tech Univ, Inst Appl Math, TR-0653 Ankara, Turkey.",Drs.gazioglu@abdn.ac.uk,,,,,,,29,1,1,2,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We discuss various econometric problems associated with the hedonic wage approach, namely the instability of the estimates to specification changes, unobserved heterogeneity and endogeneity. We find evidence of significant compensating wage differentials and Values of a Statistical Life (VSL) figures only under the most restrictive assumptions, i.e. when we assume that there is no unobserved heterogeneity and that all regressors are exogenous. However, the VSL values are large and vary dramatically with the inclusion or exclusion of industry and/or occupation dummies, as well as with the addition of nonfatal risk. When we specify models that allow for heterogeneity and endogeneity of risk and of other regressors, we find no evidence of compensating wage differentials. We conclude that if compensating differentials for risk exists, econometric problems and the changing nature of labour markets prevent us from observing them. We also conclude that models and techniques for panel data that account for unobserved heterogeneity and endogeneity present a completely different picture about compensating wage differentials than that inferred by most wage-risk studies, which have generally used single cross-sections of data.","[Hintermann, Beat; Alberini, Anna] Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ AREC, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Markandya, Anil] Univ Bath, Dept Econ & Int Dev, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Markandya, Anil] FEEM, Milan, Italy",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Bath; Fondazione Mattei,"Alberini, A (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ AREC, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",aalberini@arec.umd.edu,"Azkarate, Ainhoa/K-9087-2013; Markandya, Anil/K-9381-2013","Azkarate, Ainhoa/0000-0003-0471-3094;",,,,,62,21,23,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Allied with difficulties of matching personnel numbers and posts, significant skill mismatches can take a long time to eradicate, with obvious financial and operational penalties. In the light of these factors, a holistic understanding of the exit behaviour of naval personnel is vital for naval manpower planners. This paper analyses ratings' voluntary (quits) and involuntary (separation) exit patterns from the Royal Navy using an independent competing risks hazard regression analysis framework. The results show that both voluntary and involuntary exits are pro cyclical with respect to macroeconomic and labour market conditions for both male and female ratings. Male ratings are more likely to quit or separate due to a lack of promotion to higher ranks as compared with females. Male ratings are also more likely to quit as a result of a hectic operational tempo when compared with their female counterparts. Frequency of sea/shore deployments also seems to exert a significant effect with respect to quits and separation outcomes of both genders. In terms of marital status married males are less likely to quit compared with their unmarried male counterparts, whereas the opposite is the case for female ratings.","[Jaffry, Shabbar; Ghulam, Yaseen; Apostolakis, Alexandros] Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth Business Sch, Dept Econ, Portsmouth PO1 3DE, Hants, England",University of Portsmouth,"Jaffry, S (通讯作者)，Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth Business Sch, Dept Econ, Richmond Bldg,Portland St, Portsmouth PO1 3DE, Hants, England.",shabbar.jaffry@port.ac.uk,"Apostolakis, Alexandros/AAP-1442-2020","Apostolakis, Alexandros/0000-0003-0999-0752; Jaffry, Shabbar/0000-0002-2234-9575; Ghulam, Yaseen/0000-0002-3206-1786",,,,,41,2,2,2,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Based on the quantitative results, we use simulation to look at how a new pricing strategy and the threat of legal penalty for file sharing would influence the online music market. Findings include these: estimated willingness to pay for downloading one music file is significantly less than the actual price of the file; consumers are sensitive to longer search and download times for music files and very sensitive to the threat of legal action; and consumers are not sensitive to online music services broadening their catalogues. Finally, the simulation shows that a combination of increased transaction costs for illegal file sharing and lower-priced digital music files would inhibit illegal file sharing and bolster the number of people purchasing music legally from the online services.","[Jeong, Gicheol; Lee, Jongsu] Seoul Natl Univ, Econ & Policy Program, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Lee, J (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Econ & Policy Program, Seoul, South Korea.",jxlee@snu.ac.kr,,,,,,,11,5,8,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This implies that the certification may reduce the information asymmetry between informed and uninformed parties. Second, compared with the incumbent, new entrants adopt more precise signals and use finer grading cutoffs to differentiate from the incumbent. Third, our measured differentiated grading cutoffs map consistently into prevailing market prices, suggesting that the market recognizes differences across multiple grading criteria.

If competition is high, managers prefer small innovations because they are afraid of loss (loss aversion). If competition is low, managers choose small innovations because of low value attributed to additional increase in their incomes due to successful innovation (diminishing sensitivity). Firms facing intermediate levels of competition choose larger innovations. Composition effect is a consequence of the inverted-U relationship. If competition is intense (industry firms have low profit expectations), technology leaders innovate more than laggards because they are less afraid of loss, and the resulting technology gap is high. As competition decreases, laggards are increasingly more active and finally, along the decreasing part of the inverted-U curve, start to innovate more.","[Krcal, Ondrej] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,,krcalo@mail.muni.cz,,,,,,,8,1,1,1,7,"UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,CESKE BUDEJOVICE, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZ-370 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-218-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,359,364,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS47,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287979900061,0

Besides basic instruments, defining the tax schedule - tax scale, tax free amount and so on, very popular are tax exemptions and tax credits. Usage of these two instruments is justified with tax equity postulates and they are usually treated as almost identical in effect. However, Lambert and Yitzhaki [1997], analyzing a very general definition of the just tax, show that a tax exemption can be treated as equitable (under certain conditions) while a tax credit cannot. In the context of this result, the primary aim of this paper is the analysis, if this theoretical finding is reflected in practical consequences of usage of these two tax instruments. In order to reflect the actual effect of both instruments, presented analysis was made on the basis of the data taken from the local tax office. Results of presented analysis suggest - despite theoretical doubts - similar characteristics of both instruments. Moreover, taking into account progressive character of the tax system, application of tax exemption seems to be more justified.","[Mazurek, Edyta; Kosny, Marek] Uniwersytet Ekon Wroclawiu, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Mazurek, E (通讯作者)，Uniwersytet Ekon Wroclawiu, Wroclaw, Poland.",edyta.mazurek@ue.wroc.pl; marek.kosny@ue.wroc.pl,"Mazurek, Edyta/R-1376-2018; Kosny, Marek/P-5292-2018","Mazurek, Edyta/0000-0001-7410-1638; Kosny, Marek/0000-0003-3629-2183",,,,,11,0,0,0,1,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2010,,4,,,,,481,492,,,,,,12,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,654YX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000282208400010,0

It is very important to have a proper instrument for the estimation of credit risk in banks because it reduces potential loss due to crediting reliable clients. Banks develop internal credit risk estimation models and various data analysis methods can be applied for this purpose. Statistical predictive analytic techniques and artificial intelligence can be used to determine default risk levels. Banks must also have data about clients from the activity in the past. To understand risk levels of credits, banks usually collect information about borrowers. Financial ratios remain primary variables for predicting corporate financial distress. The principal financial ratios as variables for the analysis are indicators of company's financial structure, solvency, profitability and cash flow. Credit risk estimation models are based on the analysis of this data. Using these models it becomes possible to predict the default possibility of new clients. Credit risk estimation models in banks differ significantly in architecture and operating design. The main reason for these differences is that banks' models are assigned by bank personnel and are usually not revealed to outsiders. The object of this research is credit risk estimation models. The purpose of research is to develop credit risk estimation models and to evaluate an influence of input data reduction on credit risk models accuracy. Two methods were applied in this research: the analysis of scientific publications about estimation of credit risk and the analysis of developed in this research credit risk estimation models performance. Analyzing financial data of Lithuanaian companies three initial credit risk estimation models were developed wherein these data analysis methods were applied: discriminant analysis (DA), logistic regression (LR) and artificial neural networks (ANN) - multilayer perceptron. 60 financial rates of companies were analyzed They were calculated from the financial reports of Lithuanian companies for 3 years. The variable selection for the DA model was accomplished applying the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The variable selection for the LR model was accomplished applying ANOVA. The actual variables for credit risk analysis in ANN model were selected by network according to their ranks of importance. The classification accuracy of models was evaluated by the correct classification rate (CCR). The highest classification accuracy was reached by LR model, which classified 97% of companies correctly. ANN model correctly classified 95.5%, DA model 84% of companies. Further situation was analyzed where 60 initial variables were reduced applying factor analysis and the changes in classification accuracy of models were estimated The number of factors to retain were calculated by the Kaiser criterion ant the scree test. After the factor analysis the 6 new credit risk estimation models were developed applying the same data analysis methods: DA, LR and ANN By every method 15 and 6 new variables obtained from the factor analysis were analyzed The research has shown that the new 15 variables extract 89.37% of variance from initial variables.

We find that using Gregory and Hansen's (1996) residual-based test for cointegration and Pedroni's (1999) panel cointegration test without structural breaks provide weak evidence of cointegration between nominal exchange rates vis-a-vis the US dollar and relative prices. However, when we use the Lagrange multiplier panel structural break cointegration test we find strong evidence of panel cointegration, providing evidence for PPP.","Fac Business & Law, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia",,"Narayan, PK (通讯作者)，Fac Business & Law, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",paresh.narayan@deakin.edu.au,"Narayan, Paresh/AAE-8777-2019; Narayan, Paresh Kumar/AEM-2143-2022","Narayan, Paresh/0000-0001-7934-8146",,,,,56,7,7,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In 1983, only 29 of the 459 local authority areas in the UK was coal mining more than 10% of total employment. Over the 20-year period 1983-2002, average percentage employment growth in these areas was less than the UK as a whole. But the key feature is the huge diversity across areas, with three showing employment falls of nearly 20% and three exhibiting employment gains of more than 30%. Some areas showed great resilience in the face of a serious shock. Two general factors account for over half the variability of this experience. First, the greater the percentage in coal mining in 1983, the lower was 20-year employment growth. Second, the more militant an area was during the miners' strike of 1984/85, the lower also was employment growth.","[Ormerod, Paul] Volterra Consulting Ltd, London SW14 8AE, England; [Ormerod, Paul] Univ Durham, Inst Adv Study, London SW14 8AE, England",Durham University,"Ormerod, P (通讯作者)，Volterra Consulting Ltd, 135C Sheen Lane, London SW14 8AE, England.",pormerod@volterra.co.uk,,,,,,,5,17,20,2,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

While the state provides subsidies to build comparative advantage, industry must learn to deploy borrowed technology efficiently in production and compete internationally. The state must also curtail consumption to build physical and educational infrastructure. However, current theories of late-late industrialization, which mostly draw from the East Asian manufacturing experience, demand reexamination thanks to the characteristics of information and communication technologies, especially software. These characteristics include rapid technological change, which can preclude learning from borrowed technology, and the need to encourage consumption, since information and communication technologies are general purpose technologies that can potentially enhance aggregate productivity. Further, as the marginal cost of production of software is negligible, efficient manufacturing is not an issue. This paper shows how our understanding of late-late industrialization may be broadened by drawing on the experience of the Indian software industry.","Int Inst Informat Technol Bangalore, Bangalore 560100, Karnataka, India",,"Parthasarathy, B (通讯作者)，Int Inst Informat Technol Bangalore, 26-C Elect City, Bangalore 560100, Karnataka, India.",pbalaji@iiitb.ac.in,,"Parthasarathy, Balaji/0000-0002-4246-8918",,,,,81,18,18,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

These expectations are found to be generated by a mixed process combining the traditional adaptive, regressive and extrapolative processes augmented by macroeconomic effects (price, income, money). This mixed expectational process verifies the term structure relation of interest rates based on the portfolio choice model with a long term asset and a short term asset, where a state-space representation is introduced to account for the unobservable part of the long term asset in the portfolio. As predicted by the theoretical model, the risk premium depends on the conditional expected variance of the short term asset and on the conditional expected covariance between the latter and inflation, while the estimated value of the relative risk aversion coefficient is found to be economically acceptable. Overall, these results support that experts' expectations are consistent with the model of interest rate term structure.","[Prat, Georges; Uctum, Remzi] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, CNRS, F-92001 Nanterre, France",Universite Paris Nanterre; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Prat, G (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, CNRS, 200 Av Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France.",georges.prat@u-paris10.fr; remzi.uctum@u-paris10.fr,,,,,,,35,2,2,0,9,DE BOECK UNIVERSITE,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

While models with deterministic trends are widely used, models with stochastic trends are not so well known. In an influential paper Harvey (1997) strongly advocates a structural time series approach with stochastic trends in place of the widely used autoregressive models based on unit root tests and cointegration techniques. Therefore, it is important to understand their relative merits. This article suggests that both methodologies are useful and they may perform differently in different models. This article provides a few guidelines to the applied economists to understand these alternative methods.","[Rao, B. Bhaskara] Univ S Pacific, Suva 2086, Fiji; [Rao, B.

In this study I focus on time investments in children as I investigate the long-term educational effects on children of increasing parents' birth-related leave from 14 to 20 weeks using a natural experiment from 1984 in Denmark. The causal effect of the reform is identified using regression discontinuity design to compare a population sample of children born shortly before and shortly after the reform took effect. Results indicate that increasing parents' access to birth-related leave has no measurable effect on children's long-term educational outcomes. Mothers' incomes and career opportunities are slightly positively affected by the reform. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This is exemplified by Cukierman and Lippi (2001) who postulate that wages are set having area-wide prices in mind. The insight of aggressive wage behaviour has not been confirmed by the EMU experience, which has been characterised by wage moderation. The present paper investigates the possibility of wage restraint using a monetary union model which. realistically, assumes that trade unions set wages with national prices in mind. Drawing on plausible ranges for all parameter values (and macroeconomic shocks), our simulations show that a monetary union elicits real wages that are broadly comparable to those obtained under monetary autonomy. The confidence bounds around these results are rather wide, in particular including scenarios of wage restraint. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

An empirical model that incorporates monetary, fiscal and other external variables in addition to exchange rates is developed. Before estimating the model, time-series properties of the data are diagnosed. Two forms of the model, one with real exchange rate and the other with nominal exchange rate and relative price level (foreign-to-domestic price ratio) are estimated. The results suggest that devaluation is contractionary in the short run, expansionary in the medium run and neutral in the long run, and the effects emanate from nominal devaluation and not from the changes in relative price level.","[Upadhyaya, Kamal P.] Univ New Haven, Dept Econ & Finance, West Haven, CT 06516 USA; [Sencicek, Mehmet] Yeshiva Univ, Dept Econ, Yeshiva Coll, New York, NY 10033 USA",University New Haven; Yeshiva University,"Upadhyaya, KP (通讯作者)，Univ New Haven, Dept Econ & Finance, West Haven, CT 06516 USA.",Kupadhyaya@newhaven.edu,,,,,,,26,13,15,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Marx acknowledged the great benefits that capitalism's unprecedented technological dynamism has brought to humanity. For Marx, however, the 'end and purpose' of capitalist production is the accumulation of surplus value. From this perspective technology in capitalism is, first and foremost, a means to capital's end, valorisation, with technological change furthering human ends in a profoundly partial and precarious manner. This paper reconstructs Marx's argument in favour of this general thesis. It concludes with a discussion of three illustrations. When technological development is subsumed under the valorisation imperative, technological change in the workplace will tend to reinforce coercive and exploitative social relations. Full development of the immense potential of network technologies will be systematically hampered, and technological change will tend to generate overaccumulation and financial crises.","Iowa State Univ, Dept Philosophy & Religious Studies, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University,"Smith, T (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Philosophy & Religious Studies, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",tonys@iastate.edu,"Smith, Tony/X-2037-2019",,,,,,21,13,14,3,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

This has serious implications for global economic governance as one of the main causes of the international financial crisis were those imbalances. The two possible traumatic exit options for the Bretton Woods II regime are that China diversifies its reserves (which could trigger a dollar crisis) and that the United States imposes unilateral tariffs on China (which could weaken the multilateral trading system).

The latter accrues to all countries. Own country emissions reductions are typically not in the self interest of countries and hence countries will not participate in global climate negotiations, unless the perceived damage from climate change is very large and much larger than damage estimates in the Stern review. We use Stern based damage estimates and investigate how the incentives for large population low wage rapidly growing countries in the BRIC group (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to participate in global climate change negotiations both as a sub-global coalition and individually can be affected by penalties (tariffs) inflicted or financial transfers made to them by the OECD. We assess what levels of other country trade measures linked to non-participation are needed to induce compliance as an all or nothing discrete choice. We also analyze participation linked to financial transfers. We use a general equilibrium model calibrated to a 2006-2056 base case, and capture induced changes in the global trade equilibrium in our analyses. Our results suggest that only very high tariffs of over a hundred percent by all other countries, or even higher tariffs by the OECD alone, could induce participation by BRIC countries. Equally, large financial transfers would be needed. (C) 2009 Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In fact, fiscal policy can be conceived only as a mixture between the methods of procurement of resources available to the state and those regarding the destinations that are given to these resources, in the performance of its functions and tasks. Fiscal policy represents the aggregate of decisions that are taken in order to achieve the structural modeling of the tax system, the guarantee of its functioning in order to accomplish the desired aims in economics by the public decision-making person. Therefore, fiscal policy is a component of the state financial policy, including all the regulations on the establishment and collecting of taxes and materializing the state's options about taxes, also the decisions concerning public expenses that are financed. But, its components must be concerted with those of the budgetary or monetary policy, also of the price policy and the employment policy etc., so that they become integrated into the general policy. When it comes to taxation, European policy has two major components: direct taxation - which is the responsibility of member states and indirect taxation, which affects the free movement of goods and services. Member states have already taken measures to prevent tax evasion and double taxation, and European policy in this area aims to ensure that on the home market the competition is not distorted by differences between the systems and the installments of indirect taxation. Moreover, measures have been taken to prevent the negative effects of competition in taxation, which may arise in case of assets transfers between EU member states.","[Tuncu, George-Florin; Popescu, Marin; Rizea, Marinel] Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Sibiu, Romania; [Tuncu, George-Florin] Constantin Brancoveanu Univ, Fac Management Mkt Econ Business, Pitesti, Romania",Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu; Constantin Brancoveanu University,"Tuncu, GF (通讯作者)，Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Sibiu, Romania.",tun_flo@yahoo.com; mariusmp@yahoo.com,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,1,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-987-8,,,,2010,,,,,,,760,769,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8PH,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000392594000108,0

Maberly and Pierce focus on the Halloween effect in the United States and contend it is driven by two negative-return outliers. We argue that controlling for two outliers is somewhat arbitrary. We apply robust regression methods-including all the data but limiting the influence of extreme returns-to the estimation of the Halloween effect in the United States. Contrary to the Maberly and Pierce findings, our results indicate statistical significance of a Halloween effect in the U.S. at levels similar to those originally reported in Bouman and Jacobsen.","Missouri State Univ, Springfield, MO 65897 USA",Missouri State University,"Witte, HD (通讯作者)，Missouri State Univ, Springfield, MO 65897 USA.",witte@missouristate.edu,"WITTE, HUGH/GSJ-0217-2022",,,,,,8,10,10,0,8,INST SPONTANEOUS ORDER ECONOMICS,FAIRFAX,"9745 KINGS CROWN COURT #102, FAIRFAX, VA 22031 USA",1933-527X,,,ECON J WATCH,Econ.

This is probably because females are less likely to have full-time jobs and thus have more spare time, leading them to seek social involvement in their neighbourhoods and participate in community activities. Second, divorce causes the propensity to commit suicide among males to become about two times higher than that among females because of the compensation costs that males are more likely to pay to females.","Seinan Gakuin Univ, Dept Econ, Sawara Ku, Fukuoka 8148511, Japan",,"Yamamura, E (通讯作者)，Seinan Gakuin Univ, Dept Econ, Sawara Ku, 6-2-92 Nishijin, Fukuoka 8148511, Japan.",yamaei@seinan-gu.ac.jp,,,,,,,22,16,20,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

It presents a model where an upstream patent holder with no production capabilities licenses a product innovation, by means of royalty-only contracts, to several downstream firms that produce and market the new product. In a two-period signaling model, the profitability of short-term and long-term contracts is compared, given that the licensees' costs may be inferred by observation of their output levels. For a sufficiently large difference in production costs, the patentee introduces a series of short-term contracts, rather than a long-term contract for the entire expected lifetime of the innovation. In such a sequence of contracts, both high- and low-cost firms pay the same royalty rate (which is not higher than that of long-term contracts) and reveal their costs in the first licensing period. Thereafter, royalties are smaller (than in the first period) for high-cost firms but larger for low-cost producers so as to increase expected total output and licensing income. Overall, royalties are not time-decreasing, in expected terms, as information evolves from incomplete to complete. This strategy is typically welfare-improving.","Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela,"Antelo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, Campus Norte, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain.",manel.antelo@usc.es,,"Antelo, Manel/0000-0003-1846-6872",,,,,23,3,3,1,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-5469,,,SPAN ECON REV,Span.

Moreover, rivalry has a clearly negative impact on the disposition towards others and on the experienced well-being of those on the long side. Since subjective well-being improves only for those on the short side rivalry contributes to larger inequalities in experienced well-being.

First, the firm-level component of the effective tax burden is generally much more important than the one at the country level. Second, tentative empirical results on the nexus between firm level investment and corporate taxation illustrate that the conclusions obtained with forward looking firm-level effective tax rates differ starkly from those based on country-level forward-looking rates.","[Loretz, Simon] Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Ctr Business Taxat, Oxford OX1 11HP, England; [Egger, Peter] Ifo Inst, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Egger, Peter] Univ Munich, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Pfaffermayr, Michael] Univ Innsbruck, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Winner, Hannes] Salzburg Univ, A-5010 Salzburg, Austria",University of Oxford; Ifo Institut; University of Munich; University of Innsbruck; Salzburg University,"Loretz, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Ctr Business Taxat, Pk End St, Oxford OX1 11HP, England.",egger@ifo.de; simon.loretz@sbs.ox.ac.uk; michael.pfaffermayr@uibk.ac.at; hannes.winner@sbg.ac.at,"Loretz, Simon/AAE-5830-2020; Pfaffermayr, Michael/AAR-2786-2020","Pfaffermayr, Michael/0000-0002-8558-7757; Egger, Peter/0000-0002-0546-1207; Loretz, Simon/0000-0002-7117-1531; Winner, Hannes/0000-0001-9350-6892",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F037864/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/F037864/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,29,21,22,2,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

These shocks, which were more persistent than expected when they first started, led to an inflation rate that significantly exceeded the target established by the Central Bank. With this in mind, the objective of this paper is to analyze and quantify the implications of the more persistent supply shocks on the main macroeconomic variables, i.e., the inflation rate, the output gap, the interest rate, and the exchange rate. We find that more persistent supply shocks lead to greater inertia (as expected), as well as to greater volatility of these variables. This, in turn, causes the disequilibrium generated by this type of shock to disappear rather slowly. In addition, a greater level of indexation originating in a potential de-anchoring of expectations could intensify the impact of supply shocks' persistence. Finally, the effects on inflation are nullified if the central bank only considers the inflation rate in its loss function.","[Felipe Morande, L.; Mauricio Tejada, G.] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Negocios, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile,"Morandé, LF (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Negocios, Santiago, Chile.",fmorande@fen.uchile.cl; mtejada@fen.uchile.cl,,,,,,,48,0,0,0,2,BANCO CENTRAL CHILE,SANTIAGO,"MORANDE 115 2ND PISO, AUGUSTINAS 1180, SANTIAGO, 6500-590, CHILE",0717-3830,,,ECON CHIL,Econ.

One might be tempted to argue that by this single indicator alone, the government's macroeconomic policies have been a failure. This paper explains why jumping to such a conclusion would be a mistake. Annual time series data on total formal sector employment is constructed dating back to 1946. The relationship between economic growth and formal sector employment is then measured and changes in the employment coefficient over time are described. The employment coefficient was found to be relatively stable, with a long-term average value of 0.5. It returned to this value after a short-lived collapse in the mid-1990s. It is concluded that the main reason for the persistently high and rising rates of unemployment in South Africa since the mid 1990s was the very large increase in the labour force and not a historically deficient growth or employment performance of the economy.","Univ S Africa, Dept Econ, ZA-0003 Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Hodge, D (通讯作者)，Univ S Africa, Dept Econ, POB 392, ZA-0003 Pretoria, South Africa.",hodged@unisa.ac.za,,,,,,,20,16,20,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

This is due to realization that during the crisis the countries affected saw turmoil in both their currencies and stock markets. This paper studies the non-linear interactions between stock price and exchange rate in Malaysia using a two regimes multivariate Markov switching vector autoregression (MS-VAR) model with regime shifts in both the mean and the variance. In the study, the Kuala Lumpur Composite Index (KLCI) and the exchange rates of Malaysia ringgit against four other countries namely the Singapore dollar, the Japanese yen, the British pound sterling and the Australian dollar between 1990 and 2005 are used. The empirical results show that all the series are not cointegrated but the MS-VAR model with two regimes manage to detect common regime shifts behavior in all the series. The estimated MS-VAR model reveals that as the stock price index falls the exchange rates depreciate and when the stock price index gains the exchange rates appreciate. In addition, the MS-VAR model fitted the data better than the linear vector autoregressive model (VAR).","[Ismail, Mohd Tahir] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Math Sci, Minden 18000, Penang, Malaysia; [Bin Isa, Zaidi] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Sch Math Sci, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Ismail, MT (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Math Sci, Minden 18000, Penang, Malaysia.",mtahir@cs.usm.my; zaidiisa@pkrisc.cc.ukm.my,"Ismail, Mohd Tahir/A-7280-2018","Ismail, Mohd Tahir/0000-0003-2747-054X",,,,,44,17,20,1,11,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

A comparative dynamics analysis demonstrates that if a government's fiscal deficit is not so high, deflation has a negative impact on the upper bound, while if a government's fiscal deficit exceeds a critical level, deflation rather improves it.

It is found that the impact is indeed sizeable: a 1-percent decline in economic growth in the USA, the EU and Japan is likely to lead to a 0.73-percent decline in growth in China. The article discusses whether the current measures of fiscal stimulus are adequate to offset the sharp decline in external demand. Although there is little doubt that the massive fiscal stimulus will largely offset the significant shortfalls in external demand, the current growth pattern in China will be increasingly unsustainable in the long term. China's reform cycles suggest that external shocks are often opportunities for structural reforms. Therefore, the crisis could also be a catalyst for rebalancing China's economic structure so as to return the economy to a sustainable path.","Australia & New Zealand Banking Grp, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",,"Liu, LG (通讯作者)，Australia & New Zealand Banking Grp, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",ligang.liu@ANZ.COM,,,,,,,9,27,28,0,22,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,DEC,2009,17.0,6,,,,,1,23,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2009.01171.x,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,519PC,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271778100001,0

In this paper, we extend the CGK model by assuming that traders are not allowed to consume more than a given amount (upper bound) of the good. In the CGK model, instead the only restriction is that no agent can consume more than the entire endowment in the economy. By varying this upper bound, we characterize the set of endowments (efficient region) in which efficient trading mechanisms exist in terms of this upper bound. We show that the efficient region becomes smaller when the upper bound decreases. On the other hand, when this upper bound becomes the entire endowment of the economy, we obtain the result in CGK as a special case.","[Wang, Yuntong] Univ Windsor, Dept Econ, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada; [Lu, Hu] Hlth Canada, Appl Res & Anal Directorate, Ottawa, ON K1A 0L2, Canada",University of Windsor; Health Canada,"Wang, YT (通讯作者)，Univ Windsor, Dept Econ, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.",Hu_Lu@hc-sc.gc.ca; yuntong@uwindsor.ca,,,,,,,6,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,1434-4750,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

Most previous studies control for unobserved skills of workers by applying the fixed-effects estimator to longitudinal data, thus assuming time-invariant unobserved individual heterogeneity. We release this assumption by using a sample of moonlighters; hence, identification is achieved by differencing across two jobs held simultaneously rather than sequentially. Using the UK Quarterly Labour Force Survey, we find that controlling for unobserved skills in the sample of moonlighters does not reduce the estimate of the wage gap.","[Muravyev, Alexander] DIW Berlin, IZA, Berlin, Germany; [Muravyev, Alexander] St Petersburg Univ, Grad Sch Management, St Petersburg, FL USA",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Muravyev, A (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, IZA, Berlin, Germany.",,"Muravyev, Alexander/D-7846-2013","Muravyev, Alexander/0000-0001-8936-2582",,,,,38,2,2,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

Commons often referred to third sector organizations, such as associations, cooperatives, and trade unions, it is unclear how these organizations can be fitted into his transactional typology. This paper clarifies this problem by identifying two dimensions of bargaining, managerial, and rationing transactions: 1) the extent of legal equality of transactional participants, and 2) the extent of commonness of these participants' transactional interests. These dimensions enable defining the identity of the third sector in terms of a distinct variety of rationing transactions combining legal equality of transactional participants with significant commonness of their interests. The paper further explores several implications of this argument for new institutional economics, concerning the citizenship aspect of markets and hierarchies and the possibility of viewing third sector organizations as hybrids between markets and hierarchies.

We use a dynamic-equilibrium model with tax distortions and government outlays uncertainty, and model maturity as the fraction of debt that needs to be rolled over every period. In the model, the benefits of defaulting are tempered by higher future interest rates. We then calibrate our artificial economy and solve for the optimal debt maturity for Brazil as an example of a developing country and the US as an example of a mature economy. We obtain that the calibrated costs from defaulting on long-term debt more than offset costs associated with short-term debt. Therefore, short-term debt implies higher welfare levels.","[Alfaro, Laura] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Kanczuk, Fabio] Univ Sao Paulo, BR-05508 Sao Paulo, Brazil",Harvard University; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Alfaro, L (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",lalfaro@hbs.edu; kanczuk@usp.br,,,,,,,18,20,28,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

The previous empirical literature has not reached a consensus about the size of the education externality, which is given by the difference between the microeconomic and the macroeconomic return to education. Relative to our benchmark value that is based on a parameterization of the derived specification, we find that the estimated education externality is too large when the empirical model is not properly restricted, and appears to be absent when all control variables of the empirical model are properly accounted for. We note that the absence of an education externality is difficult to reconcile with observed levels of education subsidies for efficiency reasons.","[Gundlach, Erich] Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24100 Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Gundlach, E (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, POB 4309, D-24100 Kiel, Germany.",erich.gundlach@ifw-kiel.de,"Carstensen, Kai/AAF-7834-2020",,,,,,35,6,6,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

The first is examined in Imbs et al. - which we refer to as estimator aggregation bias - and the second is put forth by Broda and Weinstein - hereafter, data aggregation bias. The findings indicate substantial estimator aggregation bias and data aggregation bias. Although estimates using aggregate data and imposing homogeneous coefficients provide little evidence of PPP, findings with disaggregated data and heterogeneous coefficient estimators offer strong support. The results also suggest the presence of small-sample bias as examined in Chen and Engel, but with little effect on the qualitative results. Tradable goods and non-tradable goods show little distinction in convergence rates.

We experimentally Verify that belief elicitation can alter paths of play in a two-player repeated asymmetric matching pennies game. Importantly, this effect occurs only during early periods and only for players with strongly asymmetric payoffs, consistent with a cognitive/affective effect on priors that may serve as a substitute for experience. These effects occur with a common scoring rule elicitation procedure, but not with simpler (unmotivated) statements of expected choices of opponents. Scoring rule belief elicitation improves the goodness of fit of structural models of belief learning, and prior beliefs implied by such models are both stronger and more realistic when beliefs are elicited than when they are not. We also find that inferred beliefs (beliefs estimated from past observed actions of opponents) can predict observed actions better than the stated beliefs from scoring rule belief elicitation.

International R&D Spillovers. European Economic Review, 39, 859-887] is first revisited on an expanded data set that we have constructed for the purpose of this study. The new estimates confirm the key results reported in Coe and Helpman about the impact of domestic and foreign R&D capital stocks on TFP. In addition, we show that domestic and foreign R&D capital stocks have measurable impacts on TFP even after controlling for the impact of human capital. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to include institutional variables. Our results suggest that institutional differences are important determinants of TFP and that they impact the degree of R&D spillovers. Countries where the ease of doing business and the quality of tertiary education systems are relatively high tend to benefit more from their own R&D efforts, from international R&D spillovers, and from human capital formation. Strong patent protection is associated with higher levels of total factor productivity, higher returns to domestic R&D, and larger international R&D spillovers. Finally, countries whose legal systems are based on French and, to a lesser extent, Scandinavian law benefit less from their own and foreign R&D capital than countries whose legal origins are based on English or German law.

I argue that this desire was moulded in evolutionary times by a mechanism known to biologists as sexual selection, whereby an observable trait - conspicuous consumption in this case - is used by members of one sex to signal their unobservable characteristics valuable to members of the opposite sex. It then shows that the standard economics problem of utility maximisation is formally equivalent to the standard biology problem of the maximisation of individual fitness, the ability to pass genes to future generations, and thus establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation for including conspicuous consumption in the utility function.

To study this phenomenon, we introduce the notion of physician-enabled demand and examine empirically whether this behavior responds to competitive pressures in the market and financial incentives associated with different physician payment mechanisms. We find that physician-enabled demand increases with more competition under fee-for-service reimbursement, but decreases with greater competition under managed care.

A trade reform is often deemed beneficial because the elimination of trade barriers allows labour to reallocate towards those sectors in the economy in which the country has a comparative advantage. The amount and speed of the reallocation, however, and the post-reform behaviour of output, productivity and welfare, will depend on how regulated the labour market is. First, I document that high firing costs slow down the intersectoral reallocation of labour after a trade reform. Second, in order to isolate the effect of firing costs on labour reallocation, output and welfare after a trade reform, I build a dynamic general equilibrium model. I find that if a country does not liberalize its labour market at the outset of its trade reform, the intersectoral reallocation of workers will be 30% slower, and as much as 30% of the gains in real output and labour productivity in the years following the trade reform will be lost. From a policy standpoint, the message is that while trade reforms are desirable, they need to be complemented by labour market reforms in order to be fully successful.","Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",University of Toronto,"Kambourov, G (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",,,,,,,,32,67,95,1,28,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

They base their results on multivariate unit root tests that provide for two breaks in mean. This note extends the analysis to directly examine whether the series were fractionally integrated. When no allowance is made for breaking means, the results suggest evidence in favor of hysteresis, an outcome that generally applies when one break in mean is considered. Allowing for two breaks demonstrates that the evidence in favor of the natural rate and the hysteresis hypotheses is temporally sensitive.","Queens Univ, Sch Business, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",Queens University - Canada,"Sephton, PS (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Sch Business, 143 Union St, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",PSephton@business.queensu.ca,"Sephton, Peter/JFS-9778-2023","Sephton, Peter/0000-0002-8871-6649",,,,,7,15,15,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Unions' strategy in this paper includes bargaining for non-wage benefits together with monetary compensation for workers. It is shown that unions' strategy generates employment, raises the ratio of skilled to unskilled workers and raises national income. This suggests that even when migration acts as a competitive fringe, instead of using controversial migration policy as a covert anti-union tool, policy makers should encourage this type of bargaining which will have both economically and politically favorable effects.

Despite the general appeal of the integrated MCP approach, dimensionality imposes limitations on practical application. A complementarity representation involves both primal and dual relationships, often doubling the number of equations and thereby the scope for error in specification. When an underlying optimization model of the energy system includes upper and lower bounds on many decision variables, the explicit treatment of income effects may become intractable. We present a decomposition of the integrated MCP formulation that permits a convenient combination of top-down general equilibrium models and bottom-up energy system models for energy policy analysis. We advocate the use of complementarity methods to solve the top-down economic equilibrium model and quadratic programming to solve the underlying bottom-up energy supply model. A simple iterative procedure reconciles the equilibrium prices and quantities between both models. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Second, it documents a much neglected topic in economics: that ex ante estimates of costs and benefits are often very different from actual ex post costs and benefits. For large infrastructure projects the consequences are cost overruns, benefit shortfalls, and the systematic underestimation of risks. Third, implications for cost-benefit analysis are described, including that such analysis is not to be trusted for major infrastructure projects. Fourth, the article uncovers the causes of this state of affairs in terms of perverse incentives that encourage promoters to underestimate costs and overestimate benefits in the business cases for their projects. But the projects that are made to look best on paper are the projects that amass the highest cost overruns and benefit shortfalls in reality. The article depicts this situation as 'survival of the unfittest'. Fifth, the article sets out to explain how the problem may be solved, with a view to arriving at more efficient and more democratic projects, and avoiding the scandals that often accompany major infrastructure investments. Finally, the article identifies current trends in major infrastructure development. It is argued that a rapid increase in stimulus spending, combined with more investments in emerging economies, combined with more spending on information technology is catapulting infrastructure investment from the frying pan into the fire.","Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Flyvbjerg, Bent] Aalborg Univ, Aalborg, Denmark; [Flyvbjerg, Bent] Delft Univ Technol, NL-2600 AA Delft, Netherlands",University of Oxford; Aalborg University; Delft University of Technology,"Flyvbjerg, B (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",bent.flyvbjerg@sbs.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,41,291,321,2,85,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

It explains why infrastructure matters, why Britain's infrastructure performance has been poor, and summarizes the scale of the challenge for the coming decade. Privatization, liberalization, and competition have focused on monopoly market failure and private incentives, but they have neglected the time inconsistency problem which confronts investors in networks with high fixed and sunk costs. The failure to commit which has characterized British approaches to infrastructure has been partially addressed through the creation of regulated asset bases (RABs), backed up by the duty on regulators to ensure that functions can be financed. The paper considers how the RABs can be developed to provide credible long-term contracts over a wide range of activities, and how the financial regulatory regime can complement this commitment, notably through the split cost of capital and the indexation of the cost of debt approaches. The paper concludes by setting out the building blocks of a credible regulatory framework for infrastructure, together with the impacts on reducing the cost of capital. The role of the State in reinforcing this commitment and the associated institutions are also set out.","New Coll, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Helm, D (通讯作者)，New Coll, Oxford, England.",dieter@dhelm.co.uk,,,,,,,22,26,27,0,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Applied Mathematics and Computation 2003, 146(2-3),849-855.] studied most productive scale size in classic data envelopment analysis. The classic data envelopment analysis requires that the values for all inputs and outputs be known exactly. However, this assumption may not be true, because data in many real applications cannot be precisely measured. One of the important methods to deal with imprecise data is considering stochastic data in DEA. Therefore, this research studies most productive scale size with considering stochastic data in DEA. To that end, input-output orientation model introduced in Jahanshahloo and Khodabakhshi [Jahanshahloo, GR and Khodabakhshi, M., Using input-output orientation model for determining most productive scale size in DEA Applied Mathematics and Computation 2003,146(2-3), 849-855.] is extended in stochastic data envelopment analysis. To solve the stochastic model, a deterministic equivalent is obtained. Although the deterministic equivalent is non-linear, it can be converted to a quadratic program. Furthermore. data of software companies is used to apply the proposed approach. Performance of software companies are evaluated based on their scale sizes in classic and stochastic data envelopment analysis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that the interplay of pension generosity and development of capital markets is crucial to understand fertility decisions. Since children have traditionally represented for parents a form of retirement saving, particularly in economies with limited or nonexistent capital markets, an exogenous increase of pension spending provides a saving technology alternative to children, thus relaxing financial (saving) constraints and reducing fertility. We build a simple two-period OLG model to show that an increase in pensions is associated with a larger decrease in fertility in countries in which individuals have less access to financial markets. Cross-country regression analysis supports our result: an interaction between various measures of pension generosity and a proxy for the development of financial markets consistently enters the regressions positively and significantly, suggesting that in economies with limited financial markets, children represent a (if not the only) way for parents to save for old age, and that increases in pensions amount effectively to relaxing these constraints.","[Profeta, Paola] Univ Bocconi, Econpubbl & Dondena Res Ctr, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Galasso, Vincenzo] Univ Bocconi, IGIER, CEPR, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Galasso, Vincenzo] Dondena Res Ctr, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Gatti, Roberta] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Gatti, Roberta] CEPR, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Bocconi University; Bocconi University; Bocconi University; The World Bank; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Profeta, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bocconi, Econpubbl & Dondena Res Ctr, Via Rontgen 1,Room 3B103, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",vincenzo.galasso@unibocconi.it; rgatti@worldbank.org; paola.profeta@unibocconi.it,"Galasso, Vincenzo/AFP-4222-2022","Galasso, Vincenzo/0000-0002-3882-0587",,,,,30,20,24,0,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

The main question to be answered with the integrated model is whether or not the central bank should include explicitly the financial stability indicator in its monetary policy (interest rate) reaction function. It is found in general, that including distance-to-default (dtd) of the banking system in the central bank reaction function reduces both inflation and output volatility. Moreover, the results are robust to different model calibrations. Indeed, it is more efficient to include dtd in the reaction function with higher coefficient of exchange rate pass through, and with a larger impact of financial vulnerability on the exchange rate, as well as on GDP (or the reverse, there is more effect of GDP on bank's equity-i.e., what we call endogeneity).",,,,DGray@imf.org; cgarcia@uahurtado.cl; lluna@transelec.cl; jrestrep@bcentral.cl,,,,,,,38,1,1,0,1,BANCO CENTRAL CHILE,SANTIAGO,"MORANDE 115 2ND PISO, AUGUSTINAS 1180, SANTIAGO, 6500-590, CHILE",0717-3830,,,ECON CHIL,Econ.

If, however, these are not valid, misspecified models result. This article considers estimation of the dynamic linear panel data model, which often forms the basis of testable economic hypotheses. The estimators of such a model are frequently similarly based on certain assumptions which appear to be often untenable in practice. Here, the performance of these estimators is analyzed in scenarios where the theoretically required conditions are not met. Specifically, we consider three such instances of serial correlation of the idiosyncratic disturbance terms; correlation of the idiosyncratic disturbance terms and explanatory variables; and, finally, cross-sectional dependence (as a robustness check to these findings, we also consider correlations between observed and unobserved heterogeneity terms). The major findings are that the limited tests readily available tend to have poor power properties and that estimators' performance varies greatly across scenarios. In such a wide array of experiments, it is difficult to pick-out just one winner. However, a robust estimator across all experiments and parameter settings was a variant of the Wansbeek-Bekker estimator. This is a significant finding, as this estimator is infrequently used in practice. When the experiments are extended to include correlations between observed and unobserved heterogeneity terms, one might also consider, for across-the-board performance, the Blundell and Bond estimator.","[Harris, Mark N.; Timol, Isfaaq] Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia; [Kostenko, Weiping] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Matyas, Laszlo] Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary; [Matyas, Laszlo] Univ Paris 12, Paris, France",Monash University; University of Melbourne; Central European University; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC),"Harris, MN (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia.",,"Harris, Mark/O-5084-2015","Harris, Mark/0000-0002-1804-4357",,,,,29,4,4,0,5,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

It is then shown that when the spillover effect is large (small), a cooperative investment regime achieves a lower (higher) access cost than a noncooperative investment regime.

The development of the optimum-currency-area paradigm, however, has not been a smooth one. After a rise in research activity during the 1960s, the paradigm fell from favor in the 1970s and 1980s, before it re-emerged as an active area of research. This paper argues that the decline of the theory as an active area of research partly reflects paradoxes among the contributions of Mundell, McKinnon, and Kenen. Correspondingly, the renewed interest in the theory is due, in part, to a reconciliation of those paradoxes, reflecting both developments in academic thought and the evolution of the international monetary system.","Bank Greece, Athens 10250, Greece",European Central Bank; Bank of Greece,"Tavlas, GS (通讯作者)，Bank Greece, El Venizelos Ave, Athens 10250, Greece.",gtavlas@bankofgreece.gr,,,,,,,62,16,19,2,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We allow not only for the cross-sectional dependencies of innovations, but also for the presence of co-integration across cross-sectional levels. Unbalanced panels and panels with differing individual short-run dynamics and cross-sectionally related dynamics are also permitted. We also more carefully formulate the unit root hypotheses in panels. In particular, using order statistics, we make it possible to test for and against the presence of unit roots in some of the individual units for a given panel. The individual IV t-ratios, which are the bases of our tests, are asymptotically and normally distributed and cross-sectionally independent. Therefore, the critical values of the order statistics as well as the usual average statistic can be easily obtained from simple elementary probability computations. We show via a set of simulations that our tests work well, whereas other existing tests fail to perform properly. As an illustration, we apply our tests to the panels of real exchange rates, and find no evidence for the purchasing power parity hypothesis, which is in sharp contrast with the previous studies.","[Chang, Yoosoon] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Song, Wonho] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Chung Ang University,"Chang, YS (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0969146] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,26,35,36,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

In order to sensibly represent the rank mobility of subgroups within a given society, we address the problem in terms of partial permutation matrices which include standard (global) matrices as a special case. We first provide a characterization of a partial ordering on partial matrices which, in the standard case of global matrices, coincides with the well-known concordance ordering. We then provide a characterization of an index of rank mobility based on partial matrices and show that, in the standard case of comparing global matrices, it is equivalent to Spearman's p index.

In agreement with the theory of storage, we find that: i) the negative correlation between price volatility and inventory is globally significant for crude oil; ii) this negative correlation prevails only during those periods of scarcity when the inventory is below the historical average and increases importantly during the winter periods for natural gas.

And, if so, can we quantify the benefit? Since the emergence of the euro, there has been great interest in the consequences of a transfer of the dollar's premier international role to the euro. This paper presents a novel model-based approach towards assessing the welfare benefits associated with the international use of a country's currency. Apart from the familiar benefits associated with seigniorage, residents of the issuing country experience an increase in the purchasing power of their currency both at home and abroad. In the calibration exercise carried out in this paper, we find the benefits of an international currency to be quantitatively significant. The welfare gain for the Euro area in having the euro internationally used ranges from 1.9% to 2.3% of consumption depending on relative inflation rates. The rest of the world is not indifferent as to which currency circulates as the dominant international currency. Conditional on their currency not being used internationally, their preference is for the dominant international currency to be the one with the lowest inflation rate. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, if less educated foreign- and native-born workers specialize in different production tasks, because of different abilities, immigration will cause natives to reallocate their task supply, thereby reducing downward wage pressure. Using occupational task-intensity data from the O*NET dataset and individual US census data, we demonstrate that foreign-born workers specialize in occupations intensive in manual-physical labor skills while natives pursue jobs more intensive in communication-language tasks. This mechanism can explain why economic analyses find only modest wage consequences of immigration for less educated native-horn workers.

The main hypothesis under investigation is that the impact of the franchise extension on the tax structure is conditional on tax collection costs. We find that the share of direct taxes (including the personal income tax) is positively affected by the franchise extension, but only if relative tax collection costs are below a given threshold. We use literacy as a proxy for the cost of levying a broad-based income tax. We also show that the gradual relaxation of income and wealth restrictions on the right to vote contributed to growth in total government spending and taxation.","[Jensen, Peter S.] Univ So Denmark, Dept Border Reg Studies, DK-6400 Sonderborg, Denmark; [Aidt, Toke S.] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England",University of Southern Denmark; University of Cambridge,"Jensen, PS (通讯作者)，Univ So Denmark, Dept Border Reg Studies, Als 2, DK-6400 Sonderborg, Denmark.",toke.aidt@econ.cam.ac.uk; psj@sam.sdu.dk,"Jensen, Peter/ABC-1916-2021; Aidt, Toke/AAC-1068-2020","Aidt, Toke/0000-0002-8319-6568; Jensen, Peter/0000-0003-1905-6859",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/D000912/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/D000912/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,70,67,73,1,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

This heroic design feature has led to debate on the adequacy of superannuation plans for those with interrupted employment, particularly the adverse impacts this has on the retirement income prospects of women. This paper employs non-parametric stochastic simulation to investigate two possible solutions to gender inequality in superannuation, higher contribution rates and more aggressive asset allocation. Our results suggest that while both these strategies in isolation are effective in reducing the current gender disparity in superannuation outcomes, they demand significant changes to current arrangements when employed individually to address the problem. A combined approach is found to be more powerful in ensuring a more equitable superannuation outcome for women, as it nullifies the relative disadvantage of interrupted employment with only modest changes to contribution rates and asset allocation.","[Basu, Anup K.] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Drew, Michael E.] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Griffith University,"Basu, AK (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",,,"Basu, Anup/0000-0002-7977-0467; Drew, Michael/0000-0002-2822-9611",,,,,29,6,6,0,4,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0004-9018,,,AUST ECON REV,Aust.

The decomposition satisfies the completely identical distribution (CID) condition, whereby the between-group inequality is null if and only if the distribution within each subgroup is identical to all the others. Thus, this decomposition contrasts strikingly with the subgroup decomposition of the generalized entropy measures, which satisfy the condition that the between-group inequality is null if the mean within each subgroup equals those of all the others. The new decomposition can be generalized to the distance-Gini index and the volume-Gini index, two multivariate Gini indices introduced by Koshevoy and Mosler, with some modification of the index definition and a somewhat loosened CID condition in the latter case. The source decomposition is also generalized to these multi-dimensional indices. Interaction terms appear among sources of different attributes in the decomposition for the modified volume-Gini index.","Stat Res & Training Inst, Minist Internal Affairs & Commun, Shinjyuku Ku, Tokyo 1628668, Japan",,"Okamoto, M (通讯作者)，Stat Res & Training Inst, Minist Internal Affairs & Commun, Shinjyuku Ku, Tokyo 1628668, Japan.",mokamoto2@stat.go.jp,,"Okamoto, Masato/0000-0003-1652-7061",,,,,24,7,9,3,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

However, it is standard economics that individuals value losses more than gains. Moreover, imposing large, uncompensated and uninsurable policy-induced losses would be widely regarded as unfair, when they are merely collateral damage from policy action. The article argues the case for adjusting the calculation of efficiency to take account of this 'unfairness' and discusses how it could be done.

The first is to identify current problems in Japan's pension administration. The chief problem is a weak governance structure. In particular, the current governance structure ignores the role of pension participants. A rigorous division and clear assignment of responsibilities to each of the pension participants, the Social Insurance Agency, and the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is urgently needed. Given rapid demographic change, the second objective is to consider the case for full tax financing of the National Basic Pension. It is estimated that the net burden would vary across different cohorts, but we demonstrate that the net burden can be smoothed across different cohorts.

The files available at YouTube include a mix of user-generated video and clips from network television shows. Networks fear that availability of their clips oil YouTube will depress television viewing. But unauthorized clips are also free advertising for television shows. As YouTube has grown quickly, major networks have responded by making their content available at their own sites. This paper examines the effects of authorized and unauthorized web distribution on television viewing between 2005 and 2007 using a survey of Penn students on their tendencies to watch television series on television as well as on the web. The results provide a glimpse of the way young, Internet-connected people use YouTube and related sites. While I find some evidence of substitution of web viewing for conventional television viewing, time spent oil viewing programming on the web - 6.8 h per week - far exceeds the reduction in weekly traditional television viewing of about 7 min. Perhaps more important, overall time spent on network-controlled viewing (television plus network web sites) increased by 3.7 h per week.

Our model economy corresponds to a two-stage game. First, firms choose their capacity levels. Second, after the capacity levels are observed, they set prices. Given the capacities and prices, consumers allocate their demands across the firms. We establish the existence of pure strategy oligopoly equilibria and characterize the set of equilibria. We then investigate the efficiency properties of these equilibria, where efficiency is defined as the ratio of surplus in equilibrium relative to the first best. We show that efficiency in the worst oligopoly equilibria can be arbitrarily low. However, if the best oligopoly equilibrium is selected (among multiple equilibria), the worst-case efficiency loss is 2(root N - 1)/(N - 1) with N firms, and this bound is tight. We also suggest a simple way of implementing the best oligopoly equilibrium. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

By analyzing the dynamics under order-driven protocols we show that the behavioral and structural assumptions of the model are closely intertwined. The high responsiveness of agents to a fitness measure causes excess volatility, but the frictions of the order-driven markets may stabilize the dynamics.

The model incorporates foreign direct investment in business services and productivity effects in imperfectly competitive goods and services markets endogenously. through a Dixit-Stiglitz framework. The ad valorem equivalent of barriers to foreign direct investment have been estimated based on detailed questionnaires completed by specialists in Kenya. We estimate very substantial gains to Kenya from regulatory liberalization in business services, and additional gains from uniform tariffs. The estimated gains increase to 50% of consumption in the long run steady state model, where the impact on the accumulation of capital from an improvement in the productivity of capital is taken into account. Decomposition exercises reveal that the largest gains to Kenya will derive from liberalization of costly regulatory barriers that are nondiscriminatory in their impacts between Kenyan and multinational service providers.

Using a model that explicitly allows for consumption smoothing, we obtain an estimate of relative risk aversion of 82. Instead, assuming consumption to be immediate gives an estimate of 2, close to what is traditionally reported, while a model of full asset integration gives estimates higher by several orders of magnitude. Our results show that estimated risk aversion is sensitive to the assumptions made with respect to the consumption profile and that it is possible to determine the level of asset integration endogenously. The average subjective time discount rate, which includes a preference for the present, equals 6 percent per month.

We show that large depreciations tend to generate a negative impact on the pass-through coefficient, this impact being more intense the higher the level of dollarization of the economy. We interpret this as evidence that, in highly dollarized economies, the classic inflationary effects of a real depreciation-higher internal demand and imported inflation-can be offset or diminished by both the larger financial costs and the balance-sheet effect, especially if the depreciation is large. Additionally, the exchange rate regime is shown to matter: countries with fixed exchange rates suffer more noticeably the balance-sheet effects of large depreciations. (C) Elsevier B.V.

Generalized method of moments (GMM) is often the preferred method for estimation of FOCs, as it avoids distributional assumptions on stochastic terms, provided all structural errors enter the FOCs additively, giving a single composite additive error. But SML has advantages over GMM in models where multiple structural errors enter the FOCs nonadditively.

In this regard the options' framework yields choice-theoretic implications on the relationship among risk, convenience yields from art ownership, and investor 'hurdle prices'aEuroprices triggering the purchase and sale of artworks at auction. The methodology offers testable implications concerning the adjustment dynamics in the relationship between historical art returns and risk-free yields.

We test such hypothesis by using two different panel unit root tests (Im, Pesaran and Shin, 1997; and Levin-Lin, 1993) and eight panel cointegration tests (Pedroni, 2001; Larsson, 2001). These econometric tools let overcome the small sample distortions often faced by studies based on time series techniques. Our unit root tests do not show evidence of absolute convergence towards the leading economy from 1970 to 2004 and for two shorter samples. However, cointegration tests show evidence in favor of conditional convergence for the same period.

Within gender groups, the striking difference between full and part-time employees is that full-timers work in higher paying occupations than do part-timers. Also, female occupational segregation makes a significant contribution to the earnings gap between male and female part-time employees but not for full-time workers. A further new result is that female workplace segregation contributes significantly to the full/part-time earnings gap of both males and females. Part-time employees work in more feminized workplaces and their earnings are lower. There remains, moreover, a substantial residual gender earnings gap between male and female employees.","[Mumford, Karen; Smithy, Peter N.] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Mumford, K (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",kam9@york.ac.uk,,"Mumford, Karen Ann/0000-0002-0190-5544",,,,,23,20,20,1,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

It provides a formal presentation of Rostow's insight of the role of a leading sector in industrialization. Population growth may lead to a shortage of food and a breakdown of the industrialization process. However, population growth may benefit the manufacturing sector in the adoption of increasing returns to scale technologies. Elasticity of demand for agricultural goods plays an important role in determining whether an improvement of agricultural technology or an increase of population is beneficial to the manufacturing sector. A comparison of China and Britain before the Industrial Revolution shows that research and development are necessary for sustained growth. Achieving industrialization independently requires a combination of a sufficiently large market size from the demand side and a sufficiently large supply of technologies from the supply side.

In this paper, I use the separate-spheres model, a theoretical model that explains the determinants of bargaining power in marriage, to analyze how a remarried couple's bargaining relationship affects their child investment in stepfamilies. Based on this theoretical model, I build and estimate an empirical model that investigates the determinants of parental investment. As evidence of parental preference for biological children over stepchildren, I find that an increased wage rate of a biological mother significantly improves her child investment when her husband is a stepfather of the child, while there is no such effect for mothers living with the biological father of the child.","[Akashi-Ronquest, Naoko] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Fullerton, CA 92634 USA; [Akashi-Ronquest, Naoko] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA",California State University System; California State University Fullerton; Research Triangle Institute,"Akashi-Ronquest, N (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Fullerton, 800 N State Coll Blvd, Fullerton, CA 92634 USA.",nakashi@rti.org,,"Ronquest, Naoko/0000-0002-0496-9973",,,,,40,9,12,0,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

We find that both measures of consumption as well as income is clearly hump shaped over the life cycle. Hence, real consumption per household seems to track income over the life cycle. This empirical regularity is hard to reconcile with basic specifications of the life cycle model. We further document life cycle profiles of demographic and labor supply variables. We argue that part, but not all, of the hump in consumption may be explained by household composition variables. Durable consumption per adult equivalent stays approximately flat until age 60 after which it drops dramatically. This phenomenon may be partly explained by a decrease in work related durable expenditures after retirement. Non-durable consumption per equivalent adult increases steadily until age 55 and stays approximately flat after that.","[Alessie, Rob] Univ Groningen, Netspar & Tinbergen Inst, Fac Econ & Business, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [de Ree, Joppe] DIW Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Mitte, Germany",University of Groningen; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Alessie, R (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Netspar & Tinbergen Inst, Fac Econ & Business, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",r.j.m.alessie@rug.nl; jderee@diw.de,,"Alessie, Rob/0000-0002-5128-6753",,,,,13,20,25,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,MAR,2009,157.0,1,,,,,107,120,,10.1007/s10645-009-9119-4,0.0,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,474AQ,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268255000004,0

It documents a massive decline in long-term real interest rates from the 1990s until 2008, followed by a sudden spike during the financial crisis of 2008. Breakeven inflation rates, calculated from inflation-indexed and nominal government bond yields, were stable from 2003 until the fall of 2008, when they showed dramatic declines. The paper asks to what extent short-term real interest rates, bond risks, and liquidity explain the trends before 2008 and the unusual developments that followed. Low yields and high short-term volatility of returns do not invalidate the basic case for inflation-indexed bonds, which is that they provide a safe asset for long-term investors. Governments should expect inflation-indexed bonds to be a relatively cheap form of debt financing in the future, even though they have offered high returns over the past decade.","[Campbell, John Y.; Viceira, Luis M.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Shiller, Robert J.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Harvard University; Yale University,"Campbell, JY (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,63,73,83,1,22,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

This paper reexamines this empirical relationship using nonparametric methods. We use different governance measures, as defined in World Governance Indicators Provided by the World Bank. The findings show that only three of the six measures: voice and accountability, political stability, and rule of law are significantly correlated with economic growth. Regulatory control, control of corruption, and government effectiveness were found to be insignificant. The concept of growth profile curves are introduced as a visual device to interpret the results of the nonparametric analysis. We find that the empirical relationship between voice and accountability, political stability, and growth are highly nonlinear. These effects demonstrate heterogeneity across indicators, regions, and time. These empirical results are complementary to the literature on growth diagnostics in demonstrating that specific, targeted reforms to improve governance may be a more effective policy lever to encourage economic growth rather than wholesale reform. Finally, they provide a cautionary tale to practitioners using parametric methods. Journal of Comparative Economics 37 (1) (2009) 121-143.

This paper aims to estimate the need for new PhDs in the Estonian academic, public, and private sectors for the period 2007-2012. Need in the academic and public sectors is estimated by a survey of employers (e.g. universities, research institutes, ministries); private sector need is derived from forecasted R&D expenditure in the business sector. Results show that expected demand for PhDs is significantly lower in the public and private sectors than in academia. Total demand over all three sectors is rather high, annually more than 10% of the number of PhDs, caused both by high replacement demand from upcoming retirements and by growth demand. The policy implication of our results is that planned increase in PhDs should correspond with other developments in educational and R&D policy.","[Eamets, Raul; Kanep, Hanna] Univ Tartu, Fac Econ & Business Adm, EE-51009 Tartu, Estonia",University of Tartu,,Jaan.Masso@mtk.ut.ee; Raul.Eamets@mtk.ut.ee,,"Masso, Jaan/0000-0002-0466-4942; Merikull, Jaanika/0000-0002-5699-8602",,,,,41,4,5,0,13,EUROBALTIC CENTRES EXCELLENCE,RIGA,"RAINA BLVD 19, RIGA, LV-1586, LATVIA",,,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

A model is proposed to analyze the effect of backward integration on collusive outcomes in a downstream duopoly with asymmetric marginal costs. Vertical integration expands the set of collusive outcomes that are sustainable for a given realization of the discount factor. This is an additional effect of vertical integration that antitrust authorities should consider. Side payments implemented by input sales are more relevant the larger the difference in marginal costs, since they allow for the shifting of production towards the relatively more efficient firms, while maintaining firms' incentives to collude. A price of the input above that posted by an alternative source or sales of the input below cost may be observed, depending on the realization of downstream firms' costs.","Univ Navarra, Dept Business Adm, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain",University of Navarra,"Mendi, P (通讯作者)，Univ Navarra, Dept Business Adm, Edificio Bibliotecas Este, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain.",pmendi@unav.es,"Mendi, Pedro/K-9218-2014","Mendi, Pedro/0000-0001-7253-7534",,,,,16,9,10,0,12,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,,,J ECON,J.

Yet, interestingly, developing countries, and smaller economies, face much larger output declines following a disaster of similar relative magnitude than do developed countries or bigger economics. A close study of the determinants of these adverse macroeconomic output costs reveals several interesting patterns. Countries with a higher literacy rate, better institutions, higher per capita income, higher degree of openness to trade, and higher levels of government spending are better able to withstand the initial disaster shock and prevent further spillovers into the macroeconomy. These all suggest an increased ability to mobilize resources for reconstruction. Financial conditions also seem to be of importance: countries with more foreign exchange reserves, and higher levels of domestic credit, but with less-open capital accounts appear more robust and better able to endure natural disasters, with less adverse spillover into domestic production.

Specifically, an additional year of education of the household head, irrespective of ethnic or gender considerations, decreases smoking probability by 1.5 percent. However, the negative effect of education seems to be higher for Chinese (US$1.07) than Malay (US$0.26) households in terms of conditional expenditures.

Firms are hierarchical in two respects: the organization of workers in production and the wage structure. The firm's hierarchy is represented as a sector of a circle, where the radius represents the hierarchy's height, the width of the sector represents the breadth of the hierarchy at a given height, and the angle of the sector represents the span of control. A perfectly competitive firm chooses height and width, as well as capital, in order to maximize profit. We analyse the short-run and long-run impact of changes in scale economies, input substitutability, and input and output prices on the firm's hierarchical structure. We find that the firm grows as the specialization of its workers increases or as its output price increases relative to input prices. The effect of changes in scale economies is contingent on the price of output. The model also brings forth an analysis of wage inequality within the firm, which is found to be independent of the firm's hierarchical organization of workers, and only depends on the firm's wage schedule.","[Tang, Kam Ki; Yanes, Leopoldo] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Tang, KK (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",kk.tang@uq.edu.au,,"Tang, Kam/0000-0001-7282-8112",,,,,29,0,0,0,4,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Most studies of household saving behavior are based on the life-cycle theory of saving. However, there is doubt as to whether these studies adequately explain the low and declining rate in the United States. This study explores two hypotheses that depart from the life-cycle explanatory framework. The first hypothesis examines the possibility that the low rate of household saving in the United States is related to Americans' strong belief that vertical mobility in the United States is readily possible and hence their relatively weak sense of class identity. A second corollary hypothesis is that in an economy in which a high degree of vertical mobility is thought possible, a high degree of inequality in the distribution of income and wealth may reinforce the tendency to save little.","American Univ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Wisman, JD (通讯作者)，American Univ, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",,,"Wisman, Jon D./0000-0001-7563-3150",,,,,73,38,45,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

We then go on to show that the incentive to avoid the truth is increasing in income/wealth and decreasing in self-esteem, the perceived accuracy of one's self-assessment, and the role that luck plays in generating opportunities.","[Andolfatto, David; Mongrain, Steeve; Myers, Gordon] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Andolfatto, D (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",dandolfa@sfu.ca; mongrain@sfu.ca; gmmyers@sfu.ca,"Andolfatto, David/I-5738-2016","Andolfatto, David/0000-0003-0703-3967",,,,,13,1,1,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

To the list of answers to this question, we add neoclassical production (specifically, the Tobin effect) as one possible explanation. To that end, we study an overlapping generations economy with capital where limited communication and stochastic relocation create an endogenous transactions role for fiat money. We assume a production function with a knowledge externality (Romer style) that nests economies with endogenous growth (AK form) and those with no long-run growth (the Diamond model). The Tobin effect is shown to be always operative. Under CRRA preferences, a mild degree of social increasing returns is sufficient (but not necessary) for some positive inflation to dominate zero inflation and for the Friedman rule to be sub-optimal, irrespective of the degree of risk aversion.

Our analysis shows that M&As do not affect the size distribution when we consider the entire population of firms. When we focus on the firms involved in an M&A event, we observe a shift of the firm size distribution towards larger sizes. Firm size distribution becomes more concentrated around the mean, less skewed to the right hand side, and thinner at the tails as a whole. The shift toward higher sizes due to M&A is not uniform but affects firms of different sizes in different ways. While the number of firms in the lower tail decreased, the number of firms in the central size classes increased substantially and outweighed the increase in the number (and mean size) of firms in the upper tail of the distribution (consequently the overall market concentration measured by the Herfindahl index declines). M&As lead to a departure from log-normality of the firm size distribution, suggesting that external growth does not follow Gibrat's law. Our counterfactual analysis highlights that only internal growth does not affect the shape of the size distribution of firms. On the contrary, it suggests that the change in the size distribution is almost entirely due to the external growth of the firms.","[Cefis, Elena] Univ Utrecht, TC Koopmans Res Inst, NL-3512 BL Utrecht, Netherlands; [Cefis, Elena] Univ Bergamo, NL-3512 BL Utrecht, Netherlands; [Marsili, Orietta] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Schenk, Hans] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Sch Econ, NL-3512 BL Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Utrecht University,"Cefis, E (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, TC Koopmans Res Inst, Janskerkhof 12, NL-3512 BL Utrecht, Netherlands.",e.cefis@econ.uu.nl; omarsili@rsm.nl; hans.schenk@econ.uu.nl,"Cefis, Elena/AAJ-3162-2020","Cefis, Elena/0000-0001-9960-4354; Marsili, Orietta/0000-0002-4879-6701",,,,,24,19,22,1,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

In the model inflation, growth, and inequality are jointly determined. We show that an increase in the long-run money growth rate raises inflation and reduces growth, but its effect on income inequality depends on the relative importance of the two types of heterogeneity. Inequality shrinks with the rise of inflation when capital heterogeneity dominates and enlarges when skill heterogeneity dominates. Therefore, our model supports a negative (positive) inflation-inequality relationship and a positive (negative) growth-inequality relationship when capital (skill) heterogeneity dominates.

Using simple diagrams, an expansion of the health sector by recruiting immigrant skilled workers in certain cases is shown to compare favorably to the long-term (short-term) alternative of using domestic (unskilled) workers. From a formal analysis, changes in nonhealth outputs are shown to depend on factor-bias and scale effects. The net effects generally are indeterminate. The main finding from the applied model is that importing foreign doctors and nurses into the UK yields higher overall welfare gains than a generic increase in the NHS budget.

Developing and transitional economies have intended to dispose of their past 'blue prints' and seek out templates which have been successful in the existing market economies. At the core of our questioning is the accepted idea that the process of organizational change in transitional and emerging economies is and needs to be 'managed'. In this paper the processes of organizational change in two distinct cultures, China and Estonia, has been analyzed drawing partially on an institutional perspective. To compare the implementation of change in selected organizations in China and Estonia, we conducted structured interviews with members of top management teams in 160 companies in several large cities in the northern part of China: Bejiing, Tianjin, Jinan and Zibo; and in 243 Estonian companies. In Estonia, the interviews were carried out at two different periods: first in 2001 (137 companies) and second in 2005 (106 companies). In both countries the companies (the sample) were selected from a cross section of industries and sectors, ranging from manufacturing and technology, banking and insurance organizations, to those in energy and education industries. Results indicate that in Chinese organizations people tended to be more accepting changes than in Estonian companies, but in a passive manner. The most frequently used strategy for overcoming resistance to change in both countries was communication and education. But Estonian managers attached more importance to empowering and involving employees and training them for the changes than the Chinese managers. In order to explane these results the authors apply institutionalism. China and Estonia are greatly influenced by socialist/communist ideologies. Estonia had a long history of socialism before its independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991. Likewise, since the founding of China in 1949, China has been under socialist regime for over half a century. A socialist society in this context is characterized by high formalization, centralization and totalitarianism. Estonia has been building democracy for the past 15 years. But in China the level of democracy has not been high. Although China experienced successful transformation of economic regime, the political system in China has remained within its specific version of socialism and operated on the basis of centralized power. There are fundamental and conflicting ways in which individuals have been trained to think and act under totalitarianism system. In Estonian companies management is more democratic, employees' views are sought and in order to encourage employees to accept and support changes, some measures are taken, e.g. communicating with the employees, the likely benefits brought by the changes and improving employees' welfare. As in China relationship between people is the priority, in the process of change, complicated relation network has to be taken into consideration.","[Alas, Ruth; Sun, Wei] Estonian Business Sch, Management Inst, EE-10114 Tallinn, Estonia; [Sharifi, Sudi] Salford Business Sch, People Work & Org Res Ctr, Salford M5 4WT, Lancs, England",Estonian Business School; University of Salford,"Alas, R (通讯作者)，Estonian Business Sch, Management Inst, Lauteri 3, EE-10114 Tallinn, Estonia.",ruth.alas@ebs.ee; S.Sharifi@salford.ac.uk; wei.sun@ebs.ee,,,,,,,31,11,11,1,12,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The Fed generally over-predicted inflation, but consumers produced unbiased forecasts with superior predictive content. In fighting inflation, the Fed was, perhaps, cautious by assigning much cost to under-predictions, but little or no cost to over-predictions. Under such an asymmetric loss function, the bias in the Federal Reserve forecast of inflation appears to be rational. However, this explanation, while plausible, cannot be substantiated from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) transcripts.","[Baghestani, Hamid; Soliman, Mohamed] Amer Univ Sharjah, Sch Business & Management, Dept Econ, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates",American University of Sharjah,"Baghestani, H (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Sharjah, Sch Business & Management, Dept Econ, POB 26666, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.",baghesta@msn.com,,"Baghestani, Hamid/0000-0003-4568-1682",,,,,9,8,8,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We use quarterly 1998-99 panel data to examine mobility across six labour market statuses (inactivity, unemployment, formal wage employment, informal wage employment, self-employment and farming). Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis of labour market segmentation. Formal employment is preferred to informal employment. Unemployment is largely a queuing device for individuals with higher education waiting for formal jobs. Some self-employment is subsistence activities and consistent with a segmented labour market, while other is high risk and potentially high return activities. Age, gender and education are significant determinants of labour mobility. Finally, informal employment serves as a buffer in times of recession - with farming and informal wage employment absorbing labour shed by other statuses during the Russian financial crisis.","[Bernabe, Sabine] Katholieke Univ Leuven, LICOS Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, Louvain, Belgium; [Stampini, Marco] African Dev Bank, Res Dev Dept, Tunis, Tunisia",KU Leuven; African Development Bank Group (AfDB),"Bernabè, S (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, LICOS Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, Louvain, Belgium.",sabine.bernabe@econ.kuleuven.be; m.stampini@afdb.org,"Stampini, Marco/GVT-9917-2022",,,,,,37,15,17,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

Companies compete for customers, revenue, market share with products and services that meet customer's needs and they are more than ever interested in outsourcing. Even though Business Process Outsourcing has almost twenty years' experience, companies are still facing the issue: which functions should be given to third party and which are to be kept in-house. It is important to realize, that some functions and processes should never be outsourced. To achieve maximum benefit from outsourcing, companies must carefully evaluate their processes and sources of information that are fed into them. After this self-examination, companies can distinguish between their core and non-core processes. This evaluation is essential before any outsourcing decision. Processes, which are using companies' core competencies, should not be outsourced, because core competencies create sustainable competitive advantage for a company. This competitive advantage allows operating successfully in common environment and also creates possibility to split into wide variety of related markets. Core Competencies have a major impact on the features of the product or service, which company offers to customers. Core competence is something company can do better than a competitor, i.e. company's features, which are valuable, rare, difficult to imitate and difficult to substitute. It can be in the range from product development to employee dedication. The starting criteria for determining whether capability is a core competency is the question: is it capable of producing sustainable competitive advantage? Understanding Core Competencies allows companies to invest in the strengths that differentiate them and set the strategies that unify the entire organization. It is not right to equate a core competence to a specific product or service. Products and services may frequently change and core competencies are the basement on which products and services are based. Therefore Core Competences are fundamental aspects of a company, like its culture, values, skills, knowledge and abilities, therefore they are not the subject to a sudden change. It is also important to distinguish core competence from strategy as strategy defines how company defends, builds and transforms core competence over the time. Core competences are often mixed with core processes. Some authors operate with those two terms as if they meant the same. However core competence and core process are different things. Core processes are built by using core competences. Even though core competence concept was introduced in 1990 and there were a lot of publicity and discussions dedicated to this subject, amazingly only few individuals understand this concept well and apply it to the business they are in.","[Boguslauskas, Vytautas; Kvedaraviciene, Goda] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Boguslauskas, V (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio Str 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",vytautas.boguslauskas@ktu.lt; goda.kvedaraviciene@gmail.com,,,,,,,25,21,32,0,26,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Overall evidence supports the informative content of the spread in Italy over the whole period (1984-2005) although results are more satisfactory as from 1992.

Furthermore, this result is confirmed using data from earlier years. This suggests that the impact of FDI and trade on child labor, if any, is the increases in income they generate.

Yet neither is there a theoretical consensus nor consistent empirical evidence that would lead us to believe the relationship is positive, negative or nonexistent either within broadly defined regions or over time. This study investigates a possible cause for this phenomenon. What we find is that out of 14 popularly defined sub regions, only 7 can be constrained over time within the respective sub region, while only two broadly-defined regional classifications are justified. We did find that the grouping of OECD countries is statistically valid, but only if the relationship is allowed to vary over time.

Fluctuations around trend in the former, or business cycles, have been a traditional focus in macroeconomics, while similar cyclical patterns in mortality are also interesting and are now increasingly studied. In this paper, I assess the welfare implications of cyclical fluctuations in mortality using a new utility-theoretic model of preferences over uncertain length of life. Echoing the classic result of Lucas (1987) regarding business cycles, my findings suggest that short-term fluctuations in mortality are not very costly. While consumption fluctuations are relatively large, cyclical fluctuations in mortality are tiny compared to the much larger static uncertainty in length of life that derives from naturally rising mortality rates through age. Secular improvements in life expectancy and gains against static health inequalities appear to be much more important than cyclical mortality.","CUNY City Coll, New York, NY 10031 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; City College of New York (CUNY),"Edwards, RD (通讯作者)，CUNY City Coll, New York, NY 10031 USA.",redwards@qc.cuny.edu,,,,,,,37,4,4,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

We focus on the effect that German tourism to Spain has on German imports of Spanish wine. Due to the different stochastic properties of the series under analysis, which display different orders of integration, a methodology is used based on long memory regression models, where tourism is supposed to be exogenous. The period covered is January 1998 to November 2004. The results show that tourism has an effect on wine imports that lasts between 2 and 9 months. Disaggregating the imports across the different types of wine, it is observed that only for red wines from Navarra, Penedus and Valdepenas, and to a certain extent for sparkling wine, tourism produces an effect on future import demand. From a policy-making perspective our results imply that the impact of tourism on the host economy is not only direct and short-term but also oblique and delayed, thus reinforcing the case for tourism as a means for economic development.","[Fischer, Christian] Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Gil-Alana, Luis A.] Univ Navarra, Fac Econ, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain",University of Bonn; University of Navarra,"Fischer, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",christian.fischer@ilr.uni-bonn.de,"Fischer, Christian/A-9435-2015","Fischer, Christian/0000-0002-5016-3962",,,,,27,32,35,2,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The following types of crime were subject to investigation: (i) total, (ii) violent crimes, (iii) property crimes, (iv) other crimes, and (v) total social costs of crime. In the light of the obtained results, the causes of the increasing crime should be associated in the first place with deteriorating social development among which economic inequality plays the leading role - as well as with lenient penitentiary policies.

The simplest version gives the right holder the ability to act after potential competitors. However, another common implementation requires the right holder to accept or reject some offers before potential competitors are given the same offer, and, if the right holder rejects the initial offer, allows the right to be exercised affirmatively only if competitors are subsequently offered a better deal (e.g. a lower price). We explore, theoretically and experimentally, the impact this latter form of right of first refusal can have on the outcome of negotiation. Counterintuitively, this right of first refusal can be disadvantageous to its holder.

An assumption is made that enterprise strategy formation may be improved by using strategy planning tools, by widening dimensions that describe the types of entrepreneur, and by integrating them into a particular system, i.e. the taxonomy of imperatives. The authors analyze different approaches and work methods of various strategy development schools in Lithuania and abroad as well as extensive literary sources in order to answer which of the main distinguished imperatives has an impact on enterprise strategy formation. This is the major objective of the study. With reference to the study, the article views the investigated issues from a new perspective while trying to discuss what strategic decisions are reflected in the formed strategy. The quality of such decisions may be perceived as a function of imperatives (requirements, regulations, orders, sophistication, and knowledge) that is based on the information needed for decision-making since the strategy of enterprise activity is always an expression of strategic decisions and their outcome. The article analyses how the introduced imperatives are implemented by entrepreneurs of different character and how an entrepreneur's character influences strategy formation in small and medium enterprises. First researchers were already to notice the qualities that successful entrepreneurs possess (Carland et al., 1996). According to Zakarevicius and Zuperkiene (2008), leaders' personal qualities have been studied since the beginning of the last century and subject-related qualities have been studied since the middle of the last century; however, a constantly changing organization environment raises new requirements and that is why the indication of leaders' personal and subject-related qualities that correspond them as well as the improvement of quality development is a relevant scientific and practical problem. As the authors claim (Gudonavicius el al., 2008), entrepreneurs of different types perceive the risk differently. Their actions may be understood as a quality function of strategic decision, whereas their competence to act may be perceived as a result of the decision. A positive result of activity is not achieved only due to high level of an entrepreneur's actions; it is also important to make proper decisions for the implementation of formed strategy. The simple construct explains why more attention should be given to entrepreneurs' personal qualities and to their impact while making strategic decisions. The methodology of the study is mainly based on a complex analysis of strategy development including a comprehensive logical analysis and synthesis of foreign and local authors' scientific publications, the insights of the authors of the article, questionnaire survey, cluster analysis, and the methods of statistical data processing. The study method is qualitative and exploratory. Semistructured testing was used in the work as well as the survey of the following geographical range: enterprise owners (entrepreneurs, leaders, managers) from Kaunas and Siauliai city and district. The study revealed that entrepreneurs of different types form different strategies and perform different activities to implement them while using different imperatives. Moreover, the objectives and formation of a strategy depends on strategists' social qualities and social context inside which they act.","[Gudonavicius, Linas; Bartoseviciene, Vladislava] Kauno Tech Univ, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Saparnis, Gintaras] Siauliu Univ, LT-76285 Shiauliai, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology; Siauliai University,"Gudonavicius, L (通讯作者)，Kauno Tech Univ, Laisves Al 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",,,,,,,,43,25,25,0,10,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The basis for the theory is that certifiers offer differentiated tests; for a given object it is more difficult to pass the test of certifier i than the test of certifier j. Given the test standards, certifiers compete for customers via their fee-setting. Segmentation occurs in equilibrium: sellers with low unobservable quality self-select to an easy test and sellers with high unobservable quality self-select to a hard test. Moreover, sellers choosing an easy test pay a lower (endogenous) certification fee than sellers choosing a hard test.

Decisions to attend school seem subject to peer effects and time-inconsistent preferences. Merit scholarships, school health programs, and information about returns to education can all cost-effectively spur school participation. However, distortions in education systems, such as weak teacher incentives and elite-oriented curricula, undermine learning in school and much of the impact of increasing existing educational spending. Pedagogical innovations designed to address these distortions (Such as technology-assisted instruction, remedial education, and tracking by achievement) can raise test scores at a low cost. Merely informing parents about school conditions seems insufficient to improve teacher incentives, and evidence on merit pay is mixed, but hiring teachers locally on short-term contracts can save money and improve educational outcomes. School vouchers can cost-effectively increase both school participation and learning.","[Kremer, Michael] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Holla, Alaka] Innovat Poverty Act, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",Harvard University; Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA),"Kremer, M (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",mkremer@fas.harvard.edu; alaka.holla@gmail.com,,,NICHD NIH HHS [T32 HD007338] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,128,55,78,1,35,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1941-1383,,,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

The paper explores these issues within the context of cumulative emissions targets based on linear reductions in CO2-e emissions of 50% and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. Six technology futures were constructed within the MiniCAM integrated assessment model and then applied to the emissions targets. The paper explores the influence of technology availability and expectations of future technology availability on the economic consequences of emissions mitigation, on the time path of emissions mitigation, and on the evolution of the U.S. energy system over time. One of the strongest themes to emerge from the scenarios in this study is that near-term decision-making depends on the availability of technology decades into the future, when deep emissions reductions are required to meet the cumulative emissions goals. In the scenarios in this paper, it is the expectations about future technology that have the most dramatic effect on greenhouse gas emissions prices and emissions reductions in 2020, as opposed to near-term technology availability. Moreover, it is the nature of technology 20, 30, and 40 years out, rather than availability and deployment of technology in the next decade, that will largely determine the character of the mid-century energy system.

The results reveal two-way causal connections between trade, inward FDI, inward merger and acquisitions (MAs) and growth for most of the sample economies.

The functioning of labour market is determined by the interaction of different market segments and sectors, which differ in different regions as well as in demographical, social, professional, qualification and other features. It is pointed out that labour market influenced by economic, social and political forces is resolved into separate segments (parts of labour market), which differently operate and react to the changes of environment. Estimating labour market through the regional aspect it can be resolved into particular territorial units, with their regional similarities and differences. The objects of segmentation can become employers as well as the unemployed groups. The segments of labour market can be formed according to the performance sector, work specialization, qualifying skills, etc. The segmentation of labour market enables: - to analyse labour market through the aspect of the extent as well as the content; - to survey the possibilities of the different groups of people in the labour market; - to train the qualified specialists according to the demand in the labour market; - to organize training and re-skilling courses; - to distribute political means through the different territorial units of the labour market; - others.

Such countries constitute a critical development challenge given their enormous socio-economic needs and the difficulties associated with providing effective development assistance. Conflict destroys a country's economic, governance and administrative institutions; weakens public financial management systems and increases transaction costs, which makes it difficult for principals to monitor their agents. Rebuilding social and economic infrastructure is as crucial as the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the destroyed physical infrastructure-roads, bridges, restoration of water supply and sanitation and energy and power. A framework is elaborated here for assessing W Post-conflict situations in African countries; (ii) possible mechanism of financing post-conflict reconstruction and development in Africa; and, (iii) lessons from the past challenges of financing countries in post-conflict transition in Africa.

Lower trade costs, however, matter over and beyond their effects on trade flows: as less productive firms are forced out of business by the tougher competitive conditions of international markets, economic integration fosters lower prices and higher average productivity. We assess the quantitative relevance of these effects calibrating a general equilibrium model using country, sector and firm-level empirical observations. The euro turns out to have increased the overall competitiveness of Eurozone firms, and the effects differ along interesting dimensions: they tend to be stronger for countries which are smaller or with better access to foreign markets, and for firms which specialize in sectors where international competition is fiercer and barriers to entry lower.","[Ottaviano, Gianmarco I.

Thus, the relationship between inflation and inflation uncertainty in Thailand support Holland's (1995) stabilization hypothesis.","Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61761 USA",Illinois State University,"Payne, J (通讯作者)，Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61761 USA.",jepayne@ilstu.edu,,,,,,,41,13,13,2,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

They showed that it was a direct relation between the FDI flows (as percent of the GDP) and the growth of GDP per capita not just for the developed countries, but also for most of the developing countries. In this way, the countries that had attracted an important FDI volume had the highest economic growth rates. Since the early '60s of the 20(th) century, the times with the most intense foreign investment activities had coincided with a sudden increase in the macroeconomic indicators (especially the GDP). Because the economic science proved that there was a direct connection between the FDI volume and economic growth rates, the IMF and the World Bank staffed to recommend to all countries (recommendation that they make currently) to create favorable conditions to attract FDI for ensuring, in this way, high development rates. The countries in transition need FDI not just to produce more goods and a higher quality. Foreign capital investments are the most efficient and safe way to integrate into the world economy. Concluding, only direct foreign investments would allow the re-specialization of the economy to surpass the situation of maintaining on the world markets only with food products and raw materials. Indeed, the acquired experience shows that FDI substantially enhanced the national economies' re-specialization processes all over the world. The authors share the opinion of those specialists who affirm that FDI plays a determinant role in respecializing the transition economies and in increasing the export potential. Also, FDI growth leads to increase in the manufactured production quantity. Further, we shall examine some structural changes which occurred under the influence of FDI in the economies of new European Union member states (the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia) and in South-East Europe, drawing also the attention upon the changes in the export potential of those countries.","[Pelinescu, Elena] Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania; [Pelinescu, Elena] Hyper Univ, Bucharest, Romania; [Radulescu, Magdalena] Univ Pitesti, Pitesti, Romania",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest; University of Pitesti,"Pelinescu, E (通讯作者)，Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania.",,"Radulescu, Magdalena/AEW-0205-2022",,,,,,34,25,30,0,20,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Using several empirical strategies that are designed to control for the influence of unobservables, we explore the relationship between substance use and four outcomes: fighting, property-destruction, theft, and running away. Our results suggest that, for males, the positive association between substance-use and these outcomes is probably spurious. In contrast, there is some evidence that female substance use may be causally related to destroying property, theft, and running away.

Our analysis is important because FDI is considered as a main contributor to economic development, modernization, income growth, catching-up process and changes in specialization structure. In this paper, we adopt a rigorous econometric model to explain the FDI inflows. We examine the role played by economic and non-economic factors in FDI attractiveness. Using the gravity model and recent econometric techniques, we obtain the unbiased and convergent estimators. From an econometric point of view, the use of a Fixed Effect Vector Decomposition (FEVD) estimator for the gravity model appears to be convenient for our data sample.","[Sova, Robert; Stancu, Ion] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Sova, Robert; Sova, Anamaria] Univ Paris 04, CES, Paris, France; [Albu, Lucian Liviu] Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Sorbonne Universite,"Sova, R (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",albul@ipe.ro,"Sova, Robert A/P-3822-2016; Albu, Lucian Liviu/C-4524-2011; Albu, Lucian-Liviu/N-1468-2014","Albu, Lucian-Liviu/0000-0001-8097-227X",,,,,18,8,10,0,2,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Based on our theoretical groundings, we identify potential barriers under four categories, namely macroeconomic policy factors, political factors, institutional factors and socioeconomic factors. Using cross-sectional time-series data for 17 South East Asian economies from 1996 to 2005, we test these set of barriers against per capita FDI inflows and volatility in FDI inflows using fixed effects pooled regression analysis. In the process, we also check as to how fragile our results are to the small but important changes, which we bring in the conditioning information set using robustness check. Our empirical evidence suggests that all the possible set of barriers identified have significant negative effect on per capita FDI and positive impact on volatility in FDI inflows. We therefore suggest that there is an urgent need to find the solutions to break these barriers that are acting as stumbling blocks in attracting FDI of their actual potential.","[Vadlamannati, Krishna Chaitanya] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Appl Econ, Santiago De Compostela, Spain; [Tamazian, Artur] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Finance & Accounting, Santiago De Compostela, Spain; [Irala, Lokanandha Reddy] ICFAI Business Sch, Finance Area, Hyderabad 501203, Andhra Pradesh, India",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; The ICFAI Foundation for Higher Education (IFHE); ICFAI Business School (IBS),"Vadlamannati, KC (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Appl Econ, POB 15782, Santiago De Compostela, Spain.",kcv.dcm@gmail.com,"Reddy, Irala Lokanandha/ADL-1405-2022","Reddy, Irala Lokanandha/0000-0003-2670-8130; Vadlamannati, Krishna Chaitanya/0000-0001-5999-1126; Tamazian, Artur/0000-0002-1087-9296",,,,,42,13,16,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

To this end, we analyse the determinants of survival of internet firms that have gone public at the NASDAQ stock exchange from December 1996 through February 2001. Financial and nonfinancial data published in the IPO prospectuses are examined. For our analysis, we use the semiparametric Cox proportional hazard model and estimate the effect of these variables on the trading (survival) time using the parametric Log-logistic survival model. It appears that the average operating history of internet IPOs is remarkably small compared to noninternet IPOs, namely 2.4 and 10 years, respectively. Furthermore, we find that the average number of risk factors for internet IPOs is four times higher than the number reported for noninternet IPOs. The results of the parametric analysis correspond to the semiparametric results. Our findings hold under a number of different model specifications and robustness checks. The sensitivity analysis in the Log-logistic model reveals that the greatest positive effect on the survival time comes from investor demand followed by operational cash flow over liabilities. The expected survival time is shortened mostly by IPO market level, followed by valuation uncertainty.","[van der Goot, Tjalling] Univ Amsterdam, Sch Business, Dept Accountancy, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Giersbergen, Noud] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Quantitat Econ, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam,"van der Goot, T (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Sch Business, Dept Accountancy, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",L.R.T.vanderGoot@uva.nl,,,,,,,43,13,15,2,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The hypothesis is twofold. First, technological progress, through the rise in wages and the decreasing cost of recreation, made it possible for the average U.S. worker to afford more time off from work. Second, changes in the wage distribution explain the changes in the distribution of hours. A general equilibrium model is built to explore whether such mechanisms can quantitatively account for the observations. The model is calibrated to the U.S. economy in 1900. It predicts 82% of the observed decline in hours, and most of the contraction in their dispersion. The decline in the price of leisure goods accounts for 7% of the total decline in hours.

We find that the presence of a time-varying marginal cost dampens the expansionary impact of a positive technology shock. With a given fraction of firms standing ready to satisfy demand at predetermined prices, the variations in the marginal utility of consumption attributed to technology shocks can easily be smoothed. Thus, technology shocks contribute little to the equity premium. Under a standard monetary policy rule, the real effect of monetary policy shocks is too weak and short-lived to generate a reasonable equity premium. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Using a basic measure of whether the worker has discretion over the start and end times of work, men have more than twice the wage return to flexibility than do women, even within the same firm and detailed occupation. This difference cannot be explained by differences in household responsibilities or by differences in part time work by gender, but gender differences in job authority and autonomy do matter. Differences in the wage returns to this type of flexibility account for 10% of the gender wage gap, which suggests that understanding the underlying cause for the disparity in the returns to flexibility is important for understanding the policy implications of promoting flexible work arrangements.","Univ Calif, Merced, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Merced,"Winder, KL (通讯作者)，Univ Calif, Merced, CA USA.",kwinder@ucmerced.edu,,,,,,,22,7,8,2,12,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Thus, simulations have shown that in the Anglo-American group of countries (Australia, Canada, Ireland, UK and USA) a given relative improvement in economic circumstances which brings an extra 0.840 immigrants per 1000 population per year (334 800 in total) in the short run, brings somewhat fewer (288 700 in total) in the long-run.","Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Zubanov, N (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",n.zubanov@bham.ac.uk,"Zubanov, Nick/H-8180-2014",,,,,,12,0,0,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

This argument suggests that the appropriate probability distributions for these factors may be fat-tailed. The matter of tail shape has important implications for the calculation of the social cost of carbon dioxide (SCCO2). In this paper a probabilistic integrated assessment model is adapted to allow for the possibility of a thin, intermediate or fat tail for both (i) the climate sensitivity parameter and (ii) the damage function exponent. Results show that depending on the tail shape of the climate sensitivity parameter the mean SCCO2 rises by 29-85%. Changes in the mean SCCO2 due to the adjustments to the damage function alone range from a reduction of 7% to a rise of 12%. The combination of both leads to rises of 33-15%. Greater rises occur for the upper percentiles of the SCCO2 estimates. Given the uncertainties in both the science and the economics of climate change different tail shapes deserve consideration due to their important implications for the range of possible values for the SCCO2.","[Pycroft, J.] European Commiss, IPTS, JRC, Econ Climate Change Energy & Transport Unit, Seville 41092, Spain; [Hope, C.] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS); University of Cambridge,"Pycroft, J (通讯作者)，European Commiss, IPTS, JRC, Econ Climate Change Energy & Transport Unit, Edificio EXPO,C Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville 41092, Spain.",Jonathan.PYCROFT@ec.europa.eu,,,,,,,38,13,13,0,16,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics-Kiel,DEC 22,2011,5.0,,,,,,,,201122,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2011-22,0.0,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,865YM,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298346800001,0

In this model, domestic banks have (through past lending operations) more soft information on their borrowers available compared to foreign banks. Foreign banks, however, have a superior screening technology that allows them to obtain more hard information about their borrowers' investment projects. The model has an important implication: Foreign banks increase their market share when credit market conditions deteriorate. The rationale for this finding is that the comparative advantage of the domestic bank loses value in unstable credit market conditions. Thus, the advantage of having a screening technology becomes more important and allows the foreign bank to increase market share. In times of crisis hard information on projects is relatively more important than soft information on the borrower's history. Journal of Comparative Economics 39 (4) (2011) 486-498.

Two cases are distinguished, with and without labour market segmentation, for which different patterns of formal/informal supply obtain. Without segmentation, informality may generate production where otherwise there would be none. Typically, however, a trade-off obtains: when informality makes output higher it cuts the profit of the most able entrepreneurs, potentially damaging growth. With segmentation, informality causes some replacement of 'good' jobs by 'bad,' and total employment may be affected in either direction; without segmentation the effect on total employment is weakly positive.

The paper examines the determinants of plot-level survival rates of program-planted trees and grasses. It finds that household rights over retired land as well as autonomy in program decision-making (which we argue on the basis of supportive evidence are plausibly exogenous to post-retirement outcomes) have important and potentially countervailing impacts on the provision of environmental services targeted by the program. Households permitted to select what to plant obtain better program outcomes, but do not make the choices that the government would like them to, while those permitted to decide what land to retire perform worse. The analysis also finds that households more vested and experienced in agriculture and with less exposure to off-farm labor markets fare better in managing their planted trees. Significant learning-by-doing effects are also evident, suggesting that greater technical support to farmers could improve outcomes and lower program costs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In a dynamic panel data setting, using a unique database comprising data from 17,462 firms, we estimate an augmented cost share equation whereby the wage bill share of skilled workers in a given firm is related to international exposure and technology adoption. It emerges that R&D expenditures are positive and significantly related to skill upgrading. This result supports the skill-biased technological change argument in the case of a middle-income country such as Turkey. Moreover, the firm-level analysis reveals a positive impact of technological transfer from abroad, foreign ownership and exporting status on the demand for skills, highlighting the role of increasing international openness in fostering skill upgrading within firms. Our microdata also allow us to investigate the direct impact of import flows in shaping the relative demand for skills. The results show that those firms belonging to the sectors experiencing rapid increase in the share of inputs imported from industrialised countries also experience a higher increase in the labour cost share of skilled workers. This finding provides further support for the hypothesis that imports from industrialised countries imply a transfer of new technologies, in turn leading to a higher demand for skilled labour (the so-called skill-enhancing trade hypothesis).

Because of the initial deferral of tax payments, the short-run budgetary cost of tax-deferred accounts is significantly higher than the long-run cost. Therefore, the budget-neutral introduction of tax-deferred accounts would make current and near-future households worse off, although it would increase national wealth and total output in the long run. If the government spread the short-run cost to future households by increasing debt, the policy change could make all age cohorts, on average, as well off as the economy without tax-deferred accounts. Due to increased government debt and debt service costs, however, national wealth and total output would decrease in the long run. Thus, introducing tax-deferred accounts would not increase national wealth and improve social welfare at the same time. This is partly because the policy change is regressive and reduces the risk sharing effect of the current income tax system. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The accuracy of such confidence intervals can deteriorate severely, however, if the bootstrap IRFs are biased. We document an apparently common source of bias in the estimation of the VAR error covariance matrix which can be easily reduced by a scale adjustment. This bias is generally unrecognized because it only affects the bootstrap estimates of the error variance, not the original OLS estimates. Nevertheless, as we illustrate here, analytically, with sampling experiments, and in an example from the literature, the bootstrap error variance bias can have significant distorting effects on bootstrap IRF confidence intervals.

Faced with rising deposit outflows in October 2008, many transition countries were forced to extend the limits of deposit insurance coverage. Has this calmed private agents? Or has it caused more uncertainty? We analyze these questions by employing household survey data for Croatia from exactly the time deposit insurance was extended. First, we provide evidence how the financial crisis has affected trust in banks and trust in the local currency. Then, we show that the increase in deposit insurance coverage had an immediate and positive impact on how people perceived the safety of deposits and the credibility of the local currency. Therefore, our results suggest that this policy measure helped to prevent a more serious and dangerous meltdown of deposits and a further shift towards foreign currency denominated assets. However, despite this effect the perceived safety of deposits remained lower than it was before the financial crisis. We also consider this finding to be of relevance for other countries of Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, few studies have analyzed black-white differences in intergenerational income mobility and the factors that determine these differences. This is largely due to the absence of appropriate methodological tools. We develop nonparametric methods to estimate the effects of covariates on two measures of mobility. We first consider the traditional transition probability of movement across income quantiles. We then introduce a new measure of upward mobility which is the probability that an adult child's relative position exceeds that of the parents. Conducting statistical inference on these mobility measures and the effects of covariates on them requires nontrivial modifications of standard nonparametric regression theory since the dependent variables are nonsmooth functions of marginal quantiles or relative ranks. Using National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data, we document that blacks experience much less upward mobility across generations than whites. Applying our new methodological tools, we find that most of this gap can be accounted for by differences in cognitive skills during adolescence.","[Bhattacharya, Debopam] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Mazumder, Bhashkar] Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL USA",University of Oxford; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago,"Bhattacharya, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",debobhatta@gmail.com; bmazumder@frbchi.org,,,,,,,37,73,98,1,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

The results of our empirical test confirm our expectations that globalization contributes to economic growth, but it is also sensitive to specific institutional factors, like an incumbent political party. Globalization has a larger impact on real gross domestic product per capita in FCCs than in OECD countries.

Given any prior over behavioral types, we construct a modified prior with the same total weight on behavioral types and a larger support under which almost all efficient, feasible, and individually rational payoffs are attainable in perfect Bayesian equilibrium. Thus, whether reputation effects emerge in repeated games with contracts depends on details of the prior distribution over behavioral types other than its support. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Extending the analytical framework of Black et al. (2006), the present paper measures the housing bubbles of China's 35 major cities from the second quarter of 1999 to the second quarter of 2010. The results indicate that the housing bubbles in China's 35 major cities were relatively small in the sample interval, but the bubbles in eastern metropolises, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hangzhou and Ningbo, have been relatively big since 2005. The changing tendency of housing bubbles in most cities highly corresponds with the changes in real estate policies. This paper decomposes the housing bubbles of the 35 cities, and finds a great proportion of irrational bubbles rather than rational intrinsic bubbles generated by price speculation. Based on empirical analysis, this paper proposes policy recommendations for preventing the generation and expansion of housing bubbles.","Renmin Univ China, Sch Publ Adm, Dept Land & Real Estate Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Yu, HY (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Publ Adm, Dept Land & Real Estate Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",rucyhy@163.com,,,,,,,39,24,26,1,58,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,NOV-DEC,2011,19.0,6,,,,,56,75,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2011.01266.x,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,856IP,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000297633300004,0

In principle, subsistence is consistent with different combinations of food consumption, energy expenditure, body weight, and health. In practice, caloric intake has remained remarkably constant over the course of development, giving the appearance of a minimal subsistence constraint in consumption alone. We argue that the trendless nature of caloric intake results from a positive income effect on food consumption being offset by a reduction in the need for food as the energy requirements of work decrease with development. The theory helps explain the observed patterns in body mass, fertility, and economic growth rates for more than two centuries. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The productivity of contributions, as captured in the marginal-per-capita return, differs among individuals, so that there are two types: high and low productivity. Every two or eight periods, depending on the treatment, individuals vote on a punishment regime, in which certain individuals are permitted, but not required, to have punishment directed toward them. The punishment system can condition on type and contribution history. The results indicate that the most effective regime, in terms of contributions and earnings, is one that allows punishment of low contributors only, regardless of productivity.

The tax level, however, is not exogenous and it depends on the political equilibrium arising from agents' voting decisions.

Capital utilization decisions and their differential role in determining market prices for capital goods under the two regimes of infrastructure provision serve as a critical transmission mechanism for fiscal policy. A subsidy to private providers of infrastructure is preferable to direct government provision irrespective of how the subsidy or expenditure is financed. The case for private provision is much stronger in economies characterized by high levels of congestion. The choice between private and government provision also has a crucial effect on the design of optimal fiscal policy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Critical views of social capital purport that the neoclassical principle is dominant in economics and the social sciences, and thus offers a reductionist view of social norms and networks that is instrumentalist and individualist. Here we argue that, despite neoclassical (mis)treatments, social capital can constitute a path to a more pluralistic economics, provided we turn to alternative, non-neoclassical principles of rationality that restore the social aspects of human behavior. To this end, we relate social capital to the concept of social embeddedness, where individuals take part in multiple collective agencies, and freely engage in a reflexive process to assess different norms and networks. Hence, individuals' choices do not depend on their personal utility, but on their personal identity, that is, who they want to be when confronting these choices.","[Christoforou, Asimina] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, Athens, Greece; [Christoforou, Asimina] Univ Crete, Dept Econ, Iraklion, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business; University of Crete,"Christoforou, A (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, Athens, Greece.",,,,,,,,31,12,13,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

In this paper we investigate differences between individuals and small groups as decision makers in information cascade situations. In line with results from social psychology as well as results on Bayesian decision making (Charness et al., 2006) we find that groups behave more rationally than individuals. Groups, in particular, are able to abandon their own private signals more often than individuals when it is rational to do so.

We find that replacing patents with this alternative has the potential to increase welfare in the United States through reform of pharmaceutical patents by $43.9-$194 billion when measured in present value terms (this is 0.3-1.3% of annual GDP) based on simulations involving four selected drug sectors.

This question is particularly relevant to production in China, which has a huge territory and population, but a skewed distribution in terms of urban-rural development. This paper aims to examine the dynamics of industrial agglomeration and the impact of agglomeration on firm-level productivity in China's textile industry by using a firm-level panel dataset from 2000 to 2005. First, the average value of the Ellison-Glaeser (EG) index (city level) is found to be approximately 0.00019. Moreover, the calculated city EG index of spatial concentration for each year exhibits a decreasing trend of spatial agglomeration for garments and other fiber products, but an increasing trend for the textile industries' agglomeration in China. The above findings are similar to the findings of Lu and Tao (2009). Secondly and importantly, this study finds an inverted U-shape relationship between agglomeration and productivity. It suggests that while industrial agglomeration enhances firms' productivity, agglomeration diseconomies may appear if the degree of agglomeration is too high. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The emergence of new marketing systems may have altered price transmission mechanisms, especially if collusion behaviors have appeared among domestic stakeholders along the marketing chain. I use threshold cointegration tools to analyze the dynamics of world price transmission to coffee growers in three deregulated markets. The methods I use allow me to test the presence of a threshold in both the cointegrating relationship and its corresponding error correction model. Over the pre-reform period, I detect asymmetric price adjustments that appear favorable to producers - deviations from the long-run equilibrium resulting from largest increases in world prices being eliminated relatively quickly - and disappear in the post-reform period. On the contrary over the post-reform period, the results suggest that largest decreases in world prices may be transmitted relatively quickly to growers. These results can be seen as expressions of a favorable pricing policy over the pre-reform period and an unfavorable influence of new private agents over the post-reform period, meaning that in some cases reforms may have failed to create competitive market structures.

Moreover, they constitute a major source of profit shifting opportunities in multinational enterprises (MNEs) due to a highly intransparent transfer pricing process. This paper argues that, for both reasons, MNEs have an incentive to locate intangible property at affiliates with a relatively low corporate tax rate. Using panel data on European MNEs and controlling for unobserved time-constant heterogeneity between affiliates, we find that the lower a subsidiary's corporate tax rate relative to other affiliates of the multinational group the higher is its level of intangible asset investment. This effect is statistically and economically significant, even after controlling for subsidiary size and accounting for a dynamic intangible investment pattern. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The expression 'what works' is crucial: the emphasis is on evidence-based conclusions that will have immediate policy use. No room for good intentions, wishful thinking, ideological biases, Washington Consensus, cost-benefit calculations or even parametric stochastic assumptions. A valuable byproduct has been the identification of questions that other methods might answer, or that subsequent randomised evaluations might address. An unattractive byproduct has been the dumbing down of econometric practice, the omission of any cost-benefit analytics and an arrogance towards other methodologies.

A correlation between giving or volunteering by one's peers and one's own giving can be driven by self-selection into groups, common shocks that inspire both the solicitor to ask and the individual to give, or social influence. Using data from a university, this paper analyzes whether alumni are more likely to give and give larger amounts when they are solicited by someone with whom they have social ties. Freshman year roommate assignments and the structure of the university's giving campaigns are used to overcome problems of selection and common shocks. Social ties play a strong causal role in the decision to donate and the average gift size. Additionally, a solicitor's request is much more effective if he or she shares characteristics, such as race, with the alumnus being solicited. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This conclusion stands in contrast to the prevailing view that training costs are a source of inefficiency in imperfect labor markets. The efficiency of the competitive economy relies on the ability of large firms to take into account the negative impact of the training rate on the wages negotiated inside the firm through intrafirm bargaining: untrained workers accept a wage reduction in compensation for potential training that is accessible only following employment. This intrafirm bargaining process solves efficiency problems associated with training costs that would otherwise lead to inefficient hiring and training decisions. This conclusion holds true for both specific and general human capital. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This paper computes the Shaked and Sutton (1982) model for a lognormal distribution of consumer incomes to investigate the effect of inequality on firms' entry, product quality, and pricing decisions. The main findings are that greater inequality in consumer incomes leads to the entry of more firms and results in more intense quality competition among the entrants. More intense quality competition raises the average quality of products in the market as firms compete for the shrinking share of higher-income consumers. With zero costs of quality improvements and an upper bound on the top quality or when costs of quality are fixed and rise sufficiently fast, greater heterogeneity of consumer incomes also reduces firms' incentives to differentiate their products. Competition between more similar products tends to reduce their prices. However, when income inequality is very high, the top quality producer chooses to serve only the rich segment of the market and charges a higher price. The conclusion is that income inequality has important implications for the degree of product differentiation. price level, industry concentration, and consumer welfare. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Andreoni (1998) argues that such a fundraising strategy may be particularly effective when funds are being raised for projects that have fixed production costs. The reason is that when there are fixed costs of production simultaneous giving may result in both positive and zero provision equilibria. Thus absent announcements donors may get stuck in an equilibrium that fails to provide a desirable public project Andreoni (1998) demonstrates that such inferior outcomes can be eliminated when the fundraiser initially secures a sufficiently large seed donation. We investigate this model experimentally to determine whether announcements of seed money eliminate the inefficiencies that may result under fixed costs and simultaneous provision. To assess the strength of the theory we examine the effect of announcements in both the presence and absence of fixed costs. Our findings are supportive of the theory for sufficiently high fixed costs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

At younger ages, wages increase in line with productivity gains but as prime-age approaches, wage increases lag behind productivity gains. As a result, older workers are, in fact, worthy of their pay, in the sense that their contribution to firm-level productivity exceeds their contribution to the wage bill. On the methodological side, we note that failure to account for the endogenous nature of the regressors in the estimation of the wage and productivity equations biases the results towards a pattern consistent with underpayment followed by overpayment type of policies.","[Cardoso, Ana Rute] Barcelona GSE IAE CSIC, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Guimaraes, Paulo; Varejao, Jose] Univ Porto, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal; [Guimaraes, Paulo] Univ S Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Varejao, Jose] CEF UP, Oporto, Portugal; [Cardoso, Ana Rute] CSIC, Inst Econ Anal, Campus UAB, Barcelona 08193, Spain",Barcelona School of Economics; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE); Universidade do Porto; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; Universidade do Porto; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE),"Cardoso, AR (通讯作者)，CSIC, Inst Econ Anal, Campus UAB, Barcelona 08193, Spain.",anarute.cardoso@iae.csic.es,"Cardoso, Ana Rute/B-5888-2009; Varejao, Jose/B-6959-2009; Guimaraes, Paulo D/A-7085-2008","Guimaraes, Paulo D/0000-0002-2992-1028",,,,,24,53,61,1,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,JUN,2011,159.0,2,,,SI,,95,111,,10.1007/s10645-011-9163-8,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,781QG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291948000002,0

Seven financial indicators capable of explaining business failure at a 1-year prediction horizon are identified. Using the model estimated in this way, an aggregate indicator of the creditworthiness of the Czech corporate sector (the JT index) is then constructed and its evolution over time is shown. This indicator aids the estimation of the risks of this sector going forward and broadens the existing analytical set-up used by the Czech National Bank for its financial stability analyses. The results suggest that the creditworthiness of the Czech corporate sector steadily improved between 2004 and 2006. However, the JT index for 2007 and 2008 deteriorated what could be explained through global market turbulences while the further decrease in 2009 rather by the global recession. The used methodology for the construction of the JT index might be suitable for decision makers when evaluating the economy's financial stability.

Srednjaja Eljuzan, located in the oblast of Penza, is presented as a hotbed of Wahhabism by some but as a model Muslim community by others. Islamic norms are heavily present in villagers' lives. Beyond the regular observance of religious rites, rules defined as Islamic permeate the norms regulating social life. This micro-sociological survey of changes in individual commitments and collective logics seeks the reasons for this Islamic influence in the village's history during the post-Soviet period. Insisting on how individuals' behaviors are made coherent with the collective mindset, the author describes the place held by the three fundamental values of work, family and faith in this local society. Interviews with villagers shed light on divergences, behind a facade of unanimity, in the denominations of Islam that are followed, in particular between different generations.",,,,liliya_sagitova@mail.ru,,,,,,,3,0,1,0,5,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

It offers a reconstruction of a mode of reasoning that is compatible with the emergence of conventions, and argues that such reasoning is pragmatically rational. This is a form of non-Bayesian inductive reasoning in which an individual's private and subjective conceptions of salience can influence the inferences she makes. This mode of reasoning is then shown to be pragmatically rational in a more general sense, relevant to problems of induction discussed in the philosophy of science. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We find that, unconditionally, white females manage to stretch their time the most by almost four additional hours per day and non-white men stretch their time the least. The three secondary activities most often combined with other (primary) activities in terms of time spent on them are social activities including resting, passive leisure and childcare. Regression results indicate that non-white ethnic minorities engage less in multitasking than whites, with Pakistani and Bangladeshi males spending the least time on total secondary activities. There also exists a significant ethnicity gap for secondary housework activities and for both males and females, although females in general engage more in multitasking. The effect is heterogeneous across different sub-groups. We review several potential interpretations and discuss whether these differences in behavior may relate, among other, to opportunity costs of time, different preferences and tastes of ethnic minorities, integration experience, family composition and household productivity.","[Zaiceva, Anzelika; Zimmermann, Klaus F.] Univ Bonn, IZA, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Zaiceva, Anzelika] Univ Bologna, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Zimmermann, Klaus F.] DIW Berlin, Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn; IZA Institute Labor Economics; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Zaiceva, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, IZA, Schaumburg Lippe Str 5-9, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",zaiceva@iza.org,"Zaiceva, Anzelika/H-1192-2016","Zaiceva, Anzelika/0000-0001-7542-8974",,,,,45,12,14,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

A number of effective decision making methods that support decisions under conditions of multiple criteria have appeared in the last decade. This paper presents a panorama of decision making methods in economics and summarizes the most important results and applications over the last five years.

China and the US are two big users and targets of AD investigations. They, respectively, represent developing and developed countries on one hand, and new AD users and traditional AD users on the other. In this paper, using AD filing data of these two countries from 1991 to 2005, we explore whether China's AD is more retaliatory than that of the US. Our results obtained from negative binomial models with maximum likelihood techniques show that although both countries have some degree of retaliatory incentives in their AD filings, China is not more (or may even be less) retaliatory than the US. We also compare the two countries' similarities and differences in their AD responses to other factors such as macroeconomic conditions, contagions, and geographical distance.","[Bao, Xiaohua] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Larry D.] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; University of Hong Kong,"Bao, XH (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",xiaohuabao77@163.com; larryqiu@hku.hk,,,,,,,35,15,18,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Bilingual RNs are found to earn higher wages than monolingual nurses. A direct measure of fluency in a language other than English is used to examine the source of the bilingual wage premium.Two avenues for the premium are examined, (1) a response to demand for bilingual workers and (2)a response to accounting for a portion of innate ability and skills that would otherwise have been unobserved by the employer. Regressing interactions of various language regions and fluency indicators provides limited evidence for the premium arising from an increase in demand for bilinguals. The majority of the premium is due to accounting for levels of skill and ability that would otherwise be unknown. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This paper identifies the most restrictive limit that rules of origin can enforce and still continue to guarantee gains from trade for FTA formation. We note that many commonly used rules of origin exceed this condition in practice. We apply the identified welfare-supporting rules of origin and prove the existence of a FTA general equilibrium involving only within-FTA transfers that is at least as satisfactory for every consumer as an arbitrary original world trade allocation. The analysis also helps to explain why hub-and-spoke extensions of FTAs cannot be expected to guarantee gains from trade for all participants in general.,"[Grinols, Earl L.] Baylor Univ, Dept Econ, Hankamer Sch Business, Waco, TX 76798 USA; [Silva, Peri] Univ N Dakota, Dept Econ, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA; [Silva, Peri] Ctr Luca dAgliano, Milan, Italy",Baylor University; University of North Dakota Grand Forks,"Grinols, EL (通讯作者)，Baylor Univ, Dept Econ, Hankamer Sch Business, 1 Bear Pl 98003, Waco, TX 76798 USA.",Earl_Grinols@baylor.edu; peri.da.silva@und.edu,,,,,,,30,8,9,2,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

It proceeds to use the models to evaluate International Cocoa Organization's (ICCO) Buffer Stock's decision to purchase excess stock from the market a floor price and re-sell it, in periods of low supply, at the ceiling price. The results show that cocoa producer prices and incomes were more stable during periods of ICCO buffer stock intervention than after the demise of the buffer stock. The results further indicate that stock-buying operations induced greater stability in producer incomes than buying stock-selling operations. (C) 2011 Society for Policy Modeling.

It also examines monetary policy in Malaysia, a country that has not adopted IT. The study estimates policy reaction functions to test the links between the adoption of IT and use of a monetary policy rule. The impulse responses of prices to a monetary policy shock are also estimated to identify monetary policy impacts on prices. The findings on the monetary policies of the five economies can be summarised as follows. Korea has taken an inflation-responsive and forward-looking policy stance under inflation targeting, which has had an effect on the stability of prices. Indonesia and Thailand have conducted inflation-responsive but backward-looking policy stances, which have had no impact in terms of price stabilisation. The Philippines (which adopted IT but under a pegged exchange rate regime) and Malaysia have neither followed inflation-responsive rules nor had policy impacts in terms of controlling inflation.","[Taguchi, Hiroyuki; Kato, Chizuru] Minist Finance, Policy Res Inst, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1008940, Japan",,"Taguchi, H (通讯作者)，Minist Finance, Policy Res Inst, Chiyoda Ku, 3-1-1 kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1008940, Japan.",hiroyuki.taguchi@mof.go.jp; chizuru.kato@mof.go.jp,,,,,,,19,14,14,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0818-9935,,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

I discuss recent empirical evidence from both large-scale databases and specific industries which suggests that tougher competition does indeed raise productivity and one of the main mechanisms is through improving management practices. To establish this, I report on new research seeking to quantify management. I relate this to theoretical perspectives on the economics of competition and management, arguing that management should be seen at least in part as a transferable technology. A range of recent econometric studies suggests that (i) competition increases management quality and (ii) improved management quality boosts productivity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

By linking a global trade model to a national policy model which itself is connected to a set of disaggregated household data, we are able to assess the effects of the proposed Doha trade liberalizations on households both at the national and regional levels. According to the results of the model, the impacts of a Doha Round agreement on households differ significantly from those of China's WTO accession. China's economy would benefit from the trade liberalization associated with the Doha Round. The overall impacts, however, are relatively minor. Although farmers will benefit at the national level, the gains among farmers vary largely by income group and province. Also, the impacts on households that produce different types of crops differ.

The paper also focuses on the post-reform period, after 2005, allowing greater flexibility of the RMB to explore the change in the role of the Chinese import share in determining the trend in the US exchange rate pass-through. Evidence reveals that China's share of US imports has a negative effect on the exchange rate pass-through. However, this negative effect has been moderated to a negligible level since China's exchange rate reform. An important implication is that the exchange rate flexibility of the RMB has been raised to a significant level may no longer cause distortion in the US competitive environment and prevent the USA from adjusting current accounts.","[Kim, Donghun] Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul 120749, South Korea; Dept Commerce, Beijing, Peoples R China",Yonsei University,"Kim, D (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",zhoujianhuan@mofcom.gov; dhkim2@yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,,14,2,2,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAY-JUN,2011,19.0,3,,,,,87,104,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2011.01244.x,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,772IJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291227300006,0

In the model, leaders of full and limited democracies risk losing power if they do not stand up to threats from abroad. In addition, the leader of a fully democratic country loses the support of the median voter if he attacks a non-hostile country. The result is a non-monotonic relationship between democracy and peace. Using Polity data, we classify countries as full democracies, limited democracies, and dictatorships. For the period 1816-2000, Correlates of War data suggest that limited democracies are more aggressive than other regime types, including dictatorships, and not only during periods when the political regime is changing. In particular, a dyad of limited democracies is more likely to be involved in a militarized dispute than any other dyad (including mixed dyads, where the two countries have different regime types). Thus, while full democratization might advance the cause of peace, limited democratization might advance the cause of war. We also find that as the environment becomes more hostile, fully democratic countries become more aggressive faster than other regime types.","[Baliga, Sandeep] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Lucca, David O.] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC USA; [Sjoestroem, Tomas] Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA",Northwestern University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Baliga, S (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,"Sjostrom, Tomas/AAB-9239-2020; Baliga, Sandeep/KCY-3667-2024","Sjostrom, Tomas/0000-0003-2835-0953; Baliga, Sandeep/0009-0000-5709-4253",,,,,78,24,30,4,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Individual preferences and the Pareto weights (which capture the intra-household bargaining process) are identified by making use of panel data with couples and individuals who became a widow(er) in the observation period, along with the assumption that an individual's preferences can only change in a particular manner after the spouse's death. The change in preferences comes from changes in observable variables that can be controlled for (like mental health) and from the loss of the possibility to jointly enjoy leisure after the couple's dissolution.

We show that profit-maximizing market makers provide liquidity in order to manage their trading capacity constraint optimally over time: they use slack trading capacity early to accumulate assets when the selling pressure is strong in order to relax their trading capacity constraint and sell to buyers more quickly when the selling pressure subsides. When the trading capacity constraint binds, the bid-ask spread is strictly positive, widening and narrowing as market makers build up and unwind their inventories. Because the equilibrium asset allocation is constrained Pareto-optimal, the time variations in bid-ask spread are not a symptom of inefficient liquidity provision.","[Weill, Pierre-Olivier] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Weill, Pierre-Olivier] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Weill, PO (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, 8283 Bunche Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",poweill@econ.ucla.edu,,,,,,,17,3,3,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

This paper aims at examining the possibility of an aggregation bias in national-level studies, which could conceal disparities between regions. As regional differences and decentralization processes stand out in Spain as compared to other OECD countries, we focus the analysis on this country. Latent class models are used to define deprivation indices using the Spanish EU-SILC. The results seem to show that the absence of significant relationships between both phenomena still holds at a regional level. The decomposition methods used in the paper show that it might be due to some regional singularities in some determining factors of income and multidimensional poverty.","[Perez-Mayo, Jesus] Univ Extremadura, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, E-06071 Badajoz, Spain; [Ayala, Luis] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Madrid, Spain",Universidad de Extremadura; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Pérez-Mayo, J (通讯作者)，Univ Extremadura, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Ave Elvas S-N, E-06071 Badajoz, Spain.",jperez@unex.es,"Pérez-Mayo, Jesús/D-9424-2016; Ayala, Luis/ABF-8664-2021; Jurado, Antonio/GYJ-7544-2022; Ayala, Luis/AAA-2231-2019","Pérez-Mayo, Jesús/0000-0001-6757-7857; Jurado, Antonio/0000-0003-1407-5954; Ayala, Luis/0000-0002-3141-827X",,,,,57,39,44,1,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

We focus on identifying the group of households that lack enough wealth holdings to sustain them during a period of economic crisis in order to quantify asset poverty, and its demographic weight, in two industrialized countries with particularly different household demographics and saving attitudes such as Spain and the United Kingdom. Our results show that the age profile of the asset poor is remarkably similar in the two countries. In both it is individuals in households whose head is under 45 years old who are more likely to be asset poor. However, some country-specific differences also arise. For instance, the incidence of wealth poverty in the United Kingdom is about twice that of Spain. Using counterfactual analysis we find that, although the different household demographics clearly contribute importantly to this result, there remains a significant part of the asset-poverty gap which is not explained by this relevant factor.","STICERD London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Azpitarte, F (通讯作者)，STICERD London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",F.Azpitarte@lse.ac.uk,"Azpitarte, Francisco/F-2170-2016","Azpitarte, Francisco/0000-0002-2688-6933",,,,,42,22,22,1,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

For that purpose, in a Lancasterian framework we first introduce attributes, addresses, alternatives and subjective associations between attributes. Second, we define tastes as subsets of attributes resulting from a specific mapping T over the powerset of attributes and we establish the two conditions, monotonicity and normalization of the mapping T, under which tastes can be said to be well-formed; that is, formally relevant as a representation of the subjective associations between attributes (Theorem 1). Third, we exhibit the formal properties, reflexivity and transitivity of the subjective associations that structure the attributes set if tastes are well-formed (Theorem 2).

This article examines the extent to which several theoretically founded factors including, economic growth, energy prices and weather conditions determine the expected prices of the European Union CO2 allowances during the 2005 through to the 2009 period. The novel aspect of our study is that we examine heavily traded futures instruments that have an expiry date in Phase 2 of the EU El's. Our study adopts both static and recursive versions of the Johansen multivariate cointegration likelihood ratio test as well as a variation on this test with a view to controlling for time varying volatility effects. Our results are indicative of a new pricing regime emerging in Phase 2 and point to a maturing market driven by the fundamentals.

The strategic interaction of consulting groups, client firms, and consultants gives rise to a market equilibrium in a mixed economy. Under very general conditions, whenever a match client-consultant is formed, a pure strategy equilibrium exists where the consulting group pleases the client's request and the consultant is poached by the client. Thus, the equilibrium quality of the consulting services market does not depend only on the consulting group's assignment strategy but also on the clients' poaching behavior (consumption externality).",,,,emanuela.ciapanna@bancaditalia.it,,,,,,,24,2,2,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

Understanding the expectations that individuals have is thus of crucial importance to designing and evaluating policies in health, education, finance, migration, social protection, and many other areas. However, the majority of developing country surveys are static in nature and many do not elicit subjective expectations of individuals. Possible reasons given for not collecting this information include fears that poor, illiterate individuals do not understand probability concepts, that it takes far too much time to ask such questions, or that the answers add little value. This paper provides a critical review and new analysis of subjective expectations data from developing countries and refutes each of these concerns. We find that people in developing countries can generally understand and answer probabilistic questions, such questions are not prohibitive in time to ask, and the expectations are useful predictors of future behavior and economic decisions. The paper discusses the different methods used for eliciting such information, the key methodological issues involved, and the open research questions. The available evidence suggests that collecting expectations data is both feasible and valuable, suggesting that it should be incorporated into more developing country surveys. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The paper identifies a peculiar sense in which the speculator is unconventional.

First, do high tax rates and complex tax regulations really constitute a barrier to the formalization of micro-firms? Second, does formalization improve firm performance measured along several dimensions, including revenues, employment and capital stock? Third, what are the channels through which this occurs? We find that SIMPLES led to a significant increase in formality in several dimensions. Moreover, newly created firms that opt for operating formally show higher levels of revenue and profits, employ more workers and are more capital intensive (only for those firms that have employees). The channel through which this occurs is not access to credit or contracts with larger firms. Rather, it appears that the lower cost of contracting labor leads to adopting production techniques that involve a permanent location and a larger paid labor force. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Either by estimating mean-variance liquidity constrained frontiers or directly estimating optimal portfolios for alternative levels of risk aversion and preference for liquidity, we obtain strong effects of liquidity on optimal portfolio selection. In particular, portfolio performance, measured by the Sharpe ratio relative to the tangency portfolio, varies significantly with liquidity. When the investor shows no preference for liquidity, the performance of optimal portfolios is relatively more favorable. However, it is also the case that, under no preference for liquidity, these portfolios display lower levels of liquidity.

However, with rising energy prices and environmental concerns, we see conflicts emerging between energy subsidies, energy demand/supply fundamentals and climate change considerations. Energy subsidies have important implications for sustainable development through their effects on energy use, efficiency and the choice of fuel source. This paper applies the price-gap approach to estimate China's energy subsidies. Results indicate that China's energy subsidies amounted to CNY 356.73 billion in 2007, equivalent to 1.43% of GDP. Subsidies for oil products consumption are the largest, followed by subsidies for the electricity and coal sectors. Furthermore, a CGE model is used to analyze the economic impacts of energy subsidy reforms. Our findings show that removing energy subsidies will result in a significant fall in energy demand and emissions, but will have negative impacts on macroeconomic variables. We conclude that offsetting policies could be adopted such that certain shares of these subsidies are reallocated to support other sustainable development measures, which could lead to reducing energy intensity and favoring the environment.

To this end, the framework used in this paper extends the protection for sale analysis to explicitly model the role of domestic importers and foreign exporters in the determination of preferential trade treatment. The predictions of the model are tested using data on preferential trade between the United States and Latin American countries. The results suggest that Latin American exporters and US importers' lobbying efforts have a significant and important role in determining the extent of preferential access granted by the United States. More interestingly, these findings also show that U.S. importers capture a very substantial share of the rents generated by tariff preferences. These results therefore shed a pessimistic view on preferential trade schemes as a reliable source of gains for developing countries. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Previous estimates of income elasticities of nutrient demand have ranged from zero to unity. However, these estimates are always based on the total income. One possible reason for this wide range is that dietary behaviour may respond differently to different sources of income if, for example, agents engage in 'mental accounting', the practice of treating distinct income sources as not fully fungible. Estimating income elasticities with total income may mask these differential responses and result in very different income elasticity estimates depending on which income source changes. Using dietary diversity as a measure of dietary quality, we find that differential dietary responses do exist across income sources among the pastoralist households studied. Possible explanations for this result include market failures for certain commodities, intrahousehold bargaining and mental accounting. These differential effects persist after accounting for intrahousehold bargaining, market failures and after using exogenous variations of the different income sources. While we cannot test it explicitly as an explanation, mental accounting does appear to play some part in explaining the dietary patterns evident in this sample.","[Villa, Kira M.; Barrett, Christopher B.; Just, David R.] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",Cornell University,"Villa, KM (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",kmj34@cornell.edu,"Barrett, Christopher B./A-9750-2009; Just, David R/K-7302-2012","Barrett, Christopher B./0000-0001-9139-2721;",,,,,40,15,20,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The vast majority of empirical approaches, however, limit cross-country heterogeneity in production technology to the specification of total factor productivity, the 'measure of our ignorance'. In this survey, we present two general empirical frameworks for cross-country growth and productivity analysis and demonstrate that they encompass the various approaches in the growth empirics literature of the past two decades. We then develop our central argument, that cross-country heterogeneity in the impact of observables and unobservables on output as well as the time-series properties of the data are important for reliable empirical analysis.","[Eberhardt, Markus; Teal, Francis] Univ Oxford, Ctr Study African Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford,"Eberhardt, M (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Ctr Study African Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",,,"Eberhardt, Markus/0000-0002-0945-0759",ESRC [ES/G014469/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G014469/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,175,225,242,0,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

To point to the right context for the pattern, this paper establishes a formal mechanism in line with Kuznets' explanation that relates to the industrialization-cum-urbanization phases of closed trade regimes. The mechanism involves an interaction among urban-rural sectoral size differences, agricultural tastes/income, and migration, and predicts an inverted-U shape in inequality in the following way: (i) widening differences in the sizes of urban and rural sectors due to exogenous shocks affect negatively the agricultural tastes/income, worsening inequality; (ii) increasing sectoral size differences and decreasing agricultural tastes/income jointly foster intersectoral migration; (iii) migration acts, in turn, as an equilibrating effect, improving the income distribution. Empirically testing these predictions, non-Sub-Saharan developing countries' data support the mechanism, while data from developed and Sub-Saharan African countries provide little support, as per our prior expectations. This highlights a contrasting evidence on the inverted-U shape across country groups of differing development stages.","[Anbarci, Nejat; Ulubasoglu, Mehmet A.] Deakin Univ, Fac Business & Law, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Deakin University,"Ulubasoglu, MA (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Fac Business & Law, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",mehmet.ulubasoglu@deakin.edu.au,"Ulubasoglu, Mehmet/AAT-2856-2021; Ulubasoglu, Mehmet/AAI-8535-2020","Anbarci, Nejat/0000-0001-5952-8086; Ulubasoglu, Mehmet/0000-0003-3055-5755",,,,,52,0,0,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Although the approach to valuing ecosystem services seems straightforward, in practice there are a number of challenges. The majority of ecosystem services are not marketed, and it is often difficult to determine how changes in ecosystem structure, functions, and processes influence the quantities and qualities of ecosystem service flows to people. Only when these difficulties are overcome is it possible to use existing valuation methods to assess the impact on human well-being that results from a change in ecosystem services.

The optimum currency area (OCA) theory provides a framework with several criteria for such analysis. In such context, we start by a descriptive analysis of the first twelve euro countries under six criteria, leading to a mixed conclusion on whether the EMU is closer or farther to fulfil them. Then we assess the impact of five OCA criteria on countries' relative competitiveness. Differences in the growth of unit labour costs, the dissimilarity of trade and the differences in output growth were found to be the most significant. This way, we identify some causes of the divergent competitiveness between some EMU countries that contributed to weaker economic growth in some of them.","[Barbosa, Joao Rebelo; Alves, Rui Henrique] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, CEF UP, Oporto, Portugal; [Alves, Rui Henrique] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, NIFIP, Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto,"Barbosa, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Fac Econ, CEF UP, Oporto, Portugal.",joaorebelobarbosa@gmail.com; rhalves@fep.up.pt,"Alves, Rui Henrique/B-5974-2009","Alves, Rui Henrique/0000-0002-4003-100X",,,,,60,4,5,0,33,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2011,58.0,5,,,SI,,605,629,,10.2298/PAN1105605R,0.0,,,25,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,877OY,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299193000004,0

I review and evaluate the objections cited by critics of this approach.

The use of figurative language, dramatic language, silences, puns, break down of dialogues, and verbal humor, all are effective on making absurdity or making language witty. Stoppard goes beyond Absurdity by breaking the distance between audience and the actors. In his plays, human beings are unable to communicate with each other, due to being afraid of using a language having no particular form. Sometimes it is serious, sometimes witty, sometimes meaningless and sometimes difficult to comprehend. Sometimes the turn in language from literal meaning to metaphorical meaning is delayed, sometimes it has hasted, and it is elided entirely. The study focuses on the varied degrees of wittiness. Three kinds of metaphors: Simple, complex, difficult have found in this study. There is a relationship between wit, transference and interference in the process of creating metaphor.

Turkey was a closed economy in late 1970s and has gradually become an open economy in these 30 years. During this period, Turkey followed globalization and regional integration strategies simultaneously. On the one hand, Turkey gradually opened its economy to the rest of the world. On the other hand, in the process of joining the EU, Turkey signed the Customs Union agreement. This makes Turkey a good case study of testing whether the regional integration decision has caused any deviation in the trade flow of the country. In this study, we first develop a gravity model and employ a panel dataset to verify whether it works in explaining Turkey's trade flow Next, we use this equation to test the importance of EU countries in Turkey's trade flow and whether the flow has been subject to deviation after the Customs Union agreement. Our findings suggest that although EU countries have always been important in Turkey's trade flow, Customs Union has not lead to any statistically significant deviation in Turkey's trade flow, hi that respect, the globalization effect has dominated the regional integration effect in the case of Turkey.","[Bilici, Oe] Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Erdil, E.] Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey; [Yetkiner, H.] Izmir Univ Econ, Dept Econ, Izmir, Turkey",University of Essex; Middle East Technical University; Izmir Ekonomi Universitesi,"Bilici, Ö (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",,"Erdil, Erkan/D-2031-2010; Yetkiner, Hakan/D-5955-2014","Erdil, Erkan/0000-0003-3091-2441; Yetkiner, Hakan/0000-0002-4455-8757",,,,,21,4,4,3,21,NATL ACAD MANAGEMENT,KYIV,"VUL PANASA MYMOGO 26, KYIV, 01011, UKRAINE",1993-6788,,,ACTUAL PROBL ECON,Actual Probl.

The impact depends on whether multinational enterprises (MNEs) expand production in reforming countries and the extent of decline in imitative activity. We examine the responses of U.S.-based MNEs and domestic industrial production to a set of intellectual property rights reforms in the 1980s and 1990s. Following reform, MNEs expand the scale of their activities. MNEs that make extensive use of intellectual property disproportionately increase their use of inputs. There is an overall expansion of industrial activity after reform, and highly disaggregated trade data indicate higher exports of new goods. These results suggest that the expansion of multinational activity more than offsets any decline in imitative activity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Unproductive activity creates a negative externality on the relative rewards to producers. If the size of bureaucracy is exogenously given, among the multiple equilibria, the one with fewer private rent-seekers yields higher welfare. By choosing a small size of bureaucracy, the government can establish the superior equilibrium as the unique outcome, which also achieves the constrained optimum. If the population of bureaucrats is endogenously determined, however, a larger bureaucracy enhances production and welfare. The size of government and economic performance are jointly determined, and their relationship depends on the quality of government.

Theoretically, this could imply that emerging markets that have not yet deregulated financial markets could employ monetarist policies. We analyse the case of China, in order to explore whether monetary targeting was in theory a possible policy framework for the central bank, and to glean policy lessons for emerging markets. Employing Svensson's criteria for the selection of intermediate targets, we find that a measure such as M1 fulfils the criteria and can serve as an intermediate target. However, it is also found that the relatively small error between monetary target and actual variables may be due to alternative monetary policy procedures, in particular, the use of 'window guidance' credit controls. Next, we test the relevance of the McCallum rule in China, which appears more relevant than the Taylor rule. In particular, we find that the actual movement of M1 fits the McCallum rule reasonably well, even during the high inflation period from 1992 to 1994. This suggests that before the official adoption of M1 as the intermediate target in 1994, the People's Bank of China may have already been 'practising' its use by implicitly following the McCallum rule. It is also found that monetary policy was too loose during 1992-1994 and a little too tight during 1998-2002. We conclude that an analysis of the traditional monetary aggregates is insufficient, and research on the role of credit aggregates would appear to be more promising. Meanwhile, policy lessons from our study include that central banks, even in emerging markets that maintain relatively regulated and 'repressed' financial markets, cannot rely too much on quantitative monetary aggregates, if traditionally defined.","[Chen, Yuanquan; Werner, Richard A.] Univ Southampton, Ctr Banking Finance & Sustainable Dev, Sch Management, Southampton, Hants, England",University of Southampton,"Werner, RA (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Ctr Banking Finance & Sustainable Dev, Sch Management, Southampton, Hants, England.",werner@soton.ac.uk,,,,,,,67,8,9,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

We allow for public and private consumption, intragroup production, and consumption externalities within a group; we only assume that the group always reaches Pareto-efficient decisions. We show that aggregation problems involve a simple mathematical structure: The aggregate demand of the group, considered as a vector field, can be decomposed into a sum of gradients. We briefly introduce exterior differential calculus as a tool to study this structure. We analyze two main issues. One is testability: What restrictions (if any) on the aggregate demand function characterize the efficient behavior of the group? The second issue relates to identifiability; we investigate the conditions under which it is possible to recover the underlying structure-namely, individual preferences, the decision process, and the resulting intragroup transfers-from the group's aggregate behavior.","[Chiappori, Pierre Andre] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Ekeland, Ivar] Univ British Columbia, Dept Math, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada",Columbia University; University of British Columbia,"Chiappori, PA (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",pc2167@columbia.edu,,,,,,,79,6,6,0,12,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4603-4,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

In order to study the impact of private schools on educational outcomes, we develop a general equilibrium model that simultaneously incorporates locational choice built on access and locational choice built on tax-school quality attributes of jurisdictions. We conclude that private school choice enhances the welfare of all households-both those attending private schools and those attending public schools-while also working to reduce the amount of housing and school segregation in equilibrium. Investigation of alternative school policies indicates that greater choice, including using targeted school vouchers, can improve welfare and achievement. Finally, we demonstrate how the fiscal burden arising from some households paying less taxes than they consume in public services varies significantly with the structure of school choice options.","[Hanushek, Eric A.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Sarpca, Sinan; Yilmaz, Kuzey] Koc Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",Stanford University; Koc University,"Hanushek, EA (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",hanushek@stanford.edu; ssarpca@ku.edu.tr; kuyilmaz@ku.edu.tr,,"Hanushek, Eric/0000-0002-7090-7535; Sarpca, Sinan/0000-0003-4011-3985",,,,,32,8,8,1,23,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

This suggests that potential technology transfer between foreign firms and their local competitors is more than offset by the competition induced by the entry of foreign firms.

After testing for unit roots that allow for a structural break, we employ parametric tests for cointegration: based on Johansen (1995) and Saikkonen and Lutkepohl (2000a, b, c) as well as the nonparametric procedure proposed by Breitung (2002) and Breitung and Taylor (2003) that does not assume linearity. By employing these procedures recursively, two distinct regimes are identified characterized by whether or not imports and exports are cointegrated.

Labour is also differentiated according to skills in a hierarchy of tasks they can perform. Globalisation occurs in two distinct phases, leading to the agglomeration of an industry (manufacturing) in the first wave, which is subsequently displaced by the other industry (services) when the second wave of globalisation takes place. Because of agglomeration effects, the increase in relative endowment of a factor may increase its relative wages, leading to more inequality.

In particular, we test the hypothesis that consumption is smoothed to a lesser degree after negative shocks, whereas the impact of a positive shock is delayed for a longer period of time. Our analysis is based on an error-correction framework that allows for asymmetric adjustment. We find that the mean adjustment lag after a negative shock is significantly shorter than after a positive shock, especially since the beginning of the 1980s. This result is consistent with the interpretation that borrowing constraints limit the degree to which the impact of negative shocks on consumption can be smoothed.","[Leibrecht, Markus] Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Vienna, Austria; [Leibrecht, Markus] Univ Econ & Business, Res Inst Int Taxat, Vienna, Austria; [Scharler, Johann] Univ Linz, Dept Econ, A-4040 Linz, Austria",Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Leibrecht, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Vienna, Austria.",markus.leibrecht@wu-wien.ac.at,,,,,,,30,2,2,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In principle there are two alternatives for dealing with such misalignment: either environmental data have to be aggregated into the input-output classification, which entails an undesirable loss of information, or input-output data have to be disaggregated based on fragmentary information. In this article, I show that disaggregation of input-output data, even if based on few real data points, is superior to aggregating environmental data in determining input-output multipliers. This is especially true if the disaggregated sectors are heterogeneous with respect to their economic and environmental characteristics. The results of this work may help analysts in understanding that disaggregation based on even a small amount of proxy information can improve the accuracy of input-output multipliers significantly. Perhaps, these results will also provide encouragement for preferring model disaggregation to aggregation in future work.","Univ Sydney, Sch Phys, ISA, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Lenzen, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Phys, ISA, A28, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",m.lenzen@physics.usyd.edu.au,"Lenzen, Manfred/D-3161-2013","Lenzen, Manfred/0000-0002-0828-5288",,,,,40,231,237,12,118,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Initially, the crisis arose in banking sector and spread gradually over to affect all sectors of global economy resulting in fiscal crisis in many countries. Even though the harshest times seem to be over it is important to analyse properly both causes and responses to the crisis in order to avoid recurrence of the same mistakes in the future. Responses to the crisis have been mainly discussed and/or formulated at national and/or international level, which seems reasonable taking into account global nature of the crisis. Yet, regions, cities, municipalities are those to face concrete impacts of the crisis. A question arises whether implementation of purely top-down macroeconomic approach has been sufficient in the face of crisis and to which extent lower regional levels have possessed power and/or tools to take an action in mitigating impacts of crisis as well. Similar impacts of the crisis may be tracked down across European municipalities, such as impairment of access to credits, higher costs of borrowing and thus, postponing investment projects. As analysed surveys suggested, stands to the crisis taken by municipal/regional governments proved to have many similar features too as for fields of interventions (support of business start-up, social services, particularly unemployment benefits etc.). The crisis has been mostly perceived in negative way, even though several surveyed cities have adopted different stance taking the crisis as a challenge for a readjustment of current and/or elaboration of future strategic plans. Experience of past crises that had led to restructuring of local economies during the 70s to 90s was of high importance for current achievements of mentioned cities.","[Lungova, Miroslava] Tech Univ Liberec, Dept Econ, Fac Econ, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,,miroslava.lungova@tul.cz,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,4,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-755-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,270,278,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT98,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300261200030,0

The analysis of demand patterns uses the general modelling approach of Levy-Garboua and Montmarquette (1996) as a basis and makes use of the ordered probit class of models for its statistical analysis.

Overall, we find that LMIs explain wage persistence. In particular, we find a high level of Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) and a high level of Bargaining Centralization (BC) increase wage persistence.","[Menezes, A. G.; Vieira, J.

In a split-sample treatment, social context is simulated by requiring participants to potentially have to disclose their vote to the group (voting disclosure) across both hypothetical and real settings. The experimental design also varies the cost (a coercive tax), and includes an uncertain level of benefit from the public good. The design allows investigation of the role of social context in both hypothetical and real referenda and its interaction with changes in the financial stakes involved (costs and potential benefits). Results show evidence of hypothetical bias, but also a social context effect that occurs in both real and hypothetical settings. This social context effect is larger than the effect of hypothetical bias, but is muted by the magnitude of costs and potential benefits. Hypothetical cases are also shown to be more prone to the social context effect.","[Mozumder, Pallab] Florida Int Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Dept Econ, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Mozumder, Pallab] Florida Int Univ, Social Sci Res Lab, Int Hurricane Res Ctr, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Berrens, Robert P.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University; State University System of Florida; Florida International University; University of New Mexico,"Mozumder, P (通讯作者)，Florida Int Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Dept Econ, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",mozumder@fiu.edu,,,,,,,65,3,4,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This is achieved using an empirical framework that allows the central bank's policy preferences to be zone-like and asymmetric. The first major finding is that the monetary authorities' response towards inflation is zone symmetric. That is, they react in a passive manner when inflation is within the target band whereas they become increasingly aggressive when it deviates from the target band. The monetary authorities also react with the same level of aggressiveness regardless of whether inflation overshoots or undershoots the inflation target band. The second major finding is that the monetary authorities' response to output fluctuations is asymmetric. That is, they react more aggressively to negative deviations of output from the potential so that they weigh business cycle recessions more than expansions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The study has been motivated by the recent debate on the efficacy of financial liberalisation, on the one hand, and the painful experiences some of the countries had with the liberalisation of their financial sectors, on the other hand. On the whole, the study finds the laissez-faire version of financial liberalisation to be unsuitable in Kenya - despite the level of faith that some developing countries still have in the full financial liberalisation ideology. Specifically, the study finds the financial sector in Kenya, just as in many other developing countries, to be fragile and prone to market failures. The study, therefore, reiterates the need for prudential regulations in order to deter financial institutions from engaging in risky lending practices.","Univ S Africa, Dept Econ, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Odhiambo, NM (通讯作者)，Univ S Africa, Dept Econ, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.",,,,,,,,24,0,1,0,2,NATIONAL ACAD MANAGEMENT,KYIV,"VUL PANASA MYMOGO 26, KYIV, 01011, UKRAINE",1993-6788,,,ACTUAL PROBL ECON,Actual Probl.

Renewed interest in MRIOA has led to several large research projects focused on constructing detailed and accurate MRIOTs. However, very few researchers have made use of the already available and regularly updated database produced by the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP). We demonstrate and discuss how the GTAP database can be converted into an MRIOT without the need for additional balancing. An illustrative example uses the GTAP-MRIO to reallocate carbon dioxide emissions from producing to consuming countries. We suggest that an MRIOT that treats international transport exogenously is adequate until more reliable data on international transport margins and emissions are available. To focus resources and refine methods, a concerted research effort is needed to compare the results of the GTAP-MRIO model with the new MRIO datasets under development.","[Peters, Glen P.] CICERO, Oslo, Norway; [Andrew, Robbie] Landcare Res NZ Ltd, Palmerston North, New Zealand; [Lennox, James] Landcare Res NZ Ltd, Lincoln, New Zealand",Landcare Research - New Zealand; Landcare Research - New Zealand,"Peters, GP (通讯作者)，CICERO, Oslo, Norway.",glen.peters@cicero.uio.no,"Andrew, Robbie/B-4204-2008; Peters, Glen P/B-1012-2008","Andrew, Robbie/0000-0001-8590-6431; Peters, Glen P/0000-0001-7889-8568",,,,,39,252,268,16,133,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

First, it seeks to establish whether the stylized facts of the 'great moderation' that have been documented for the UK and US economies can be found for the Euro area. Second, it explores possible explanations for any changes that have occurred in the volatility of Euro area output fluctuations. In examining why business cycles have moderated, much of the existing literature has tended to concentrate on a few key factors. These include shifts in the structure of the economy, improved monetary policy and a 'good luck' factor. This paper, however, follows a relatively new branch of the great moderation literature by focusing on whether international business cycle linkages have changed in a way that may have perpetuated the dampening in Euro area output fluctuations. The results show Euro area output fluctuations to have significantly reduced in variability over the last quarter of a century. The results go on to highlight that, although Euro area cycles differ little from rest of the world cycles, the moderation in Euro area output fluctuations is only marginally due to changes in international business cycle linkages and smaller international and domestic shock variances.","Loughborough Univ Technol, Dept Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",Loughborough University,"Rafiq, MS (通讯作者)，Loughborough Univ Technol, Dept Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",sohrab.rafiq@ecb.int,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

It will be shown that significant strides have been made in relation to both the targets, especially in the province of Xayaboury where the contraceptive prevalence rate is the highest and maternal mortality is the lowest in the country. That said, it is unlikely that either target will be realised by 2015 for the nation as a whole. Some of the reasons for this are canvassed such as problems with the existing health infrastructure and its personnel, the cost of health care, the demographic profile and cultural expectations of women of childbearing age, geographic barriers, the absence of communication and transport infrastructure and the influence of international donors on how monies are expended. As discussions now begin to set the framework for the post-MDG compact of the international community to address poverty and wellbeing, it would be valuable to consider the multiplicity of factors which directly impact maternal and infant mortality rates (such as family planning, age at first birth, access to antenatal care and government expenditure on maternal health care) and explain what causes change, over non-contextualised statistics that simply report changes.","[Scopaz, Anna; Eckermann, Liz; Clarke, Matthew] Deakin Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Geelong, Vic 3220, Australia",Deakin University,"Eckermann, L (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Geelong, Vic 3220, Australia.",liz.eckermann@deakin.edu.au,,,,,,,42,2,2,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

The results show that different socio-demographic and employment related characteristics affect the training participation of workers. Well-educated and better paid workers are much more likely to participate in training programmes than others. Age has a positive impact on training participation for younger workers (under 37 years), but a negative effect on older workers' participation. The results also indicate that occupational affiliations have a significant impact on training participation. We also find that married workers seem to be less likely to participate in training programmes, but the difference between married and single is only significant at the 10% level. Finally, gender does not have any significant effect at any conventional level although the coefficient on the female dummy is positive, suggesting females might be slightly more likely to participate in training programmes.","[Thangavelu, Shandre M.; Liu Haoming; Cheolsung, Park] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 117570, Singapore; [Heng, Ang Boon; Wong, James] Minist Manpower, Dept Manpower Res & Stat, Singapore 059764, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Thangavelu, SM (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, 1 Arts Link, Singapore 117570, Singapore.",ecssmt@nus.edu.sg,"Thangavelu, Shandre/ABC-9025-2021",,,,,,13,8,8,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

But the validity of the choice of standardization or adaptation strategy is determined by its potential to improve company performance (Samie & Roth, 1992). Jain (1989) states that suitability of an international marketing strategy is confirmed by the strategy's influence on the company performance - economic and strategic benefit, received due to implementation of the chosen strategy. Although the factor of company's performance should be one of the most important ones when making the strategic decision of standardization/adaptation, according to scientists, this issue has been researched empirically the least, and results of performed research works are contradictory (Katsikeas, Samiee & Theodosiou, 2006). Therefore, the link between standardization/adaptation of international marketing strategy and company performance remain a topical object of the scientific research. The problem in this article is formulated with the help of the following question: is there any link between standardization/adaptation decisions of international marketing strategy and company performance? The aim of the article is to develop a theoretical model of the link between standardization/adaptation decisions of international marketing strategy and company performance and to test it empirically. Seeking to realize the set task, research was performed using methods of systematic and comparative analysis of scientific literature. Empirical verification of the theoretical model was performed using the case analysis method. Identified internal organisational and external environmental factors, which limit standardization/adaptation decisions of international marketing strategy, are presented in the article based on the analysis of scientific literature. Reviewing research of this subject, causality direction is analyzed and the link between standardization/adaptation decisions of international marketing strategy and company performance is substantiated. The performed analysis of scientific literature has shown that the link between standardization/adaption and company performance is reciprocal and complicated; possibly it is influenced by other forces, such as Porter's (1980) generic strategies. Based on literature analysis a theoretical model of the link between standardization/adaptation decisions of international marketing strategy and company performance was composed. The model encompasses external and internal antecedent factors that condition the decision to standardize or adapt and outcomes of standardization/adaption as well as the influence of the generic strategy on the standardization/adaptation decisions of international marketing strategy and company performance. The model reveals that company performance may be not only the outcome of standardization/adaptation decisions, but also an antecedent of these decisions. The generic strategies have a direct and indirect (acting through the international marketing strategy) impact on company performance. Analysis of the case of LENZE Group revealed that applied standardization/adaptation and cost leadership/ differentiation strategies when they are adjusted do complement each other and their strategic goals are not confronting. This partially negates theoretical assumptions that adaptation is compatible with the differentiation strategy, and standardization is compatible with cost leadership strategy, and this reveals that other combinations of strategic decisions are also possible, conditioning the improvement of company performance.","[Virvilaite, Regina; Seinauskiene, Beata; Sestokiene, Giedre] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Virvilaite, R (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Laisves Av 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",regina.virvilaite@ktu.lt; beata.seinauskiene@ktu.lt; giedreik@yahoo.com,"Šeinauskienė, Beata/ABE-9315-2021; Šeinauskienė, Beata/ADO-5527-2022","Šeinauskienė, Beata/0000-0003-1791-0214;",,,,,31,3,6,3,44,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Where projects are targeted on specific geographic areas, counterfactual outcomes in each can differ from observed outcomes because the amount of government spending (gross of aid) differs, the productivity of government spending differs, or both. This paper estimates the benefits of two concurrent World Bank health projects in Vietnam targeted on specific provinces. Estimates are derived from a model linking outcomes (under-five mortality) to government spending before and after the project and in project and nonproject provinces, and are presented for different assumptions regarding fungibility of funds (zero and full fungibility) and the impacts of the project on the productivity of government spending (the project modifies productivity in both sectors equally and in neither sector). The estimated mortality reductions are highly insensitive to the assumed degree of fungibility, but highly sensitive to the assumed productivity effects (the estimates range from 1 to 25%). The wide range reflects the uncertainty due to the lack of a genuine control group of provinces. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Based on our recent mathematical results, we prove the existence and stability of random fixed points as the perturbation intensity of random dividends is sufficiently small. Furthermore, we prove that the random fixed points converge almost surely to the corresponding fixed points of the deterministic skeleton as the perturbation intensity tends to zero. Moreover, simulations suggest similar behaviors in the case of more complicated attractors. Therefore, the corresponding deterministic skeleton is a good approximation of the random model with sufficiently small random perturbations of dividends. Given that dividends in real markets are generally very low, it is reasonable and significant to some extent to study the effects of heterogeneous agents' behaviors on price fluctuations by the corresponding deterministic skeleton of the random model.

The objective of this article is to devise a methodology of assessment of municipalities which could be employed in the elaboration of economic pillar of territorial analytic data files. In the first part of the article, there are presented varied approaches used by agencies of state administration, Czech Statistical Office and research institutions for measuring of regional disparities. An analysis of these approaches has shown that they are concerned with assessment of larger territorial units, as a rule regions, districts and administrative territories of municipalities with extended competences. The methodology devised in this article is concentrated on the smallest territorial units - municipalities - which constitute basic building blocks of the regions. At the same time, this methodology endeavours to discover strong points and weak spots of municipalities, on which their development plans can be based. The original methodology, elaborated in 2007, was founded on factor analysis of 26 indicators which were reduced to 8 common factors. When updating the data basis of this methodology in 2010, it has been found that certain original indicators are not monitored by the Czech Statistical Office any more. Therefore, we have proceeded to a modification of original methodology in collaboration with the Czech Statistical Office. The updated methodology is based on factor analysis of 33 indicators, 10 of them original ones. The aim has been to find such indicators which do encompass the phenomena monitored originally (territory, population, employment, economic activities and civic amenities), and at the same time, no changes in the sphere of methodology and in the periodicity of monitoring are expected with respect to them in the long term. On the basis of the newly performed analysis it can be stated that the contents of individual factors have not changed in principle. Only the number of factors has been reduced by one, and some factors can be interpreted better and more definitely now.","[Zizka, Miroslav] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Business Adm, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,,miroslav.zizka@tul.cz,"Zizka, Miroslav/I-5624-2016","Zizka, Miroslav/0000-0002-7804-3954",,,,,10,1,1,0,2,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-755-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,614,622,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT98,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300261200066,0

The market process approach to innovation ( and entrepreneurship) is combined with the stationary bandit approach to property rights to derive a proposition concerning how the lack of exogenous constraints on the government can retard innovation. According to this, a credible commitment to secure property rights through respecting individual or human rights becomes an important factor for the process of catching up for those countries that are relatively close to the most developed ones in terms of technology and thus income. The proposition is tested on cross-country panel data using a measure of civil rights as a proxy for the commitment to secure individual rights. This argument provides one possible explanation for the fact that there is a strong correlation between democracy and income while the correlation between democracy and growth is weak.","Univ Debrecen, Dept Econ, H-4028 Debrecen, Hungary",University of Debrecen,"Czeglédi, P (通讯作者)，Univ Debrecen, Dept Econ, Kassai U 26, H-4028 Debrecen, Hungary.",pal.czegledi@econ.unideb.hu,"Czeglédi, Pál/JXW-6671-2024","Czeglédi, Pál/0000-0001-6666-0923",,,,,72,2,2,0,13,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

The paper pursues the question by asking how neuroscience constructs an understanding of individuals as whole persons. The body of the paper is devoted to examining two approaches: Don Ross's neurocellular approach to neuroeconomics and Joseph Dumit's cultural anthropological science organization approach. The accounts are used to identify boundaries on single individual explanations. Within that space Andy Clark's external scaffolding view and Nathaniel Wilcox's socially distributed cognition view are employed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We implement two simple incentive schemes modeling the basic characteristics of a cooperative incentive environment in which payoffs are based on a group's performance, as well as a competitive environment in which payoffs result from individuals' relative performances. Our results indicate that trust and the expectation of trust are positively affected by being exposed to a team setting compared to a competitive tournament scheme.

The results suggest that the elasticity of reported self-employment income to the net-of-tax share is approximately .9, implying a real elasticity (net of any reporting response) of around .4. Estimated elasticities tend to be larger for higher income taxpayers, married males, and females. In addition, the elasticity of self-employment income is considerably larger than the elasticity wage and salary income estimated using the same methodology.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) thus began deregulation of the banking sector in 1999 to strengthen the competitiveness of local banks relative to their foreign competitors through mergers. This paper employs a nonparametric Malmquist productivity index to provide measure of productivity, technological change and efficiency gains over the period 1995-2005.

In this connection, we decompose their macroeconomic activities (real GDP) into common and country-specific components using the Bai-Ng method (2004). Our results suggest first that both components are non-stationary and have permanent effects on their overall economy. Second, we find the relative importance of common factors in all countries in terms of their contribution to variations in real GDP. But evidence is also obtained for country-specific effects becoming increasingly important in countries like China in recent years. Therefore, if, for example. China is expected to grow at a fast pace in future, our findings imply that creation of a regional monetary union of these 10 countries needs to be held back until the Chinese economy has become more dominant in the region.
