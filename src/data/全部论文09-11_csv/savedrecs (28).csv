Foreign studies have shown that approximately 10 % of hospitalizations occur at patient's damage. The Czech Republic, respectively Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic, is currently developing a series of activities to promote the Luxembourg Declaration (Luxembourg Declaration on Patient Safety), which was approved at the EU Member States Summit and calls on the EU Member States to deal with this issue. This publication supports the above-mentioned activities. There is proposed the introduction of Quality Management System (QMS), which would include the risk management. Furthermore, there are described experiences from one large public hospital in the Czech Republic with incorporated certain features of risk management into the competency of internal auditors, a research took place to evaluate the significance of health and non-health risks in terms of their impact on the organization. 47 hospital staff members on a variety of managerial positions participated in this survey. The questionnaires surveying health risks paid particular attention to physical, chemical, biological and combined risks. The questionnaires researching non-health risks included questions on general, accounting and budget risks. The risk analysis shows that the most important risk for health facilities is the biological risk of blood and tissue collection, manipulation with biomaterials in laboratories, storage of used needles, shards of ampoules, damaged glass material and handling laundry used by patients. The risk analysis shows that the highest proportion of risk with a moderate and significant impact belongs to a group of general risk. As a significant risk is in this particular case evaluated the behaviour of employees in public, which has an essential impact on the image of the hospital as a whole and the perception by patients.","[Keclikova, Kristyna] Minist Interior Prague, Police Coll, Prague, Czech Republic; [Bris, Petr] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Dept Ind Engn & Informat Syst, Zlin, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Kecliková, K (通讯作者)，Minist Interior Prague, Police Coll, Prague, Czech Republic.",krigakec@seznam.cz; bris@fame.utb.cz,"AKKÖPRÜ, MUSTAFA/ABG-4147-2020; Bris, Petr/AAX-5083-2021","Bris, Petr/0000-0001-7027-1648; Keclikova, Kristyna/0000-0001-8579-0715",,,,,22,6,6,0,27,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Based on personal interviews and secondary data, it examines how China's financial markets are reconfigured through heterogeneous knowledge networks ranging from mobile transmigrants and regulatory counterparts in other countries to different financial institutions within China. China's WTO accession is not a straightforward liberalization of its banking sector but a contested process of negotiations between the Chinese government, regulatory bodies and foreign and domestic banks. This process of knowledge translation and conflict resolution is key to revealing the temporary and unstable character of markets and demonstrates how the entanglement of different knowledge networks opens up conjectural space for new forms of market meanings and practices.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Lai, KPY (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, 1984 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada.",karen.lai@ubc.ca,"Lai, Karen P Y/IVH-3064-2023; Lai, Karen P.

To test this hypothesis, the study compares the capacity of different organizational designs of internal and external RD activities to produce complementarities. The results indicate the existence of complementarities for cases where firms combine their own RD with research collaboration. No complementarities are found for cases where firms adopt both intramural and RD outsourcing jointly. Additionally, a comparison of the factors driving choices on RD reveals that the use of oinnovation management practiceso and the presence of otechnological opportunitieso relate more to the adoption of research collaboration than to the adoption of RD outsourcing.

Using both primary and secondary data sources, culture at Goo-Moremi Village and Gorge is considered sacred as ancestor worship controls the day-to-day lives of people. Ambivalence, tensions and local resistance emerge in the process of commodifying culture at Goo-Moremi village.

Designing the requirements conditions for decommissioning, and especially for dismantling and restoring the freed area to the natural circuit, is a consistent element in the sustainable development of construction. This paper presents the PEM methodology according to the Construction extension of the PMBOK - the international standard in project management. The application of this methodology for representative projects creates the premise for sustainable development. Starting from the globally recorded effects of urban sprawl in the last half-century, this paper examines the extent to which constructions affect the balance of sustainable development. The way the rules for planning environmental management are structured in the international standard, allows the improvement of sustainable design. The application of Project Management to the letter according to the PMBOK international standard, including Project Environmental Management, greatly reduces the risk of having a resulting investment that is harmful instead of being beneficial. Managing and complying with the rules of sustainable development in the construction industry protects the natural environment against the harmful effects generated by the continued development of mankind.

Therefore, the height of the patenting activity and its structure in the area of ICT represents a measurable effect actually developed by the country's strategic priorities for the development of innovation and R&D. Hence, the development potential of the IS of the country can be examined by measuring the structure and level of patent activity in the ICT sector.

Our approach aims at answering the following questions: Does spatial position influence the development degree? Can regions which divide similar institutional and geographic factors converge rapidly? Will the least developed regions from the east be able to experience a more accentuated economic increase and catch-up with the most developed ones from the EU economic centre? How did the centre-periphery model evolve in the European Union through the extension towards the East? Are there any similarities or differences between the southern and the eastern peripherality?

It is very difficult for them to realize the importance of good management.","[Seidler, Jiri] Tepelne Hosp Hradec Kralove As, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",,,seidler@thhk.cz,,,,,,,4,1,1,0,2,GAUDEAMUS,HRADEC KRALOVE,"UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE, ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-100-6,,,,2011,,,,,,,281,285,,,,,,5,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCM57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310711600053,0

Its impact on the labour market are reflected mainly by decrease of job opportunities, increasing number of job seekers, and thus an increase in unemployment rate, as well as increasing long-term unemployment. It also comes to significant changes in the structure of employment in sectors of economy and related educational structure. Individual employers in the region react on this situation differently. In 2010, when it is spoken about the going off of the economic recession, many of them have already surpassed the critical period and are gaining employees again.

To prevent climate change, in the coming future a carbon budget will be set for each country, and in turn the country will sell carbon quotas to companies. Companies can also buy or sell their quotas with each other. In other words, companies have to pay for the carbon dioxide emissions. In effect, it will deeply influence the whole supply chain of a company including sourcing, producing and distributing processes. Nowadays, with globalization, many multi-national companies deploy their manufacturing base in Asia where the production cost is low, and then transport products to major consuming markets viz U.S. and Western Europe either by sea or by air. Therefore this mode requires global oceangoing ships or long-haul flights, which consume fuel and generate carbon dioxide emissions. However, with the carbon quota or extra cost for consuming energy that will be further reflected in the corresponding price, the current mode will be significantly changed to adapt for the new constraint. Except the delivery cost adjusted by carbon quota, carbon charge will also affect the producing and storing processes, for both of them need energy consumption as well as greenhouse gas emissions. In short, the supply chain of a company is forced. to be redesigned to conform to the carbon reduction obligation. This research aims to investigate the impacts of carbon quotas on supply chain management. Analytic models will be constructed to describe the trade-offs in supply chain when carbon quota is further considered. Numerical experiments will be conducted to examine the optimal solution to minimize the expected total cost.","[Tang, Shao-long] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Beijing Normal Univ, Business & Management Div, United Int Coll, Zhuhai, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jacqueline W.] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Sch Accounting & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University Zhuhai; Beijing Normal University - Hong Kong Baptist University United International College; Hong Kong Baptist University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Tang, SL (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Beijing Normal Univ, Business & Management Div, United Int Coll, Zhuhai, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",sltang@uic.edu.hk; afwwj@inet.polyu.edu.hk,,,,,,,24,2,2,0,9,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8640-0,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,1.0,,,,,,238,+,,,,,,2,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX00,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303173400051,0

A shared assumption underlying both expectations is that news media displacement, or substitution, is a function of the degree to which news media are functional equivalents. This article explores this assumption from a niche theoretical perspective, using survey data from 2 student samples as illustrative cases. Findings indicate that, for these students, news media substitution does not depend on functional equivalence of media in providing gratifications and gratification opportunities or types of content. Post hoc analyses suggest instead that, for this particular audience, media use depends on habit and media accessibility.

The importance of the subject arises from the much needed technological changes in the world, the interest for a united Europe by trials to realize European micro-globalization. Prior Work: The paper' author is going to explain the technologies relocation issue at global level not only regional or European one, in order to reveal the consequences from economic point of view and also the implication over industries and economies indicators (productivity, inflation). The starting point of the research is represented by Balassa-Samuelson model. It initially represents the mechanism to appreciate real exchange rate in catching-up process, due to the productivity non-linear evolution in international competing field than in protected field, associated with the convergence of EU periphery towards developed countries. Paper will be focused on: the market flexibility (i.e. financial integration, factor productivity mobility, or price and wages flexibility), the asymmetric shocks (production and consumer structure), the public authorities levers flexibility (i.e. fiscal integration, political integration), and the shocks similarities (possible to be measured due to the extant technologies). Design/Methodology/Approach: The author will use empirical study and stochastic version of Balassa-Samuelson model approach (also see Mihaljek & Klau, 2003) in order to capture the research evidence and to achieve the paper's objectives. The reason author considers the methods appropriate and reliable consists is the fact that it is impelled by international competition, modern capital and technologies infusion with much influence over price level (inflation rate).

This belief consists in the fact that economic convergence of the poorer countries towards the incumbents is of paramount importance for all industrial, economic, social, and political actors. In conclusion, the fears of adverse effects blenching from technologies transfers inside EU can be considered not well founded. Originality Value: Originality value is represented by the intent to demonstrate the relocation process can be considered a positive one both for old and new manufacturers.","[Vartolomei, M.] Politehn Univ Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania",Polytechnic University of Timisoara,,mihaelavartolomei@yahoo.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,10,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-2-3,,,,2011,,,,,,,221,224,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI18,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306939900056,0

Implementing TOM and its main components represents a dramatic challenge from those of traditional management. It requires a massive change in the social and technological components of a workforce. This study examines the relationships between corporate culture, TOM implementation and financial performance of Tunisian manufacturing firms. The model is tested using structural equations, surveying 70 Tunisian firms. The causal analysis results show no significant and direct effect of TOM implementation on Sales and operating income growth, but a negative and significant direct effect of TOM implementation on ROA and ROS. Furthermore, results show a positive and a significant relationship between corporate culture and the TOM implementation. This study also assessed the culture dimensions shared among Tunisian manufacturing firms and investigates their relationship with TOM practices. Successful adoption of TOM practices lies largely on a culture oriented innovation characterized by an openness to change, propensity to experiment and take risks and culture oriented people reflecting perceived support, cooperation, mutual respect and consideration between organizational members. The results suggested that there was no strong evidence to verify the moderator effect of the corporate culture on the relationship between TOM implementation and financial performance. The key managerial implications of these results are that firms shouldn't get disillusioned with TOM when short-term improvements did not materialize given that TOM implementation is an expensive immaterial investment and that many cultural traits affect the benefits of effective TOM implementations.","[Wali, Senda] Univ Sfax, Sfax Fac Econ & Management, Dept Accounting, Sfax 3013, Tunisia; [Boujelbene, Younes] Univ Sfax, Sfax Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Sfax 3013, Tunisia",Universite de Sfax; Universite de Sfax,"Wali, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sfax, Sfax Fac Econ & Management, Dept Accounting, Route Menzel Chaker Km 3-5, Sfax 3013, Tunisia.",wali_sonda@yahoo.fr; Younes.boujelbene@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,55,6,7,0,17,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Imbalances and searching for new fields. The aim of this article is to identify basic trends of the current configuration of global capitalism. The article starts characterizing three essential developments from the late 1970s until the recent crisis. First, undertaking far-reaching restructuring and attacks on wages, capital was able to significantly increase the profit rates after they had fallen in the early 1970s. Second, based on the increasing power of finance capital a global rentier regime emerged. Third, countries in Southeast Asia and China became important areas for investment and capital accumulation. After this analysis the article shows that despite the crisis the finance-dominated configuration of capitalism persists. Based on a massive state intervention this regime entered a process of transformation. Enforcing bank bailouts and transforming private into public debts the states play a crucial role in stabilizing the power of finance capital. Moreover, the global imbalances between net exporters and importers increase again. The paper concludes arguing that the rise of profitability depends on the extent to which it is possible to massively devaluate capital and to open up new regions and fields for a profitable valorization of capital. Thus, the creation of a constellation allowing a stable growth period is unlikely.","Salzburg Univ, Abt Humangeog Wirtschaftsgeog FB Geog & Geol, A-5020 Salzburg, Osterreich, Austria",Salzburg University,"Zeller, C (通讯作者)，Salzburg Univ, Abt Humangeog Wirtschaftsgeog FB Geog & Geol, Hellbrunnerstr 34, A-5020 Salzburg, Osterreich, Austria.",Christian.Zeller@sbg.ac.at,"Zeller, Christian/C-8281-2013",,,,,,95,7,7,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

Innovation capabilities of companies depend on a variety of factors, such as R&D expenditure, knowledge management processes, culture, organization structure, management systems etc. In search of new, innovative ideas and solutions the undertakings tend to co-operate more and more often also colleges, universities and other public research institutions, in which research is actually one of their basic missions. If once the purpose and the pinnacle of scientific research work of scientists, employed at the universities and research institutes, was publication of research results in scientific magazines and presentations at the conferences (result of basic research), today the results of research are conveyed through patents, trademarks and other forms of commercial application to a much greater extent. Consequently, the degree of innovation is tightly related to the co-relation between the universities and economy. This paper seeks to provide insights into researchers' motives to innovate. Although motivation has been investigated in many fields, there is not much to be found with regard to how to motivate the researchers at universities, research institutes and last but not least in the enterprises to research and to innovate. Hereby, we present the results of a research, which analysed what motivates and what hinders the Slovenian researchers, foremost those involved in patentable inventions, at their work. We asked the researchers which factors either as incentive or as obstacle influence most their scientific research work and in this regard the patent activity in different phases of research process. The picture of the factors (hindrances and motivators), collected through our research, could present a strong support in planning and forming the work of researchers at universities, research institutes and in enterprises. Based on the results obtained through the research we can conclude that the Slovenian universities and research institution have still a lot of work to do in the field of increase of efficiency of the scientific research activity. Considering the Herzberg motivation theory the factors, which especially encourage the researchers towards research work, should be integrated in the work environment as much as possible; those, taking their motivation away, should be eliminated or at least limited. The findings of the research will be of special importance to the management persons of universities, research institutes and enterprises, who are responsible for setting up an encouraging and motivational work environment with the aim to achieve higher innovation and more effective research.","[Zirnstein, Elizabeta] Univ Primorska, Fac Management, Koper, Slovenia",University of Primorska,,elizabeta.zirnstein@gmail.com,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,11,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,899,906,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800108,0

When the informed party is the injurer and acts first, the simple negligence rule is optimal, and under certain conditions, the first best standard of due care is optimal. The informed party will have an incentive to comply with the standard due to the discontinuity of the negligence rule, whereas the uninformed party may infer this and hence also take appropriate precautions. In general, the optimal policy for the court depends on who acts first and on who the injurer is. Thus, optimal rules are contributory negligence when the informed party is the victim and acts first, no liability when the uninformed party is the injurer and acts first, and strict liability without contributory negligence when the uninformed party is the victim and acts first.","Copenhagen Sch Econ & Business Adm, Inst Innovat & Org Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Lando, H (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Sch Econ & Business Adm, Inst Innovat & Org Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark.",hl.ino@cbs.dk,"Lando, Henrik/AGQ-5785-2022",,,,,,14,0,0,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

The question is whether a buyer of a stolen good should obtain title to the good if he/she has purchased it in good faith. As described in the article different jurisdictions treat this issue differently. The traditional theory suggests that there is a trade-off between the costs of protecting the good and the costs of verifying the ownership. However, as shown, the rule of law concerning this issue significantly affects parties' incentives. Specifically, it is shown that a rule of law where good faith is irrelevant in determining the issue of property rights Pareto dominates a rule where good faith may protect an innocent buyer. Thus, an owner of an asset will spend more resources on protecting his property and potential buyers will incur higher costs in order to verify the ownership when good faith is decisive for the transfer of property rights.","Copenhagen Sch Econ & Business Adm, Dept Int Econ & Management, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Rose, C (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Sch Econ & Business Adm, Dept Int Econ & Management, Porcelaenshaven 24, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",car.int@cbs.dk,,,,,,,12,2,2,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

The outcome of such evaluations-particularly in network industries conducive to competitive inroads and technological change-may involve ascertaining whether short-run sacrifices of static efficiency (allocative and technical) are justified by long-run gains in dynamic efficiency. This determination is complicated by the fact that short-run sacrifices are frequently known and measureable, whereas long-run gains are uncertain and less easily measured. Although a growing number of economists-generally relying on the writings of Joseph Schumpeter-conclude that dynamic efficiency is of substantially greater importance in such tradeoffs, in many cases the conclusion is not based on specific measurements of the tradeoffs encountered in particular policies. This article presents a review of the economic arguments favoring (or perhaps opposing) the primacy of dynamic efficiency. On the basis of this review, an analytical framework based on adapting models typically used to evaluate market structure and performance (for example, Cournot models) is developed. This framework can be used to evaluate the static/dynamic efficiency tradeoffs of competition and regulatory policies.",,,,ti.tardiff@gmail.com,,,,,,,15,1,1,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

In a model where an incumbent faces second-period competition by entrants, we show that AUD can indeed be abused to shift rents from entrants. In contrast to exclusive dealing which is usually seen as very similar to AUD, inefficient quantity distortions may arise even with perfect information if and only if there is sufficiently intense competition among potential entrants.","[Wohlschlegel, Ansgar] Univ Bonn, D-5300 Bonn, Germany; [Feess, Eberhard] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Frankfurt, Germany",University of Bonn; Frankfurt School Finance & Management,"Wohlschlegel, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, D-5300 Bonn, Germany.",e.feess@frankfurt-school.de; wohlschlegel@uni-bonn.de,,"Wohlschlegel, Ansgar/0000-0001-7620-2539",,,,,24,7,8,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

These findings provide support for one of the key predictions of the theory of contestable markets: that market forces under contestability would tend to render any inefficient organization of the industry unsustainable and, consequently, tighten the distribution of firms around the optimum.","[Kessides, Ioannis N.] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Tang, Li] Inter Amer Dev Bank, Washington, DC 20577 USA",The World Bank; Inter-American Development Bank,"Kessides, IN (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",ikessides@worldbank.org; ltang@iadb.org,,,,,,,51,2,3,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

It argues that economic imperatives alone cannot account for the national interest case for large-scale immigration that prevailed in 2004. It examines the rules of belonging deemed to pertain to citizens and immigrants within the key policy documents of Irish developmental modernisation and recent key policy documents which address immigration and integration. Similar developmental expectations have been presented as applying to Irish and immigrants alike. Irish human capital expanded in a context where ongoing emigration came to be presented in terms of agency, choice and individual reflexivity. It again expanded considerably due to immigration.

In an extensive empirical study, we compare the GCE approach to other models of VaR forecasting and conclude that it provides accurate and robust estimates of the realized VaR.

The objective of this paper is to analyse the role labour conflict plays in the persistence of macro underemployment in South Africa. For the analysis two models identified from the literature were used. In these models labour conflict originates from an over-regulated labour market where labour appropriates capital and bad or hostile labour relations. In both models the switch to technology leads to underemployment. It was found that bad labour relations contribute to the persistence of underemployment in South Africa.,"[Schoeman, C.

J,"Schwartz, A",,,,"Schwartz, Alan",,,Price Discrimination with Contract Terms: The Lost-Volume Problem,AMERICAN LAW AND ECONOMICS REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PROFITS PUZZLE; UNCONSCIONABILITY; INFORMATION; WARRANTIES; DAMAGES,"The lost-volume problem in contract law poses a problem of contract design. A seller with market power who faces buyers with private valuations for the subject of sale solves the problem with a combination of a required positive down payment and a later transaction price above cost. This combination maximizes the surplus the seller can capture from the buyers, but the contract is inefficient: the positive down payment cuts off contracting and a price above cost induces breach by buyers who value the product above its cost. The lost-volume question, then, is whether a court should enforce the inefficient contract the seller prefers or should instead impose one of two mandatory rules: permitting the seller to recover full lost-profit damages or no damages at all. These mandatory rules produce inefficiencies of their own. This paper's contribution is (a) to clarify the lost-volume problem; (b) to show that the three judicially implementable solutions cannot be Pareto-ranked abstractly: which outcome best turns on the distribution of buyer valuations in particular markets; (c) to show which value distributions likely would yield efficiency under each of the solutions; and (d) to argue, for second-order reasons, that courts should enforce the consensual contract rather than impose either mandatory rule.

The real data used in this study are daily GBP exchange rates and NYSE composite index. Empirical results from both simulation and real data reveal that, under a recursive forecasting scheme. SVM-GARCH models significantly outperform the competing models in most situations of one-period-ahead volatility forecasting, which confirms the theoretical advantage of SVM. The standard GARCH model also performs well in the case of normality and large sample size, while EGARCH model is good at forecasting volatility under the high skewed distribution. The sensitivity analysis to choose SVM parameters and cross-validation to determine the stopping point of the recurrent SVM procedure are also examined in this study.

Exit rates were greater, however, when a parent firm had substantial experience outside the product market of the current expansion.

First, ratings of abilities (such as the Elo rating) are complemented with a simulation approach which yields winning probabilities for the full tournament. Second, tournament winning probabilities are extracted from bookmakers' odds using a consensus model, and the underlying abilities of the competitors are then derived by an inverse application of the tournament simulation. Both techniques are employed for forecasting the results of the European football championship 2008 (UEFA EURO 2008), for which the consensus model based on bookmakers' odds outperforms methods based on both the Elo rating and the FIFA/Coca Cola World rating. Moreover, the bookmaker consensus model correctly predicts that the final will be played by the teams from Germany and Spain (with a probability of about 20.5%), while showing that both finalists profit from being drawn in groups with relatively weak competitors.

By studying a non-congested airport whose aeronautical charge is regulated, we find that revenue sharing allows the airport and airlines to internalise a positive demand externality between aeronautical services and concession services, which may improve welfare. However, revenue sharing may cause a negative effect on airline competition. An airport may strategically share the revenue with its dominant airlines, which can further strengthen these firms' market power. Such exclusive revenue sharing may or may not improve welfare.

The locally adaptive signal extraction and regression (LASER) model is designed to capture relatively persistent AR processes (signal) which are contaminated by high frequency noise. The distributions of the innovations in both noise and signal are modeled robustly using mixtures of normals. The mean of the process and the variances of the signal and noise are allowed to shift either suddenly or gradually at unknown locations and unknown numbers of times. The model is then capable of capturing movements in the mean and conditional variance of a series, as well as in the signal-to-noise ratio. Four versions of the model are estimated by Bayesian methods and used to forecast a total of nine quarterly macroeconomic series from the US, Sweden and Australia. We observe that allowing for infrequent and large parameter shifts while imposing normal and homoskedastic errors often leads to erratic forecasts, but that the model typically forecasts well if it is made more robust by allowing for non-normal errors and time varying variances. Our main finding is that, for the nine series we analyze, specifications with infrequent and large shifts in error variances outperform both fixed parameter specifications and smooth, continuous shifts when it comes to interval coverage.

Predictions for the non-core variables are obtained by applying their measurement equations to DSGE model-generated forecasts of the state variables.

Results of analysis of more than 24,000 consumer complaints filed with a local BBB office during a 13-year period do not provide consistent support for this disadvantaged consumer perspective. Instead, the emerging vulnerable consumer perspective may provide a more promising basis for future research.","[Garrett, Dennis E.; Toumanoff, Peter G.] Marquette Univ, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA",Marquette University,"Garrett, DE (通讯作者)，Marquette Univ, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA.",dennis.garrett@marquette.edu; peter.toumanoff@marquette.edu,,,,,,,61,23,27,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

This was done in order to highlight common and contrasting findings from a set of selected studies for different ELs. As many results of these studies were largely qualitative in nature and only partially comparable, a specific tool for analysing categorical data based on artificial intelligence methods, namely, rough set data analysis (RSDA), was employed. This experimental study is the first RSDA approach that compares the results of several rural case studies and infers general induction rules for the different ELs. The results of our analysis show that using and benefiting from local resources are the key factors that explain how entrepreneurs become embedded in rural areas.","[Akgun, Aliye Ahu; Baycan, Tuzin] Istanbul Tech Univ, Fac Architecture, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, TR-34437 Taskisla, Taksim, Turkey; [Nijkamp, Peter] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Spatial Econ, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Brons, Martijn] European Commiss, JRC IPTS, Seville 41092, Spain",Istanbul Technical University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; European Commission Joint Research Centre,"Akgün, AA (通讯作者)，Istanbul Tech Univ, Fac Architecture, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, TR-34437 Taskisla, Taksim, Turkey.",gulumser@itu.edu.tr; pnijkamp@feweb.vu.nl; tuzin.baycanlevent@itu.edu.tr; martijn.brons@ec.europa.eu,"(Gülümser) Akgün, Aliye Ahu/O-1021-2013","(Gülümser) Akgün, Aliye Ahu/0000-0001-9722-5131; Nijkamp, Peter/0000-0002-4068-8132",,,,,65,31,34,0,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

This study also examines the characteristics of conditional volatility in the Baltic Stock Markets (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) by using a broad range of GARCH volatility models. Correctly forecasting the volatility leads to better understanding and managing financial market risk. Daily returns from four Baltic stock indexes are used; Estonia (TALSE index), Latvia (RIGSE index), Lithuania (VILSE index) and synthetic BALTIC benchmark index. We test a large family of GARCH models, including; the basic GARCH model, GARCH-in-mean model, asymmetric exponential GARCH and GJR GARCH, power GARCH and component GARCH model. We find strong evidence that daily returns from Baltic Stock Markets can be successfully modelled by GARCH-type models. For all Baltic markets, we conclude that increased risk will not necessarily lead to a rise in the returns. All of the analysed indexes exhibit complex time series characteristics involving asymmetry, long tails and complex autoregression in the returns. Results from this study are firmly recommended to financial officers and international investors.","[Aktan, Bora] Yasar Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Finance, TR-35100 Izmir, Turkey; [Korsakiene, Renata; Smaliukiene, Rasa] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Yasar University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Aktan, B (通讯作者)，Yasar Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Finance, Selcuk Yasar Campus, TR-35100 Izmir, Turkey.",bora.aktan@yasar.edu.tr; renatakorsa@takas.lt; rasa.smaliukiene@vgtu.lt,"Korsakiene, Renata/E-8598-2017; Smaliukiene, Rasa/L-3577-2019; Aktan, Bora/S-6019-2017","Korsakiene, Renata/0000-0002-4119-4521; Smaliukiene, Rasa/0000-0002-5240-2429; Aktan, Bora/0000-0002-1334-3542",,,,,40,27,27,0,13,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

On the other hand, the research was connected with the analysis of the bureaucratic logic of decision-making process, characterized by non-functional stability, inflexibility, individualism, power, authority and hierarchy, centralization, vagueness, fragmentariness. The objective of the research was to analyse to what extent manager's decision-making is based on bureaucratic tools or organizational learning in either complex problem-solving or non-problem-solving decision-making. (MANOVA, method of the repeated measure, inter-subject factor - situation: 1. non-problematic, 2. problematic). The conclusion of analysis is that there are significant differences in character of solving of problem situation and non-problem situation decision-making: the bureaucratic attributes of decision-making are more intensive in problematic situations while learning approach is more actual in non-problematic situations. The results of our analysis have shown that managers who apply the learning organization attributes in their decision-making. are more successful in problem-solving.","[Bolfikova, Eva] Univ Pavol Jozef Safarik, Fac Publ Adm, Dept Social Studies, Kosice 04132, Slovakia; [Hrehova, Daniela] Tech Univ Kosice, Dept Social Sci, Kosice 04001, Slovakia; [Frenova, Jana] Univ Presov, Fac Management, Presov 08001, Slovakia",University of Pavol Jozef Safarik Kosice; Technical University Kosice; University of Presov,"Bolfíková, E (通讯作者)，Univ Pavol Jozef Safarik, Fac Publ Adm, Dept Social Studies, Popradska 66, Kosice 04132, Slovakia.",eva.bolfikova@upjs.sk; daniela.hrehova@tuke.sk; frenovajana@centrum.sk,"Hrehová, Daniela/ABA-9146-2021",,,,,,77,6,9,1,20,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Efficient functioning of the public mass transportation supported from the public sources in the towns is more urgent at present, when the individual automobile traffic leads to congestions in central parts of the cities. The demand to increase the culture of travelling in the public mass transportation requires, however, substantial costs. Therefore it is necessary to solve the balance between the inhabitants' requirements and the economy of the transportation system. The operation of the public mass transportation must be rational; the vehicles must not show unreasonable waiting times, etc. One of the possible ways how to rationalise the public mass transportation is to minimise the number of vehicles in operation complying with the requirements of the travellers. The paper deals with the problem of minimising the number of vehicles needed to operate the lines of the public mass transportation network. To solve this problem the methods of linear programming are used. There are four mathematical models described in which the vehicles are assigned to the individual lines. The models arise from the mathematical model PRIVOL [4], and they vary from this model especially by the variety of the rolling-stock the transport company has at disposal. By means of the constructed models a number of numerical experiments concerning the network corresponding to a medium-sized town were performed using the four constructed models. These numerical experiments demonstrated the functionality of the designed models. The main contribution of the presented modifications of the original model PRIVOL consists in the fact, that instead of the optimal number of seats the new models are able to directly find an optimal number of vehicles needed to operate the particular lines to meet the expected demand of the passengers. That way the proposed approach allows to objectify the decision making of the transport company concerning the allocation of vehicles to the network lines.","[Danek, Jan; Teichmann, Dusan] Tech Univ Ostrava, Inst Transport, Ostrava, Czech Republic; [Plevny, Miroslav] Univ W Bohemia, Fac Econ, Plzen, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava; University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Danek, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Ostrava, Inst Transport, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",jan.danek@vsb.cz; plevny@kso.zcu.cz; dusan.teichmann@vsb.cz,"Plevny, Miroslav/J-9489-2015","Plevny, Miroslav/0000-0003-4774-0877; Teichmann, Dusan/0000-0002-8790-8796",,,,,10,8,8,0,7,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Data for the study were collected from a sample of 620 full-time frontline hotel employees in Turkey. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was employed in analyzing the data. The results show that work-family conflict fully mediates the impacts of work overload on exhaustion and disengagement. Also positive affectivity reduces the effect of work-family conflict on disengagement. Implications of the empirical results and directions for future research are delineated in the study. In this study we develop a model and test eight hypotheses that are based on the precepts of the Conservation of Resources (COR) theory [16]. We contend that work overload is a predictor of work-family conflict which influences the two dimensions of burnout (exhaustion and disengagement). In other words, our model proposes that work-family conflict acts as a full mediator between work overload and the burnout dimensions. In the remainder of the paper, we present our hypotheses.

Moreover, the relationship between high frequency financial market data has been a common research topic for world economies. However, there is hardly any study that attempts to search for the possible functional relationship between consumer confidence and financial market variables. This paper is a simple attempt to link these two brands of literature by focusing on the relationship between financial market variables and consumer confidence index before the global crisis has started. We have two distinctive points. First, we derive separate consumer confidence indices for men and women by employing micro-level consumer confidence data from an emerging market (Turkish CNBC-e consumer confidence index) for the period of January 2003 - January 2008. Second, employing this data set, we do not only check for the existence of a relationship between consumer confidence and financial market variables (such as interest rates, exchange rates and stock exchange index) but also focus on the possibility of gender response. We find evidence of gender response difference as throughout the period women are more pessimistic than men-due probably to lower levels of wealth-and respond less to changes in exchange rates than men-due probably to lower purchasing power.","[Kucukaslan, Ash] Marmara Univ, FEAS, Dept Business Adm, TR-34722 Istanbul, Turkey; [Celik, Sadullah] Marmara Univ, FEAS, Dept Econ, TR-34722 Istanbul, Turkey",Marmara University; Marmara University,"Küçükaslan, A (通讯作者)，Marmara Univ, FEAS, Dept Business Adm, Goztepe Campus, TR-34722 Istanbul, Turkey.",aekmekci@marmara.edu.tr; scelik@marmara.edu.tr,"Çelik, Sadullah/B-2435-2018","Çelik, Sadullah/0000-0003-4124-3589",,,,,49,3,4,1,25,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Restructuring of the logistics chain. Standardized containers which are designed to meet the particular needs of different goods turn heterogeneous cargo into homogeneous unit loads which can easily be moved and stacked. Thus for transport handling containers provide opportunities for automation and economies of scale. In the past the transport chain from sender to recipient has been characterized by a sequence of single-transit shipments with interim storage. Nowadays goods shipped in containers can be reloaded to different means of transportation and are transported to their destination under a single through-rate in less time. Planning and control of intermodal transport can be done door-to-door in an integrated full-service approach. The transformation from manual to industrialized transport handling provides opportunities for staff savings, however, it requires considerable investments in different vehicles, containers, equipment and software for operations. Customers benefit from efficiency gains in form of lower shipment prices. This article analyzes the impact of containerisation on liner shipping, harbours and transport in the hinterland as the key elements of the maritime logistics chain. The discussion outlines the topic in the context of globalisation and changing contours of the global economic map.","Univ Marburg, Fachbereich Geog, D-35032 Marburg, Germany",Philipps University Marburg,"Nuhn, H (通讯作者)，Univ Marburg, Fachbereich Geog, Deutschhausstr 10, D-35032 Marburg, Germany.",nuhn@mailer.uni-marburg.de,,,,,,,50,0,0,1,23,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

Firstly, government, media and enterprises should work together to promote low-carbon concept. Secondly, a protective system for low-carbon agricultural marketing has to be established by institutional innovation.

Close attention is paid to questions of spatial organization of creative industries as well as possibilities of its stimulation in the interest of strengthening the competitive position of individual areas. A little less attention is usually paid to the role and spatial organization of the creative industries in diverse geographical conditions, such as old industrial or rural regions. Old industrial areas represent a specific type of problem regions and there are questions of how the creative industries can contribute to regeneration of old industrial regions. The principal focus of this paper is mainly on factors and processes influencing the spatial organization, or respectively the concentration of creative industries in the framework of Moravian Silesian Region as an old industrial region. The Moravian-Silesian Region represents a classical old industrial region of peripheral character, in particular in relation to western markets. The traditional sectors are among the most struck sectors in the region, which can in the future increase the demand for new ones, such as e.g. creative industries. Attention is further paid, on one hand, to internal structural characteristics of creative industries in the comparative perspective, and on the other hand to explanation of evolution in this sector in the region of interest.

The asymmetric EGARCH-M model is used for this examination. It is found that the real estate returns in Taiwan, including Taipei City and Taichung City, are unable to hedge unexpected inflation while the estimated returns in Taipei County and Kaohsiung City can hedge unexpected inflation partially. Besides Taipei County and Kaohsiung City, the asymmetric leverage effect of real estate return risks is found in other regions too. So, from the viewpoint of hedging unexpected inflation, the metropolitan areas, which suffer less shock from bad news than from good news, can partially hedge unexpected inflation. On the other hand the forward forecasting test found that during the Asian financial crisis in 1997, there was a structural change in real estate return risks in Taiwan.","Overseas Chinese Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung 40271, Taiwan",,"Wang, KM (通讯作者)，Overseas Chinese Univ, Dept Finance, 100 Chiao Kwang Rd, Taichung 40271, Taiwan.",wkminn@ocu.edu.tw,"Wang, Kuan Min/H-5247-2019","Wang, Kuan Min/0000-0002-0237-0596",,,,,29,1,1,0,9,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Four standard credit scoring techniques-naive Bayes, logistic regression, recursive partitioning and artificial neural network-are compared to SMO, using a sample of 195 healthy firms and 51 distressed firms over five time periods between 1994 and 2002. The five techniques perform well in predicting default particularly one year before financial distress. Furthermore, the prediction still remains Sound even 5 years before default. No single methodology has the absolute best classification ability, as the model performance varies in terms of different time periods and variable groups. External influences have greater impacts on the naive Bayes than other techniques. In terms of similarity with Moody's ranking, SMO excelled over other techniques in most of the time periods.

We take a step forward and consider contest on the talent market as well. Each team takes into account the fact that the price to be paid recruiting talent is a function that depends on both its own demand and the demands from the rival teams. For the two-team model, we show that the removal of the assumption that teams are price takers implies that the invariance proposition only survives if the price-function for talent is linear increasing. The extension to the n-team model shows that this result no longer holds; in fact, revenue sharing improves the competitive balance. More generally, an improvement in competitive balance is the most likely if one rules out the possibility of a very convex price-function. In addition revenue sharing can reduce the economic inefficiency of teams' behavior, and so profits may increase.","Toulouse Sch Econ LERNA, F-31000 Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Cavagnac, M (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ LERNA, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France.",Michel.Cavagnac@univ-tlse1.fr,,,,,,,17,1,2,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

The purpose of this short paper is to show that Professor Hudson's long article fails to do what it seems intended to do.

In order to understand how the current crisis arose, we must review the most fundamental principles of banking. Doing that, we find that the main service performed by banks is the creation of liquidity, a collective good that can be destroyed by the behavior of individual financial institutions. The key element in creating liquidity is the monetization of various types of collateral. When collateral takes the form of land or capital that turns over slowly, banks lose liquidity. That is why major banking crises have frequently been associated with real estate lending.

Today, with the development that the social sciences have achieved, special recognition and thematic treatment have been granted to the phenomenon of illness and to the impact that research has on the health component for the process of social development, manifesting the broad spectrum of possibilities for study, which includes the entire set of components that interrelate to explain the dynamic of the aforementioned binomial. Conclusions are that today, the cultural diversity that characterizes humanity enriches this thematic object, since each culture interprets and assimilates health-illness in a different manner, thereby realizing different manifestations and approaches to interpret and become aware of this reality.","Univ Zulia, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela",,"Lugo, JEP (通讯作者)，Univ Zulia, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela.",jepeluz@hotmail.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

However, we find at the same time that the educational attainment of inventors has grown more rapidly than that of entrepreneurs and the educational gap has tended to widen over time.","[Baumol, William J.; Schilling, Melissa A.] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Wolff, Edward N.] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA",New York University; New York University,"Baumol, WJ (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, 40 W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA.",wbaumol@stern.nyu.edu; mschilli@stern.nyu.edu; ew1@nyu.edu,"Schilling, Melissa A/A-2385-2008; Schilling, Melissa/HNQ-0845-2023",,,,,,41,37,45,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Impact is measured as citations from the publications of permanent staff in eight Irish politics departments, based on data compiled in April 2008 from two leading academic indexes - ISI's Web of Science and Scopus - as well as the now popular Google Scholar. We discuss some of the criticisms that naturally arise in a study of this nature. Then, following similar exercises in other disciplines (e. g. economics), we use the impact measures to compare and rank individual scholars as well as departments. We also explore the extent to which the choice of different indexes, and different measures, influences the results that we obtain. While there are differences, in particular between indexes based purely on articles and those that access books and other material, the results from the different indexes are strongly correlated.","[Benoit, Kenneth; Marsh, Michael] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Benoit, K (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Polit Sci, Dublin, Ireland.",,"Benoit, Kenneth/J-8562-2014","Benoit, Kenneth/0000-0002-0797-564X",,,,,20,7,7,0,9,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

We find that the high underpricing in these two markets - contrary to the evidence on the US - is not driven by insiders' selling behaviour. However, the large Underpricing is caused by the high degree of riskiness of the issuing firms and by the partial adjustment phenomenon of offer prices to compensate institutional investors for the truthful revelation of their demand for the shares. For France, lock-up agreements act as substitutes to underpricing, but not so for Germany. We also explore the reasons for the large difference in underpricing between the German and the French IPOs: German firms are more underpriced because they are riskier, have larger price revisions, have less stringent VC lock-up contracts, and go public mostly during the hot issue period when the general level of underpricing in all IPO markets is substantially higher.

We further divide the sample based on bankruptcy (agency) costs, earnings components and growth opportunities of a firm to explore how these factors affect the returns-residual income link. We find that the relative predictive ability for contemporaneous price by considering other earnings and non-earnings information is better than that of models without non-earnings information. If the bankruptcy (agency) cost of a firm is higher, its information role in the firm's equity valuation becomes more important and the accuracy of price prediction is therefore higher. As for non-earnings information, if bankruptcy (agency) cost is lower. the information role becomes more relevant, and the earnings response coefficient is hence higher. Moreover, the decomposition of unexpected residual income into permanent and transitory components induces more information than that of the Unexpected residual income alone. The permanent component has a larger impact than the transitory component in explaining abnormal returns. The market and industry properties and growth opportunity also have incremental explanatory power in valuation.

Our results show strong evidence that related variety contributes to regional economic growth. Thus, Italian regions that are well endowed with sectors that are complementary in terms of competences (i.e., that show related variety) perform better. The article also assesses the effects of the breadth and relatedness of international trade linkages on regional growth, since they may bring new and related variety to a region. Our analysis demonstrates that regional growth is not affected by simply being well connected to the outside world or having a high variety of knowledge flowing into the region. Rather, we found evidence of related extraregional knowledge sparking intersectoral learning across regions. When the cognitive proximity between the extraregional knowledge and the knowledge base of a region is neither too small nor too large, real learning opportunities are present, and the external knowledge contributes to growth in regional employment.","[Boschma, Ron] Univ Utrecht, Dept Econ Geog, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Iammarino, Simona] Univ Sussex, Freeman Ctr, SPRU, Brighton BN1 9QE, E Sussex, England",Utrecht University; University of Sussex,"Boschma, R (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Dept Econ Geog, POB 80 115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",r.boschma@geo.uu.nl; s.iammarino@sussex.ac.uk,,"Iammarino, Simona/0000-0001-9450-1700",,,,,90,565,642,7,247,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

We correct for the discrepancy between potential and actual work experience and create a predicted measure of work experience. We use the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and extend our findings to the Integrated Public Use Microdata Sample. Our results suggest that potential experience biases the effects of schooling and the rates of return to labor market experience. Using such a measure in earnings models underestimates the explained portion of the male-female wage gap.

Adopting incentive pay is associated with about 30-40 percent more income per license. Universities with strong local development objectives generate about 30 percent less income per license but are more likely to license to local (in-state) start- up companies. In addition, we show that government constraints on university licensing activity are costly in terms of forgone license income and the creation of start-up companies.

Empirically the paper studies the emergence and development of new firms derived in various forms from a downsizing lead pharmaceutical firm (Pharmacia). A model is developed conceptualizing RCC of regions by the levels of business creation obtained at different levels of asset complexity for given levels of decomposition of available resources. RCC of Pharmacia's home region (Stockholm-Uppsala) is characterized by mapping all 75 new firms derived from Pharmacia onto the RCC space, revealing low RCC particularly for resources released from Pharmacia in highly decomposed form. Recombinations whereby managers from Pharmacia and other related incumbents become founders of new bio drug discovery firms (DDFs) come out as particularly scarce when benchmarked against the simultaneous emergence of a DDF sector in the otherwise comparable Copenhagen region. Venture capital is argued to be a key mechanism in RCC affecting high-tech entrepreneurship. We test and confirm that compared to their Copenhagen counterpart, DDFs in the Stockholm-Uppsala region received much less early stage venture financing which therefore provided notable disincentives for re-combinatorial manager-to-founder transitions.","[Dahlgren, Henrich; Valentin, Finn] Copenhagen Sch Econ & Business Adm, Res Ctr Biotech Business, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Valentin, F (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Sch Econ & Business Adm, Res Ctr Biotech Business, Kilevej 14A 3, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",fv.ino@cbs.dk,,,,,,,53,3,3,1,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

The most common approach to forecasting demand in these companies involves the use of a computerized forecasting system to produce initial forecasts and the subsequent judgmental adjustment of these forecasts by the company's demand planners, ostensibly to take into account exceptional circumstances expected over the planning horizon. Making these adjustments can involve considerable management effort and time, but do they improve accuracy, and are some types of adjustment more effective than others? To investigate this, we collected data on more than 60,000 forecasts and outcomes from four supply-chain companies. In three of the companies, on average, judgmental adjustments increased accuracy. However, a detailed analysis revealed that, while the relatively larger adjustments tended to lead to greater average improvements in accuracy, the smaller adjustments often damaged accuracy. In addition, positive adjustments, which involved adjusting the forecast upwards, were much less likely to improve accuracy than negative adjustments. They were also made in the wrong direction more frequently, suggesting a general bias towards optimism. Models were then developed to eradicate such biases. Based on both this statistical analysis and organisational observation, the paper goes on to analyse strategies designed to enhance the effectiveness of judgmental adjustments directly.

This paper examines the casual relationship, using Granger test, between gross domestic products (GDP) and total primary energy consumption in Croatia. Analyzed period is from 1953 to 2005. In the paper vector auto-regression model (VAR), Granger causality test and unit root test are used as tools for analysis. Economic and energetic time series usually have the problem of non stationarity series. Non-stationary time series are trying stationarity with differentiation of variables, using co-integration technique. Applying Granger's causality test in Croatian case, we found that GDP Granger causes total energy consumption not energy consumption Granger causes GDP. The result shows that relationship for Croatia runs from total primary energy consumptions to gross domestic products, not from gross domestic products to primary energy consumption. Conclusion of VAR model is that variable total primary energy consumptions and the constant are not significant in the model and that variable gross domestic products is significant.

The analysis of English and Scottish football business systems has shown that the football business micro-environments in both countries are analogical in structure; however, it does not guarantee the same flows of income and expenditures. In both England and Scotland the maximizing of income generation efficiency is realized through three subsystems of FBS, which play different roles: (1) the main (top) league exclusively oriented to commerce, (2) second league, which is in the intermediary position between the commercially-based top league and public interest- oriented lower leagues, (3) football association whose primary task is the administration and development of the sports activities. The analysis of the developing football business system of Lithuania has led to the following findings: (1) in Lithuania, the second football league has no financial independence which is typical for the English and Scottish second leagues, and this is the reason why there are only two income accumulation subjects in the Lithuanian football business; (2) in Lithuania, the largest share of income in FBS is generated by the main managing organization what weakens the commercial interests of the entire system; (3) Lithuanian FBS is more dependent on the support of private sponsors what makes football business more risky; (4) the Lithuanian FBS faces the problem of insufficient investment into football infrastructure what leads to disproportions in income sources.","[Karpavicius, Tomas] Kaunas Univ Technol, Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,,t.karpavicius@futbolas.lt; giedrius.jucevicius@ktu.lt,"Jucevicius, Giedrius/HPI-3903-2023",,,,,,22,0,0,2,16,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,KAUNAS,"K DONELAICIO 73, KAUNAS LT 3006, LITHUANIA",1822-7090,,,CHANGE SOC BUS ENV,,,2009,,,,,,,209,216,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTW62,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288290300030,0

New procedures have recently started to be used for measurements of relative effectiveness of production units. Procedure file of the procedures, methods and algorithms is called in general Data Envelopment Analysis DEA. It is about methods which represent a particular field of application on linear programming. DEA is a method of linear programming which was originally developed for regarding of effectiveness of driving and planning of non - profitable institutions (e.g. schools, hospitals, etc), Afterwards its application spread to some economical fields as well, where there is measured effectiveness of different enterprises or organization units by means of DEA. Presented contribution is dealing with quantification of effectiveness of road transportation companies by means of DEA and monitoring of effectiveness of companies in time by means of Malmqist index. It is divided into 2 sections. In the first section you will find description of basic DEA models and the second is devoted to Malmquist index. Malmquist index is one of the quantitative implements of evaluating the effectiveness, which attempts a model description of influence of technology modifications and their separation from other sources of increasing eventually decreasing of effectiveness of companies. It enables its separation into two components during evaluation of amendments in time - amendment of relative effectiveness against set of other units (road transportation companies) and amendments of borders of production possibilities evoked by new technologies.","Zilinska Univ, Fak Prevadzky Ekon, Katedra Ekon, Zilina 01026, Czech Republic",,"Kliestik, T (通讯作者)，Zilinska Univ, Fak Prevadzky Ekon, Katedra Ekon, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Czech Republic.",tomas.kliestik@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Kliestik, Tomas/O-8070-2015","Kliestik, Tomas/0000-0002-3815-5409",,,,,13,39,39,0,9,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The sample consisted of 481 undergraduate students studying physics, IT and mechanics at five Lithuanian universities. Statistical analysis and qualitative content analysis were used in this study. The results allow to state that the professional motivation of the female students would be stimulated by such factors as effectively organized studies, followed by principles of gender mainstreaming, participation in the students' exchange programs, positive changes in the lecturers' attitudes towards young women studying technological and physical sciences, examples of good female practice in the studies/while studying, and optimised system of professional orientation in the secondary schools.","Vilnius State Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Dept Philosophy & Cultural Studies, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Urboniene, A (通讯作者)，Vilnius State Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Dept Philosophy & Cultural Studies, Muitines G8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",aiste.urboniene@vukhf.lt,,,,,,,31,5,5,1,15,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

By contrast in code-based legal systems, the principle of duty to rescue does apply. What is behind this difference? To answer this question, we develop a new model extending the reach and strength of the standard civic duty game by taking into account the cost of wrongful intervention. We use this model to analyze and compare three policy options: doing nothing, adopting a duty-to-rescue rule, and encouraging would-be rescuers. We show that a duty-to-rescue rule is more likely to be welfare enhancing when the cost of inappropriately intervening is low, and that, in certain cases, encouraging would-be rescuers is preferred by a representative citizen to both a duty-to-rescue rule and no-rule. Finally, we offer an explanation for the choices made in the USA and France as to whether to use rescue laws. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

A series of complications arise when applying this principle in practice. These are discussed in the paper.

In economics, decisions are often based on forecasts of the upward or downward movements of the variable of interest. We point out that directional forecasts can provide a useful framework for assessing the economic forecast value when loss functions (or success measures) are properly formulated to account for the realized signs and realized magnitudes of directional movements. We discuss a general approach to (directional) forecast evaluation which is based on the loss function proposed by Granger, Pesaran and Skouras. It is simple to implement and provides an economically interpretable loss/success functional framework. We show that, in addition, this loss function is more robust to outlying forecasts than traditional loss functions. As such, the measure of the directional forecast value is a readily available complement to the commonly used squared error loss criterion. (C) 2011 International Institute of Forecasters.

Evidence from the Market for Lawyers,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; ECONOMICS; POLITICS; FACULTY,"The comparative performance of academic and economic markets continues to be debated. One factor potentially distinguishing academic markets is the profit motive. Profit and competition have been shown to curb discrimination in markets, and the absence of profit discipline could result in myriad forms of prejudice in academic hiring. We explore the role of the profit motive in the performance of academic markets by comparing the pedigree of employees of top law schools and top law firms. Top law schools are much more likely to employ graduates of top ranked law schools than elite law firms, and the difference exists at both the junior and senior levels. We find no evidence that the graduates of top 5 law schools outperform grads of less prestigious schools in publications or citations. In the absence of a profit motive, academic hiring appears more likely to indulge a preference for pedigree, and by implication, this may explain other scholarly prejudices in the academy.","[Pjesky, Rex J.] W Texas A&M Univ, Dept Accounting Econ & Finance, Canyon, TX 79016 USA; [Sutter, Daniel] Troy Univ, Sorrell Coll Business, Johnson Ctr Polit Econ, Troy, AL 36082 USA",Texas A&M University System; West Texas A&M University; Troy University System; Troy University,"Pjesky, RJ (通讯作者)，W Texas A&M Univ, Dept Accounting Econ & Finance, Canyon, TX 79016 USA.",rpjesky@mail.wtamu.edu; dan@danielsutter.com,,,,,,,28,3,3,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Because exchange-listed Japanese firms (unlike exchange-listed U.S. firms) need not disclose executive compensation figures in their securities filings, most studies on Japan lack even good data on pay. Through 2004, however, the Japanese tax office disclosed the tax liabilities of the 73,000 Japanese with the highest incomes. We obtained this data, and match the high-tax list against the list of CEOs of the firms listed in Section 1 of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. We thus estimate salaries and risk exposure in a new way. We confirm survey and anecdotal evidence that Japanese executives earn less than American-about one-fifth the pay, adjusting for firm size and outside income. Tobit regressions show that pay in Japan depends heavily on firm size (a .22 elasticity) and on accounting profitability, but not on stock returns. Additionally, family owned firms and those with large lead shareholders pay less to employee CEOs not in the family or with large shareholdings, as do firms whose directors have less tenure on the board.","[Nakazato, Minoru] Univ Tokyo, Dept Law Taxat & Law & Econ, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Ramseyer, J.

Furthermore, whereas voluntary compliance seems to be positively related to age and education, enforced compliance is negatively related to education.","[Muehlbacher, Stephan; Kirchler, Erich; Schwarzenberger, Herbert] Univ Vienna, Fac Psychol, A-1010 Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Muehlbacher, S (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Fac Psychol, Univ Str 7, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",stephan.muehlbacher@univie.ac.at; erich.kirchler@univie.ac.at,"; Kirchler, Erich/K-7985-2013","Muehlbacher, Stephan/0000-0002-3665-4976; Kirchler, Erich/0000-0003-4731-1650",,,,,32,108,119,1,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Based on a multidisciplinary comparative study conducted in six French regions, this paper aims to analyze the ways in which regional rail policies are constructed by examining, in particular, the way they are generated as a result of interactions between different institutional actors. These interactions are linked to tensions in three main areas: the financing of transport investments, the financing and nature of rail services and regional governance. We examine these tensions by referring to three configurations of actors: the first includes the Regions and the State, the second, the Regions and the rail actors, and the third, the Regions and other local authorities. Finally, we discuss our findings, emphasizing what they teach us about the regionalization process in France. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, transport prices in the high-demand direction have to exceed those in the low-demand direction. This implies that transport costs, and therefore trade costs, are fundamentally endogenous with respect to trade imbalances. We study the effect of an imbalance in trade flows on transport prices using micro-data on trips made by carriers in the inland waterway network in North West Europe. We find that imbalances in trade flows have substantial effects on transport prices. We estimate that a one standard deviation increase in the region's trade imbalance (the ratio of export and import cargo flows) increases the transport price per tonne of trips departing from this region by about 7%.","[Jonkeren, Olaf; Demirel, Erhan; van Ommeren, Jos; Rietveld, Piet] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Ommeren, Jos; Rietveld, Piet] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Jonkeren, O (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",ojonkeren@feweb.vu.nl,,"Van Ommeren, Jos/0000-0003-4838-478X",,,,,31,26,35,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Using a structural model of the interactions between firms, financial institutions, governments and courts we show, through numerical simulations, the distortions in liability sharing between firms and financiers that the imperfect implementation of government policies implies. We consider in particular the role played by the efficiency of the courts in jointly avoiding Type I (finding an innocent firm guilty of inappropriate care) and Type II (finding a guilty firm not guilty of inappropriate care) errors. This role is considered in a context where liability sharing is already distorted (when compared with first best values) due not only to the courts' own imperfect assessment of safety care levels exerted by firms but also to the presence of moral hazard and adverse selection in financial contracting. There is also not congruence of objectives between firms and financiers on the one hand and social welfare maximization on the other. Our results indicate that an increase in the efficiency of court system in avoiding errors raises safety care level, thereby reducing the probability of accident, and allowing the social welfare maximizing government to impose a lower liability [higher] share for firms [financiers] as well as a lower standard level of care.

The research sample is composed of 156 Dutch enterprises from various industries. Empirical evidence shows that reduction of labor costs, improved competitiveness, strategic decisions taken by the group head and reduction in other costs are the main motivations for Dutch firms to engage in international outsourcing. Tax and regulatory advantages seem to play a lesser role. The motivations can be grouped into three distinct factors: access to cheaper resources and increasing competition, access to scarce and distinctive resources and reduction of other production costs. The most important impediments turn out to be problems with distance to producers, the need for proximity to existing clients, concerns about the outsourcing operation exceeding expected benefits and linguistic/cultural barriers. Violation of patents/intellectual property rights and uncertainty of international standards are not viewed as important issues. The impediments are captured by three different dimensions as indicated by the data: legal and governmental obstacles, human concerns and logistical difficulties.","Bilkent Univ, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey",Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Ok, ST (通讯作者)，Bilkent Univ, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",tulug@bilkent.edu.tr,,,,,,,30,15,20,2,24,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Two crucial challenges thereby are the development of a common system understanding among the multiple stakeholders with potentially conflicting interests and the structured definition of comprehensive assessment criteria. Defining the functions of the system railway station, i.e. discussing what the system should do, can support solving these challenges. Based on a review of Swiss railway stations in a transdisciplinary research project applying four focus groups (n=38), 28 expert interviews and two expert workshops, we present a structured framework of five generic functions of railway stations and their interdependencies. The five generic functions are: linking catchment area and transport network, supporting transfer between modes of transport, facilitating commercial use of real estate, providing public space, and contributing to the identity of the surrounding area. Potential conflicts between functions are identified. They concern the competition of multiple functions for space, for customer attention or for revenues as well as increasing system complexities with station size. We illustrate how the framework of functions can be used to foster a common system understanding and to develop assessment criteria. Although elaborated from a Swiss perspective the framework is perceived adaptable to railway stations of other countries. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, the perspective is research based professionalization of facilitating innovation within employee driven innovation, user driven innovation, clustering, etc. The approach is based on a model -Dialogic Helicopter Team Meetings - developed in an action research project on EDIT.

Because of these negative associations, policies in Western European countries are often aimed at breaking up these poverty concentrations by mixing the population composition through changing the housing stock. However, whether these policies are successful remains to be seen. We asked residents of urban restructuring areas in six Dutch cities about the consequences of mixing policies. The number of residents who perceive improvements in the neighbourhood in the past few years is substantially outnumbered by the residents who report a decline in neighbourhood quality. However, many residents have high hopes for their neighbourhood's future. This finding indicates that social mixing policies have not matched the policy-makers' expectations yet - but may do so in the course of time.","[Bolt, Gideon; Van Kempen, Ronald] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht URU, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Bolt, G (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht URU, POB 80-115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",G.Bolt@geo.uu.nl; R.vanKempen@geo.uu.nl,,,,,,,31,14,15,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Under split-rate property taxation, land is typically taxed at a significantly higher rate than improvements. Beginning in 1965 Hawaii experimented with a statewide split-rate property tax system to encourage economic growth and effect land reform. The experiment was ended in 1977. Following the transfer of property taxing powers to the counties in 1978, some counties brought back the split-rate property tax at times. Since 2006, Kauai County has adopted the unusual practice of taxing improvements at a higher rate than land for most property classes. This article chronicles and explains the rationale behind Hawaii's state and county experiments with split-rate property taxation.","[Kwak, Sally; Mak, James] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Kwak, S (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, 2424 Maile Way,Rm 542, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",kwaks@hawaii.edu; jmak@hawaii.edu,,,,,,,41,3,3,2,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Are they a real enrichment to the Chinese industrial sector? Within a single country - China- we can distinguish two different populations of biotech enterprises: one set up and led by returnees (the majority of whom have been to the USA), the other by mainland Chinese entrepreneurs. Returnees are defined as migrant entrepreneurs who have left their country of origin for a certain period to then return to it. They have been exposed to an occidental culture (mainly North American and European) and have benefited from an enrichment of their human capital by means of research visits or research fellowships at the best universities worldwide. In our study we compare the technological and product positioning of the two populations of enterprises. We distinguish between the enterprises positioned in mature market segments (who exploit already existing commercial opportunities) and those positioned in emerging market segments, which explore new opportunities. For the present paper we collected data on the Chinese biotech sector. We studied 19 returnees' societies and 23 mainland Chinese societies. Based on this sample, we test the influence of the head manager status (returnee/ or not) on the intensity of their companies' innovative behaviour. The results show that the firms managed by returnees are more strongly positioned in emerging markets compared to the firms that are managed by mainland Chinese. We conclude that returnees in the Chinese biotech sector contribute to the diversification of the markets on which the Chinese industry is positioned and to its technological catching-up towards US standards.","[Laroche, Nicholas] Univ Auvergne, Clermont Univ, Ctr Etud & Rech Dev Int, BP 10448, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Cabagnols, Alexandre] Univ Blaise Pascal, Clermont Univ, Polytech Clermont, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Henaut, Pascale] Biopole Clermont Limagne, Solusci, F-63360 St Beauzire, France; [Romond, P.] Univ Auvergne, Clermont Univ, ERT 18, Concept Ingn & Dev Aliment & Med, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Laroche, Nicholas] CERDI, CNRS, UMR 6587, F-63009 Clermont Ferrand, France",Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA),"Laroche, N (通讯作者)，Univ Auvergne, Clermont Univ, Ctr Etud & Rech Dev Int, BP 10448, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France.",nicolas.laroche@u-clermont1.fr; alexandre.cabagnols@polytech.univ-bpclermont.fr; henaut@soluscience.fr; P-Charles.ROMOND@u-clermont1.fr,"Cabagnols, Alexandre/ISV-1456-2023","Cabagnols, Alexandre/0000-0003-4891-6344",,,,,28,0,0,0,17,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,550,558,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800067,0

This study also is aiming to reveal new facets of understanding marital roles in purchase decision. Hypotheses: (1) Marital roles vary throughout the purchase decision process, not only in decision-making phase; (2) perception of marital roles in purchase decision varies over time depending on the household life cycle. All the prior work has been pursued in various countries with the aim of testing the model and identifies potential differences or mutations that could occur, primarily due to cultural differences. New models have been developed following the example of different countries: USA, UK, France, Belgium and Canada (Douglas and Silk 1981), China (Ford, Pelton and Lumpkin 1995), India (Webster 2000), USA. and New Zealand (Lee and Beatty 2002). For Romania there isn't accomplished such a study. At 20 years after the market opening, customers are becoming less predictable. The effects of globalization on the purchase decision of the households presented both at the macro-economic and socio-cultural level as well, are still unknown. If at first, in 1990, was enough to be present in the media to sell, in the 2000's, that recent years (starting current crisis) have made major changes. It can be very important, especially for foreign companies to know the particularities of the Romanians in the purchase decision process. According to Hofstede's indicators, Romania is characterized by high power distance (90), collectivism (30), masculinity (42) and high uncertainty avoidance (90). From here we may conclude that even the households buying decision is mostly Husband dominated. If so, even the advertising stimuli addressed to the public to boost the purchasing decision should be addressed mainly to men. Reality shows different. Advertising stimuli are directed mainly towards the women audience and increasingly for children and teenagers. Is necessary to align to the existing chain of ideas that starts with Davis and Rigaux study and to identify features of the Romanian space in order to compare them with those registered globally.","[Manolica, Adriana; Ciobanu, Oana; Bobalca, Claudia] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,,manolica@uaic.ro; ciobanu.oana@uaic.ro; iuliana.bobalca@uaic.ro,"Stoian, Claudia/R-1828-2016; Manolica, Adriana/AAK-4579-2021",,,,,,17,0,0,0,16,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-2-3,,,,2011,,,,,,,161,164,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI18,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306939900041,0

This architecture is aimed to reduce unnecessary network traffic and solve bottleneck problems in the traditional pull-based architecture. By using the same service contract in the publish/subscribe model, a SOAP-based message can be directly sent from a publisher (a service provider) to all relevant subscribers (service clients) via a broker. When subscribers have no need to keep checking for new or updated data from the publisher, service response time and workload on the publisher are reduced. To proof of the concepts, two experiments on comparison between pull-based and push-based architecture are provided. Our experimental results show that the average response time and the workload are significantly minimized in the push-based architecture.

More specifically, this PhD paper is concerned with multinational corporate suppliers of the inputs to agriculture, ie the seeds and chemicals on which modern industrial agriculture relies. Although business is motivated by profit, the author argues that this is not the only factor driving agribusiness innovation; innovation and R&D are complex processes emerging from multiple interactions with multiple framework conditions. This paper attempts to unravel these conditions by developing a conceptual framework which will then guide the author's empirical fieldwork in an agribusiness setting. This is a conceptual paper is based on a strand of the author's PhD literature review. The conceptual framework begins with the agrifood supply chain as the starting point of conditions influencing agribusiness innovation. The author posits that all actors (farmers, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers) in the agrifood chain have an influence on agribusiness, albeit some indirectly felt, such as though consumer trends. The conceptual framework then expands outwards from the agrifood chain to include conditions such as regulation (the Pesticide Directive), incentives (such as tax credits), market factors (global trade agreements), the agroecological environment (soil, water, weather), and pressure groups. The conceptual framework also includes conditions internal to the business such as corporate structure and strategy. The author argues that if one of these framework conditions changes enough, it can have a ripple effect on the rest of the framework, potentially making a new R&D direction viable.","[Payne-Gifford, Sophie] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England",University of Reading,,s.payne2@pgr.reading.ac.uk,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,8,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,997,1005,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800118,0

No economy is a small isolated island and the bankruptcy of a company can also influence a situation on the other side of the world. But companies are very complicated organisms and that is why it is not a simple task to estimate company future development. The best-known model of prediction called Z-Score was introduced by E.I. Altman in the USA more than forty years ago, in 1968. This model was modified several times. The best-known modification is the ZETA model which is applicable to unlisted companies and was established by Altman in 1977. The Z-Score model was verified not only by the author but also by other analysts many times. Some analysts criticize that the model doesn't give correct results. Above all, it is not able to detect the coming crisis within a sufficient time period. The aim of this paper is to introduce the ZETA model to readers and try to show the application possibilities of this model to companies in the Czech Republic. The model is described in the first chapter. The next chapter focuses on the ZETA index value calculation for Czech companies. Variables of the model are tested in others chapters. i also try to set correlation coefficient for each pair of the variables. In my analysis i worked with accounting data of thirty-seven going companies and thirteen firms which went bankrupt.","Univ W Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Plzen, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Pitrová, K (通讯作者)，Univ W Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Plzen, Czech Republic.",pitrovak@kem.zcu.cz,"Micudova, Katerina/HNP-4823-2023","Micudova, Katerina/0000-0002-4432-0079",,,,,18,21,21,0,31,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Our findings, based on an empirical survey conducted among Romanian certified public accountants, indicate that in Romania managerial accounting had a different and slower evolution compared to the international evolution as it is associated with cost calculation and budgeting while managerial accounting is much more. Moreover, Romanian companies seems to prefer traditional managerial accounting practices and techniques like job-order costing, process costing, standard costing, budgeting practices while practices like activity based costing or target costing are known by only a few professionals. Because in our country there are only a few studies about the role, function and utility of managerial accounting we consider that the main contribution of this study is that provides a unique and detailed examination on how managerial accounting is perceived by practitioners.

The natural environment had been overturned by the technological progress that allowed the obtaining of new genetic combinations, in order to get more resisting and productive vegetables, animals and fish. If in the mid of the XX century, the improvement in crop led to what was called Green Revolution, at the end of the same century, by applying innovative technologies based on combining genes, Green Revolution has been transformed in Genetic Revolution. Genetically Modified Organisms, created and cultivated on a large scale in the USA, became at this moment a very controversial subject. Many experts are afraid that the genetic engineering would generate biodiversity loss, removing the barriers which protected species' integrity in the course of time, all of this having negative consequences on population health.

Public policies are modern tools of governments to pursue technological changes and realize the development of a nation. Globalization as a multidimensional process influences governance and opened the doors of economic performance and sustainable development only if public policies promote faster growth, lower inflation, higher incomes and greater economic freedom. The globalization indexes demonstrate that countries which globalized more experienced higher growth rates but it is not enough for poor countries simply to globalize their economies to reduce poverty and assure sustainable development. However, policy formulation itself should be revised to integrate strategic thinking, in order to allocate resources based on priorities.

We develop a simple screening model where parties have symmetric expectations regarding the probability of a strike down and asymmetric information regarding plaintiff's non-economic harm. Our model makes the following predictions: First, caps may increase the length required to resolve disputes if the caps are low enough or the probability of a strike down is large enough. Second, although caps always increase the percentage of disputes that are settled out of courts, they do not necessarily save litigation expenses. Third, when caps increase the length of dispute resolution, they also increase litigation expenses if and only if the settlement negotiation costs are neither too small nor too large. Fourth, while caps always reduce the recoveries of plaintiffs with large claims, caps may increase recoveries of plaintiffs with low claims compared to their recoveries in states with no caps. We end by discussing the robustness of the results. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The methodology used was historical event analysis, modeled via a binary logistic regression, creating a model that predicts correctly in 90.3% of the cases. The variables that best explain drop-outs are family income and student academic performance; however, in the light of the results of this study, a need exists to rethink the relationship between admittance and dropping out.

First, we explore the effects of a rule change in September 2002 on option grant dates. Second, we examine the retroactive backdating of option grant dates. Finally, we look at the timing of option grant dates along with news releases around those dates. The outcome of the analyses shows that there are no significant abnormal cumulative returns in the period before the option grant date. However, we find significant abnormal cumulative returns during a period of 30 trading days thereafter, even for scheduled options granted before September 2002. Furthermore, it appears that earnings news releases around option grant dates are managed. The empirical results provide evidence that the timing of news can be seen as a substitute for both backdating option grants and the timing of the option grant date after September 2002. The paper presents novel findings that option grants are retroactively backdated. The latter outcome is based not only on the effects of the change in legislation, but also on an analysis of the relation between the number of options granted and the difference between the highest annual stock price and the exercise price of the option grants. These findings are robust under different model specifications. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The WTP estimate reflects the benefit of preference for indigenous vegetation over alien vegetation. In a survey, a questionnaire was administered to 260 households in the Underberg region during September 2005. It was deduced that the mean WTP for the project was R21.12 in 2005 (R26.40 in 2008), the total WTP was R25 344.00 (R31 680.00 in 2008) and the WTP per hectare was R21.87 (R27.34 in 2008). A valuation function to predict. WTP responses was also estimated. The function showed that knowledge of the local Working for Water Programme and income were important determinants of WTP.","[Du Preez, M.; Tessendorf, S.; Hosking, S.

Findings from the USITC framework-based assessment have been illustrated in a cobweb-shaped diagram to show an analogy of Cambodia's garment industry in comparison with that of China and Vietnam. For the improvement of the current working environment and the forthcoming upgrading process, a trajectory of the Cambodia's garment industry has been projected in three vital stages: (1) assembling, (2) OEM, and (3) original brand manufacturing. In response to the first objective, the Cambodia's garment industry is predicted to face a high risk of industrial downturn in the post-2008 era due to the internal weaknesses in the supply side. For the second objective, the shift from Cambodia's current garment assembler status to OEM status will take a long time and require training of local managers and skilled workers.","[Lee, Joosung J.] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Innovat & Technol Management, Seoul, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST),"Lee, JJ (通讯作者)，Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Innovat & Technol Management, Seoul, South Korea.",jooslee@kaist.ac.kr; teduongsun@yahoo.com,"Lee, Joosung/C-1801-2011",,,,,,36,3,3,0,22,KOREAN SOC INNOVATION MANAGEMENT & ECON-KOSIME,DONGJAK-GU,"26TH FL SPECIALTY CONSTRUCTION CTR SHINDAEBANG-DONG, 395-70, DONGJAK-GU, SEOUL 156-714, SOUTH KOREA",1976-1597,,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

In this paper, I use data on interisland airfares to examine the effects of an antitrust immunity agreement that allowed two airlines to coordinate capacity for a limited period of time. I find not only that prices rose during the period of coordination but that they remained high until the entry of a new competitor, 2(1)/(2) years after immunity expired. That the incumbent airlines were able to sustain supracompetitive fares well past the end of immunity suggests that even short-lived grants of immunity can have persistent effects.

They have not until now been studied by economists, and this article attempts to fill that gap by offering a detailed analysis, inspired by the Austrian School of Economics, of their object and approach. We first show that, from a theoretical point of view, the explanations advanced by these sociologists are based implicitly on basic models of economics, such as the law of supply and demand and the law of costs, and that they cannot therefore replace economic explanations of prices. Secondly, from a methodological point of view, these studies are based on field surveys that provide concrete information on certain markets but they lose sight of an aspect that is fundamental to the Austrian School, the interdependence of prices in different markets. And when this interdependence is taken into account, namely, in the case of the relationship between cost and price, the causal link postulated by sociologists goes from cost to price when Austrian economists argue that it goes in the opposite direction.","Univ Lille USTL, Fac Sci Econ & Sociales, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France",Universite de Lille - ISITE; Universite de Lille,"Fillieule, R (通讯作者)，Univ Lille USTL, Fac Sci Econ & Sociales, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France.",renaud.fillieule@univ-lille1.fr,,,,,,,28,2,2,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

In so doing, I seek to highlight the often-contested nature of the implementation of standards in social fields that are marked by different and distributed principles of evaluating quality, production processes, and legitimate actions in the marketplace.

Unfortunately, rapid technological change and an abundance of product configurations mean that the demand for parts in high-tech products is frequently volatile and hard to forecast. The paper describes a Bayesian statistical model which was developed to forecast the parts demand for Sun Microsystems, Inc., a major vendor of enterprise computer products. The model embodies a parametric description of the part's life cycle, allowing it to anticipate changes in demand over time. Furthermore, using hierarchical priors, the model is able to pool demand patterns for a collection of parts, producing calibrated forecasts for new parts with little or no demand history. The paper discusses the problem addressed by the model, the model itself, and a procedure for calibrating it, then compares its forecast performance with those of alternatives.

We first present a median-voter model of the determination of citizenship laws. Next we test the implications of the model on a new set of data on citizenship laws across countries. We show that citizenship laws respond to economic and institutional determinants endogenously. When facing increasing immigration, countries with a jus soli regime tend to restrict their legislation, whereas countries with a jus sanguinis regime resist innovation. The welfare burden does not prove to be an obstacle to jus soli legislation, but demographic stagnation encourages it. A high degree of democracy promotes the adoption of jus soli elements, whereas instability of state borders determined by decolonization impedes it. Religion and ethnic diversity have no residual effect.","[Bertocchi, Graziella; Strozzi, Chiara] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy",Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia,"Bertocchi, G (通讯作者)，Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.",,"Bertocchi, Graziella/O-6435-2019; Bertocchi, Graziella/C-3565-2016; Strozzi, Chiara/G-7344-2016","Bertocchi, Graziella/0000-0003-1004-2362; Strozzi, Chiara/0000-0003-2776-4775",,,,,44,25,31,0,12,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

This article uses the occurrence of a racial profiling scandal in New Jersey to quantify the effect of a move toward race-neutral policing. The scandal and subsequent reforms led to an estimated 16-33 percent decrease in annual arrests of minorities for motor vehicle theft. I also present evidence that, as policing against minorities decreased, motor vehicle theft increased in areas populated by minorities. My implied elasticities do not suggest that minorities respond to policing intensity differently than the general population. New Jersey data generate little strong evidence of additional adverse responses by minorities to lessened police scrutiny. The findings are robust to a number of specification checks, and similar patterns are observable in Maryland, a state that experienced a profiling scandal several years before New Jersey.","RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA 90406 USA",RAND Corporation,"Heaton, P (通讯作者)，RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA 90406 USA.",,,,,,,,52,17,22,0,18,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Firstly, we introduce a novel semiparametric technique called Genetic Programming to estimate and explain the willingness to pay to maintain environmental conditions of a specific natural park in Spain. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time in which Genetic Programming is employed in contingent valuation. Secondly, we investigate the existence of bias due to the functional rigidity of the traditional parametric techniques commonly employed in a contingent valuation problem. We applied standard parametric methods (logit and probit) and compared with results obtained using semiparametric methods (a proportional hazard model and a genetic program). The parametric and semiparametric methods give similar results in terms of the variables finally chosen in the model. Therefore, the results confirm the internal validity of our contingent valuation exercise. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

This paper describes this transition during the second half of the twentieth century in light of a changing international system and the geopolitical constellations of the Cold War and European integration. As part of such historical experiences, external circumstances and internal preferences the civilian power concept became the foundation for the Berlin Republic's grand strategy of promoting civilianised structures in the international system. Unlike at the beginning of the twentieth century, German foreign policy after reunification in 1990 was not based on a deliberately pursued strategy of militaristic power politics to attain world power status. It reflected a foreign policy identity into which Germany 'grew' during the Cold War in a process of adapting and becoming part of European integration and American hegemony. Even though Germany did not completely abandon its power ambitions, their articulations and claims were radically transformed. A civilianised international system thereby became the objective and medium of German foreign policy. Such a system is characterised by multilateralism, supranational integration, strong international institutions, rule of law, free trade, human rights, good governance and restrictions of the use of force.","Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",University of Plymouth,"Bachmann, V (通讯作者)，Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.",veit.bachmann@plymouth.ac.uk,,,,,,,37,0,0,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0040-747X,,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Exploring these linkages through the sociology of environmental flows and interactive governance theory the paper discusses: (1) how market-based governance tools facilitate interaction within national and international value chains; (2) which links they target; and (3) what key actors they involve. Three market-based governance tools are compared - Das Fisch-o-Meter, the Scottish Sustainable Haddock Project and the Marine Stewardship Council - to illustrate the structure and function of different market-based spaces of interaction. The paper concludes that by understanding the kinds of interactions that are facilitated by market-based governance arrangements we can determine their potential for fostering changes in consumption and production practices which ultimately lead to sustainable fisheries.","Wageningen Univ, Environm Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Bush, SR (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Environm Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",simon.bush@wur.nl,,"Bush, Simon/0000-0002-6689-2246",,,,,52,14,21,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Nevertheless, the fallout from the credit crisis has not been homogeneous across space. That some localities were hit harder than others suggests that there are distinct geographies of financialization. Combining insights from the varieties of capitalism literature with those from the literature on financialization studies, the article offers a first take on what may explain these different geographies on the basis of an informal comparison of the trajectories of financialization and their political repercussions in the United States, Germany, and the Netherlands. The article ends with some reflections on how economic geography could be enriched by combining comparative studies on institutionalism and financialization, while its distinct research focus-detailed spatial analysis endowed with a well-developed sensitivity for geographic variegation-may help overcome the methodological nationalism of much comparative institutionalism.","[Engelen, Ewald; Fernandez, Rodrigo] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Human & Behav Sci, Dept Geog Planning & Int Dev Studies, AMIDSt, NL-1018 VZ Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Konings, Martijn] Univ Sydney, Dept Polit Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Amsterdam; University of Sydney,"Engelen, E (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Fac Human & Behav Sci, Dept Geog Planning & Int Dev Studies, AMIDSt, Nieuwe Prinsengracht 130, NL-1018 VZ Amsterdam, Netherlands.",e.r.engelen@uva.nl; m.konings@usyd.edu.au; r.fernandez@uva.nl,"Fernandez, Rodrigo/GRF-1350-2022",,,,,,75,75,83,0,36,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

The research question we pose is how a company can successfully carry out this integration of CSR into its strategic management, for which a model that includes three stages - introduction, implementation and generalization of CSR - is presented. Based on an exploratory case study within a Spanish technology-intensive firm (Indra), we show the way this company has developed and implemented an explicit plan for the integration of ethical values and CSR initiatives into its corporate and business strategies. Although this company has established its own methodology in order to develop and implement CSR plans, it fits in essence to our three-stage model of CSR integration. In general, our analyses show a beneficial impact of the development and implementation of CSR plan for this technology-intensive company. In particular, it seems that the CSR plan enables companies to improve its' internal and external (competitive) context through a better exploration and exploitation of knowledge, its stable relationships with stakeholders and the development and improvement of intangible resources such as reputation or social capital. It is also shown that there are important factors to consider in order this process can successfully carried out, such as organizational culture, human resource practices or knowledge management systems. Future research will need to engage in larger-scale confirmatory as well as longitudinal studies of the impact of CSR implementation for company performance.","[Skerlavaj, Miha] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Dept Management & Org, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Guadamillas-Gomez, Fatima] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Law & Social Sci, Dept Business Adm, Toledo 45071, Spain; [Donate-Manzanares, Mario J.] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Law & Social Sci, Dept Business Adm, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain",University of Ljubljana; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Skerlavaj, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Dept Management & Org, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",fatima.guadamillas@uclm.es; mariojavier.donate@uclm.es; miha.skerlavaj@ef.uni-lj.si,"Škerlavaj, Miha/AAA-3342-2022; Donate, Mario J./AAH-8885-2021; Guadamillas, Fátima/L-4356-2017; Skerlavaj, Miha/B-6238-2008","Donate, Mario J./0000-0003-4087-2535; Guadamillas, Fátima/0000-0002-4811-3544; Skerlavaj, Miha/0000-0002-1977-9283",,,,,46,12,16,0,36,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Based on the found patterns of users behaviour, which are represented by sequence rules it is possible to modify and improve the web page of an organisation. This article aims at finding out by means of an experiment to what degree it is necessary to realize data preparation for web log mining and it aims also at specifying inevitable steps for obtaining valid data from the log file. Results of the experiment are very important for the portal, which is regularly analysed and modified, since they can prove correctness of individual steps at analysis, or through an identification of useless steps they can make the advance preparation of data simpler. These results show that data cleaning from crawlers accesses has a significant impact on the quantity of extracted rules only in case, when we use the method of paths completion. On the contrary, the impact on the reduction of the portion of inexplicable rules as well as the impact on the quality of extracted rules in terms of their basic characteristics was not proved. Paths completing was proved crucial in data preparation for web log mining. It was proved that paths completing has a significant impact both on the quantity and the quality of extracted rules. However, it was proved that allowing the used browser upon identifying sessions has neither any significant impact on the quantity nor on the quality of extracted rules. There exist a number of models for identification of users sessions, which are crucial in data preparation, however, there exists also a method, which identifies them expressly. Our next goal is to additionally programme this functionality into the existing system and analyse various parameters of individual methods of identification of sessions compared with the reference direct identification. It also mentions the necessity to pay attention to the analysis of web logs in the real time and to reduce the time needed for the advance preparation of these logs and at the same time to increase accuracy of these data depending on the time of their collection.","[Munk, Michel; Kapusta, Jozef; Svec, Peter; Turcani, Milan] Constantine Philosopher Univ Nitra, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Informat, Nitra, Slovakia",Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra,"Munk, M (通讯作者)，Constantine Philosopher Univ Nitra, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Informat, Nitra, Slovakia.",mmunk@ukf.sk; jkapusta@ukf.sk; psvec@ukf.sk; mturcani@ukf.sk,"Munk, Michal/AAE-7199-2020; Turčáni, Milan/D-4168-2019; Svec, Peter/G-5209-2011; Kapusta, Jozef/C-4592-2013; Munk, Michal/N-1724-2017","Turčáni, Milan/0000-0003-4606-8724; Svec, Peter/0000-0002-1713-6444; Kapusta, Jozef/0000-0002-8285-2404; Munk, Michal/0000-0002-9913-3596",,,,,36,21,22,0,22,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Redefinition of the roles of the state and private providers, privatization in health care became a central theme of recent health care reforms in Slovakia. The debate about the pros and cons of privatization in health care is very intensive, though mainly at the political level. Some opponents still regard privatization as a policy simply advocated to cut back the role of the public sector in health care. But advocates of privatization believe it can raise effectiveness and quality. Our article analyses the problem of Slovak hospital ownership. It begins with a brief theoretical overview of the key aspects of privatisation: predominantly from the viewpoint of neoclassical public economics. The analytical part was intended provide a comparative analysis of performance of different types of Slovak hospitals. But the lack of publicly available data limits the scope and depth of our analysis. Despite these limitations our article argues that ownership form is not the main determinant of hospital performance. We base this argument on both theoretical grounds and on our empirical evidence from Slovakia. In the light of this argument, we propose that decisions about hospital privatisation and its form, in spite of their dominantly political character, should respect concrete conditions and the specific environment. A public-private-civil sector ownership mix seems to be the most appropriate current response for Slovakia.","[Nemec, Juraj] Univ Mateja Bela Banskej Bystrici, Ekon Fak, Katedra Financii Uctovnictva, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia; [Merickova, Beata; Strangfeldova, Jana] Univ Mateja Bela Banskej Bystrici, Ekon Fak, Katedra Verejnej Ekon, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",Matej Bel University; Matej Bel University,"Nemec, J (通讯作者)，Univ Mateja Bela Banskej Bystrici, Ekon Fak, Katedra Financii Uctovnictva, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia.",juraj.nemec@umb.sk; beata.merickova@umb.sk; jana.strangfeldova@umb.sk,"Meričková, Beáta Mikušová/AAN-7235-2021; Nemec, Juraj/M-5467-2013","Meričková, Beáta Mikušová/0000-0002-3187-9201; Nemec, Juraj/0000-0002-5881-7422",,,,,46,12,12,0,12,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Using repeated cross sectional data covering highly-developed nations, we consider the differential effects of aggregate social norms regarding the division of household labor. Controlling for other factors that affect the marriage market, our findings indicate that more egalitarian norms are associated with an increase in the probability of forming a household. When additionally controlling for individual attitudes, we find that, ceteris paribus, more egalitarian women are less likely to form a household, while more egalitarian men are more likely to do so. This pattern of results is consistent with economic models of the marriage market where partners contract over the future household division of labor. Moreover, given the salience of household formation as a proximate determinant of fertility, our results potentially shed light onto the process of below replacement fertility and the economic challenges associated with it.","Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",University of Oxford,"Sevilla-Sanz, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",almudena.sevilla@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,27,56,58,2,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,,,J POPUL ECON,J.

A CURRENT BANK SURVEY,E & M EKONOMIE A MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,rating; company; bank; survey,,"The article deals with the possibilities of improving companies ratings used for the evaluation of the probability of default of the credits granted by banks. There are two general views mentioned in the article. The view of banks, which can refine their conditions, and, above all, adapt themselves to potential risks, which leads to an improvement of their own risk management and their refinancing conditions. The view of companies, whose good ratings, no matter whether arranged by banks or by external rating agencies, imply appropriate interest terms. The influencing factors for the rating are known by many companies. Hence, in practice it is often a target to influence these factors and key figures positively. A successful implementation of the findings of the conducted survey would help companies to improve their rating. The main part of the article describes the results extracted for this purpose from the survey which was carried out between 28 November.2008 and 28 February 2009. The analysis of the survey identified contemporary allocation of documents, completeness of documents, actual financial + profit planning, disclosure of accounting policy and extensive company documentation as the five best possibilities for companies to improve their ratings. Also we can see a strong weighting of the banks on measures within the ranges of documentation and balance relations. Of course, the conclusion concerning the best possibility for the rating improvement cannot be seen as unambiguous, since it depends on too many variables.","[Speth, Heribert] Dr Ing Paul Christiani GmbH & Co KG, Constance, Germany; [Sebo, Juraj; Kovac, Jozef] Tech Univ Kosiciach, Strojnicka Fak, Katedra Manazmentu & Ekon, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Speth, H (通讯作者)，Dr Ing Paul Christiani GmbH & Co KG, Constance, Germany.",hspeth@hotmail.com; juraj.sebo@tuke.sk; jozef.kovac@tuke.sk,"Šebo, Juraj/AAA-8950-2020","Šebo, Juraj/0000-0001-8468-4689",,,,,14,5,5,0,7,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

While verifying this hypothesis, we focused on the value of the factor of unemployment - F1 on the educational level in the municipality. The test proved that the factor value F1 depends on the educational level, however the dependence is weak. The analysis of variance was amended by the test of independence in 2 by 2 table and the calculation of Pearson's R. A positive relationship has been proved. This means that higher level of education of the population can be expected in strong municipalities (according to factor F1) and lower level of education in the weak municipalities. The research will further focus on identifying other factors that have a greater influence on factor F1 than the educational level.","[Valentova, Vladimira Hovorkova; Nedomlelova, Iva] Tech Univ Liberec, Dept Econ Stat, Fac Econ, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,,vladimira.valentova@tul.cz; iva.nedomlelova@tul.cz,"Nedomlelová, Iva/AAD-1593-2022; Nedomlelova, Iva/HLP-5065-2023; Hovorkova Valentova, Vladimira/M-1370-2018","Nedomlelová, Iva/0000-0001-9038-6610; Hovorkova Valentova, Vladimira/0000-0001-5718-315X",,,,,13,0,0,0,1,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-5210-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,101,108,,,,,,8,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDC19,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000312551100013,0

So we can make the conclusion: the environmental problem can't be solved by one single method, the effective environmental management must depend on the coordination and cooperation of all the methods.

While the ideas of Richard Florida have permeated local and regional planning strategies in most parts of the Western world, critiques have been numerous. Florida's 3T's (technology, talent, and tolerance) have been adopted without considering whether the theory fits into the settings of a specific urban and regional context. This article aims to contextualize and unpack the creative class approach by applying the knowledge-base approach and break down the rigid assumption that all people in the creative class share common locational preferences. We argue that the creative class draws on three different knowledge bases: synthetic, analytical, and symbolic, which have different implications for people's residential locational preferences with respect to a people climate and a business climate. Furthermore, the dominating knowledge base in a region has an influence on the importance of a people climate and a business climate for attracting and retaining talent. In this article, we present an empirical analysis in support of these arguments using original Swedish data.","[Asheim, Bjorn] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Dept Social & Econ Geog, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Hansen, HK (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Dept Social & Econ Geog, Solvegatan 16, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",bjorn.asheim@circle.lu.se; hogni.kalso_hansen@circle.lu.se,"Hansen, Høgni Kalsø/ABB-2367-2020","Hansen, Høgni Kalsø/0000-0001-6174-1417",,,,,48,208,237,6,162,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

In response to a class action alleging copyright infringement, Google has agreed to a settlement with the plaintiffs, which include the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers. A federal district court must approve the settlement for it to take effect. Various individuals and organizations have advocated modification or rejection of the settlement, based in part on concerns regarding Google's claimed ability to exercise market power. The Antitrust Division has confirmed that it is investigating the settlement. We address concerns of Professor Randal Picker and others, especially concerns over the increased access to orphan books, which are books that retain their copyright but for which the copyright holders are unknown or cannot be found. The increased accessibility of orphan books under GBS involves the creation of a new product, which entails large gains in consumer welfare. We consider it unlikely that Google could exercise market power over orphan books. We consider it remote that the static efficiency losses claimed by critics of the settlement could outweigh the consumer welfare gains from the creation of a valuable new service for expanding access to orphan books. We therefore conclude that neither antitrust intervention nor price regulation of access to orphan books under GBS would be justified on economic grounds.","[Hausman, Jerry A.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Sidak, J.

The welfare effects of increasing the fuel levy by 10 per cent are negative but very small. Similarly, the marginal excess burdens for efficiency and equity (poverty) are quite low, suggesting much smaller impacts of the intervention on both economic activity and equity. Furthermore, a fiscal policy reform that raises fuel levy by 10 per cent is progressive as it has stronger negative effects on higher income households than on lower income households. A potential source of instability for the macroeconomy and total government revenue is the negative effect on economic activity induced by the fuel levy increase. The remedies suggested are that policymakers should make tax room elsewhere in the intergovernmental fiscal system to accommodate the fuel levy increase.","[Mabugu, Ramos; Amusa, Hammed] Financial & Fiscal Commiss, Midrand, South Africa; [Chitiga, Margaret] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Mabugu, R (通讯作者)，Financial & Fiscal Commiss, Midrand, South Africa.",,"Mabugu, Ramos Emmanuel/HPF-8840-2023","Mabugu, Ramos Emmanuel/0000-0001-8405-3051",,,,,10,3,3,0,4,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"RM EMS 4-51, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

J,"Verhetsel, A; Sel, S",,,,"Verhetsel, Ann; Sel, Steve",,,World maritime cities: From which cities do container shipping companies make decisions?,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,World cities; Maritime economics; Globalisation; Urban networks,CITY NETWORK,"In recent decades, many researchers have devoted themselves to the study of world cities. One of the most important contributions to world city research has come from the Globalisation and World Cities Study Group & Network (GaWC-Loughborough University). GaWC focuses on external relationships between world cities. It has analysed the world city network and the hierarchy between cities in various sectors, but primarily in advanced producer services (accountancy, advertising, banking/finance and law). Previous studies have identified London, New York, Paris and Tokyo as high-level global service centres, followed closely by Chicago, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Los Angeles, Milan and Singapore. Thus far, however, the maritime sector has been neglected in the identification and analysis of global cities. The main purpose of the present article is to fill this void. The first part of our analysis includes a study of the literature on world cities and an examination of the criteria and methods on which previous research has been based. In part II, we explore the world maritime city network by applying and interpreting the GaWC methods. For a city to be recognised as a world maritime city, it must have a presence of container shipping companies and container terminal operators. As for the city's operational capacity, that is determined by the extent of linkages between those container shipping companies and container terminal operators, on the one hand, and the rest of the world maritime market, on the other hand. The collected empirical evidence shows that Hong Kong, Hamburg, Singapore, Shanghai, Tokyo, New Jersey/New York, Bangkok/Laem Chabang and London are the world's leading maritime cities. Furthermore, analysis of interrelations in these cities between shipping companies and container terminal has indicated Hong Kong, Hamburg and New York to be the main nodes in the world maritime city network.

How can these changes be understood and interpreted, especially from a territorial point of view? There are two contradictory economic theories regarding the tangible effects of the rise of the finance industry. According to neoclassical financial theorists, the finance industry's success is based on its positive effects on the real economy through its capacity to allocate financial resources efficiently. An alternative approach, adopted here, posits that finance does not merely mirror the real economy and that the financial economy, far from being a simple instrument for the allocation of capital, has its own autonomy, its own logic of development and expansion. A series of complex, and sometimes contradictory, connections link financial markets and the real economy, and there are some tensions between them, calling into question the coherence of the regional and national economies that follow from them. Moreover, the territorial approach shows how the mobility/liquidity of capital and the changing dimensions of new regions and countries are central to the finance industry's functioning. This article builds an understanding of the financial system through the lens of pension funds and highlights the impact of such a system on the real economy and its geography.","[Corpataux, Jose] Univ Quebec, INRS Urbanisat Culture & Soc, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Crevoisier, Olivier; Theurillat, Thierry] Univ Neuchatel, Inst Sociol, Res Grp Territorial Econ, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS); University of Neuchatel,"Corpataux, J (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec, INRS Urbanisat Culture & Soc, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",jose.corpataux@unine.ch; olivier.crevoisier@unine.ch; thierry.theurillat@unine.ch,"Theurillat, Thierry/HTN-0376-2023",,,,,,53,53,61,2,37,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

For example, in disease surveillance, we detect emerging outbreaks by monitoring electronically available public health data, e.g. aggregate daily counts of Emergency Department visits. We propose a two-step approach based on the expectation-based scan statistic: we first compute the expected count for each recent day for each spatial location, then find spatial regions (groups of nearby locations) where the recent counts are significantly higher than expected. By aggregating information across multiple time series rather than monitoring each series separately, we can improve the timeliness, accuracy, and spatial resolution of detection. We evaluate several variants of the expectation-based scan statistic on the disease surveillance task (using synthetic outbreaks injected into real-world hospital Emergency Department data), and draw conclusions about which models and methods are most appropriate for which surveillance tasks.

The plans set out the overall strategy, key policies that will be implemented and how the strategy will be resourced. The central government now adjusts the funding allocations up or down by up to 25% based on the quality of the plans and, on an on-going basis, achievement against the targets proposed in these plans. This paper presents a theoretical and practical assessment of the impacts of these incentives on local authority performance. The research has employed a mixed-methods approach with interviews, questionnaires, the development of a game theoretic representation of the process and a laboratory experiment. The findings have been discussed with practitioners. The research suggests that the presence of performance rewards, in a scheme where authorities believe they have a reasonable chance of being rewarded, leads to authorities setting more ambitious targets. Whilst it is not certain that these targets will be met it appears that the absolute outcomes achieved are likely to be better than they otherwise would have been. Generic conclusions are drawn about the conditions under which target-based performance reward schemes will work best. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Prosecutors, however, choose which cases to prosecute. If they prosecute only the strongest cases, they will have high conviction rates. Any system that pays attention to conviction rates, as opposed to the number of convictions, is liable to abuse. As a prosecutor's budget increases, he allocates it between prosecuting more cases and putting more effort into existing cases. Either can be socially desirable, depending on particular circumstances. We model the tradeoffs theoretically in two models, one of a benevolent social planner and one of a prosecutor who values not just the number of convictions but the conviction rate and unrelated personal goals. We apply the model to U.S. data drawn from county-level crime statistics and a survey of all state prosecutors by district. Conviction rates do have a small negative correlation with prosecutorial budgets, but conditioning on other variables in regression analysis, higher budgets are associated both with more prosecutions and higher conviction rates.

Civic norms may attach guilt and shame to criminal behavior, thus increasing its opportunity cost. Associational networks may increase returns to noncriminal activities and raise detection probabilities, but they may also work as communication channels for criminals and may offer official cover to criminal activities. The empirical assessment of these effects poses serious problems of endogeneity, omitted variables, measurement error, and spatial correlation. Italy's great variance in social and economic characteristics, its homogeneity in policies and institutions, and the availability of historical data on social capital in its regions allow us to minimize the first two problems. To tackle the last two problems, we use report-rate-adjusted crime rates and estimate a spatial lag model. We find that both civic norms and associational networks have a negative and significant effect on property crimes across Italian provinces.","[Buonanno, Paolo] Univ Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy; [Montolio, Daniel] Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain; [Vanin, Paolo] Univ Padua, I-35100 Padua, Italy",University of Bergamo; University of Barcelona; University of Padua,"Buonanno, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy.",,"Montolio, Daniel/F-1204-2016; Buonanno, Paolo/O-1949-2019","Buonanno, Paolo/0000-0001-8838-3904; VANIN, PAOLO/0000-0001-8767-8567",,,,,40,195,211,1,35,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

The Study showed that the volume of plywood, veneer, and processed wood exported before the period of 1984-1995 and during the LEB policy (1996-2005) was, respectively, 6% and 46% of the total exports during those periods. On the contrary, the aggregate price index of all products exported before the LEB policy was tip by 129% compared to -3.9% for the period during the LEB policy. A further decline in prices of the most products exported during the LEB Policy was found by the study. Thus even though an LEB policy could increase volume share of value-added products, it cannot guarantee growth in prices of wood products. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

These situations usually arise when contemporaneous or temporal aggregation is required. In these cases, histograms provide a summary of the data that is more informative than those provided by other aggregates such as the mean. Some fields where HTS are useful include economy, official statistics and environmental science. This article adapts the k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) algorithm to forecast HTS and, more generally, to deal with histogram data. The proposed k-NN relies on the choice of a distance that is used to measure dissimilarities between sequences of histograms and to compute the forecasts. The Mallows distance and the Wasserstein distance are considered. The forecasting ability of the k-NN adaptation is illustrated with meteorological and financial data, and promising results are obtained. Finally, further research issues are discussed.

THE CASE OF LITHUANIA,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,robustness; weights; ratio system; reference point theory; MOORA; regional development; redistribution of income; labour drain,OPTIMIZATION; DEFINITION; HISTORY,"The definition of robustness in econometrics, the error term in a linear equation, was not only broadened, but, in addition, moved to the meaning of common language: from a cardinal to a qualitative one: the most robust one, more robust than..., as robust as......, robust, weak robust, less robust than..., not robust, etc. Both interpretations are tested by an application on the Robustness in Regional Development, namely of the Lithuanian Regions. The computation of Regional Income, being an exponent of the welfare economy, is not sufficient for the measurement of the well-being of the regional population. The well-being economy goes farther. In the well-being economy, each individual would have to feel good concerning material wealth, health, education, all kind of security and concerning the environment. In other words, multiple objectives have to be fulfilled. Moreover, these different multiple objectives are expressed in different units. Weights are most of the time used to equalize these different units. However, introduction of weights means also introduction of subjectivity. In order to avoid this dilemma, the internal mechanical solution of a ratio system, producing dimensionless numbers, is preferred. In addition, this outcome creates the opportunity to use also a non-subjective reference point theory. The choice of the objectives is also non-subjective if all stakeholders are involved, or if all possible objectives are represented. This theory, which is called MOORA (Multi-Objective Optimization by Ratio Analysis), is applied to the different regions of Lithuania. A redistribution of income has to take place from the well-being Lithuanian regions to the poorer regions, but under limiting conditions and for well defined and eventually controlled projects.","[Brauers, Willem Karel M.] Univ Antwerp, B-2600 Antwerp, Belgium; [Ginevicius, Romualdas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",University of Antwerp; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Brauers, WKM (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Birontlaan 97, B-2600 Antwerp, Belgium.",willem.brauers@ua.ac.be; romualdas.ginevicius@adm.vgtu.lt,"Brauers, Willem/AAS-5072-2021","Ginevicius, Romualdas/0000-0003-2067-4398",,,,,63,58,61,0,12,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The empirical usability study or, language educational portals follows the standard structure; introduction, methodological frame, running own usability study and conclusion. The introduction sketches the width of the researched issue. The methodology frame provides readers with definitions and explanations of key expressions related to portal solutions; like portal, its services and characteristics where customization and personalization are described in detail. The other part of the methodological frame is devoted to usability testing in general terms. Usability testing of individual portal solutions is a tool introduced for investigation of user's aspect. Research on portal usability is built on empiric observation of ways how common users under common circumstances browse through web pages. Factors influencing user's behaviour like intuitiveness, satisfaction and conventions are highlighted due to their significant role in user's move in the portal environment. The main part of the study is represented by own usability testing of selected language portals. Selection of portals was based on the width and quality of their facilities. A special form for usability testing of language portals was created. A set of tasks was developed reflecting both general and specialised areas of the tested portal. The tasks were divided into two main categories; unsolvable tasks and solvable tasks with accomplished and failed subcategories. Ten final reports were elaborated to ten selected portals within the study on usability testing. Conclusion brings outline of further utilisation of gained findings within the research of current trends of portal solution development.","[Cerna, Miloslava] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fak Informat & Managementu, Katedra Aplikovane Lingvistiky, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic; [Poulova, Petra] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fak Informat & Managementu, Katedra Informat & Kvantitativnich, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove; University of Hradec Kralove,"Cerná, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Fak Informat & Managementu, Katedra Aplikovane Lingvistiky, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.",miloslava.cerna@uhk.cz; petra.poulova@uhk.cz,"Poulova, Petra/T-8640-2017; Černá, Miloslava/C-1605-2019","Poulova, Petra/0000-0001-5269-4065; Černá, Miloslava/0000-0002-9904-4059",,,,,23,16,16,0,5,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

It analyzes the duration of the exhibition runs of movies released by distributors who owned no theaters in Singapore during 2002 and 2003 through a survival model. The estimation shows that films released by these distributors are exhibited for shorter periods in distributor-owned theaters than in independently owned (i.e., unintegrated) theaters, and in theaters that belong to large theater chains than in the theaters of small theater chains. A spatial aspect of competition among theaters with different owners is revealed in the finding that a film is more likely to stay on at the theater at a given time when an adjacent rival theater still runs the same title. The increase in the probability of screen survival due to the spatial rivalry is greater the nearer the competing theater. These results are found when both film and theater-specific variations are controlled for.","Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, Singapore 637718, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University,"Fu, WW (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, 31 Nanyang Link, Singapore 637718, Singapore.",twjfu@ntu.edu.sg,,,,,,,70,20,23,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0899-7764,1532-7736,,J MEDIA ECON,J.

For this reason, and given its particular economic and ecological significance, action needs to be taken to counter this trend. In this connection, above all, tow goals which should be aspired to will be outlined in this paper: the coordination of the range of service offered as a result of local transport companies working together to enhance the attractiveness of LPT and the implementation of competition in local public transport. This raised the question of whether these two goals can be achieved complementary given the conditions that exist in LPT or whether competition and cooperation amont the transport companies do not instead cancel each other out. Bearing this issue in mind, this paper will analyse the two organisational forms applied in practice in LPT: the 3-level model with tendering competition and the deregulated market. In this context, focus will be given to public road passenger transport. Analysis has shown that fully deregulating the local transport markets would further weaken LPT. In contrast, the 3-level model with tendering competition could prove to be a suitable organisational model for LPT if the public transport authorities observe certain criteria when implementing this model.","Univ St Gallen, Inst Publ Serv & Tourism, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Gross, M (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Inst Publ Serv & Tourism, Dufourstr 40A, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",micro.gross@unisg.ch,,,,,,,40,3,3,1,10,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

We employ univariate and multivariate tests to test our developed hypothesis. Results of multiple analyses indicate that earnings available for common shareholders and intellectual capital disclosure are positively related at 1% significance level to share price. This signifies that market participants regard the intellectual capital disclosure as an important factor in determining market value. However, our study indicates that investors regard non-quantitative IC information as value relevant compared to quantitative information. This indicates the important of non-quantitative and non-financial information in investment decision making, especially in the knowledge based firms. Our study also reveals that among the IC components, relational capital is important in investment decision making.

Credit scoring systems are used to model the potential risk of loan applications, which have the advantage of being able to handle a large volume of credit applications quickly with minimal labour, thus reducing operating costs, and they may be an effective substitute for the use of judgment among inexperienced loan officers, thus helping to control bad debt losses. This study explores the performance of credit scoring models using traditional and artificial intelligence approaches: discriminant analysis, logistic regression, neural networks and classification and regression trees. Experimental studies using real world data sets have demonstrated that the classification and regression trees and neural networks outperform the traditional credit scoring models in terms of predictive accuracy and type II errors.","[Ince, Huseyin] Gebze Inst Technol, Kocaeli, Turkey; [Aktan, Bora] Univ Primorska, Koper, Slovenia; [Aktan, Bora] Yasar Univ, Izmir, Turkey",Gebze Technical University; University of Primorska; Yasar University,"Ince, H (通讯作者)，Gebze Inst Technol, Kocaeli, Turkey.",h.ince@gyte.edu.tr; bora.aktan@yasar.edu.tr,"Ince, Huseyin/A-9132-2009; Aktan, Bora/S-6019-2017","Ince, Huseyin/0000-0002-5953-6497; Aktan, Bora/0000-0002-1334-3542",,,,,37,49,54,4,54,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The ability to adapt to labour market changes should be an uninterrupted process, as an individual encouraged by internal and external factors, has to continuously improve his/her qualifications and find new ways for action, as well as be able to learn continuously.","[Jakstiene, Sandra; Narbutas, Valdas; Berzinskiene, Daiva] Kaunas Univ Technol, Panevezys Inst, Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,,sandra.jakstiene@ktu.lt; valdas.narbutas@ktu.lt; daiva.berzinskene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,1,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,KAUNAS,"K DONELAICIO 73, KAUNAS LT 3006, LITHUANIA",1822-7090,,,CHANGE SOC BUS ENV,,,2009,,,,,,,154,159,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTW62,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288290300022,0

Two types of data are used in the process of estimation using models based on the theory of credibility: data about own insurance risk and data about comparable insurance risks. The predictor for the next year's experience that is linear in the claims experience and optimal in the sense of least squares turns out to be a weighted average of the claims experience of the individual contract and the experience for the whole portfolio. The weight factor is the credibility attached to the individual experience, hence it is called the credibility factor, and the resulting premiums are called credibility premiums. In this article we review the Buhlmann-Straub model that is the most important credibility model and has a lot of application in non-life and life insurance as well as in reinsurance. The Buhlmann-Straub model belongs to the greatest accuracy credibility theory. Credibility estimators produced by this approach are such linear Bayes estimators that minimize the mean squared error (MSE). Credibility estimators compared with Bayes estimators don't require the choice of a prior distribution. Buhlmann showed that credibility estimators depend only on first and second moments that are easy to estimate from statistical data. This paper describes the technique of the credibility estimation for the claim frequency under assumptions of the Buhlmann-Straub model. The paper also includes the application of this credibility theory and techniques in third party motor vehicle insurance.","[Pacakova, Viera] Univ Pardubice, Fak Ekon Spravni, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic; [Soltes, Erik; Soltesova, Tatiana] Ekon Univ Bratislave, Fak Hospodarskej Informat, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Pardubice; University of Economics Bratislava,"Pacaková, V (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fak Ekon Spravni, Studentska 84, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic.",vpacakova@gmail.com; erik.soltes@euba.sk; tatiana.soltesova@euba.sk,,,,,,,4,5,5,0,6,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

According to the detailed conceptual model of secondary innovation stages and organizational learning modes, this case study elaborates HY's recent integrative learning process of the secondary innovation cycle of 1996-2005 within the new context of intensified international competition in a fast-growing developing country market with large domestic demand and large FDIs. Different from the traditional technological learning model, the secondary innovation model emphasizes the important interrelations and interactions combining the acquired technologies with existing technology systems and further with local user requirements, which can be named structural understanding and functional understanding.","[Wu, Xiaobo] Zhejiang Univ, Natl Inst Innovat Management, Sch Management, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Ma, Rufei; Xu, Guannan] Univ Cambridge, Inst Mfg, Cambridge, England",Zhejiang University; University of Cambridge,"Wu, XB (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Natl Inst Innovat Management, Sch Management, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",xbwu@zju.edu.cn,,,,,,,24,25,27,2,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Both models include the same mediators (components of commitment) and consequences (attitudinal and behavioral loyalty), yet they differ in the antecedents of commitment. By using SEM, both models are tested and compared on a sample of 150 firms. The results show that affective commitment is the only component of commitment that influences both attitudinal and behavioral loyalty. In the RM model affective commitment is positively influenced by trust, social bonds and satisfaction, while in the IMP model it is positively influenced by trust and knowledge transfers. Although differences in the sizes of effects can be found, the two models perform comparably well in terms of the model fit and their explanatory power of loyalty.","[Cater, Barbara; Zabkar, Vesna; Cater, Tomaz] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Cater, B (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Kardeljeva Pl 17, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.",barbara.cater@ef.uni-lj.si; vesna.zabkar@ef.uni-lj.si; tomaz.cater@ef.uni-lj.si,"Zabkar, Vesna/H-7030-2018; Cater, Babara/V-4803-2019","Zabkar, Vesna/0000-0002-9331-9090;",,,,,85,9,10,2,23,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Innovative SMEs also use more cash holdings to fund asset-counted R&D investment than cost-counted R&D investment, because the intangible assets created by asset-counted R&D investment may act as an innovative driver that can have a larger multiplier effect on the firm value. Moreover, innovative SMEs use more cash holdings to smooth R&D investment in the existence of the financial constraints measured by proxy variables such as capital market accessibility and credit rating level. These findings suggest new policy implications for how cash holdings can be particularly valuable for the R&D smoothing of innovative SMEs.","[Shin, Minshik; Kim, Sooeun] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Business Adm, Taegu 702701, South Korea",Kyungpook National University,"Kim, S (通讯作者)，Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Business Adm, 1370 Sankyukdong, Taegu 702701, South Korea.",sekim@knu.ac.kr,,,,,,,31,3,3,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1976-1597,,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

With the introduction of cordon pricing or area pricing, a toll district becomes more attractive as a residential place but less attractive as a workplace.

By applying the method of comparative analysis, it has been found out that the way of socially-owned enterprises being privatized and monetary regulations implemented had the crucial impact on the transition in the countries of former Yugoslavia. In fact, the chosen methods of privatization and monetary arrangements applied in these countries have established economies of uncompetitive enterprises. Privatization was either macro-economically harmful for the domestic savings and capital formation and / or unjust for people. In addition, our analyses have proved that the monetary regulation and foreign exchange policy were either not implemented at all or too little to neutralize the negative consequences of selling companies to foreign investors on the foreign exchange rate. The same goes for the combination of monetary policy and foreign exchange rate policy that should have been implemented so as to prevent speculative import and export of short-term capital.

The data were collected by means of questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and correlation and regression analyses were performed. The research showed that economic development of Croatia measured through the level of GDP significantly affects the number of registered participants in sport in a positive way. However, by using confidence interval analysis it was possible to reject the hypothesis that the fundamental problem of sport development is the insufficient amount of public resources.

The 2010 Guidelines are distinctive manly for two things. One is briefer and less detailed treatment of market delineation. The other is an expanded set of theories of harm that justify preventing mergers or reversing mergers that have already occurred. The 2010 Guidelines reflect a growing belief that in markets where product differentiation is minimal competition tends to be robust and the structural presumptions stated in previous Guidelines were too harsh. By contrast, where product differentiation is substantial the Guidelines' approach tended to define markets too broadly, overlooking significantly anticompetitive possibilities. Under the 2010 Guidelines unilateral effects analysis relevant markets can be very small, often limited to three or four firms, and excluding some obvious substitutes. Markets in merger analysis are not defined for their own sake, however, but rather to ascertain whether a particular alteration in market structure covered by the merger provisions will be likely to facilitate a price increase. The 2010 Guidelines address four substantive merger concerns: exclusion, restraints on innovation, unilateral effects, and coordinated effects. The Guidelines have a separate section on mergers limiting innovation and product variety, treated mainly in the category of unilateral effects. The 2010 Guidelines are more flexible than previous Guidelines and also more catholic about the types of harms that mergers might cause and the techniques that can be used to assess them. Older Guidelines were excessively wed to methodologies that were at the forefront of applied merger analysis when they were drafted, but that tended to make the Guidelines obsolete as new methodologies became available. Not only do methodologies change, they are also specific to the situation. Further, they tend to be well developed in the literature and accessible to experts consulted by those defending a merger as well as to the government economists who employ them. To be sure, there is a tradeoff between flexibility and guidance. Often we can have more of one only by giving up some of the other, and that tradeoff is clearly present in the 2010 Guidelines.","Univ Iowa, Coll Law, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",University of Iowa,"Hovenkamp, H (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Coll Law, Boyd Law Bldg, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",Herbert-hovenkamp@uiowa.edu,,,,,,,41,5,5,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

In this sense, several works based on the meta-analysis technique have come up in the two last decades in order to recapitulate the set of studies which have analysed such a topic. Taking these reviews as a starting point, we may establish that there is not a clear relationship between the entry mode and export performance variables. With a study on a sample of 122 Spanish hotels all over the world, we have the intention of analysing the existence and sense of the relationship between both variables. As a conclusion, we may state that the market entry mode has a positive and significant influence on export performance.","[Ramirez-hurtado, Jose M.] Pablo de Olavide Univ, Dept Econ Quantitat Methods & Econ Hist, Seville 41013, Spain; [Berbel-Pineda, Juan M.] Pablo de Olavide Univ, Dept Business Adm, Seville 41013, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide; Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Ramírez-Hurtado, JM (通讯作者)，Pablo de Olavide Univ, Dept Econ Quantitat Methods & Econ Hist, Ctra Utrera,Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain.",jmberpin@upo.es; jmramhur@upo.es,"Ramírez-Hurtado, José M./T-8083-2019","Ramírez-Hurtado, José M./0000-0002-2289-1874",,,,,51,10,11,1,26,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Customization provides ideal varieties for consumers but has no effect on quality. The firms first choose whether to customize their products, then engage in price competition. We show that the low-quality firm never customizes alone; customization becomes more likely as the difference between the firms' qualities increases; and less likely as the fixed cost of customization increases. We extend the base model by relaxing two important assumptions-uniform pricing and exogenous quality. The main conclusions with uniform pricing continue to hold when price customization is allowed. In the second extension the firms' qualities are endogenously determined.

If the loss function is quadratic, the mean of the predictive distribution is the unique optimal point predictor. If the loss is symmetric piecewise linear, any median is an optimal point forecast. Quantiles arise as optimal point forecasts under a general class of economically relevant loss functions, which nests the asymmetric piecewise linear loss, and which we refer to as generalized piecewise linear (GPL). The level of the quantile depends on a generic asymmetry parameter which reflects the possibly distinct costs of underprediction and overprediction. Conversely, a loss function for which quantiles are optimal point forecasts is necessarily GPL. We review characterizations of this type in the work of Thomson, Saerens and Komunjer, and relate to proper scoring rules, incentive-compatible compensation schemes and quantile regression. In the empirical part of the paper, the relevance of decision theoretic guidance in the transition from a predictive distribution to a point forecast is illustrated using the Bank of England's density forecasts of United Kingdom inflation rates, and probabilistic predictions of wind energy resources in the Pacific Northwest.

However, it starts from the position that previous attempts to classify and identify heterodox economics have been biased towards a priori definition. The paper aims to inform the discussion of the nature of heterodoxy with some empirical analysis. The paper examines survey data collected from a small/medium-sized sample of AHE members on the core concepts in economics. The paper applies factor analysis to the data. It also applies principles of biological taxonomy, and thence cluster analysis to the problem. The paper finds that within the self-identified community of self-identified heterodox economists there is little agreement as to whether members are pluralist, or what their attitude is to the mainstream. Indeed, there is little agreement on any core concepts or principles. The paper argues that there is little structure to heterodox economics beyond that provided by pre-existing (or constituent) schools of thought. Based on this study, heterodox economics appears a complex web of interacting individuals and as a group is a fuzzy set. These results would lead us to question further strict distinctions between heterodox, mainstream and pluralist economists.","Univ W England, Bristol Business Sch, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England",University of West England,"Mearman, A (通讯作者)，Univ W England, Bristol Business Sch, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England.",Andrew.Mearman@uwe.ac.uk,,"Mearman, Andrew/0000-0003-0601-8060",,,,,29,25,28,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The empirical findings seem to suggest that the World Islamic banks have exhibited high pure technical efficiency. A multivariate analysis based on the Tobit model reinforces these findings and significantly associated with operating expenses against asset, size, equity, NPL, Asia Financial Crisis and national income level (GDP). We also find positive correlation between bank profitability and technical efficiency levels, indicating that the more efficient banks tend to be more profitable with strong result at Asian Islamic banks. The Fixed Effect Model (FEM) that been used to analyze profitability proposed that profit efficiency is positive and statistically significant with operating expenses against asset, equity, high income countries and non performing loans against total loans. Interestingly, the empirical results show that more profitable banks are those that have higher operating expenses against asset, more equity against asset and concentrated at high income countries demonstrating close relationship between monetary factors in determining Islamic banks profitability.","[Ahmad, Nor Hayati] Univ Utara Malaysia, Coll Business, Banking & Risk Management, Sintok 06010, Kedah, Malaysia; [Noor, Mohamad Akbar Mohamad Noor] Univ Utara Malaysia, Coll Business, Sintok 06010, Kedah, Malaysia",Universiti Utara Malaysia; Universiti Utara Malaysia,"Noor, MANM (通讯作者)，Univ Utara Malaysia, Coll Business, Sintok 06010, Kedah, Malaysia.",ayati@uum.edu.my; mohamadakbamoor@yahoo.co.uk,,,,,,,26,0,1,0,12,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8719-3,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,3.0,,,,,,228,+,,,,,,2,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX67,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303218200047,0

Our research uses the priorly developed perceived environmental uncertainty scale.

Multilevel models reveal BRT improvements prompted property owners to convert single-family residences to higher density apartments and condominiums. Land price premiums of up to 10% were estimated for residences within 300 m of BRT stops and more than 25% for retail and other non-residential uses over a smaller impact zone of 150 m.

The results show that family ownership is significantly related to the use of behavioral strategic controls that, in turn, have a significantly positive effect on family firm innovation.

Yet in academia, research on social entrepreneurship is still lagging behind practice. Despite an increasing interest in social entrepreneurship research, there continues to be a lack of consensus about some fundamental questions such as what social entrepreneurship really means. Once the boundaries of social entrepreneurship have been set, it can be considered as an independent field of research, rather than as a sub-category of other research fields. In this context, the aims of our paper are to synthesise the current debate on social entrepreneurship, its conceptualisation, objectives and related discourse, and to develop a theoretical framework for the classification of it. This paper undertakes a critical review of the current debate onsocial entrepreneurship in the academic literature, with specific reference to the approaches to defining social entrepreneurship on both sides of the Atlantic. It suggests that social entrepreneurship can be generally understood in four ways, namely the commercial non-profit approach, the social purpose business approach, the third sector approach and the entrepreneurship approach. Although different perceptions do exist in different contexts, we argue that innovation, social change and sustainability are the essence of social entrepreneurship. Based on these core ingredients we differentiate social enterprises from other concepts and not-for-profit organisations such ascorporate social responsibility, philanthropy and NGOs. This paper finally proposes a conceptual framework to classify different types of social entrepreneurshipand their dynamic relations with the private, public and third sectors.","[Hu, Xiaoti; Frank, Regina; Cohen, Laurie] Univ Loughborough, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough, Leics, England",Loughborough University,,X.Hu2@lboro.ac.uk; R.Frank@lboro.ac.uk; L.Cohen@lboro.ac.uk,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,26,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,466,475,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800057,0

This has captured the attention of policymakers and given rise to a need for business-friendly initiatives targeting entrepreneurs and small businesses. The launch of publicly-supported business incubators appears to be one of these political initiatives. The purpose of this paper is therefore to provide the reader with an in-depth literature review on the subject of business incubation and to highlight gaps for further research. Literature within the field highlights different success and failure factors for business incubators. Some researchers argue that the primary value-added feature of business incubationis the structure and transfer of knowledge throughout the incubator network, thereby creating conditions that facilitate the commercialisation of the innovations of the incubatees. Others explicitly ground the importance of the relationship between the incubation manager and the incubatees in the interdependent co-production of a value-added incubation process, while newer research has focused on the importance of the networking elements of the business incubation phenomenon, stating that this is the most value-added factor incubation phenomenon incubatorinitiatives. These examples are only a few of those which seem to have an impact on BI initiatives and the entrepreneurial venture creation process which business incubators are meant to support. This paper therefore looks deeper into the field of business incubation. This review highlights different gaps in the literature and argues that business incubator initiators may believe that the value of their concept lies elsewhere, as customer satisfaction surveys have shown that there seems to be a mismatch between what entrepreneurs and startup companies want and what business incubators offer. The lack of focus on entrepreneurship theory within the business incubation field raises the question of whether business incubators offer and initiators really understand their clients and the entrepreneurial venture creation process.","[Jorgensen, Soren Berg] Roskilde Univ, Roskilde, Denmark",Roskilde University,,sberg@ruc.dk,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,50,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,939,945,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800112,0

A critical discussion of Giovanni Arrighi's arguments on the relocation of centre and periphery of the world economy. Based on data on GDP and on stock market capitalization, the paper takes issue with Giovanni Arrighi's notion of the terminal crisis of the US hegemony and the related relocation of the center of the world economy to China. While some indicators support Arrighi's argument (e.g. the shift of the accumulation dynamic from the material to the financial sphere), others don't. My analysis in this paper does not yield unambiguous results. Moreover, I question Arrighi's primary unit of analysis, national economies, maintaining that such a focus downplays the recent fundamental changes in the organization of the world economy.

This article presents evidence confirming their importance and highlighting an interesting feature of their interaction. Drawing on separate surveys of managers at industrial enterprises and directors of business associations in the Russian Federation, we demonstrate that a firm's willingness to contest government predation, its ability to influence reforms to its institutional environment, and its propensity to invest in physical capital are positively related both to the membership in a business association and to the level of political competition in its region. Of particular note, the relationship between association membership and property rights strengthens in less politically competitive regions. Business community collective action, that is, appears to serve as a substitute for political competition in securing firms' property rights.","Middlebury Coll, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA",,"Pyle, W (通讯作者)，Middlebury Coll, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA.",,,,,,,,55,26,36,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

An analysis of preferences for return migration to East Germany. In the public debate, brain drain from East Germany is supposed to be the most critical trend regarding the development and catching up of the New Lander. Therefore, potential for in- and re-migration has attracted much attention at least in the political context. Our contribution ana-lyses the re-migration potential on basis of data from a DFG research project focussing on the re-migration intentions of people formerly emigrated from Saxony-Anhalt. The analysis concentrates on the following aspects: the effect of job market success after emigration; the impact of social ties to the origin and the host region and on the selectivity of re-migration preferences. The econometric results confirm several expected effects: On the one hand an individual's job market success reduces the intention to return. Likewise, the re-migration preference increases for people whose expectations were disappointed. On the other hand, the relevance of social ties to the origin region for re-migration dispositions is confirmed by the estimations. Yet, regarding selectivity of re-migration preferences in terms of human capital econometric results are somewhat ambiguous.",,,,,"Schneider, Lutz/ADQ-1801-2022",,,,,,73,0,0,0,14,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

Arguing for heterogeneity and intangibility as sources of innovation originates from a theoretical reading in STS and ANT studies (e.g. Callon 1986, Latour 1996, Mol 2002, Pols 2005) and from field work in the area of mental health (Dupret Sondergaard 2009, 2010). The concept of sensitive innovation is developed to capture and conceptualise exactly those heterogenic and intangible processes. Sensitive innovation is therefore primarily a way to understand innovative sources that can be, but are not necessarily, recognized and acknowledged as such in the outer organisational culture or by management. The added value that qualifies these processes to be defined as innovative are thus argued for along different lines than in more traditional innovation studies (e.g. studies that build on the classic definition developed by Schumpeter that defines innovation as an effort by one or more individuals to create economic profit through a qualitative change by Schumpeter in 1934). These different lines are to do with acknowledging how innovative sources are heterogenic and intangible. Also, it is argued that to understand the sources of innovation one needs to capture, not only what people are identifying as innovative, but also looking into how artefacts are contributing in creating newness. Further, it is argued that even efforts that are not necessarily acknowledged by the outer organisational culture and/or by management may have important impact on innovating working practices that in turn add value to both the organisation, its staff members and its costumers or users. The paper is structured in the following way. First, the argument of heterogeneity in innovative processes will be presented. Second, aspects of intangibility relating to the understanding of innovation processes are argued for and discussed how heterogeneity and intangibility are important platforms of reference in sensitive innovation.","[Sondergaard, Katia Dupret] Aarhus Univ, Res Unit Innovat & Org, Danish Univ Sch Educ, Copenhagen, Denmark",Aarhus University,,katia@dpu.dk,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,8,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,235,241,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800030,0

These concepts, innovation and creativity, are the main ideas of entrepreneurship. The significance of welfare service enterprises especially has fundamentally increased in the 21th century. These enterprises are usually micro-sized and entrepreneurs are deeply committed to their enterprises. Moreover, this business sector is fairly new and there are numerous innovative enterprises. Hence, it is important to analyze the creativity of these especially innovative organizations. This paper introduces the elements of creativity and innovation in the welfare service sector. The strategy of this research is a multiple case study. Nevertheless, this is not a classical case study. In addition, the findings of this research are based on several enterprises and the phenomenon is in focus rather than the cases themselves. More profoundly, the research strategy is also extensive and mixed methods were used. The data were collected from questionnaires, the informants being welfare service entrepreneurs in eastern and north-eastern Finland. Data were analyzed using quantitative and qualitative methods. In summary, the welfare service entrepreneurs valued innovation and creativity. In addition, the enterprises also have an innovation and creativity oriented culture, accordingly they motivate their personnel to operate independently and creatively. Most importantly, the entrepreneurs experienced the innovation aspects as strategic for the operation of their enterprises. In conclusion, the results showed that the ability to innovate and create is regarded as an important success factor in the welfare enterprises. However, the competition in the welfare service sector has intensified. Above all, national medium-sized and larger organizations are taking over the markets and the entrepreneurs also mentioned these actors as a significant threat. The factors which enable welfare microenterprises to continue operating need to be studied. Furthermore, the results showed that the enterprises valued innovation and creativity, and these elements were seen as crucial to their continuation. Nevertheless, creating innovation is not systematic but rather haphazard, even if these enterprises have an innovation-oriented culture. Whether these micro-sized enterprises could be more innovative and creative than national larger organizations, if these activities were more carefully considered is an interesting question.","[Tarvainen, Tiina] Univ Eastern Finland, Joensuu, Finland",University of Eastern Finland,,tiina.tarvainen@uef.fi,,,,,,,37,0,0,0,4,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,812,819,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800097,0

Starting in the mid-1990s, seventeen states began posting information on a doctor's specific history of medical malpractice claims on state-run websites. The laws creating these sites altered the level of confidentiality that would accompany litigation and settlement. Taking into account the varying disclosure requirements across the states, we examine the impact of the altered levels of confidentiality on litigant behavior. We find evidence of two, non-exclusive effects of disclosure. First, we find evidence that defendants value confidentiality and are no longer willing to pay a confidentiality premium when websites disclose settlement outcomes. Second, we find evidence that website disclosure changes the composition of claims.

These parameters were measured for freight vehicles selected from the traffic stream and were compared to the criteria set up as a result of current Swiss policy. Results show that parameters that are currently controlled and their reduction encouraged such as gaseous emissions, axle loads and gross weight are indeed below or close to acceptable limits.

J,"Oguz, F",,,,"Oguz, Fuat",,,Competition by regulation in energy markets: the case of Turkey,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Antitrust policy; Competition; Regulation; Turkish electricity industry,ELECTRICITY; PRIVATIZATION,"A fundamental question facing the regulatory and competition authorities is whether to delegate competition policy issues of utilities to regulatory agencies or competition authorities. While, some countries prefer 'light handed regulation' by competition authorities, others grant substantial power to independent regulatory agencies. Turkey followed the liberalization wave in electricity with a regulatory reform in 2001. Recently, a slight shift of tide has appeared in previously liberalized markets. Electricity markets are the forefront example of this change of course. A similar trend is apparent in Turkey as well. Increasing pressures on prices and excess demand have created more reasons for active government involvement. As political factors weigh in, economic considerations take a secondary place in electricity markets. In order to show the tension between political and economic preferences, we use the Pareto and Kaldor-Hicks criteria of welfare economics metaphorically. This paper discusses the scope of competition policy in the Turkish electricity industry. We focus on the issue of regulatory governance. The absence of a well established institutional environment reduces the potential role of competition policy in the industry and increase political meddling in all segments of the Turkish electricity market. By looking into changes in prices, market power and new entry closely, we discuss the relative success of the regulatory reform in the electricity industry. We conclude by emphasizing the consequences of a passive competition authority in establishing a competitive electricity market.","Baskent Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06490 Ankara, Turkey",Baskent University,"Oguz, F (通讯作者)，Baskent Univ, Dept Econ, Eskisehir Yolu 20 Km Baglica, TR-06490 Ankara, Turkey.",foguz@baskent.edu.tr,,"Oguz, Fuat/0000-0001-6581-0328",,,,,24,7,7,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

The position of this paper is supported by hermeneutic analysis of the discourses of a group of social leaders in Pedro de Valdivia, an area of Temuco, Chile, with whom a research process was begun in 2008, together with a group of college students in the seventh semester of social work, that allows for mutual recognition to later be inserted in professional practices.

We build on this model of p2p to analyze the optimal strategy of a profit-maximizing firm, such as Apple, that offers content available at positive prices. We characterize the size of the p2p network as a function of the firm's pricing strategy, and show that the firm may be better off setting high prices, allowing the network to survive, and that the p2p network may work more efficiently in the presence of the firm than in its absence.","[Casadesus-Masanell, Ramon] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Hervas-Drane, Andres] Univ Pompeu Fabra & Barcelona GSE, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona 08005, Spain",Harvard University; Pompeu Fabra University,"Casadesus-Masanell, R (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Morgan Hall 233,Soldiers Field Rd, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",casadesus@gmail.com; andres.hervas@upf.edu,,,,,,,34,15,16,0,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Not surprisingly, citizens react angrily when the delegated powers are misused (i.e., used so as to decrease social welfare). Perhaps more puzzlingly, citizens sometimes repeatedly delegate the same power (e.g., surveillance of citizens, conscription), and then repeatedly react with anger to its misuse. To study this phenomenon, we model a stylized public that repeatedly adjusts the set of powers it delegates to politicians. The public obtains new information each period, forecasts rationally (but not perfectly) the benefits and costs of delegation, and infers the likelihood with which a court will correct politicians' misuses of delegated powers. We use the model to explore the history of eminent domain in the United States a history characterized by periodic public backlash. The model and historical discussion illuminate the nature of public responses to judicial rulings explaining why the public may react by adjusting the scope of delegated powers, even if a ruling merely upholds a well-established precedent.

Considering the long-run elasticity results, soyabeans (whether broken or not.) and meat of bovine animals (frozen) are the most sensitive import products, followed by maize, meat of bovine animals (fresh or chilled), sunflower seeds, and wheat and meslin.

A truism of the geography of finance, it is also a perspective that can shed light on the interaction between market location, global financial movements and personal welfare. In this article, we develop an explanation of the premium attached to being in the market, drawing upon previous contributions on the relevance of tacit knowledge and the insights provided by behavioural finance with respect to time-space myopia. To illustrate our model of four types of behaviour, mixing together various combinations of time and space conceptions of market performance, we analyse the intended retirement investment portfolios of nearly 2400 participants in a defined contribution pension plan sponsored by a London-based investment bank. Having demonstrated the empirical significance of the UK house-price bubble, respondents' retirement investment portfolios are analysed focusing upon the relative significance of property in relation to a range of other investment instruments. It is shown that, amongst similarly located respondents, there was a range of investment strategies dependent, in part, upon respondents' age, household status, job classification and income. These results allow us to distinguish between different types of behaviour even amongst well-placed respondents, providing evidence of the co-existence of sophisticated, naive and opportunistic investors against the base-case of time-space myopic behaviour. Implications are drawn for conceptualising a rapprochement between the insights of the behavioural revolution for economic geography (and in particular, the geography of finance) relevant for public policy.","[Clark, Gordon L.; Duran-Fernandez, Roberto; Strauss, Kendra] Univ Oxford, Ctr Environm, Ctr Employment Work & Finance, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Strauss, Kendra] Univ Glasgow, Dept Geog & Earth Scienes, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Oxford; University of Glasgow,"Clark, GL (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Ctr Environm, Ctr Employment Work & Finance, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",gordon.clark@ouce.ox.ac.uk,"Duran, Roberto/HPF-3738-2023; Duran, Roberto/GPJ-9674-2022","Duran-Fernandez, Roberto/0000-0002-9681-7693",,,,,64,17,18,0,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Further, endogenous access pricing results in a consumer surplus that is equal to or higher than that under exogenous access pricing.

The network cooperation resulted in the business-to-business electronic marketplaces. However, as the range as well as the number of companies operates via e-marketplaces, the need for efficient trust-building tools has emerged. In the case of globalization and huge networking factors, the large number of unknown companies is real problem, although this number can bring new competitive advantage through finding better and cheaper supplier or business partner. The absence of trust building mechanisms and strategies was identified within several studies and it is also the critical factor for the European initiative Digital Ecosystem. The paper provides the research results from the project focused on effective trust building strategies development for electronic business platforms. As trust was identified as one of the crucial electronic business adoption factors, mechanisms determining the trust building on the electronic business platforms were identified. Based on these trust building mechanism identification, the questionnaire-based analysis of its significance and minimum level was conducted and recommendations are formulated. Results shows that for the initial phase of e-marketplace project, it is needed to start with more simple services with generally high level of trust. Generally, companies prefer limited trusted services for low fee or free of charge. Acceptance of comprehensive specialized solution for the fee increases by increased e-skills. According to the research, banks are most trusted institution for escrow services. On the other hand, we recommend to provide also the integration of specialized escrow service company. As the level of increased trust is higher for e-skilled companies this solution will be still more and more trusted and provide more efficient, complex and effective way of escrow service.","[Delina, Radoslav; Drab, Radovan] Tech Univ Kosice, Ekon Fak, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Delina, R (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Ekon Fak, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",Radoslav.Delina@tuke.sk; Radovan.Drab@tuke.sk,"Delina, Radoslav/L-6141-2015; Dráb, Radovan/AAH-4044-2019","Delina, Radoslav/0000-0003-0412-9840; Drab, Radovan/0000-0002-6022-5995",,,,,28,27,27,3,39,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

For this reason, an increasing number of companies are trying to enrich brands and products with new cultural values and messages. The cultural aspects of products and brands are so relevant that lately several companies and organizations have aimed to link art and business to improve both society and corporate performance. If in the 1990s keystone contributions from Pine and Gilmore (The Experience Economy-Work is Theatre & Every Business a Stage, Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press, 1999), Schmitt (Experiential Marketing-How to Get Customers to Sense, Feel, Think, Act and Relate, New York: The Free Press, 1999), and Schmitt and Simonson (Marketing Aesthetics-The Strategic Management of Brands, Identity, and Image, New York: The Free Press, 1997) provided interesting and stimulating managerial visions, recent phenomena seem to show the necessity of providing something more than an experience. Gilmore and Pine (Authenticity: What Consumers Really Want, Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press, 2007) describe the concept of authenticity as the new business imperative; Holt (How Brands become Icons, Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press, 2004) demonstrates the success of some iconic brands with particular cultural connections. Focusing on two Italian companies (Diesel and illycaffe) that do not operate in the cultural industries but can be considered cultural producers, the paper analyzes several cultural projects, explaining their potential contribution to the competitive advantage. Collaboration with artists allows these firms to intercept and to interpret emerging cultural phenomena and consequently to anticipate the trends of the future. Cultural projects represent a sort of distributed research project that allows the co-production of future scenarios in collaboration with several categories of actors, such as famous artists, young talents and consumers. The co-development of cultural projects with external actors allows firms to reinforce connections and build communities of people who share similar visions and values.","Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Dell'Era, C (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, Piazza L da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",claudio.dellera@polimi.it,"Dell'Era, Claudio/AAF-5489-2019","Dell'Era, Claudio/0000-0002-4930-2208",,,,,55,17,20,2,49,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Individuals participate to different degrees and sometimes even distance themselves from the household they live in.

Both approaches have been used in valuing forest assets. A proof is presented which shows that, except under certain restrictive assumptions, DP using a constant discount rate and CC will not yield the same answers for investment value. A few special cases are considered for which CC and DP with a constant discount rate are consistent with each other. An optimal tree harvesting example is presented to illustrate that the values obtained using the two approaches can differ when we depart from these special cases to a more realistic scenario. We conclude that for real options problems the CC approach is preferred when data exists (such as futures prices) that allow the estimation of the market price of risk or convenience yield. Even when such data do not exist we argue that the CC approach is preferred as it has the advantage of allowing the individual specification of the prices of different sources of risk.

These are manifested in different forms (economic, social, environmental and others). Diverse macroeconomic regional indicators are used to express and quantificate the inter-regional differences. Among traditionally used and by experts acknowledged quantities of measurement of the inter-regional differences belong for example a gross domestic product (from diverse viewpoint and specification), labor market indicators, e.g. employment and unemployment rates, demographic development indicators, indicators assessing environment condition or standard of life, as well as the indicators quantifying the investments condition and development (domestic or foreign) that flow into the object territory since we consider them an important factor and precondition of growth and development of the state as a whole, as well as its individual regions. Presented contribution deals with an issue of the inter-regional differences formulation and measurement in the Slovak Republic on a NUTS 3 regions examination level (from an uniform system of the territorial units classification viewpoint), it means the autonomous districts (from a territorial-administrative order of Slovak Republic viewpoint), from direct foreign investments' point of view. In the contribution there are theoretically defined basic concepts with which we operate, a specified methodological procedure for the inter-regional differences formulation and measurement, a direct foreign investments condition analysis from 1997 to 2007 (development of the direct foreign investments during above period in all autonomous districts were subjected to a statistical examination) as well as statistical testing that will reveal a convergence (meaning a moderation/decrease) or a divergence (meaning a deepening) of the inter-regional disparities on the NUTS 3 level. In addition to an absolute formulation of the direct foreign investments condition we also quantify them in a relative proportional formulation (meaning a particular region's share on an overall direct foreign investments flowing to Slovakia).","[Koziak, Radoslav] Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Reg Dev & Publ Adm, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,,radoslav.koziak@umb.sk,"Kožiak, Radoslav/AAA-9190-2021","Kožiak, Radoslav/0000-0003-0888-7980",,,,,19,0,0,0,0,"SLOVAK ACAD SCIENCES, INST ECONOMIC RESEARCH",BRATISLAVA 1,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA 1, 811 05, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-7144-180-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,305,314,,,,,,10,Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Geography,BGW05,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000324343700025,0

Large firms comprise a business segment distinctive from small firms and giant MNCs, and are characterised by strong commitments to innovation. Conceptually, a framework is outlined that connects latecomer firms with the triad business segmentation model, local technology learning as summarised by reverse product cycle dynamics and clustering. Empirically, the study focuses on the evolutionary dynamics of a latecomer case study, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, to reveal important insights regarding the development of Taiwan's internationally competitive technological capabilities.

In his recent book Bios, he rereads biopolitics through the lens of his paradigm of immunization (Esposito, 1998, 2002) and tries to explain how, in modernity, a politics of life 'continually threatens to be reversed' into a politics of death. His philosophical analysis is profound, and his genealogical reconstruction of the modern superimposition of politics and life innovative. However, his claims are weakened by his usage of a very abstract notion of biopolitics, which fails to take note of the current impact of scientific programmes on the human condition and the emergence of new biopolitical figures. The review suggests that lack of any interest toward the history of science as well as toward more empirically-oriented analyses remains a serious shortcoming of influential political philosophers.","Univ Nottingham, Sch Sociol & Social Policy, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Meloni, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Sociol & Social Policy, Law & Social Sci Bldg,Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",maurizio.meloni@nottingham.ac.uk,,,,,,,36,6,8,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Export demand functions and error correction models for sawnwood, plywood, and veneer using data from 1961 to 2006 were estimated. Six categories of explanatory variables were hypothesized to determine export demand: world price of wood products, income of importing countries, Ghana's external debt, exchange rates, time-related variables, and policy changes (log export ban, reduction in annual allowable cut and the imposition of export levy on air-dried sawnwood). All variables except external debt were determined from augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root tests to be integrated of order one. The Johansen multivariate cointegration test showed that there was only one cointegration relationship in each timber product data. Exchange rates and income were significant determinants of exported timber products and had the theoretically expected positive signs. The three policy initiatives significantly reduced the exports of sawnwood. but increased the exports of plywood and veneer. Price was moderately elastic for sawnwood and plywood and had the expected negative signs in both cases, while it was positive and inelastic for veneer. The error-correction coefficients show that 68% of shocks to veneer exported is corrected in the following year, while only approximately 20% and 19% of this are corrected for sawnwood and plywood, respectively. Sawnwood and plywood face stiff competition in the international market and this has revenue and tax policy implications for Ghana's forestry sector. Policies that encourage domestic processing and restrictions on both legal and illegal harvesting would work to ensure greater value-added benefits to, and sustainable forest management in, Ghana.

A major way of gaining such resources is through knowledge derived from social networks. However, social networks may be quite different in nature such that the influence of these networks on growth of university spin-offs may vary, like according to tightness, strength, social heterogeneity and spatial proximity of network partners. In this paper, we first examine theoretical ideas on social capital and the role of social networks. This is followed by an empirical study of university spin-off firms to explore differences in social networks between two development stages and to estimate the influence of network characteristics on growth in these stages. Early stage spin-offs tend to employ networks dominated by tightness, strong relationships, more homogeneous partners and local partners, whereas networks of spin-offs in later stages tend to face clearly contrasting features. Furthermore, network characteristics tend to influence growth mainly in years following the early stage, with a positive influence of social capital in networks that are relatively open to new knowledge and information.","[Soetanto, Danny P.] Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Lancaster, England; [van Geenhuizen, Marina] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Delft, Netherlands",Lancaster University; Delft University of Technology,"Soetanto, DP (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Lancaster, England.",d.soetanto@lancaster.ac.uk; m.s.vangeenhuizen@tudelft.nl,"Soetanto, Danny/ABF-2842-2022","Soetanto, Danny/0000-0002-9168-5118",,,,,43,14,15,0,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

We further employ the microeconometric technique to analyze what kinds of globalization behaviors improve the quality of domestic firms' products. The empirical results show that the strategy of expansionary FDI is more effective than defensive FDI at improving product quality because it allows domestic firms to learn advanced technologies from guest countries.

Wal-Mart's price advantage over competitors for these products averages approximately 10%. On average, competitors' response to entry by a Wal-Mart Supercenter is a price reduction of 1-1.2%, mostly due to smaller-scale competitors; the response of the Big Three supermarket chains (Albertson's, Safeway, and Kroger) is less than half that size. Low-end grocery stores, which compete more directly with Wal-Mart, cut their prices more than twice as much as higher-end stores.

We identify that increased volatilities in four euro-based exchange rates are due to underlying structural changes. Also, we find that currencies are closely related to each other, especially in high-volatility periods, where cross-correlations increase significantly. Using Markov switching Monte Carlo approach we provide evidence in favour of Markov switching models, rejecting random walk hypothesis. Testing in-sample and out-of-sample Markov trading rules based on Dueker and Neely (Journal of Banking and Finance, 2007) we find that using econometric methodology is able to forecast accurately exchange rate movements. When applied to the Euro/US dollar and the euro/British pound daily returns data, the model provides exceptional out-of-sample returns. However, when applied to the euro/Brazilian real and the euro/Mexican peso, the model loses power.

The significant economic contributions of search firms as commercial intermediaries have important implications for antitrust policy towards search markets. As search firms generate more information about buyers and sellers, they become intermediaries for an increasing proportion of economic transactions. This article introduces the concept of the map of commerce to describe the extensive directory of business constructed by search firms. This article also introduces the concept of the circular flow of information to represent the comprehensive nature of the economic information managed by search firms. These firms induce information revelation through self-selection both by consumers and by advertisers. Consumers reveal personal information through the use of keywords and through their online behavior. Advertisers reveal company information by bidding on positions on the search page. Search firms employ information to match buyers with sellers more effectively and to increase earnings from advertising. The analysis shows that economic efficiencies generated by the circular flow of information depend on the strength of competition among search firms. The discussion considers antitrust policy towards Internet search markets, including issues of privacy, competition, and cooperative agreements.","[Spulber, Daniel F.] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Spulber, Daniel F.] Northwestern Univ, Sch Law, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University; Northwestern University,"Spulber, DF (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",jems@kellogg.northwestern.edu,"Spulber, Daniel F/A-8722-2009","Spulber, Daniel F/0000-0003-2697-6522",,,,,81,9,9,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

We first consider nearly cointegrated VARs, that is, stable systems whose largest root, lambda(max), lies in the neighborhood of unity, while the other root, lambda(min) is safely smaller than unity. In this context, we define the 'forecast cost of type I' to be the deterioration in the forecasting accuracy of the VAR model due to the imposition of invalid cointegration restrictions. However, there are cases where misspecification arises for the opposite reasons, namely from ignoring cointegration when the true process is, in fact, cointegrated. Such cases can arise when lambda(max), equals unity and lambda(min) is less than but near to unity. The effects of this type of misspecification on forecasting will be referred to as 'forecast cost of type II'. By means of Monte Carlo simulations, we measure both types of forecast cost in actual situations, where the researcher is led (or misled) by the usual unit root tests in choosing the unit root structure of the system. We consider VAR( I) processes driven by i.i.d. Gaussian or GARCH innovations. To distinguish between the effects of nonlinear dependence and those of leptokurtosis, we also consider processes driven by i.i.d. t(2) innovations. The simulation results reveal that the forecast cost of imposing invalid cointegration restrictions is substantial, especially for small samples.

I argue that vertical integration solves the distortion on movie run length created by the revenue sharing contracts used in the industry. Since I observe the same movie showing in the same period under different organizational forms in the Spanish market, I use a difference on different approach to exploit this variation and study differences in outcomes across organizational forms. I show that integrated theaters run their own movies longer than other movies, and longer than nonintegrated theaters do. This effect is stronger for movies of more uncertain demand due to higher contractual complexity. I also find that integrated distributors specialize in the movies of higher demand uncertainty.

Twombly, an antitrust plaintiff who tries to plead an agreement in restraint of trade under Section 1 of the Sherman Act must allege more than parallel conduct and an undefined conspiracy. Now, the complaint must include enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest that an agreement was made. Although the Court insisted it was not imposing a heightened pleading standard, it did require antitrust plaintiffs to provide enough details to make the claimed agreement plausible. In this article, I examine an important substantive consequence of Twombly's pleading regime. In more than twenty reported cases, federal courts have applied the new pleading standard to complaints alleging horizontal concerted action under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. In doing so, the courts have had to address a crucial defect in the substantive law of agreement: the Supreme Court's traditional definitions of agreement, which Twombly itself simply repeated, are too vague to help litigants and courts distinguish between consciously parallel conduct and concerted action. In the course of applying Twombly, however, the lower courts have adopted a more meaningful definition, one that requires that the parties have communicated to each other in ways that facilitate the parallel conduct. This clarification of the standard has important implications for the role of discovery in pleading and resolving claims of concerted action.","Univ Florida, Levin Coll Law, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Page, WH (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Levin Coll Law, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA.",page@law.ufl.edu,,,,,,,54,12,12,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

In particular, it has been argued that the pressures created by the prioritisation of shareholder value and the rise of new financial agents, such as private equity and hedge funds, are disembedding regional social relations, and empirical evidence illustrates the devastating effects that the short-term profit orientation of these agents can have on local economic development. The relationship between a local economy's integration into the global capitalist system and its development performance is, however, more ambiguous than might be expected. This article explores this connection in greater detail within the context of a regional cluster, namely the film and TV industry cluster in Munich-one of the leading centres for this type of industry in Germany-by means of addressing the adjustments related to the entry of foreign investors after the insolvency of the Kirch Group in 2002. Initially, the research adds weight to the suspicion that financial agents erode the long-term wealth- and employment-generating capacities of national corporations. In addition, however, the results also reveal the dynamic restructuring processes triggered by these players which, at least in the specific case investigated, provided an acknowledged corrective and contributed to the cluster's recent resurgence.","Univ Munich, Dept Geog, D-80333 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Zademach, HM (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Dept Geog, Luisenstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",zademach@lmu.de,,"Zademach, Hans-Martin/0000-0001-9927-6311",,,,,76,21,26,2,51,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Through an analysis of selected works in anthropology, economics and sociology, we begin by discussing the importance, meaning and framing of economization, as we unravel its trace within a variety of disciplinary backgrounds. We show how in combination, these works have laid the foundations for the study of economization. The second instalment of the article, to appear in the next volume of Economy, and Society, presents a preliminary picture of what it might mean to take processes of economization as a topic of empirical investigation. Given the vast terrain of relationships that produce its numerous trajectories, we will illustrate economization by focusing on only one of its modalities - the one that leads to the establishment of economic markets. With emphasis on the increasingly dominant role of materialities and economic knowledges in processes of market-making, we will analyse the extant work in social studies of 'marketization'.

After examining the utility patent applications forwarded to the US Patent Office by 24 Asian countries between 1965 to 2007, the study partially supports the claim that the digital communication revolution have influenced the competitive creativity development in Asia. However, the development growth model is shaped like a snail shell, and digital technologies have not been the silver bullet that promoted the leapfrogging of creativity in stagnating countries. Information and communication technologies (ICT) should be considered as a means of technological learning rather than the end of creativity development. The challenge of strengthening stagnating Asian countries to become competitive and innovative nations will continue until the next decade.

In our framework, the upstream firms are content providers (such as television stations) and the downstream firms are system operators (such as cable/satellite operators). We show that an a la carte regulation (i.e., a regulation that forces downstream firms to unbundle) leads to higher consumer surplus, if the unregulated equilibrium exhibits pure bundling (PB). Hence, our model predicts that in the television industry, which is mainly characterized by PB, an a la carte regulation will be beneficial for the consumers. If, on the other hand, the unregulated equilibrium is characterized by mixed bundling, then an a la carte regulation will increase consumer welfare provided that demand for multiple purchases is strong.","[Rennhoff, Adam D.] Middle Tennessee State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Jenning A Jones Coll Business, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA; [Serfes, Konstantinos] Drexel Univ, Dept Econ & Int Business, Bennett S LeBow Coll Business, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Middle Tennessee State University; Drexel University,"Rennhoff, AD (通讯作者)，Middle Tennessee State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Jenning A Jones Coll Business, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA.",rennhoff@mtsu.edu; ks346@drexel.edu,,,,,,,18,8,12,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

In malpractice suits, however, a growing number of courts are holding doctors liable for negligent acts that reduces a patient's chance of survival, even if the patient's chances for recovery have already been less than 50%. For lack of a general principle, a disparate variety of loss of chance rules seems in use. To provide some more systematic guidance, the present paper proposes to look directly at the interaction between the injurer's act and a random move of nature that captures the uncertainty. For any given move of nature, damages are still awarded on an all-or-nothing basis. If however, for lack of observability, moves of nature cannot sufficiently be distinguished, averages of correct damages over observable events are taken. While the scheme aims at compensatory goals of tort law, as a by product, it also generates efficient precaution incentives provided that due care standards obey the Hand Formula.

I study the evolution of the first postcommunist oligarchy by examining the careers of the 296 most prominent first-wave postcommunist business tycoons. Forty-three percent of them were insider oligarchs deriving their status from a privileged nomenklatura background dating back to the previous regime. The rest were outsider oligarchs with no such background. Compared with insider oligarchs, outsider oligarchs were younger, better educated, and disproportionately Jewish. Their initial business successes tended to happen in sectors neglected in the planned economy, but the overwhelming majority of them subsequently developed their own special relationship with the government.

We use the U. S. hospital industry in 1985-96 as a case study. A 1988 change in Medicare rules widened a preexisting loophole in the Medicare payment system, presenting hospitals with an opportunity to increase operating margins by 5 or more percentage points simply by upcoding patients to more lucrative codes. We find that having room to upcode is a statistically and economically significant predictor of whether a hospital replaces its management with a new team of for-profit managers. We also find evidence that hospitals that replace their management subsequently upcode more than a sample of similar hospitals whose management did not change.","[Dafny, Leemore; Dranove, David] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Dafny, Leemore] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Dafny, L (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,,,,,,,42,15,23,0,9,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

Here, we shall underline that location decision externalities precede local knowledge spillovers in the explanation of cluster aggregate efficiency, which thus requires us to focus on the sequential process of location and the nature of interdependences in location decision-making. To that end, we mean to associate cluster emergence with the formation of locational norms, and to study the critical parameters of their stability. These parameters relate to the type of decision externalities among more or less cognitively distant firms, which influences the weight and the resulting ambivalent role of knowledge spillovers at the aggregate level of clusters. We suggest two theoretical propositions which we test within a simple and general norm location dynamics modeling framework. We then proceed to discuss the results so obtained by comparing them with an emerging related literature based on the life cycle and viability of clusters.","[Suire, Raphael] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, CREM, F-35065 Rennes, France; [Vicente, Jerome] Univ Toulouse, LEREPS, F-31000 Toulouse, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Rennes; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Institut d'Etudes Politiques Toulouse (SciencePo Toulouse),"Suire, R (通讯作者)，Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, CREM, 7 Pl Hoche, F-35065 Rennes, France.",raphael.suire@univ-rennes1.fr; jerome.vicente@univ-tlse1.fr,"Vicente, Jerome/H-5784-2011; Suire, Raphael/S-6292-2016","Vicente, Jerome/0000-0002-0274-1799; Suire, Raphael/0000-0003-1735-9709; Vicente, Jerome/0000-0003-2556-2061",,,,,48,79,85,0,41,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Using detailed primary data about a cluster of software firms in Montevideo, Uruguay, the paper finds plenty of evidence of the existence of pure unintentional knowledge spillovers. In addition, it supports previous theoretical studies that have contended that there are also many knowledge flows that are to some degree produced purposively by local parties-these flows can be placed somewhere in between pure spillovers and pure market transactions. While the respondents themselves place most value on knowledge flows that are more or less purposively co-produced with customer transactions, a more objective statistical analysis shows that good product/service-innovation performance is associated with intensive use of flows with more pronounced spillover characteristics. The respondents possibly underrate the latter because of their invisibility and spontaneous nature. Heavy use of knowledge flows lying close to the market-transaction side of the spectrum is found to be associated with relatively advanced organizational capability, but not with product innovation. Overall, the findings point towards the relevance of cluster-based policies to promote innovation in a less developed country context. Various policy measures to stimulate the local circulation of knowledge are suggested.","[Caniels, Marjolein C.

In this paper, we provide empirical evidence that cumulated price variations convey meaningful information about multiple regimes in the realized volatility of stocks, where large falls (rises) in prices are linked to persistent regimes of high (low) variance in stock returns. Incorporating past cumulated daily returns as an explanatory variable in a flexible and systematic nonlinear framework, we estimate that falls of different magnitudes over less than two months are associated with volatility levels 20% and 60% higher than the average of periods with stable or rising prices. We show that this effect accounts for large empirical values of long memory parameter estimates. Finally, we show that, while introducing more realistic dynamics for volatility, the model is able to overall improve or at least retain out-of-sample performance in forecasting when compared to standard methods. Most importantly, the model is more robust to periods of financial crises, when it attains significantly better forecasts. (C) 2009 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

One such method that has been found to give consistently good results consists of simple equal-weighted averaging of the forecasts from a large number of different models, each of which is a linear regression relating inflation to a single predictor and a lagged dependent variable. In this paper, I consider using Bayesian model averaging for pseudo out-of-sample prediction of US inflation, and find that it generally gives more accurate forecasts than simple equal-weighted averaging. This superior performance is consistent across subsamples and a number of inflation measures.

These conditions stimulate nations to find new ways of enhancing their exports. This is why, probably, the bilateral approach of the international trade would stand a better chance and render greater accomplishments than the multilateral frame. To reach a multi-country agreement is a time-consuming process while a bilateral agreement can be concluded in a shorter period of time, covering more areas. In this paper we will try to figure out ways in which Romania and Egypt can develop their bilateral trade based on the long time relationship and on a mutual interest of increasing the volume and areas of trade From a Romanian perspective, an improved relationship with Egypt would lie within the new preoccupation of the government to develop the economic and political ties with the countries outside the EU and North America. For Egypt, Romania is considered to be a gateway to the EU and a bypass to the East and Central European market, especially that Romania is the second largest market in Central and Eastern Europe. The proposals made in this paper are just some of the multiple possibilities which could be approached by the two sides. They cover a general perspective but also point-to-point ideas for areas starting with agriculture and going down to a big diversity of industries. The success of these strategies depends on the willingness of the two countries to assume changes in the macro marketing environment especially the political and legal sides which could lead to a better trade frame for businesses from Romania and Egypt.","[Catoiu, Iacob; Edu, Tudor] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,iacob_catoiu@yahoo.com; tudoredu@yahoo.com; alaaradwan5@hotmail.com,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,76,86,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS71,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287984100011,0

The durability of Silicon Valley's innovative competence over the last seventy years also needs more explanation. The failure of several policy-makers around the world to reproduce the Silicon Valley cluster reveals the misunderstanding of the innovative dynamic in Silicon Valley. This study uses complex network theory - CNT (Barabasi, Newman Watts, 2006; Jen, 2006; Thompson, 2004a) to analyse the complex innovative capability of Silicon Valley and to understand the heterogeneity of agents and the multiplexity of ties that support creation and development of high-tech start-ups. As proposed by Barabasi (2002, p. 200), we view the economy as a complex network, whose nodes are companies and whose links represent the various economic and financial ties connecting them. Innovation and entrepreneurship are understood as resulting from the interactions of numerous economic agents. In a systemic perspective, by definition, the presence of a specific agent in a network induces specific interactions with other agents that could not take place if this agent were not there. Thus, the diversity of agents influences the dynamics of the system. The presence of venture capital (hereafter VC) firms in an innovative cluster opens potential specific interactions with other agents in the network (universities, large companies, laboratories) that determine a particular dynamic of innovation. In this perspective, what is distinctive about Silicon Valley is its complete and robust complex system of innovation supported by social networks of interdependent economic agents in which the VC firms have a specific function. Our perspective examines five different contributions of VC firms to Silicon Valley: financing, selection, collective learning, embedding and signalling. These five functions are different ways for the VC firms to interact with the other members of the complex network of innovation and to support the robustness of the system.","[Ferrary, Michel] Ceram Business Sch, F-06902 Sophia Antipolis, France; [Granovetter, Mark] Stanford Univ, Dept Sociol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Granovetter, Mark] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Granovetter, Mark] SUNY Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Granovetter, Mark] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",SKEMA Business School; Stanford University; Johns Hopkins University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; Northwestern University,"Ferrary, M (通讯作者)，Ceram Business Sch, Rue Dostoievski BP 85, F-06902 Sophia Antipolis, France.",Michel.Ferrary@Ceram.fr; mgranovetter@stanford.edu,,,,,,,71,198,232,8,278,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

This article points out that CRM should not be primarily understood as software only, but increasingly as management philosophy. Up-to-date technologies are considered only instrumental means when enforcing customer-focused strategy. One part of the research deals with connections, problems and possibilities of use of CRM in practice, in particular with customers' lifetime values (CLV), implementation of CRM in a company and problems and expectations from the point of view of the company's marketing activities and focused on the process of evaluation of the efficiency of CRM implementation, particularly on the metric of successful implementation and its effects.. However, organizations are still awaiting the improved market share promises and are rather slower at acquiring new customers. The speed of development in technologies such as the Internet, automation engines, interaction management and mobile communications is enabling this to happen, changing the way businesses interact and communicate with their customers but slower than in other European countries. This report is also analysing use of CRM system from marketing section's point of view.

Companies tend to work together in order to share their competencies, reduce various costs, consolidate limited resources, and hereby increase their productivity, innovativeness, and profitability. It must be emphasized that the role of clusterization is crucial in the development of SME sector, as small and medium-sized enterprises may benefit from economies of scale and extend the operation limits (size-related limitations of operation are characteristic of most small businesses). Clusters (and similar forms of interorganizational structures) create the environment for innovation and technological advancement. Therefore, small and medium-sized enterprises may gain additional benefits that include know-how, cost-saving options, innovative solutions, etc. The authors of this scientific study have concluded that the competitiveness of SME sector is closely related to the spread and extent of clusterization processes.","[Navickas, Valentinas; Malakauskaite, Asta] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Navickas, V (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Laisves 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",valentinas.navickas@ktu.lt; asta.malakauskaite@stud.ktu.lt,"Navickas, Valentinas/AAC-9651-2019; Navickas, Valentinas/GPX-0310-2022; Navickas, Valentinas/I-9119-2018","Navickas, Valentinas/0000-0002-7210-4410; Navickas, Valentinas/0000-0002-7210-4410;",,,,,24,31,37,1,33,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The fines are compared with those imposed by the European Commission over the period from 1999 to 2006. The main findings are that, while fines have increased significantly, this trend is due not to harsher fines but to less generous reductions under the Commission's leniency program. In some areas, the European Commission has not followed its own guidelines-fines are generally lower than set out, the way recidivism is penalized is incoherent, and many aspects of the fining process are unexplained or redacted. Estimated fine-to-sales ratios together with new research on overcharges and detection rates suggest that fines may be closer to those for optimal deterrence than previously thought.",,,,cento@casecon.com,,,,,,,33,9,9,1,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Special attention is devoted to the effect of conflicts between regulators. Professional conflicts signal to politicians that there is a high level of risk in implementing a given reform, thereby weakening their confidence in it. Conflicts also benefit interest groups, increasing their effectiveness vis-a-vis politicians. Using a unique data set on 32 attempts to reform Israel's financial market, I find that the greater the extent of conflicts among regulators and the greater the intensity of the opposition of interest groups, the lower the probability that a reform will be approved. These conflicts, together with the strength of interest groups, have led to repeated attempts to introduce reforms, so that it takes, on average, 10 years for a reform to be adopted.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Ben-Bassat, A (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",,,,,,,,30,5,5,0,10,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Public authorities and researchers are relying more and more on high-speed trains (HSTs), whose efficiency is supposed to lead to a modal shift from airplanes. However, most transport studies focus on the evolution of demand rather than supply, although it is basically the latter that determines environmental damage. In light of this fact, this paper aims to compare the overall dynamics in the supply of air transport in Europe compared to the HST supply and to examine empirically five city-pairs. The development of high-speed rail remains limited compared to the increase of air services. For a given city-pair, the decline in the number of flights depends on various conditions, including length of the HST journey and the strategies adopted by the airlines. Some carriers reduce their supply in terms of the number of seats but increase the number of flights in order to compete more effectively with the HSTs. Moreover, the competition between low-cost airlines and HSTs should be kept in mind and re-examined in a few years. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We illustrate the argument that when several plaintiffs file individually a lawsuit against the same tortfeasor, the resolution of the various cases through repeated trials produces positive informational externalities. When class actions are forbidden, these externalities only benefit to the later plaintiffs (through precedents, jurisprudence...). When they are allowed, the first filer may have an incentive to initiate a class action as far as it enables him to benefit from these externalities, through the sharing of information with later filers. We provide sufficient conditions under which a class action is formed, assuming a perfect discovery process. We also show that when contingent fees are used to reward attorneys' services, plaintiffs become neutral to the arrival of new information on their case.","[Langlais, Eric] Paris Ouest Univ, CNRS, F-92001 Nanterre, France; [Langlais, Eric] AgroParisTech Nancy, LEF, INRA, F-92001 Nanterre, France; [Deffains, Bruno] Univ Pantheon Assas, ERMES EAC CNRS 4441, F-75005 Paris, France",Universite Paris Saclay; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); AgroParisTech; INRAE; Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas,"Langlais, E (通讯作者)，Paris Ouest Univ, CNRS, 200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France.",bruno.deffains@u-paris2.fr; Eric.Langlais@u-paris10.fr,"Deffains, Bruno/F-2896-2018","Deffains, Bruno/0000-0001-9822-5272",,,,,16,4,4,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

The noteworthy financial resources used to conform port security to the ISPS Code standards are an interesting starting point to analyze the problem of competitive gap among ports, originating from the different ways these funds were raised by the States. The spread of international port security programmes, proposed by the USA, has not only increased this gap, but turned security risks in actual business risks. In such a scenario, it is worth to investigate how security influences the competition among ports, analyzing the approach to this topic from the perspectives of port management and governance and of the most competitive States world-wide. In such contexts, a pro-active port management capable of enhancing all those factors, including security, is necessary because such factors are able of increasing the attractiveness of a port. This article proposes the case of Rotterdam as a best practice, not only to demonstrate all competitive benefits stemming from an increased security of services being offered, but also to identify useful guidelines for minor ports willing to enhance security. Presenting the case of the Italian port system, we will show how such guidelines are useful to achieve the above-mentioned goal and offer the possibility of reaching a double outcome: economic growth of the single ports and reduction of the competitive gap between major and minor ports in a EU context.","[Parola, Francesco] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Business Studies, I-80133 Naples, Italy",Parthenope University Naples,"Parola, F (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Business Studies, Via Medina 40, I-80133 Naples, Italy.",francesco.parola@uniparthenope.it; giorgio.coppola@mit.gov.it,,,,,,,25,2,2,1,18,IST EDITORIALI POLGRAFICI INT,PISA,"CASELLA POSTALE N 1, SUCCURSALE N 8, 56123 PISA, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

The new method is based on the disaggregation of time series components through the STL decomposition procedure, the extrapolation of linear combinations of the disaggregated sub-series, and the reaggregation of the extrapolations to obtain estimates for the global series. Applying the forecasting method to data from the NN3 and M1 Competition series, the results suggest that it can perform well relative to four other standard statistical techniques from the literature, namely the ARIMA, Theta, Holt-Winters' and Holt's Damped Trend methods. The relative advantages of the new method are then investigated further relative to a simple combination of the four statistical methods and a Classical Decomposition forecasting method. The strength of the method lies in its ability to predict long lead times with relatively high levels of accuracy, and to perform consistently well for a wide range of time series, irrespective of the characteristics, underlying structure and level of noise of the data.

The backtesting of the BRW simulation, which involves different decay factors, together with a broad range of competing VaR models, has been performed on a sample of seven stock indexes and two commodities: gold and WTI oil. The results obtained show that the BRW simulation with an optimised decay factor relative to the Lopez (1998) size-adjusted function is among the best performing VaR models, second only to the conditional extreme value approach (McNeil & Frey, 2000). The optimised decay factors are sufficiently stable over time, giving economic justification to the optimisation because they do not change over longer time periods. Unlike most of the VaR models tested, in the large majority of cases, the optimised BRW model passes the Basel II criteria but yields significantly lower VaR forecasts than the extreme value approaches, thus resulting in a lower idle capital, i.e. lower costs.

Off-shore wind has higher levels of support than on-shore wind, as do technologies that are still in development such as wave and tidal. When off-shore wind, wave and tidal are added to the system, the cost of REFIT increases significantly.

But transportation policy makers have been rather ambivalent, if not indifferent, about carpool. Unlike cities in highly motorized societies, little is known about carpooling behavior in emerging economies such as China. This paper provides an initial discussion of carpooling in China by exploring a series of questions. What are the current practice and issues of carpool in Chinese cities? How do carpools in China compare with those in the motorized Western cities? Can carpools help Chinese cities mitigate the negative impacts of rapid motorization? Are foreign policies such as High-Occupancy-Vehicle (HOV) lanes transferable to China? Acknowledging the social benefits of voluntary carpooling, this paper argues: (1) bus lanes may be a better choice than HOV lanes when converting general motor vehicle lanes; (2) policies subsidizing carpoolers cannot be justified on either efficiency or equity grounds because a marginal carpooler is more likely transitioning from a transit user or non-motorized traveler than from a driver. Policy suggestions are proposed to Chinese decision makers. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

An example of these instruments is the integrated Impact Assessment system, which has been in place in EU policy-making since 2003. Impact Assessments are designed according to rational decision models and aim to enhance the neutrality and objectivity of policy-making. This paper draws a comparison between the rational paradigm emerging from the EU template and the empirical evaluations carried out to date on Impact Assessments.

Four major findings stand out. First, we find that survey participants trust in both types of Phillips curve relationships. Second, we find evidence in favor of nonlinearities in the price Phillips curve. Third, we take into account a kink in the price Phillips curve to indicate that the slope of the Phillips curve differs during the business cycle. We find strong evidence of this feature in the data which confirms recent theoretical discussions. Fourth, we employ our data to the expectations-augmented Phillips curve model.

First, formal models can be manipulated to draw out potential 'policy implications'. Second, given these theoretically derived implications, such models can be used to analyse specific policy questions. In recent years, both approaches have attracted attention in NEG work. This article assesses this 'policy turn' in NEG. It argues that the usefulness of NEG models for policy analysis is constrained by the questionable plausibility and credibility of those models. But at the same time, although proper economic geography can claim to be based much more closely on the observation of real-world phenomena, its methods and explanatory accounts are difficult to use for the sort of counterfactual 'what if' type policy analyses found in NEG. Each version of economic geography has epistemological strengths and weaknesses when it comes to policy analysis.","[Martin, Ron] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Sunley, Peter] Univ Southampton, Sch Geog, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",University of Cambridge; University of Southampton,"Martin, R (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England.",rlm1@cam.ac.uk,"Martin, Ronald/JPW-9668-2023","SUNLEY, PETER/0000-0003-4803-5299",,,,,49,38,43,3,50,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Despite significant differences between them, these theorists jointly promote an image of reflexivity as a culturally unstructured or disembedded reflection upon problematized conventions and beliefs. The paper turns this joint theoretical image into an empirical question. Focusing on the reflexive discourse sparked by the Enron scandal, it offers a grounded analysis of Enron-related articles published in the popular American BusinessWeek in 1997-2007. The analysis examines the rise and fall of the Enron icon and the sense-making process that followed its bankruptcy which, at that time, was the biggest in history. It shows that reflexivity had an underlying cultural grammar that paralleled that pertaining to the management of money. Its four primary principles were: minimizing 'costs' entailing loss of discursive status or persuasive effect; maximizing the use-value of a core truism; quantitatively cueing morality; and conducting discursive competitions. Capitalist reflexivity, the case study proposes, is based on an underlying grammar cast in the shape of its own beliefs.","Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Ramat Gan, Israel",Bar Ilan University,"Ailon, G (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Ramat Gan, Israel.",ailonsg@mail.biu.ac.il,,,,,,,85,15,16,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Design/Methodology/Approach: Water quality state in the reservoirs was evaluated by interpreting the results of physic-chemical and biological samples that were taken from monitoring stations. Results/Acknowledgements: For future generations to enjoy such finite resources there is a need for sustainable exploitation with recycling the used resources, achieved through water management. Implications: The water quality is affected by natural or anthropogenic factors, so it is necessary to adopt a water integrated management system which includes all domains at international level.

The impact of the forest-owner's age is introduced into the analysis through a parameter of perceived probability of surviving through a future period. This allows us to study the impacts of ageing on consumption and harvesting decisions as well as to see how the impact of taxes changes among different age groups of forest-owners. The results show that current consumption first decreases and then increases when moving from younger to older individuals regardless of whether non-timber assets are more or less heavily taxed through bequests than consumption. In general, we find that tax effects are dependent on the forest-owner's age. Age tends to intensify the increasing effect of the forest bequest tax on harvesting. The same is true with respect to the decreasing effect on harvesting of the inheritance tax imposed on non-forest assets. Furthermore, the forest-owner's age tends to intensify the effect on harvesting of the capital income tax imposed on forest assets, but diminishes the effect on harvesting of the capital income tax imposed on non-forest assets.

The advertising industry in Oslo is currently going through a restructuring process of adapting to the Internet as an emerging media channel for marketing, but struggles to benefit from collective learning. The established advertising agencies have been reluctant regarding the new opportunities in Internet-based advertising, which has allowed for a set of smaller and specialized web agencies to emerge, and who now possess the best skills within interactive advertising. The paper argues that there are two parallel epistemic communities in the localized advertising industry. It is shown that the advertising industry seems to have been caught in a path-dependent technological trajectory, and that in order for collective learning to unfold geographical proximity needs to be supplemented by cultural and epistemic proximity and compatibility.","[Bugge, Markus M.] NIFU Nord Inst Studies Innovat Res & Educ, N-0167 Oslo, Norway; [Bugge, Markus M.] Uppsala Univ, Dept Social & Econ Geog, Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Bugge, MM (通讯作者)，NIFU Nord Inst Studies Innovat Res & Educ, Wergelandsveien 7, N-0167 Oslo, Norway.",markus.bugge@nifu.no,,,,,,,58,9,13,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

It is an approach aimed at maintaining the function and maximizes the availability of assets at the lowest possible cost by performing the proper maintenance at the right time. This approach allows knowing, evaluating, plan, measure and controlling failures, and even accompanying the operating status of machinery. These concerns are expressed and processed through the concepts and methods of RAMS (reliability, maintainability / maintenance, availability, safety) [1]. These files contain the types of failures and their chronologies and the maintenance recorded as maintenance costs, duration and nature of failure. By exploiting these types of files, the operating parameters and health status of machines can be evaluated; therefore, the maintenance plans for production needs in real time for each machine can be understood (the objective of this work). To better characterize the failure and properly assess its consequences, a coefficient called the coefficient of proportionality of failures Kp has been introduced.

The orthodox interpretation is that the post-crisis era is typified by overly generous labor legislation granting higher minimum wages and other provisions; the rise in real wages adversely impacted the investment climate and employment growth. However, detailed sectoral analysis reveals very little evidence of a wage-driven profit squeeze. This article contends that Indonesia's current unemployment woes are best understood as the reflection of a demand-constrained economy, where important sectors are operating at around 70 percent of their capacity.

Performance measurement has become a topic of growing interest among theoreticians and practitioners especially since the late 1980s. So far, there were numerous studies that had as an objective conducting a diagnosis of the performance measurement process in organizations. This paper has two objectives: first of all we were interested in conducting an analysis of the performance measurement process in Romanian manufacturing companies and second of all we tested three hypotheses regarding the relationship between the performance measurement process and a number of variables such as: the size of the organization, the degree of IT use and the uncertainty of the business environment. The organization selected for this study have been chosen on the basis that they were manufacturing oriented. To gather data necessary for conducting our empirical study we used a questionnaire that was send to all manufacturing companies registered in the database Pro Business Romania 2010 from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. In order to test our hypotheses we conducted a factorial analysis to identify the main components of the variables used in our study: performance measurement and the uncertainty of the business environment. The results of our study show a partial validation of the first hypothesis regarding the relationship between the size of the organization and the performance measurement process,: the second one regarding the degree of IT use and the performance measurement process is fully validated and the last one regarding the relationship between the uncertainty of the business environment and the performance measurement process is again partially validated.","[Gavrea, C.; Ilies, L.; Stegerean, R.] Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,,corina.gavrea@econ.ubbcluj.ro; liviu.ilies@econ.ubbcluj.ro; roxana.stegerean@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"Gavrea, Corina/IQS-5315-2023; Stegerean, Roxana/ABC-1871-2021; Crisan, Emil/A-8698-2019","Stegerean, Roxana/0000-0002-0758-2993; Crisan, Emil/0000-0001-7076-3386",,,,,14,0,0,0,3,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-3-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,45,48,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI19,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306940000012,0

However, in Spain, this has not been the case. Until very recently, Spain was characterised by strongly rising house prices as well as by a high rate of vacant dwellings. This is the Spanish paradox. This exploratory paper attempts to explain this paradox from a welfare regime perspective. The Spanish welfare and housing system has a number of specific characteristics, such as a political ideology and culture of homeownership, a history of strong rural to urban migration, a large role for the family, and a relatively strict rent regulation and tenant protection. The paper will show that all these characteristics contribute to the Spanish paradox. The paper will also indicate how the Spanish paradox relates to the speculative bubble in the Spanish property sector that has recently burst.","[Hoekstra, Joris] Delft Univ Technol, OTB Res Inst, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands; [Vakili-Zad, Cyrus] Univ Toronto, Ctr Urban & Community Studies, Toronto, ON M5S 2G8, Canada",Delft University of Technology; University of Toronto,"Hoekstra, J (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, OTB Res Inst, Jaffalaan 9, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands.",j.s.c.m.hoekstra@tudelft.nl; cyrus.vakili.zad@utoronto.ca,"Hoekstra, Joris/JXN-1100-2024; Hoekstra, Joris/AAF-2290-2021","Hoekstra, Joris/0000-0003-0201-1785",,,,,39,41,44,1,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

The sample of our survey consisted of 193 companies in Greece. The data were gathered with the questionnaire method. The tests such as a-Cronbach and factor analysis have been taken to ensure the reliability and validity of the scale obtained. We used t-test to measure any statistically significant differences in the responses between the companies which hired an ERP consultant or re-engineered their processes and those companies which did not. The results show that companies which hired an ERP consultant for ERP selection and implementation and companies which re-engineered their procedures seem to rate technological benefits higher, in comparison with those companies which additionally did not use consultant services or did not re-engineer their processes. The findings of this study will be of value to any companies that are considering the inclusion of their techniques and operations in an ERP system and will provide stimulus for researchers and practitioners for consequent research in the field.","[Kanellou, Alexandra; Spathis, Charalambos] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Econ, Div Business Adm, Thessaloniki, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,,kanellou@econ.auth.gr; hspathis@econ.auth.gr,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,2,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-2-3,,,,2011,,,,,,,389,392,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI18,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306939900098,0

The social decision scheme theory (SDST) is summarized, and several simulations are presented to demonstrate the dependence of group aggregation accuracy upon factors such as group size, the accuracy and distribution of individual forecasts, and shared representations of the forecasting problem. Many advantages and disadvantages of group aggregation are identified and related to four generic methods of group aggregation (statistical aggregation, prediction markets, the Delphi method, and face-to-face discussion). A number of aspects of forecasting problems are identified which should govern whether or not group forecasting can be relied upon, and if so, what aggregation method should be used.

During the research there are made examples using long hemp fibres as reinforcement used in different proportions, at the beginning 50 and 70% from mass of composite, also varying the fiber coating number and directions. The tension test of the samples has been carried out. Experiments show- using hemp fibres as a reinforcer that is low energy requiring in growing and recycling, with negative CO2 balance and locally grown natural material, it is possible to reduce the costs of the material. After hackling hemp fibres to remove short fibres and remaining shives, layouts of parallel long fibers are prepared, covered with thermoplastic matrix fibres.

Second, this case study intends to investigate the strategies utilised by the Taiwanese respondent MNE subsidiaries to exploit China's location-specific factors, and then explore the firm performance of the Taiwanese respondent subsidiaries in China. The findings of this study suggest that most Taiwanese respondent MNEs, based on a cost leadership strategy, are keen to exploit China's lower-cost labour resources. However, the reality that the average labour cost in China (especially in the coastal provinces), is rising is also reflected in this survey result. Moreover, the high level of local sales seems to show that Taiwanese companies are creating more marketing networks to expand local sales in China's domestic market (a growth strategy). Taiwanese respondent firms are satisfied with their subsidiary performance in China, and are positive about the recent developments of China's location factors.","[Li, Chun-Sheng Joseph] Kainan Univ, Dept Business & Entrepreneurial Management, Luzhu 33857, Taoyuan County, Taiwan; [Henley, John; Ansell, Jonathan] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Business, Edinburgh EH8 9JY, Midlothian, Scotland; [Henley, John; Ansell, Jonathan] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Coll Management, Grad Inst Global Business & Strategy, Taipei, Taiwan",Nan Kai University Technology; University of Edinburgh; National Taiwan Normal University,"Li, CSJ (通讯作者)，Kainan Univ, Dept Business & Entrepreneurial Management, 1 Kainan Rd, Luzhu 33857, Taoyuan County, Taiwan.",d1211114@yahoo.com.tw; John.Henley@ed.ac.uk; Jake.Ansell@ed.ac.uk; tpdong@ntnu.edu.tw,,,,,,,50,8,9,0,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Prosperity and effective production are the most important reasons for continual development in the manufacture of products. All company want to product the most effective and with the most progressive method, which ensure the production with minimal costs. Optimization of manufactured process forces us to look for new methods for measuring of dimensions. The one of the basic tools to ensure product quality are coordinate measuring machines (CMMs). With these machines manufactured production can be quickly and accurately measured, CMMs can check the stability of the manufacturing process and to prove the conformity of production with a production documentation, etc. The most of the productions for automotive industry need this type of production control. Measuring machine is a device designed to measure the value of some physical quantity. Coordinate measuring machines are very important part of industrial and laboratory practice. Their massive development began in 70th. These CMMs allow the measurement of the complex geometry of part. In principle, coordinate measuring machines detect specific geometry of the measured object by locating space coordinates of several measured points.","[Novak-Marcincin, Jozef; Fecova, Veronika; Barna, Jozef] Tech Univ Kosice, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,,,"Fecova, Veronika/F-5510-2013",,,,,,4,2,2,0,2,TECHNICAL UNIV CLUJ-NAPOCA,CLUJ-NAPOCA,"STR CONSTANTIN DAICOVICIU NR 15, CLUJ-NAPOCA, 400020, ROMANIA",,,978-973-662-614-2,,,,2011,,,,,,,147,150,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDA57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000312344600033,0

The direction of relationship is also computed by using Granger Causality Test and the dynamic interaction is quantified by VAR results and Impulse Response Function at six lags. Results show that dollar exhibit bi-directional relationship whereas pound and yen have one sided influence on net foreign institutional investments. Further it is also evident from Impulse Response Function that exchange rate shocks die out in two days whereas net FII flows contain it for five to six days. On the other hand regression results validate that the net FII flows are positively correlated to rupee appreciation in dollar and yen and negatively correlated to rupee appreciation in pound and euro, but euro have insignificant influence in Indian economy.","[Raju, G.] GCET, Dept Management Studies, Greater Noida 201308, UP, India; [Shahab, Tanveer] GEMA Inst Management, New Delhi, India; [Kumar, Santosh] Amity Business Sch, Finance & Accounts, Noida, India; [Tavishi] Amity Business Sch, Econ, Noida, India; [Khatua, Ashish K.] Tata Steel Ltd, Business Anal, Jamshedpur, Bihar, India",Galgotias College of Engineering & Technology (GCET); Amity University Noida; Amity University Noida; Tata Sons; Tata Steel Limited,"Raju, G (通讯作者)，GCET, Dept Management Studies, Greater Noida 201308, UP, India.",drrajug@yahoo.co.in; tanveershahab@gmail.com; santosh.frm@gmail.com; tavu.tavishi@gmail.com; silu10@gmail.com,"Tewary, Tavishi/AAT-9922-2020; Kumar, Santosh/AAI-4736-2020","Tewary, Tavishi/0000-0001-9414-5320;",,,,,5,0,0,0,0,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8719-3,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,3.0,,,,,,273,+,,,,,,2,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX67,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303218200056,0

On the one hand, regulatory-driven environmental innovation may impose additional costs to firms and lower their profits. On the other hand, eco-innovators could profit from lower uncertainty in innovation due to regulatory standards and demand-generating effects of regulation. In this paper we analyse (a) whether regulation-driven environmental innovation generates similar innovation success compared to other types of product and process innovation, and (b) whether regulation-driven environmental innovation increases or decreases firm success (as measured by return on sales). Using firm data from the German innovation survey, we find that both product and process innovations driven by environmental regulation generate similar success in terms of sales with new products and cost savings as other innovations do. However, we find different effects when looking at the field of environmental regulation that triggered innovations. Regulations in favour of sustainable mobility contribute to higher sales with market novelties while regulations in the field of water management lower this type of innovation success. With regard to a firm's price-cost margin, new processes implemented in order to comply with environmental regulation requirements lower profitability, indicating higher costs for this type of innovation which cannot be passed on through prices. Higher profit margins can be observed for firms with innovations triggered by regulations on recycling and waste management as well as on resource efficiency.","[Rennings, Klaus; Rammer, Christian] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, D-68034 Mannheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Rennings, K (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, POB 103443, D-68034 Mannheim, Germany.",rennings@zew.de,"Rammer, Christian/ABA-8789-2021","Rammer, Christian/0000-0002-1173-9471",,,,,33,216,229,10,197,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Concretely with a potential which marketing research disposes with within these questions. a brief literature overview shows consumer expenditures as a result of product and service seeking, from that consumers expect satisfying of their needs. On the basis of introduced determination authors realized a marketing research which main aim was to enable more detailed insight into this economic category. The data was divided according to the data of the European Bureau of Statistics, the percentage compound of consumption expenditures. For better comparison possibilities, the structure of individual market subject consumption expenditures was added. The structure was averaged to original 15 European Union member countries, which are considered as the most developed regions. Before analysing the results of this marketing study the structure of consumer expenditures development of Czech households is briefly outlined. Its scheme shows a gradual convergence to EU15 countries. Realized facts in combination with a marketing insight into consumer expenditures realization served as a starting-point for an analysis of factors forming a consumer's buying decision. Summary of results enabling both relative and absolute comparison through surveyed consumption categories and influencing factors is presented at the end of the article. Except confirmation of intuitively perceived facts (whose explicit confirmation authors regard as exceptionally valuable), there were found several relatively surprising facts providing new possible points of view on consumer decision making process and results.","[Stejskal, Ladislav; Stavkova, Jana] Mendel Univ Agr & Forestry Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Mkt & Trade, Brno, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Stejskal, L (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Agr & Forestry Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Mkt & Trade, Brno, Czech Republic.",ladislav.stejskal@mendelu.cz; stavkova@mendelu.cz,"Stávková, Jana/T-8950-2017","Stávková, Jana/0000-0002-0889-0218",,,,,5,2,2,1,9,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Recent studies have shown that 'technology-push' innovation strategies have a higher positive impact on a firm's performance compared to 'market-pull' approaches. According to the resource-based view (RBV), companies accumulate technological resources by exploration or exploitation to enable technology-push innovations striving for the development of core competencies. In our research, we focus mainly on technology-intensive small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). We are especially interested in non-technological capabilities such as managerial, organizational and social capabilities, how they contribute to the firm's technological competence and influence long-term business success. We understand technological competence to be a multi-dimensional construct of second-order which contains five dimensions: learning capability, production management, R&D management, technology management and culture in R&D. These dimensions are determined by the firm's resources. Therefore, our main research question is how to measure technological competence and how it influence innovation activities leading to a sustainable competitive advantage. In our model, we propose that the higher the technological competence, the higher the company's innovation performance and its influence on a lasting business success. As we are interested in additional effects influencing the relationships mentioned above, we embed the model in a suitable framework. We include effects representing the company's environment such as an intense competition or the speed of technology diffusion. Beyond that, we integrate factors which can boost innovation performance beyond core technology competencies such as marketing and sales activities. For testing the model's inherent hypotheses, we use structural equation modeling with the partial least square (PLS) approach. In this paper, we present our model with constructs and relationships. So far, it has been evaluated on a qualitative level through expert interviews and focus groups. One key result from qualitative evaluation indicates that managerial capabilities as well as an innovation oriented culture have a highly significant impact on a company's technological competence. Furthermore, the experts consider continuous innovation more important to maintain and achieve sustainable competitive advantage than a high innovation degree. In preparation for data analysis of the quantitative survey where we will contact more than 6.200 technology-intensive SMEs in Germany, we propose a multi-level validation procedure for testing the model.","[Stelzer, Birgit; Brecht, Leo] Univ Ulm, Inst Technol & Proc Management, D-89081 Ulm, Germany",Ulm University,,birgit.stelzer@uni-ulm.de; leo.brecht@uni-ulm.de,,,,,,,47,0,0,0,15,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,1029,1039,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800122,0

The paper also examines the change management procedures (strategic, operational, personnel attitude/behavior) that will have to adopted by the users organization, once the technological changes (mobile access to the organization's ERP) have been achieved. Prior Work The paper is trying to build on the technological architectures that are being discussed in the ERP industry for evolving ERPs to be accessed via mobile devices such as iPad, Blackberries, iPhone, etc. The paper will also focus on the change management models that an organization will have to adopt as they apply to the use of mobile technologies by ERP users. Currently ERPs are not as effective as they should be because their difficulty of use has created a negative impression to users. Since ERP users have become more familiar with mobile technologies, providing mobile access may encourage ERP users to become more positive towards using the organization's ER?, therefore allowing managers and employees to become more effective. Design / Methodology Approach The approach will be that of developing a general conceptual model based on observation. Case studies of real ERPs evolved for mobile access will be briefly discussed in the Benefits section of the paper. Results / Acknowledgements The results from evolving ERPs for mobile access will address real-life situations where demand for uninterrupted mobile device access to the central ERP originates from workers on the move (e.g. truckers on the road, technicians on site, an ambulance on its way to the hospital) to executives (in a taxi to the airport or on holiday where there's been a power-cut). The ability to access the information stored in an organizations ERP anytime/anyplace will give managers a competitive advantage. Implications The implications relate mainly to practitioners (i.e. ERP users) that will be able to access their central ERP via mobile devices. Originality Value The paper's added value is its proposal of a questionnaire for ERP users with regards to their willingness to use mobile devices to access the ERP data, based on the original questionnaires conducted by Fred Davis, creator of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM).","[Tsioras, Constantinos; Katarachia, Androniki] Technol Educ Inst Western Macedonia, Thessaloniki, Greece",,,tsiorasc@netscape.net; akatarac@pme.duth.gr; stefanos.katsavounis@gmail.com,"Katsavounis, Stefanos/R-8204-2019","Katsavounis, Stefanos/0000-0001-8988-2457",,,,,6,0,0,0,9,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-2-3,,,,2011,,,,,,,421,424,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI18,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306939900106,0

We have revealed a trend of increasing regional inequality and find it is mainly a result of the rapid development of Sunan (Southern Jiangsu), which also results in rising rural inter-county inequality. Subei (northern Jiangsu) faces more challenges due to the strong effects of self-reinforcing agglomeration and the constraints of geographical barriers. The spatial Markov chain analysis reveals that the development status of neighbouring counties has a strong influence on a county's development dynamics; a poor county neighbouring relatively richer counties has a higher possibility to move upwards, and vice versa. The geographically weighted regression analysis reveals that development mechanisms have strong local characteristics and the same mechanism affects regional development differently.

Institutional approaches to public finance often employ the metaphor of 'budgetary commons'. Although intuitively appealing, the notion of budgetary commons faces the danger of becoming a catch-all term that is simply taken as a starting point for an inquiry, without scrutinising the fit between the metaphor and the actual setting. In addressing this shortcoming, the literature on budgetary commons can learn from Elinor Ostrom and the analytical approaches she has advocated in her research on natural commons. This article brings out insights from Ostrom's work that would be particularly useful for institutional analysis of budgeting. It shows that institutional approaches to public finance can draw on Ostrom's work with regard to the general approach for examining institutional configurations and their evolution over time, the analytical structures she uses for conceptualising the problems occurring on the commons, the desire to understand institutional complexity in real-life settings, and her scepticism of over-simplified models that are often used for describing and understanding the problems of common-pool resources.","Tallinn Univ Technol, Dept Publ Adm, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,"Raudla, R (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, Dept Publ Adm, Akad 3, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia.",ringa.raudla@gmail.com,"Raudla, Ringa/AAJ-5845-2020","Raudla, Ringa/0000-0003-4905-0685",,,,,105,22,24,0,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

This article shows how the professions, because of their central role in contemporary economy, provide an example of both the political- and cultural-economic production of international markets. Drawing on interviews conducted in the European executive search industry, we examine how firms and professional associations have combined cultural- and political-economic strategies of professionalization to legitimize the internationalization of the industry. We show how the success of these approaches is determined by the degree to which geographical variability exists in the use of cultural- and political-economic market production and legitimation tactics. We suggest that there is scope to bring work on the sociology of the professions into closer dialogue with work on the internationalization of professional services in ways that can be beneficial for wider debates about the 'production of markets'.","[Beaverstock, Jonathan V.; Hall, Sarah J.

The Australian approach to evaluation has some unique characteristics, especially a focus on evaluating research quantity and quality by the field of the research activity rather than by individual academic or administrative unit. This raises issues of the classification of areas of research, which has already caused controversy for Australian heterodox economists. There is also controversy about the quality rankings of economics journals.

AFVs in this paper refer to any cars run on alternatives to petrol and diesel. This research attempts to ascertain whether reductions in fuel costs, vehicle registration tax (VRT), or green house gas emissions would encourage individuals to purchase a HEV or an AFV instead of a conventional vehicle. VRT is an Irish tax that is levied on the purchase of new vehicles. One of the motivations to conduct this research was to examine a new car tax and VRT scheme introduced by the Irish government in 2008. This new policy rewards the purchase of environmentally friendly cars, with lower VRT and car tax rates. To understand individuals' perceptions of these new taxes a survey was sent to recent customers of a car company in Ireland. The survey asked respondents about their recently purchased vehicle and how important they considered vehicle attributes such as environmental performance, fuel cost, and safety, before making their car purchase. The survey also contained a number of stated preference experiments that were designed to ascertain what factors influence individuals' decisions when purchasing their new car. The results showed that respondents did not rate green house gas emissions or VRT as crucial attributes when purchasing a new vehicle. The vehicle attributes that respondents rated most highly were reliability, automobile safety, fuel costs, and the cost price. The majority of respondents agreed that HEVs and AFVs are better for the environment, cheaper to run than conventional vehicles and would be the vehicle of choice in ten years time.

The importance of this filtering process has long been recognized in the literature; the typical reason advanced for its failure has been biases (in codes or among judges). In this paper we show that bankruptcy costs can be another source of such filtering failure. We illustrate this with the Colombian reform of 1999. Using data from 1,924 firms filing for bankruptcy between 1996 and 2003, we find that the prereform reorganization proceedings were so inefficient that the bankruptcy system failed to separate economically viable firms from inefficient ones. In contrast, by streamlining the reorganization process, the reform contributed to the improvement of the selection of viable firms into reorganization. In this sense, the new law increased the efficiency of the bankruptcy system in Colombia.","[Gine, Xavier; Love, Inessa] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Giné, X (通讯作者)，World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",,,,,,,,49,11,11,2,21,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Empirical evidence indicates that with three additive components a time-varying mean of absolute returns and two cosine components with time-varying amplitudes together they capture very well the pronounced periodicity and persistence behaviors exhibited in the empirical autocorrelation pattern of IBM returns. We find that the long-run volatility persistence is driven predominantly by daily level shifts in mean absolute returns. After adjusting for these intradaily components, the filtered returns behave much like a Gaussian noise, suggesting that the three-components structure is adequately specified. Furthermore, a new volatility measure (TCV) can be constructed from these components. Results from extensive out-of-sample rolling forecast experiments suggest that TCV fares well in predicting future volatility against alternative methods, including GARCH model, realized volatility and realized absolute value.

The lawsuit ended with consent decrees limiting the ability of airlines to communicate surreptitiously through the shared fare database. This paper measures the effects of the litigation and its settlement on industry performance, comparing changes in outcomes between market segments that were more and less likely to be affected by the ATP case. Prices fell in response to the investigation but increased following the settlement, while the number of tickets sold in affected markets declined. The importance of multimarket contact also declined and then recovered.

We estimate separate probit models for men and women using Grand Slam tennis match data from 2005 to 2008. The explanatory variables are divided into three groups: a player's past performance, a player's physical characteristics, and match characteristics. We estimate three alternative probit models. In the first model, all of the explanatory variables are included, whereas in the other two specifications, either the player's physical characteristics or the player's past performances are not considered. The accuracies of the different models are evaluated both in-sample and out-of-sample by computing Brier scores and comparing the predicted probabilities with the actual outcomes from the Grand Slam tennis matches from 2005 to 2008 and from the 2009 Australian Open.

Using trial data from 2004 to 2007, we test whether there has been a systematic difference in trial outcomes between criminal defendants with different types of defense counsel, and examine relevant policy implications. Our study finds that while public defenders and government-contracted legal aid attorneys are about equally effective, they tend to adopt different litigation strategies which will in turn affect their clients' fates. Specifically, the defendants represented by public defenders tend to have higher conviction rates, but shorter sentences if they are convicted. These differences can be explained in term of the inherent differences in the institutional characters for the two types of counsel and the pecuniary incentives they face. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

I argue that proving a given practice anticompetitive or efficient can be usefully framed as an identification problem. I need to spell out in detail not only the anticompetitive story, related to the type of alleged anticompetitive strategy, but also the alternative competitive explanation, extracting the empirical predictions of the two. Comparing the latter, I can identify the factual elements that, occurring under both circumstances, are admissible under both of them, and those that instead, being specific to one of the stories, allow for discriminating between them. I apply this approach to a recent Italian case [Mercato del Calcestruzzo Cellulare Autoclavato, No. A372 (Autorita Garante della Concorrenza a del Mercato, 24 October 2007)] of selective price cuts, an example of predation where the dominant firm tries to eliminate a competitor by selectively offering discounts to the clients of the target. On the basis of a rich empirical analysis, the Authority condemned RDB, a medium-sized firm active in the market for construction materials. I show that, once the two stories are properly described, the evidence provided in the decision of the Antitrust Authority is consistent with a competitive strategy of decentralized price negotiation, whereas it is in sharp contrast with the empirical predictions derived from a predatory model of selective price cuts.","[Polo, Michele] Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy",Bocconi University,"Polo, M (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy.",michele.polo@unibocconi.it,"Polo, Michele/AAD-9444-2020",,,,,,6,3,3,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

J,"Cass, RA",,,,"Cass, Ronald A.",,,COMPETITION IN ANTITRUST REGULATION: LAW BEYOND LIMITS,JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ECONOMIC-ANALYSIS; RULE; FIDELITY; US,"Twenty-five years ago, Frank Easterbrook published his essay The Limits of Antitrust, in which he argued for a set of filters that government enforcement authorities and judges could use to test the propriety of a given action under the antitrust laws. That essay aptly exposed serious concerns about expansive use of antitrust laws, especially at the behest of lagging competitors of the enforcement target, contributing to a movement toward less ambitious use of antitrust law in the United States. More recently, changes in academic theories coupled with developments in the law outside the United States have set the stage for a reversal of the forces aligned with Judge Easterbrook's arguments. This article identifies reasons for supporting a more limited deployment of antitrust (competition) law, describes ways in which law in the United States has evolved toward greater congruence with that approach, and explores the forces that are now pulling the law in the opposite direction. Critically, the increased availability of alternative enforcement regimes with relatively low jurisdictional thresholds has created forum-shopping incentives for complainants. At the same time, antitrust regulators frequently will have incentives to behave in ways that encourage forum-shopping. This behavior will threaten to undermine results in line with Judge Easterbrook's work, creating special risks to competition in markets with a dominant firm.","[Cass, Ronald A.] Boston Univ, Sch Law, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Cass, Ronald A.] Int Ctr Econ Res, Turin, Italy",Boston University,,roncass@ruleoflaw.org,,,,,,,114,3,4,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Phillips' book defends a non-corporatist version of multiculturalism which rejects essentialized conceptions of culture and grounds the challenge to the under-representation of minority groups in the rights and needs of individuals not groups. However, reading this in the light of Phillips' other work raises questions over the necessity of invoking a notion of culture at all, rather than relying on the arguments based on individual rights and equality of outcome that Phillips makes elsewhere.

To perform the study, we conducted a questionnaire survey with 445 owners/executives of manufacturing firms. We measured business capabilities in terms of management, production, marketing-sales, information system, logistics and external relationship dimensions. Component factors and key variables for the constructs, which are identified through a literature review, are confirmed using AMOS 16.0. Then data have been analyzed to test the hypothesis by using SPSS 15.0.

Methodology was based on real cases of universities in Latin America that serve as references to specify the observations. Knowing, truth, knowledge, ethics, science, academe, society, power and transformation arc categorical categories, inseparable from university autonomy, which cannot be conceived without constant interaction with the state and society. Since knowing is the determining power for achieving transformation, even though sometimes power generated by money and violence overcomes it, the role played by universities is subject to permanent contradictions and antagonisms with the state, society or factic powers, independent of their ideology, precisely because due to knowledge, universities are a power in themselves; furthermore, they are also society itself. Without a doubt, truth loses its meaning without the transforming application of reality to valuate absolute principles of liberty, quality or equity. To create thought, science and contribute to erecting a knowledge society with a universal approach should be the fundamental role of autonomy.","[Avila J., Nelson] Univ Paris 08, Ctr Invest Econ Amer Latina, F-93526 St Denis 02, France",Universite Paris-VIII,"Avila, N (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 08, Ctr Invest Econ Amer Latina, F-93526 St Denis 02, France.",patigluz@yahoo.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,1,3,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

The aim of this article is to set out the future research area of competitiveness theory taking into account the development of competitiveness concept and existing research tendencies. On the one hand, for developing the new concept of competitiveness, it is necessary to critically analyse existing studies on competitiveness. Researchers, examining the problems of competitiveness, differently approach the concept of competitiveness, suggesting different definitions, classification, factors, models of competitiveness, and evaluation criteria. Despite all the discussions on competitiveness however, no clear definition or model of competitiveness has yet been developed. On the other hand, globalization, economic dynamism and social progress, sustainability and competitiveness go hand-in-hand. Competitiveness should be underpinned by a broad vision for the economy and society. There is a need of research initiatives to develop the new concept of Sustainable competitiveness in the context of globalisation, with much of the research focusing on how sustainable development and competitiveness interact. Such additional research will lead to new theoretical models describing the relationships between international globalization, economic growth, sustainable development, wellbeing and competitiveness.","[Balkyte, Audrone] Off Prime Minister Republ Lithuania, Unit Strateg Anal, LT-01103 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Balkyte, Audrone] Long Term Planning Strateg Coordinat Dept, LT-01103 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Tvaronaviciene, Manuela] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Econ & Management Enterprises, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Balkyte, A (通讯作者)，Off Prime Minister Republ Lithuania, Unit Strateg Anal, Gedimino Pr 11, LT-01103 Vilnius, Lithuania.",audronebalkyte@gmail.com; manuela@vgtu.lt,"/I-3713-2019; Tvaronaviciene, Manuela/GVT-4155-2022","/0000-0002-9667-3730; Tvaronaviciene, Manuela/0000-0002-9667-3730",,,,,73,137,158,13,132,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

However, there are concerns that such website ranking service will create a space of commercial fraud and unfair competition, more and more corporations will be kidnapped by this marketing mode because of the market dominant position of Baidu.com in the Chinese search engine service industry. Therefore, lack of legal risk management for the search engine companies in this field has made the website ranking service a significant source of disputes.

The cooperation means the establishment of long-term relations of production between economically and legally independent enterprises. The measurement of the level of cooperation achieved plays an important part in this process because it helps to determine the effect of cooperation on the efficiency of commercial activities of an enterprise, as well as the extent of cooperation influence, the conditions required for effective cooperation of enterprises, etc. In the present investigation, the analysis of the cooperation influence on the competitiveness of an enterprise is made, based on the suggested formula for determining the level of the cooperation achieved by enterprises. The analysis performed shows that this influence is not strong, implying that the appropriate organisational forms of cooperation have not been found yet. Cooperation mainly affects the profitability of an enterprise. The analysis of cooperation in the area of production shows that cooperation in production, and the development of new technologies and new products is most important for achieving enterprise profitability.

The differences often aggravate the social tensions based on ethnic, cultural, geographical, linguistic or religious differences, what is one of reasons to mitigate regional disparities. The mechanisms of regional convergence and divergence are well described, although there several other factors exist such as national factor of regional dependence or border factor that work as obstacles to spatial spillovers. In a light of the recent theoretical research, regional growth depends on a number of external and internal qualitative attributes, formal and informal institutions, regional innovation system, knowledge base, social capital, innovation governance, etc. The attributes can be summarised for both regions by defining problem areas and Regional innovation system deficiencies based on several studies (Todtling, Trippl 2004, Cooke 2004, Asheim et al. 2007). Both regions show mixed characteristics of both old industrial (OIR) and peripheral regions (PR). The border, national effect and lock in factors are studied on the example of two border regions of Northern Hungary and Eastern Slovakia. Both of them are border regions, including the Schengen border with the Ukraine. In a comparison to quickly growing metropolitan regions of Budapest and Bratislava, raising regional disparities between the capitals and the north/eastern parts of the countries are typical after unlocking the regional potential in the open economic space of European Union. From the economic point of view, both regions show up similarities such as heavy industry heritage, peripheral position to their metropolitan regions, similar level of regional GDP, similar degree of rurality - it means an expectation of the same problems and assumption of cross-border understanding. On the other side, the historical, cultural, political, legal conditions of trans-boundary activities make the development process of potential consistent economic space rather complex. The analysis of the circumstances, based on empirical study (interviews, focus groups) with a greater focus on Kosice region, is giving several important answers about the existing social capital, regional cooperation, attitudes of the stakeholders, potential and ideas in the cross-border context of Northern Hungary and Eastern Slovakia.","[Hudec, Oto; Urbancikova, Natasa] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,,oto.hudec@tuke.sk,"Urbancikova, Natasa/AAD-3113-2020; Hudec, Oto/F-4898-2019","Urbancikova, Natasa/0000-0002-2158-5517; Hudec, Oto/0000-0002-8877-8647",,,,,29,1,1,0,8,"SLOVAK ACAD SCIENCES, INST ECONOMIC RESEARCH",BRATISLAVA 1,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA 1, 811 05, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-7144-180-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,117,131,,,,,,15,Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Geography,BGW05,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000324343700008,0

Although Poland faced it to a lesser extent, the crisis imposed more strict requirements on different groups functioning in the labour market, and particularly graduates who, having finished higher education, are to become specialists responsible for the functioning of companies and - as a result - the entire economy. Having the above in mind, it was analyzed to what extent Polish students and students from other countries are active in the scope of improving their qualifications during studies. At the same time, a number of theses have been formulated. First of all, Polish students do not take active part in international student exchange. Secondly, the majority of economics students take up employment during studies and generate relatively high income. And thirdly, non-economics students take active part in other (apart from the aforementioned one) types of activity aimed at knowledge development. The analysis was based on statistical data derived from Eurostat and the survey conducted by the author among students and graduates of higher schools of economics.

Accurate LGD estimates of defaulted bank claims are important for provisioning reserves for credit losses, calculating adequate risk capital and determining fair pricing risky bank loans. While most of the empirical literature in the field concentrates on corporate bond markets to estimate losses in the event of default, we use a unique individual bank data set on SME loan losses. Due to the proprietary nature of data only few studies of this kind have been published so far and to our knowledge none of them covers the Eastern European banking markets. In the first stage of the analysis we estimate the LGD variable by applying the discounted cash flow approach, while in the second stage we analyse its determinants by using the ordinal regression analysis. Our findings suggest that reliable LGD estimates can be produced by discounting expected loan related future cash flows and that explanatory factors, such as type of collateral, type of industrial sector, last available loan rating, size of the debt and loan maturity satisfactorily explicate variability of the LGD variable in the specific banking market. All the results are not only relevant to the impairment policy determination and capital adequacy calculation in the specific bank, but also to the evaluation of SME loans characteristics in developing markets.","[Kosak, Marko; Poljsak, Jure] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Poljsak, Jure] Abanka Vipa DD, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Kosak, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",marko.kosak@ef.uni-lj.si; jure.poljsak@abanka.si,,,,,,,20,4,4,0,14,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

In Malaysia this is a state-directed project filled with tensions and contradictions. Legal outcomes around Muslim-non-Muslim family litigations (through either civil or Sharia courts) have evidenced the inability of the state to protect the welfare of the family. Sharia reforms have also overprivileged a version of patriarchy which exalts a new Malay-Muslim masculinity as an end to Islamization rather than as a condition of achieving family wellbeing. The cases presented here show how state policies do not inherently put a premium on welfare and productivity as the main motive of family development. Instead, state performativity is aimed at naturalizing the majority (and hegemonic) status of Muslims in the ethnically and religiously plural Malaysian society. The paradox of this situation is that partners, parents and children are torn apart for keeping together the imagined unified collectivity of a Malay-Muslim majority.",,,"Mohamad, M (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Asia Res Inst, Bukit Timah Rd, Singapore 259770, Singapore.",arimm@nus.edu.sg,,"Mohamad, Maznah/0000-0002-0756-3434",,,,,68,27,31,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

We analyse regional innovation strategies in these countries. The regional development strategies are relatively new phenomenon in V4 countries. Most of the regions created their strategies less than five years ago and many of them have been still in implementation phase, so we concentrate more on the creation of innovation strategies rather than on their implementation. The paper has two main parts - theoretical background containing the examples and reasons for innovation support at the regional level as well as key problems for governance of innovation support, mainly the problem of complexity of innovation support, which goes behind officially established borders. The second part compares activities and measures of 29 regional innovation strategies in these regions and identifies some key differences among them. We found out more similarities among the regions from the same country rather than similarities among the regions with similar level of development (e.g. in metropolitan regions). We deal with some key issues for regional innovation strategies - appropriate level and the role of regional self-governments for creation of strategy, sectoral dimension of RIS or building cathedral in the desert problem. We also identify dominance of hard infrastructure measures in the strategies. We also compare specific innovation strategies with general regional development strategies in order to identify key differences in governing creation of these strategies. We suggested some improvement in the process of creation and implementation strategies. The concentration of priorities and resources is of crucial importance for success. Better evaluation process is needed to be able to more prioritise the suggested activities and to be more specific on particular regional needs.","[Sipikal, Miroslav] Ekon Univ Bratislave, Narodohospodarska Fak, Katedra Reg Rozvoja & Verejnej Spravy, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Pisar, Peter] Univ Mateja Bela Banskej Bystrici, Ekon Fak, Katedra Financii & Uctovnictva, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia; [Uramova, Maria] Univ Mateja Bela Banskej Bystrici, Ekon Fak, Katedra Ekon, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava; Matej Bel University; Matej Bel University,"Sipikal, M (通讯作者)，Ekon Univ Bratislave, Narodohospodarska Fak, Katedra Reg Rozvoja & Verejnej Spravy, Bratislava, Slovakia.",msipikal@post.sk; peter.pisar@umb.sk; maria.uramova@umb.sk,"Pisar, Peter/ABE-4019-2020; Šipikal, Miroslav/HJY-0623-2023","Šipikal, Miroslav/0000-0002-7205-3385; Pisar, Peter/0000-0003-4898-2739; Uramova, Maria/0000-0001-7968-975X",,,,,32,23,23,0,23,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The motivation for extending the Markov switching GARCH model, previously developed to capture mean asymmetry, is that the switching variable, assumed to be a first-order Markov process, is unobserved. The proposed model extends this work to incorporate Markov switching in the mean and variance simultaneously. Parameter estimation and inference are performed in a Bayesian framework via a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme. We compare competing models using Bayesian forecasting in a comparative value-at-risk study. The proposed methods are illustrated using both simulations and eight international stock market return series. The results generally favor the proposed double Markov switching GARCH model with an exogenous variable. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[Chen, Cathy W.

Unlike liability, which is imposed by courts ex post, industry self-regulation, much like government regulation, acts before the harm is done. As compared to government regulators, however, the industry regulates with superior information. Furthermore, a pro-industry bias inherent to self-regulation also arises under alternative institutional arrangements when adjudicators are vulnerable to pressure by industry members. We show when industry self-regulation is socially desirable and feasible, and clarify when it could be an attractive institutional arrangement for developing and transition countries.

We find that in equilibrium the relative magnitude of demand uncertainty and the degree of substitutability determines firms' variable choice. Firms set prices if uncertainty is high compared to the degree of substitutability and quantities if the reverse holds true. The reason is that demand uncertainty and the degree of substitutability have countervailing effects on variable choice: Prices adapt better to uncertainty while quantities induce softer competition. If no effect dominates, firms choose different strategy variables in equilibrium.","[Reisinger, Markus; Ressner, Ludwig] Univ Munich, Dept Econ, D-80539 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Reisinger, M (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Dept Econ, Marchioninistr 15, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",markus.reisinger@lrz.uni-muenchen.de; ludwig.ressner@lrz.uni-muenchen.de,,,,,,,16,35,37,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

One such change is the emergence of a market for intellectual property (IP), and more specifically a market in patents.

Given the relevance of this phenomenon for economic geography, this article seeks to map this emerging market and illustrate its drivers, restrainers and implications.

J,"Rubinovitz, R",,,,"Rubinovitz, Robert",,,THE ROLE OF FIXED COST SAVINGS IN MERGER ANALYSIS,JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Among the many motivations for mergers, clearly one of the more important considerations is the extent to which the merger will generate cost savings for the firms involved. Standard economic models demonstrate that a decrease in marginal cost leads to a lower price, whereas a decrease in fixed costs does not necessarily have this effect. Thus, from the Antitrust Agencies' perspective, in a merger analysis, emphasis should be placed on marginal cost savings because these efficiencies will create short-run benefits for consumers, in terms of lower price and higher output, and should be given the most weight. Of late, increasing attention has been given to how fixed cost savings can improve consumer welfare. One key insight is that demonstrating the direct effects of fixed cost savings on consumer welfare may require a longer time horizon than marginal cost savings or may require embedding these savings in a dynamic context. This paper exhibits an approach that provides straightforward predictions on the relationship between fixed costs, prices, and consumer welfare. When the fixed cost of producing quality decreases, it is shown that consumer welfare increases. The clear implication of this model is that fixed cost savings should be given weight in the analysis of the potential effects of a merger on consumer welfare.",,,,robert.rubinovitz@nera.com,,,,,,,18,6,6,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

The 'wishful expectations hypothesis' suggests that a forecaster predicts what his employer wishes. The 'publicity hypothesis' argues that forecasters are evaluated by both accuracy and ability to generate publicity, and that forecasters in industries that emphasize publicity most will make most extreme and least accurate predictions. The 'signaling hypothesis' asserts that an extreme forecast signals confidence in own ability, because incompetent forecasters would mimic others to avoid public notice. Empirical evidence from a 26-year panel of annual GDP forecasts is consistent with the publicity hypothesis. This indicates that conventional tests of rationality are biased toward rejecting the rational expectations hypothesis.

It begins by specifying a model of agglomeration economies where soft skills allow agents to interact more productively. The model exposes two conflicting forces: agglomeration allows opportunities to interact, but it also produces thick, specialized markets, and this specialization can be a substitute for interaction. In order to empirically evaluate the soft skillsagglomeration relationship, the article matches data on the interaction requirements of occupations from the Dictionary of Occupational Titles to Census data. The within-industry average level of soft skills is found to be higher in cities but not in industry clusters. Workers at the top of the skill distribution in large cities typically have higher levels of soft skills than in small cities, while the least skilled workers are less skilled in large cities than in small cities. This pattern is reversed for industry clusters.","[Blum, Bernardo S.; Strange, William C.] Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada; [Bacolod, Marigee] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of Toronto; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Strange, WC (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, 105 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada.",mbacolod@uci.edu; bblum@rotman.utoronto.ca; wstrange@rotman.utoronto.ca,,,,,,,42,34,37,0,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

These political effects are statistically robust to the inclusion of prefecture fixed effects, year fixed effects, and other socioeconomic factors and, more important, are present only in government loans, and not in private loans.

In this work we strive for a better understanding of the performance of different designs within the general framework of evolutionary computation. We examine and compare (discrete) particle swarm optimization with classic genetic algorithms, both with and without hybridization with local search. In particular, we analyze the effect of different selection and reproduction mechanisms on solution quality, population diversity, and convergence behavior, and examine approaches for maintaining population diversity. As application we consider an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, namely the no-wait (continuous) flow-shop scheduling problem with flow-time criterion. The computational results support the importance of local search within (hybridized) evolutionary algorithms and show how solution quality depends on a reasonable design of crossover operators, distance functions, population diversity measures, and the control of population diversity.","[Czogalla, Jens; Fink, Andreas] Helmut Schmidt Univ UniBw Hamburg, D-22043 Hamburg, Germany",,,czogalla@hsu-hamburg.de; andreas.fink@hsu-hamburg.de,,,,,,,63,4,4,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",0075-8442,,978-3-642-00939-6,LECT NOTES ECON MATH,,,2009,624.0,,,,,,99,126,,10.1007/978-3-642-00939-6_7,0.0,,,28,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BLV72,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271188100007,0

Blink (1852-1931) founded the Nederlandsche Vereeniging voor Economische Geographie in December 1909. The primary objective of this Dutch Association for Economic Geography was to publish a monthly magazine. Bearing the name Tijdschrift voor Economische Geographie, this periodical was the first in the world to be devoted exclusively to the field. It was launched in January 1910 with an issue filled almost entirely by Blink himself. The magazine was to become his life's work. Its name was expanded in 1948 to the current title, Tijdschrift voor Economische en Sociale Geografie. Then, a more profound change occurred in 1966 when Blink's Association merged with the Royal Dutch Geographical Society KNAG, its long-standing rival. In the resulting shake-up of geographic periodicals published by the newly styled association KNAG, the Tijdschrift voor Economische en Sociale Geografie, better known ever since by the acronym TESG, emerged as its flagship academic journal. This change was readily visible in its masthead, where the addition of the name Journal of Economic and Social Geography marked the evolution from a Dutch-language professional magazine into an international academic journal.","Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"de Pater, B (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, POB 80-115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",B.dePater@geo.uu.nl,,,,,,,18,8,8,0,9,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0040-747X,,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

They include attractive tourism potential such as supply, integrated marketing and management, correct and honest co-operation between private and public sector, existing organizational structure of tourism from national to regional and local levels, regional information system and of course also positive attitude of inhabitants to tourism development. The regional tourism policy is a system with interconnected subsystems - subsystem of objectives, instruments and incentives and stakeholders, which are organizations and entities responsible for creation, and implementation of regional tourism policy. The objective of this paper is to present results of the secondary and field research, which has been conducted in Slovakia in 2005/2006. Its scientific goal was investigate the conditions for development of methodology of creation and implementation of regional tourism policy applicable in conditions of economic praxis of the Slovak Republic. Research sample created 302 representatives of public sector and 302 representatives of private sector engaged in tourism development in Slovakia. The results demonstrate the fact, that objectives, instruments and stakeholders as subsystem of regional tourism policy are influenced by existing state of tourism development in Slovakia. Slovakian respondents are not satisfied with regional tourism policy and expect systematic solution. Based on the analysis of basic aspects of regional tourism policy in Slovakia we have proposed the methodology of creation and implementation of regional tourism policy in Slovakia for self-governing regions.

One of the reason is the fact that bank capital requirements play a prominent role in sustaining financial stability. There are different theories that have rivaling predictions about how banks adjust their risk and capital behavior to imposed regulatory constraints. This paper intends to contribute to these discussions as it tries to evaluate regulatory pressure on selected banks around the world in the 2000-2005 period. To our knowledge, we are the first to test and compare the capital and risk behavior of US banks and banks from the EU 15 region in this period. In order to provide our analysis, we estimate a modified version of the simultaneous equations model developed by Shrieves and Dahl. This model analyzes adjustments in capital and risk at banks when they approach the minimum regulatory capital level. In the model, regulatory pressure is one of the explanatory variables and the dependent variables are changes in risk and capital. There are many methods that can be used to estimate the model; we have chosen the method of two-stage least squares (2SLS) and three-stage least squares (3SLS) estimates in order to test for the robustness of the results. The results indicate that regulatory requirements have the desired effect on bank behavior We find that both European and US banks close to the minimum regulatory threshold tend to increase their capital adequacy by increasing their capital. Finally, we observe a positive and significant relationship between capital levels and risk exposure for both US and EU banks.","[Matejasak, Milan; Teply, Petr] Charles Univ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic; [Cernohorsky, Jan] Univ Pardubice, Pardubice, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; University of Pardubice,"Matejasák, M (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.",milanmatejasak@hotmail.com; petr.teply@gmail.com; jan.cernohorsky@upce.cz,"Teply, Petr/E-9785-2018; Cernohorsky, Jan/HGU-5477-2022","Cernohorsky, Jan/0000-0003-2662-2353",,,,,29,14,14,0,12,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Different kinds of drivers are considered drawing on different strands of the literature, considering the firm from an organizational point of view, and as a production, industrial and innovation unit of analysis. Theoretical correlations between outsourcing decisions and variables are formulated and tested with respect to a representative cross-section sample of the firms in Reggio Emilia, a local production system in Emilia Romagna. The main result of the paper is that, in the local context investigated, transaction costs do not seem to be a significant driver of outsourcing. The decision to externalize is rather driven by other arguments, strongly based on the resource-competence approach, factors such as the need for tapping into the providers to promote technological innovation. On the other hand, these drivers are contrasted by the industrial relations of the firms, as workers and workers' representatives significantly hamper it, possibly fearing job losses, or at most expect to be involved in the relative decision in order to make it possible or even spur it. These results have important implications, both at the research level-at which they suggest to complement the transaction cost analysis of outsourcing with that of other approaches-and at the management level-at which they support the thesis that external organizational innovations, such as outsourcing, cannot neglect internal organizational aspects, such as human resource management and industrial relations.","[Montresor, Sandro] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40125 Bologna, Italy; [Mazzanti, Massimiliano; Pini, Paolo] Univ Ferrara, Dept Econ Inst & Terr, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Ferrara,"Montresor, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Str Maggiore 45, I-40125 Bologna, Italy.",sandro.montresor@unibo.it,"Montresor, Sandro/K-1833-2019; PINI, PAOLO/ITT-3182-2023","mazzanti, massimiliano/0000-0002-6538-7942; montresor, sandro/0000-0002-1195-901X",,,,,79,24,25,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Whilst agreeing with the contribution of the former in expanding beyond the thought boundaries of accounting through continuing to calling out for more. -new, -alternative and -innovative approaches, this paper argues the latter is rarely defined with adequate precision and crucial ambiguities. In particular, the individual's experience is weaker on the grounds although it constitutes the ultimate unit of the social science. Serious question remains whether accounting warrants on the one-sided emphasis only. This paper examines the challenges of a reconstruction of a research setting in empirical accounting research and methodological aspects on the aggregation of actions of individual(s). It is a story of gaining research sites in three Malaysian organizations for a four-year-doctoral ethnographic study. It highlights two main research constructions, namely: In Situating the Self in the Research Context and In the Renegotiation of the Research Context. The paper addresses accounting not as cases of researcher but as temporalities subjected to different human knowledge representations. This perspective finds that as a self-setting activity, for accounting, although it is threatened by pluralist conception, a greater range of invariance exists, and explanations in terms of collectives are unsatisfactory.","[Mustafa, Hasri] Univ Putra Malaysia, Upm Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Putra Malaysia,,m.hasri@econ.upm.edu.my,"mustafa, hasri/JGD-3972-2023",,,,,,154,0,0,0,2,UNIV KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA,BANGI,"INST TENAGA, BANGI 43600, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-942-923-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,798,823,,,,,,26,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBC87,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306479500039,0

The creative sector in Hamburg's Schanzenviertel from a time-geographical perspective. In recent years the spatial and temporal organization of everyday life has been transformed by the flexibilisation of economic relations and a growing variety of the ways how individuals coordinate their professional and private spheres and activities. Central elements of this transformation are (1) disenclosures of fixed socio-structural, temporal and spatial boundaries, (2) technical, social and cultural accelerations and (3) a growing subject-orientation within work and life conditions. Cities offer places where these transformations are well observable. These places provide both diverse infrastructures and images as material and symbolic frames for local socioeconomic processes: multiple encounters, mutual learning processes and work-life-combinations. The analysis of Hamburg's Schanzenviertel shows the explanatory power of a broadened time geographical concept in elucidating those new socioeconomic spaces. We add the concept of coupling opportunities to the traditional constraints-approach in order to show why the urban under the label of the creative city Should be understood as a specific form of organizing the everyday as well as the work life. Interrelations of subjective and structural, conditions clarify the subject-orientation within spatial economics as both system-related constraints and chances for individual self-determination. This analysis opens up a critical perspective on the selectivity and spatial inequalities within the creative city debate.","[Ossenbruegge, Juergen; Pohl, Thomas] Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Arbeitsbereich Wirtschaftsgeog, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Vogelpohl, Anne] TU Berlin, CMS, D-10587 Berlin, Germany",University of Hamburg; Technical University of Berlin,"Ossenbrügge, J (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Arbeitsbereich Wirtschaftsgeog, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",ossenbruegge@geowiss.uni-hamburg.de; pohl@geowiss.uni-hamburg.de; vogelpohl@metropolitanstudies.de,"Ossenbruegge, Juergen/AAN-2994-2021",,,,,,39,3,4,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

This research examines empirically the relationship of R&D spending and location in the value chain (lead vs. non-lead firms) to firm performance in the global electronics industry by using the Electronic Business 300 data set for 2000-2005. Our results show that firms spending more on R&D have higher gross profits, but do not have higher return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA). There is a strong positive relationship between lead firms and performance as measured by gross profit, ROE and ROA, but the relationship between lead firms and gross profit becomes insignificant when the interaction term of R&D and lead firm is included in the analysis. Finally, lead firm status has a positive interaction effect on the relationship between R&D and gross profit. These findings suggest that the relationship of R&D to performance is mixed, but that lead firms can capture higher value (gross profit) from R&D than contract manufacturers and component suppliers.","[Shin, Namchul] Pace Univ, Seidenberg Sch Comp Sci & Informat Syst, Dept Informat Syst, New York, NY 10038 USA; [Kraemer, Kenneth L.; Dedrick, Jason] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA USA",Pace University; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Shin, N (通讯作者)，Pace Univ, Seidenberg Sch Comp Sci & Informat Syst, Dept Informat Syst, 163 William St, New York, NY 10038 USA.",nshin@pace.edu,,,,,,,27,36,39,4,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1366-2716,,,IND INNOV,Ind.

We argue that this is too limited a view, as it fails to take into consideration two dimensions: Why do investments in houses take place, a question that is not only economic but also social and cultural in nature. Second, how do transnational investments in houses take place? This is important given that migrants are seldom able to construct their own homes, instead depending on actors in their country of origin.

One of the most significant effects of this heightened mobility has been that a growing proportion of the residents of migrant receiving places lack national citizenship and are thus deprived of effective sociopolitical inclusion, representation, and participation in the localities where they have moved to for work, refuge or retirement. This disjuncture between the spaces of citizenship and daily life, in turn, has led to a devolution of citizenship claims-making from national to urban space. This paper begins by identifying four key political economic developments operating at the global scale that have unsettled the established view of the close correspondence between nationhood and citizenship. It then focuses on the uses and limits of the increasingly voluble discourse on 'the right to the city' as a way to create alternative political spaces in which variously excluded groups of urban inhabitants might empower themselves. Three strikingly different examples of widely diverse group actions and state responses to illustrate the practical strengths and limits of 'the right to the city' discourse are narrated. We end by offering what we believe to be a more useful way to envisage and analyse the interplay between global mobility and urban citizenship.","[Smith, Michael Peter; Guarnizo, Luis Eduardo] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Smith, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, 1 Shields Ave Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",mpsmith@ucdavis.edu; leguarnizo@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,47,40,44,4,27,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0040-747X,,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

J,"Valdés, RMA; Comendador, FG",,,,"Arnaldo Valdes, Rosa Maria; Comendador, Fernando Gomez",,,Learning from accidents: Updates of the European regulation on the investigation and prevention of accidents and incidents in civil aviation,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Aircraft; Accident; Investigation; European Union; Safety improvement; Safety report,,"Civil aviation has a longstanding tradition of investigating accidents and reporting incidents, which contributes to making aviation one of the safest forms of transport. To make flying safer, independent investigation into accidents is essential as it the surest way of identifying the causes of an accident and answering the fundamental questions What really happened? and What can be done to prevent similar incidents in the future?. The obligation to investigate accidents is enshrined in the Chicago Convention of 1944. Recognizing the importance of accident investigation, the European Union adopted Council Directive 94/56/EC establishing the fundamental principles governing the investigation of civil aviation accidents and incidents and later on Directive 2003/42/EC on occurrence reporting. They both significantly contributed to harmonization of accident prevention. But with air traffic steadily increasing, accidents do happen despite the best efforts of regulators and industry. The organization of the air transport sector is much more complex now than it was a decade ago. Today there is significant divergence in the investigating capacity of the EU Member States compared to 1994. Furthermore nowadays investigating air accidents take new kinds of expertise and more resources than a decade ago. At the same time there is a new legal and institutional environment in Europe derived from the adoption of European aviation safety rules. Also the organizational set-up has changed substantially with the establishment of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is now responsible for certifying aircraft in the EU. The EU rules on investigating air accidents need to be updated to reflect the current realities of Europe's aviation market and the complexity of the global aviation industry. Accordingly, over the last few years the European Commission has been working on a Regulation on the investigation and prevention of accidents and incidents in civil aviation, with the intention of updating and replacing the existing Directive. With this new regulation the Commission aims to promote more efficient and independent inquiries into the causes of air accidents and also expects to strengthen the rights of the victims of air accidents. Today the end is in sight, once that the Commission and European Parliament have reached an agreement about the content and text of this new regulation. Reasons behind this new regulation are presented in this paper together with a detailed explanation of its main contents, an assessment of their impact and their expected benefits.

We consider whether motorcycle helmet laws also reduce a beneficial externality by decreasing the supply of viable organ donors. Our central estimates show that organ donations resulting from fatal motor vehicle accidents increase by 10 percent when states repeal helmet laws. Two features of this association suggest that it is causal: first, nearly all of it is concentrated among men, who account for over 90 percent of all motorcyclist deaths, and second, helmet laws are unrelated to the supply of donors who die in circumstances other than motor vehicle accidents. The estimates imply that every death of a helmetless motorcyclist prevents or delays as many as .33 death among individuals on organ transplant waiting lists.","[Dickert-Conlin, Stacy; Elder, Todd] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Dickert-Conlin, S (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",,,,,,,,32,26,31,0,10,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

We study the effects of enforcing licensing regulation laws on sex worker STI rates, using nationally representative sex worker data from Ecuador. We find that increasing enforcement in the street sector significantly decreases STIs. However, increasing enforcement in the brothel sector increases the probability of a sex worker ever being infected with any STI. Increasing enforcement in the street shifts some sex workers from the more risky street into the less risky brothels and increases street prices, reducing the overall number of street clients. As a result, overall infection rates decrease. In contrast, increasing enforcement in the brothel sector can exacerbate public health problems by inducing some unlicensed brothel sex workers into the riskier street sector.","[Gertler, Paul J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Shah, Manisha] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Gertler, PJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,,23,20,25,0,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

The evaluation is carried out using an idealised urban multimodal traffic corridor with some numerical examples that show the effects of different pricing policies. A Deterministic User Equilibrium assignment procedure is used to calculate certain performance indicators such as user travel costs, social costs and private profit. The results show that the system is highly sensitive to pricing policy and that a proper joint pricing of park-and-ride facilities, city centre parking and road tolls can be developed to simultaneously attain good private and social benefits.

There are concerns, however, that the emerging frameworks for sustainable economic renewal marginalize social dimensions of sustainability and the already existing practices of sustainability innovation within the social economy. Using empirical evidence from Ireland, this article examines the dimensions of this marginalisation by interrogating the dynamic landscape of environmentally focused social economy enterprises as additional spaces of sustainability innovation for a greener economy. It is found that while these enterprises can be cast as spaces of actually existing sustainable development tensions persist which together raise general questions about measuring and communicating sustainability as well as more foundational issues relating to permissible forms of sustainable economic renewal.","[Davies, Anna R.; Mullin, Sue J.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Geog, Dublin, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Davies, AR (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Geog, Dublin, Ireland.",daviesa@tcd.ie,"Davies, Anna/AAB-4254-2020; Hallstedt, Sophie I./A-4669-2015; Siddall, Emma/F-3812-2014","Siddall, Emma/0000-0002-3045-8552",,,,,78,62,63,7,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Yet, little work has been done by economists on why this social institution exists and why throughout history it has been intimately linked to fertility. We explain the institution of marriage as a societal consensus on the need to curb cuckoldry for the purpose of paternity certainty and biparental investment in offspring. By raising the costs of mating to individuals, marriage reduces cheating in society, a source of mating market failure, and makes paternity more certain. Men, in consequence, invest more in their putative offspring, a fact that also benefits mothers.","[Bethmann, Dirk] Otto VonGuericke Univ Magdegurg, Fac Econ & Management, D-39016 Magdeburg, Germany; [Kvasnicka, Michael] Rheinisch Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch eV RWI, Berlin Off, D-10115 Berlin, Germany",Otto von Guericke University; RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Bethmann, D (通讯作者)，Otto VonGuericke Univ Magdegurg, Fac Econ & Management, Postfach 4120, D-39016 Magdeburg, Germany.",dirk.bethmann@ovgu.de,"Bethmann, Dirk/N-6816-2017","Bethmann, Dirk/0000-0002-1949-4106",,,,,62,14,19,1,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,,,J POPUL ECON,J.

In both cases the predictions are obtained by means of multi-input single-output modeling techniques. This paper discusses the limitations of single-output approaches when the predictor is expected to return a long series of future values, and presents a multi-output approach to long term prediction. The motivation for this work is that, when predicting multiple steps ahead, the forecasted sequence should preserve the stochastic properties of the training series. However, this may not be the case, for instance in direct approaches where predictions for different horizons are produced independently. We discuss here a multi-output extension of conventional local modeling approaches, and present and compare three distinct criteria for performing conditionally dependent model selection. In order to assess the effectiveness of the different selection strategies, we carry out an extensive experimental session based on the 111 series in the NN5 competition.

Most have relied on either time series or cross-section data. The purpose of this paper is to determine the impact of unions on labor's share of income in the U. S. This study adds to the understanding of this topic by developing an analytical model of imperfect competition and estimating the model using panel data for the manufacturing sector. This study finds that unions have a positive impact on labor's share of income. Specifically, this paper finds that labor's share declined 17.9 percent between 1997 and 2006 whereas, if unionization density had remained at its 1997 level, labor's share would have declined only 13.9 percent. Thus, the decline in unionization explains about 29 percent of the decline in labor's share of income. This paper is important for three reasons. First, this paper sheds light on whether social and institutional forces play an important role in determining the distribution of income between labor and capital. Second, it helps to explain recent increases in wage inequality. Third, it has implications for understanding the potential impact of legislation, such as the Employee Free Choice Act, that would make it easier for workers in the U. S. to unionize.","Wright State Univ, Dayton, OH 45424 USA",University System of Ohio; Wright State University Dayton,"Fichtenbaum, R (通讯作者)，Wright State Univ, 3640 Colonel Glenn Hwy, Dayton, OH 45424 USA.",rudy.fichtenbaum@wright.edu,,,,,,,37,25,29,1,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

If child-care costs can be shifted completely to later periods, the impact of hyperbolic discounting on births depends on the underlying motive for motherhood, namely, whether children are regarded as consumption or investment goods.

AIR TRANSPORT POLICY AS AN EXAMPLE,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Air transport economics; Institutional economics; Aviation policy; Efficient markets,COSTS,"The award of the 2009 Nobel Prize in economics to Oliver Williamson for his analysis of economic governance, especially the boundaries of the firm highlights the importance now attached to the new institutional economics. The amount of work on transportation organizations explicitly using the tools of new institutional economics is, however, sparse and there is a tendency to continue to rely exclusively on conventional neo-classical economic orthodoxy. But the role of such things as governance, transactions costs, social norms, moral hazard, adverse selection, and property rights are clearly important in the ways that transportation organizations function and interact with one another. This paper looks, as an example, at some of situations where the NIE may shed light on the behavior of various organizations that supply or regulate air transportation services under a variety of institutional conditions. In the NIE, institutions are the rules of the game, consisting of both the formal legal rules and the informal social norms that govern individual behavior and structure social interactions whereas, organizations are those groups of people, and the governance arrangements they create, when coordinating their team actions against other teams performing also as organizations. For example, one can think of how the Ryanair organization acts in relations to other airline organizations within the existing set of legal institutions established by the European Union, or why airlines like United and Continental merge and the form mergers take.","[Button, Kenneth] George Mason Univ, Ctr Transportat Policy Operat & Logist, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Button, Kenneth] George Mason Univ, Aerosp Policy Res Ctr, Sch Publ Policy, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University; George Mason University,"Button, K (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Ctr Transportat Policy Operat & Logist, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",kbutton@gmu.edu,,,,,,,42,1,1,0,14,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

For more than a century, critics have objected that the case for intellectual property is far from clear. This article uses a game theoretic model to organize the debate. It is possible to model innovation as a prisoner's dilemma between potential innovators and to interpret intellectual property as a tool for making cooperation the equilibrium. However, this model rests on assumptions about costs and benefits that are unlikely to hold, or have even been shown to be wrong, in many empirically relevant situations. Moreover, even if the problem is indeed a prisoner's dilemma, in many situations, intellectual property is an inappropriate solution. It sets incentives to race to be the first, or the last, to innovate, as the case may be. In equilibrium, the firms would need to randomize between investment and noninvestment, which is unlikely to work out in practice. Frequently, firms would need to invent cooperatively, which proves difficult in larger industries.","Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Bonn, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Engel, C (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Bonn, Germany.",engel@coll.mpg.de,,,,,,,30,2,2,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

According to the democratic efficiency theory, voters can successfully punish ineffective political agents by removing them from office. In contrast, the public choice theory argues that the bundled nature of political goods prevents voters from successfully holding ineffective politicians accountable. We find that although there is limited support for the punishment effect predicted by the democratic efficiency theory, this effect is overwhelmed by the fact that the bundle of goods politicians offer contains elements that pull in opposing directions. This prevents the punishment effect from having any real impact, leading to democratic failure.

This paper aims to present a case study of road pricing in Valletta and the role played by policy transfer in its introduction. To do this, it applies data gathered from existing literature, in-depth interviews and direct observation with those involved in the policy development. Experience of road pricing was gained from London, Durham, Edinburgh and Stockholm. One of the major barriers to policy transfer was felt to be the unique geography of the island however international events, local conditions and a political champion driving change were critical factors to the successful implementation of the road pricing scheme. Policy transfer was deemed useful in terms of policy development, relations with stakeholders, scheme design and administrative approaches.

It begins by drawing on literature from the fields of political science, public administration, organisational learning and management to outline a conceptual framework for policy transfer and learning. This framework is then used to structure a review of policy transfer literature in the fields of transport and planning policy. Although there is only a limited amount of literature on policy transfer in this field, the findings suggest that transport has much in common with other areas of public policy in terms of the main aspects and influences on policy transfer. As well as being part of a process for introducing new ideas into countries or cities, policy transfer in the transport sector (as in other areas of public policy) can also be a highly politicised process that seeks to justify preferred solutions. Little is known about the relative importance of different parts of the transfer process or the extent to which learning about policies in other areas can influence the effectiveness of policy design in the transport arena and/or policy outcomes. The paper concludes with some research and methodological recommendations that may help to answer these questions. It is suggested that policy transfer concepts can be important to both practitioners and researchers in the transport arena, particularly given the pressures to seek solutions to accelerate progress to a more sustainable future.

MIDAS leads to parsimonious models which are based on exponential lag polynomials for the coefficients, whereas MF-VAR does not restrict the dynamics and can therefore suffer from the curse of dimensionality. However, if the restrictions imposed by MIDAS are too stringent, the MF-VAR can perform better. Hence, it is difficult to rank MIDAS and MF-VAR a priori, and their relative rankings are better evaluated empirically. In this paper, we compare their performances in a case which is relevant for policy making, namely nowcasting and forecasting quarterly GDP growth in the euro area on a monthly basis, using a set of about 20 monthly indicators. It turns out that the two approaches are more complements than substitutes, since MIDAS tends to perform better for horizons up to four to five months, whereas MF-VAR performs better for longer horizons, up to nine months.

In this study, we forecast house price inflation for five metropolitan areas of South Africa using principal components obtained from 282 quarterly macroeconomic time series in the period 1980:1 to 2006:4. The results, based on the root mean square errors of one to four quarters ahead out-of-sample forecasts over the period 2001:1 to 2006:4 indicate that, in the majority of the cases, the Dynamic Factor Model statistically outperforms the vector autoregressive models, using both the classical and the Bayesian treatments. We also consider spatial and non-spatial specifications. Our results indicate that macroeconomic fundamentals in forecasting house price inflation are important.

This paper proposes imitating market-oriented solutions from private franchise chains to increase the service quality offered by transport operators, solutions that include the threat of losing rents or quasi-rents to stop franchisee opportunism. The study bases its arguments on the complementarities between different control mechanisms and the similarities between franchise and concession contracts. Similarly, the paper proposes linking the renewal of concession contracts to the administrative reputation of operators (measured by customer feedback on service quality).

George Stigler plays a central role in the professional reception of Coase's work and, in particular, of the idea that came to be known as the Coase theorem. While Coase's negotiation result was taken up in the scholarly literature not long after the publication of The Problem of Social Cost, it was Stigler who gave the theorem its name and introduced it to scores of readers in The Theory of Price (1966). His remaking of Coase's idea into a theorem had significant rhetorical force, which, combined with the challenge that it pose to received thinking about externality problems, both lent credibility to the idea and made it a force to be reckoned with. The present paper analyzes Stigler's various commentaries on the Coase theorem with a view to getting at both how Stigler understood the theorem and its import and why he exhibited such a fascination with it over the last 30 years of his life.","Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Denver, CO 80217 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver,"Medema, SG (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, CB 181, Denver, CO 80217 USA.",steven.medema@ucdenver.edu,,,,,,,47,29,31,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

The classic system offered the consumer a range of products relatively limited from which he had to choose the product that fits best to his needs. Nowadays, the customer dictates what is going to be produced. The need of the market is to produce unique products according to the requirements of each different person. Shape, material, gauge, color or other characteristics are elements that make each product unique. To meet this new trend, manufacturing systems basically have to produce a variety of unique products, which according to classical theories, lead enterprises in economic disaster. Is there quality in scheduling the flexible manufacturing system? As we know, quality may be associated with products that meet consumer needs and have a long life. Quality generates costs that can be mitigated with an accurate and precise scheduling of the manufacturing system, so that it produces many different products, but still within optimum parameters. Quality of scheduling could mean unique production at low costs.","[Abrudan, Claudiu] Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Marian, Liviu] Petru Maior Univ Targu Mures, Targu Mures, Romania","Technical University of Cluj Napoca; George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science, & Technology of Targu Mures","Abrudan, C (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",claudiu.abrudan@mis.utcluj.ro; liviu.marian@ea.upm.ro,,,,,,,15,4,4,0,5,TECHNICAL UNIV CLUJ-NAPOCA,CLUJ-NAPOCA,"28 MEMORANDUMULUI STREET, CLUJ-NAPOCA, 400114, ROMANIA",,,978-973-662-614-2,,,,2011,,,,,,,1,4,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDA57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000312344600001,0

Pecuniary knowledge externalities enable one to appreciate both the gains and losses associated with the regional concentration of knowledge-generating activities. Both are two sides of the same coin. The gains are due to the reduction in the prices of knowledge as input into its dedicated markets, while the losses stem from the reduction in the prices of knowledge as an output. This analysis allows us to contextualize the effect of geographic proximity on knowledge externalities and their impact on regional growth. Our analysis leads to the hypothesis of an inverted U-shaped relationship between the agglomeration of innovation activities and productivity growth. The empirical analysis based on a large sample of European regions from 1996 to 2003 supports the hypothesis that agglomeration yields diminishing net positive effects beyond a maximum.","[Antonelli, Cristiano; Patrucco, Pier Paolo] Univ Turin, Dipartimento Econ S Cognetti de Martiis, Lab Econ Innovaz F Momigliano, I-10124 Turin, Italy; [Antonelli, Cristiano; Patrucco, Pier Paolo; Quatraro, Francesco] Coll Carlo Alberto, BRICK, Turin, Italy; [Quatraro, Francesco] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GREDEG, CNRS, Nice, France",University of Turin; Collegio Carlo Alberto; Universite Cote d'Azur; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Antonelli, C (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dipartimento Econ S Cognetti de Martiis, Lab Econ Innovaz F Momigliano, Via Po 53, I-10124 Turin, Italy.",pierpaolo.patrucco@unito.it,"ANTONELLI, CRISTIANO/HTN-7364-2023; Quatraro, Francesco/S-3012-2017","Quatraro, Francesco/0000-0001-5746-2239; Antonelli, Cristiano/0000-0002-5652-0510",,,,,66,72,77,4,51,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

The dairy sector in Pakistan has considerable potential, it not only provides livelihood to a great majority of farmers but can also contribute significantly towards exports, if developed properly. Despite immense potential in this sector, the livestock farmers face numerous issues such as, poor profitability, poverty, lack of contact with the ultimate market, lack of education and knowledge. The farming profession in Pakistan is largely inherited and the farmers do not know the right methods to raise the animals. An interesting element to note here is the role of women as the prime caretakers of cattle. In the midst of all these problems, a ray of hope for these desperate farmers is provided by PDDC. PDDC, more commonly known as Dairy Pakistan, proposes to improve the dairy sector by re-engineering at both the farm and the processor level. It is a public private initiative with a vision to bring Pakistan in the list of top five dairy economies of the world. PDDC is a three phased program that started in 2005 and is expected to continue till 2015. PDDC has made concerted efforts to re-engineer the dairy industry both at the farm and the processor level. The aim is to modernize the local dairy practices so as to better meet the local demand and at the same time compete with the developed dairy industries of the world such as New Zealand, China, India, USA, etc. This case study aims to determine the impact and outcomes of the initiatives taken by PDDC, using the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) approach. The study is focused at the micro level to see whether PDDC has been successful in convincing farmers to adopt modern dairy practices. The research methodology used was in-depth interviews, based on semi structured questionnaires, with farmers from six dairy farms in Sind, where training was imparted to enable farmers to revolutionize the pattern of their dairy yield. The findings of the research indicate encouraging results. Farmers who had practiced the methods taught to them such as leaving the cattle open to graze in enclosed areas, covering the troughs, etc. experienced an increase in yield per cattle.

The enlargement of the EU in 2004 and 2007 has added even greater complexity to the diversity of concepts of public services already found in the EU. Bauby notes that it is interesting to see that in 1957 (what is now) Article 93 TFEU (in the Chapter on Transport) used the term 'public service', whereas, Article 106(2) TFEU (ex Article 90(2) EEC, Article 86(2) EC) created a new concept of 'services of general economic interest' but this was a derogation from the fundamental economic freedom and competition law of the EU. This was an entirely new concept which was not recognised in any language of the original Member States or in scientific literature. However, attempts to put SGEIs on a positive footing in EU legislation have met with resistance and it is questionable how far the new Treaty of Lisbon 2009 will provide an adequate legal basis for EU legislation.","[Bauby, Pierre] Univ Paris 08, F-75008 Paris, France",Universite Paris-VIII,,bauby.pierre@orange.fr,,,,,,,21,5,5,0,4,TMC ASSER PRESS,J N DEN HAAG,"R J SCHIMMELPENNINCKLAAN 20-22, J N DEN HAAG, 2517, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-6704-733-3,LEG ISS SERV GEN INT,,,2011,,,,,,,19,36,,10.1007/978-90-6704-734-0_2,0.0,,,18,Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Government & Law,BVN53,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291967200002,0

The aim was to test the validity of the IDP theory, and to find out the specificities in this particular case. Our investigation was based on the two approaches of the IDP concept: the initial concept of IDP, which relates the NOIP (Net Outward Investment Position) to the level of development proxy by GDP/capita; the revised concept of IDP (broadened approach), which complement the narrow understanding of the level of development by including several structural variables. Empirical testing shows that GDP/cap does not influence NOIP. Concerning the impact of several structural variables on IFDI (Inward FM) and on OFDI (Outward FDI), the results enforce the finding regarding the lack of impact of GDP/cap on IFDI or on OFDI. But the structural variables influence positively or/and negatively the NOIP evolution.

The evolution of border practice is canvassed through the confronting notions of territorial discontinuity and territorial continuity. Clearly, current territorial dynamics between Ceuta and Morocco are characterised by both the existence of conflictive geopolitical cross-border dialectics and the implementation of fortifying securitisation measures. However, simultaneously, the border region is also marked by intensifying patterns of cross-border interaction which are sourced in the rising potentialities of economic and urban cross-border co-operation. In this light, the paper seeks to map the present intertwining of these apparently disagreeing territorial trends. To conclude, the paper underlines the ongoing modification of relational power between Ceuta and Morocco. It depicts the strengthening of local cross-border co-operative practices as a potential tool to cope with persistent sovereignty disputes in the border region.","Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Geog, Bellaterra 08193, Cerdanyola Vall, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Ferrer-Gallardo, X (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Geog, Edifici B,Campus UAB, Bellaterra 08193, Cerdanyola Vall, Spain.",xavier.ferrer.gallardo@uab.cat,,,,,,,62,15,16,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

CSR is often viewed as self-regulation, devoid of government. We attribute the scholarly neglect of the variety of CSR-government relations to the inadequate attention paid to the important differences in the way in which CSR has 'travelled' (or diffused), and has been mediated by the national governance systems, and the insufficient emphasis given to the role of the government (or government agency) in the CSR domain. We go on to identify a number of different types of CSR-government configurations, and by following empirically the CSR development trajectories in Western Europe and East Asia in a comparative historical perspective, we derive a set of propositions on the changing dynamics of CSR-government configurations. In particular, we highlight the varied role that the governments can play in order to promote CSR in the context of the wider national governance systems.","[Gond, Jean-Pascal] HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada; [Kang, Nahee] Univ Manchester, Inst Dev Policy & Management, Sch Environm & Dev, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Moon, Jeremy] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Int Ctr Corp Social Responsibil, Nottingham NG8 IBB, England",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; University of Manchester; University of Nottingham,"Gond, JP (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, 3000 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada.",jean-pascal.gond@hec.ca; nahee.kang@manchester.ac.uk; jeremy.moon@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Moon, Jeremy/0000-0002-0848-6274; Gond, Jean-Pascal/0000-0002-9331-6957; Kang, Nahee/0000-0003-3325-2741",,,,,147,205,230,7,94,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Regions should promote their own growth by mobilizing local assets and resources so as to capitalize on their specific competitive advantages, rather than depending on national transfers and subsidies to help them grow. Traditional policies based only on infrastructure provision or schooling are not sufficient for this task; instead, a more comprehensive policy is called for, one that integrated these two policies in a co-ordinated agenda across levels of government and that foster business development and innovation. This paper aims to look into the determinant role of innovation at regional level for potentially explaining the variations in growth among regions in Romania. Innovation positively affects growth just as endogenous theory suggests. In order to promote growth, policy makers should develop a comprehensive regional policy that not only links regions through infrastructure investments, but that also fosters human capital formation and facilitates the process of innovation. It is necessary to determine the factors are most relevant to generate growth at the regional level and which factors are needed if regions are to reap the benefits of globalization. The paper provides in the first section a literature review on existing studies related to regional development and innovation by making reference to the main theories and works in this area. The second section provides a brief description of the methodology of the current study based on growth at regional level in Romania - an econometric model for regional economic growth will be used - an analysis of patents and research and development expenditure will be included. Main findings will be presented in a separate paper once all data is gathered and the appropriate model is identified.","[Grigore, Corina] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,corinagrigore@gmail.com,,,,,,,9,1,1,0,4,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,426,428,,,,,,3,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800052,0

This information is added to producer surplus in order to derive social surplus. The method, thus, produces a simple approach for authorities to assess social surplus in a market and its benefits to the users. A modified exponential demand function is applied to calculate consumer surplus and social surplus for 97 ferry services in Norway regulated by the state. The calculations are based on empirical data concerning ferry fare, revenue data at service level and reasonable assumptions about fare point elasticity for services covering different distances. In 2007, these services generated welfare for the users (consumer surplus) and the society (social surplus) amounting to about 5.8 billion NOK and 4.3 billion NOK, respectively. Consumer surplus and social surplus varied considerably amongst the services. Only 3 of the 97 services operate with positive profits and, hence, without subsidies. About 21 of the services contribute negatively to social surplus. Many of these unprofitable services are the only transport alternatives in rural areas and could be argued to continue operation according to politically decided regional measures. Implicitly, maintaining all these 21 services means that the welfare for the people in these areas is valued as up to four times greater than the welfare of the people in the rest of society.

This study examined travel patterns of 130 students who study and live on campus in a rural university of Thailand. All survey participants completed a travel diary for seven consecutive days in a typical school week. Other than overall travel patterns, such as trip generation, mode split, distance traveled, and travel time, this study also investigated the differences in traffic patterns of four student groups, categorized by their gender and whether they own a private vehicle or not. It was found that students of both genders appeared to have similar travel patterns in all aspects. Whether they own a private vehicle does not appear to impact daily trip generation nor the total distance traveled of the students, but it does have an effect on the travel modes used by students. Those students who own a private vehicle mostly rely on driving the vehicle, while those who do not own a vehicle rely on three modes of travel: primarily being a passenger on or in a friend's private vehicle, and to a lesser extent, driving a friend's vehicle, and taking a bus (the only form of public transport on the campus). The results indicate a high social interdependency among university students, which makes the development of a model to simulate travel behavior of university students a complicated task.

Despite this resource scarcity, some small enterprises do innovate. The research question is: how do small enterprises manage resource scarcity in their product innovation processes? A multiple case study of three different small enterprises was used to answer the research question. The enterprises implement several approaches to use existing resources more efficiently or increase existing resources, such as reducing formality and including customers and users in the innovation processes, intertwining innovation processes, working concurrently on innovation and operational processes, adopting lead-user inventions, and only starting innovation processes when a current customer asks for or needs the potential new product. The efficiency of these approaches is found to be explained by common small enterprise characteristics. One conclusion from this study is that resource scarcity can be managed and small enterprises' specific characteristics can facilitate innovation if these are recognized and used as strengths.","[Lofqvist, Lars] Univ Gavle, Gavle, Sweden",University of Gavle,,lars.lofqvist@hig.se,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,7,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,583,592,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800071,0

This paper aims to analyze the relationship between innovative capacity and the ownership of international enterprises more innovative in 2009. In this regard, this work aims to assess the way in which innovation activities are carried out, not so much to define a quantitative approach to measuring the ability to innovate, but to highlight the practice in carrying out innovation activities themselves. More specifically, these practices are intended to clarify with examples of the innovation in business, without having to resort to the calculation of specific quantitative indicators, going to use an analysis approach based on a variety of aspects. In particular, the work deepens the characteristics of the ownership of these companies, divided into three main forms of government: the public company, the company controlled by a shareholder and the family business. In this case, the structure of corporate governance of companies has been analyzed based on two variables: the firm size and the degree of concentration of ownership structure ( or Degree of Ownership Concentration). The empirical analysis highlights the relationship between the propensity to invest in highly innovative and structure of corporate governance of companies of the undertakings concerned, going to examine the nature of institutional investors and their ability to influence, in companies where they own a significant share of equity, the decisions of the economic subject in R&D.

We want to evaluate the National Innovation Systems (NIS) performance of 31 countries from the point of view of technical efficiency. As previous researchers have shown a transnational comparison of regional policies developed with a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model provides meaningful insights to regional policy development that policymakers can act on. Thus DEA model identifies best practice cases of innovation policies. We present in this paper an evaluation based on the information provided by European Innovation Scoreboard (EIS) 2009 which is one of the instruments designed to understand the sources and patterns of innovative activity. Using EIS data, we estimate the production frontiers with the nonparametric estimator of efficiency frontiers - DEA. A bootstrap algorithm developed by Simar (1999) was used in order to compute confidence intervals for the efficiency scores, bias corrected efficiency scores and to test the type of the returns to scale of the production process. The efficiency scores estimated with an output oriented DEA model show that the countries considered innovation leaders in the EIS reports are not also technically efficient when transforming innovation inputs into innovation outputs. The results of our analysis show that the most efficient NIS is the one in Denmark and the most inefficient is the one in Malta. Given that the innovation process is one of the main drivers for sustained economic growth, it is obvious that we need innovation policies based on rigorous quantitative analysis. We think that ranking countries according to their innovation performance represents a useful tool for the policy makers especially for those in inefficient countries who should study the strategies and the policies of the most efficient countries in order to improve their ability to transform innovation inputs into innovation outputs. Although there are other studies that deal with the efficiency of innovation systems, the one presented in this paper is unique due to the way the variables were constructed and due to the utilization of an important tool for the inference in the DEA framework-the bootstrap algorithm.","[Matei, Monica] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Natl Sci Res Inst Labour & Social Protect, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,matei.monicamihaela@gmail.com,"Maer Matei, Monica Mihaela/C-3096-2011","Maer Matei, Monica Mihaela/0009-0006-0386-8405",,,,,8,0,0,0,9,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-2-3,,,,2011,,,,,,,301,304,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI18,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306939900076,0

The article will review major issues related to prediction of the technological substitution of old fiber production technology by the new technology. If a new technology begins to replace an existing technology without a major change in function, it will tend to go to completion usually at a constant rate of substitution. Diffusion theory predicts that the yearly relative capacity increase of the new technology decreases with an increasing market share. This theory is basics for so called Fisher Pry model. The Fisher-Pry description and its variants have been widely used in the study of technology substitution. Although the model was introduced using empirical arguments, it is now a well-known fact that the model considers a special ease of logistic growth and can be obtained from the Lotka-Volterra competition equations. The MATLAB program for utilization of Fisher Pry and generalized model will be described.

A multitude of works have provided insights about the network effects on firms and entrepreneurial results. Apparently, these works are contradictory and ours wants to stimulate a greater attention on the possibility to study the entrepreneurial network with a contingent approach, in order to redeem this inconsistency of results. In particular, we directed our attention both to the evolutionary stage of the firm and to the industry environmental conditions in which firms are embedded. Keeping an indiscriminate evaluation of network over these variables, can be dangerous and even misleading. The entrepreneurial output, on which we are focusing on, is the innovation rate and our study takes place in a context of established entrepreneurial firms in the reality of district (Italian and European very traditional context). While there is a well-developed the body of studies on young and technology-intense firms, studies are still lacking about less dynamic and more traditional industries. For this reason, we prefer a qualitative approach to sound in depth all the potential origins of the entrepreneurial network effect. We adopted a semi-grounded approach in creating our case studies. Additionally, one researcher has lived in the targeted district of the study for almost 25 years, allowing an ethnographic approach in the triangulation of the data. Our findings suggest a strong predominance of the strong ties to back the entrepreneurial action. First, strong ties are well-connected with incremental innovations. Second, for the for the radical innovations, as well, they play a determinant role in the implementation of these changes. To relations with bridging actors have been assigned the merit of radical innovations' discovery. However, when bonding players with whom cooperate to share the implementation of these innovations didn't exist, a lot of projects had been discarded. In some cases, entrepreneurs had overcome the problem of strong ties' lack supporting the social cost of new strong ties' formation by themselves or reducing the external dependency with a major level of internal implementation. This has been possible when they possessed at the moment of the opportunities' discovery a good level of firm's internal capital (reserve of available resource like human capital or financial prosperity). This situation can be explained by the fact that strong ties, in some cases, can be replaced by a sufficient level of internal resources and capabilities.","[Pellegrini, Massimiliano Matteo] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata,,massimiliano.pellegrini@unifi.it,"Pellegrini, Massimiliano Matteo/N-7178-2019","Pellegrini, Massimiliano Matteo/0000-0002-5722-2988",,,,,47,0,0,0,7,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,729,736,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800087,0

A comment on current crisis research in economic geography. Although some economic geographers have responded quickly to the recent world financial crisis, this paper identifies some major weaknesses in current theoretical thinking in economic geography. It differentiates between the understanding of the causes of a crisis and empirical research on its consequences. Deficits in the analysis of causes relate to a systemic view of the coherence of territories in the world economy, the macro-perspective necessary to understand the world economy, the interconnectedness of the financial and real economy, and, finally, different dimensions of historical time as seen by Braudel and Wallerstein. Three recent theoretical concepts are discussed which seem to offer some understanding of the historical processes leading to crisis, i.e., neoschumpeterian innovation theory, evolutionary economic geography, and regulation theory. Finally, the paper offers two options for the current economic geographical analysis of the crisis which are not necessarily mutually exclusive: Either focusing on a macro-perspective of the world economy with the concept of regulation theory and/or strengthening the traditional competences of economic geography in a deeper analysis of the impacts of the crisis.","Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Humangeog, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Schamp, EW (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Humangeog, Robert Mayer Str 6-8, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany.",Schamp@em.uni-frankfurt.de,,,,,,,55,7,7,1,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

The study examines whether goodwill trust moderates the relationship between competence trust and inter-firm learning. Although earlier research points to an additive effect of competence and goodwill trust on inter-firm learning, this study hypothesizes an interactive effect of the two trust types. The study's basic premise is that, in collectivist contexts characterized with a weak legal system, goodwill trust determines the efficacy of competence trust. Empirical tests of this hypothesis involve data collected from 158 small-scale manufacturers of furniture located in Turkey. Initial empirical analysis shows that whereas goodwill trust has a positive main effect on inter-firm learning, competence trust does not. Introducing an interaction term reveals that competence trust positively influences inter-firm learning only when goodwill trust is high. Additionally, cluster analysis indicates that inter-firm learning is lowest when both competence trust and goodwill trust are low and highest when both forms of trust are high.","[Sengun, Ayse Elif; Onder, Cetin] Baskent Univ, Dept Business Adm, TR-06490 Ankara, Turkey",Baskent University,"Sengün, AE (通讯作者)，Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Cinnah Caddesi Kavaklidere, Ankara, Turkey.",ayseelifs@yahoo.com,"Onder, Cetin/IZD-5553-2023","Onder, Cetin/0000-0002-3490-8039",,,,,91,12,12,0,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

However, the period of crisis threatened their position in the application of monetary policy. It seemed that the Taylor rules were not valid any more. Despite this fact, Taylor managed to defend his rule for the moment arguing that the data used by the Federal Reserve System were not correct. The Taylor-type rules were discredited. Still, in long-term their application can be important. In the paper we have compared the formulations of monetary rules in several countries. Moreover, it would seem that the application of monetary rules makes no sense for the individual euro area member states, as their monetary policy is applied in a common way by the European Central Bank. Though, if a national central bank knows a monetary rule for its country, it can defend economic interests of that country in a more obvious and transparent way. It can give to the central bank more arguments in common decision making process at the level of the European Central Bank Governing Council. Consequently, we have decided to calculate a monetary rule for Slovakia as the latest euro area member state. Our derived formula includes, besides harmonised index of consumer prices, lagged base rates, the data on balance of payments as well. The main reason for the formula expansion is the fact that the Slovak economy is significantly open. Besides these facts, other aspects had to be taken into consideration, too. Naturally, any monetary rule should not be followed blindly; nevertheless, it should serve as a certain guideline. After all, this has been the original message of the Taylor rule.","[Sinicakova, Marianna] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Kosice, Slovakia; [Pavlickova, Viera] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice; Technical University Kosice,"Sinicáková, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Kosice, Slovakia.",marianna.sinicakova@tuke.sk; viera.pavlickova@tuke.sk,"Siničáková, Marianna/AAA-5402-2020","Siničáková, Marianna/0000-0001-7551-4231",,,,,28,5,5,0,7,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Due to the 'innovation prone' nature of these companies, they are able to dedicate enough resources and capabilities to adopt expensive ICT existing solutions or even develop and customise their own tools. On the other hand, smaller construction companies, such as the Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) that comprise the majority of Europe's building industry, do not always count with enough resources to promptly adopt expensive knowledge management software systems that would allow an efficient performance of collaborative construction works. Additionally, the sub-sector working on restoration, retrofitting and maintenance of old buildings, which may belong to the Cultural Heritage objects, requires a special need to efficiently protect sensitive features in the buildings, such as, historical, social and usage value. These requirements urge this sub-sector to find an immediate and affordable way to get their in-house know-how managed. In this regard, H-KNOW project is motivated by the increasing number of complex works of rehabilitation of buildings that require a rapid and systematic access to specific knowledge. The project approach is to provide this sub-sector with innovative solutions that facilitate a promptly access to suitable competitive knowledge through building a business cooperative network among SMEs and Research & Technical Development (RTD) partners. Based on the identification of a business opportunity, this networked infrastructure enables the creation of a private collaborative space, which empowers their members to share knowledge regarding a specific construction industry project derived from that business opportunity. Summarising, the project plans to develop technical solutions based on ICT that are affordable for the targeted SMEs, including knowledge sharing, collaboration management and training services for engineers.

It is a documentary-analytical study, based on a bibliographic review and the classification of material for processing the collected data; interpretation of that data is based on the category crisis of the neoliberal cycle. Neo-liberalism reduces the functions of the Andean states to central areas: education, health and citizen safety; privatizes state businesses and public services, where market reason takes precedent over the society-State relationship, with nefarious consequences for the population, originating in the time of the democratic rise of anti-neoliberal governments. Conclusions are that at the dawn of the twenty-first century, neo-liberalism enters in crisis when the market manifests its incapacity to counteract high poverty indexes and the deterioration of living conditions for the people. The leftist Andean governments introduce changes in the political systems, re-dimensioning the macro-economic adjustment policies and rejecting bilateral and multilateral agreements that promote free markets in the heart of the institutional system of Andean integration.","Univ Zulia, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela",,"Fermín, EF (通讯作者)，Univ Zulia, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela.",eudisfermin@cantv.net,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

It is demonstrated that the proposed autoregressive model is asymptotically related to the variance ratio through the weighting schedules that these two tools use. It is also demonstrated that under a trend stationary time series process the proposed autoregressive model approaches a trend stationary model when the memory of the autoregressive model is increased. These links create a theoretical foundation for tests that confront the random walk model simultaneously against a trend stationary and a variety of short- and long-memory autoregressive alternatives.

On the few occasions that the existence of altruism is recognized in economics, the tendency is to build this from the axiom of individual selfishness. The aim of this paper is to break from this tradition and to treat as a primitive that individuals are endowed with the 'cooperative spirit', which allows them to work in their collective interest, even when that may not be in their self-interest. The paper tracks the interface between altruism and group identity. By using the basic structure of a Prisoner's Dilemma game among randomly picked individuals and building into it assumptions of general or in-group altruism, the paper demonstrates how our selfish rationality interacts with our innate sense of cooperation. The model is used to outline circumstances under which cooperation will occur and circumstances where it will break down. The paper also studies how sub-groups of a society can form cooperative blocks, whether to simply do better for themselves or exploit others.","Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Basu, K (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,,,,,,,73,17,21,0,22,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

Using the basic-needs approach, an analysis-of-covariance model is derived and estimated, with the headcount, gap, and squared gap poverty ratios serving as the respective dependent variables, and the Gini coefficient and PPP-adjusted incomes as explanatory variables. The study finds that the responsiveness of poverty to income growth is a decreasing function of inequality, albeit at varying rates for the three poverty measures: lowest for the headcount, followed by the gap and fastest for the squared gap. The ranges for the income elasticity in the sample are estimated at: 0.02-0.68, 0.11-1.05, and 0.10-1.35, respectively, for these poverty measures. Furthermore while, on average, the responsiveness of poverty to income growth appears to be the same between the rural and urban sectors, there are substantial sectoral differences across countries. The results suggest the need for country-specific emphases on growth relative to inequality.","UNU WIDER, Helsinki, Finland",,"Fosu, AK (通讯作者)，UNU WIDER, Helsinki, Finland.",Fosu@wider.unu.edu,,,,,,,25,35,38,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The analysis exploits a Swedish refugee dispersal policy to obtain exogenous variation in individual locations. Using very detailed data on the exact location of all residences and workplaces in Sweden, we find that having been placed in a location with poor job access in 1990-1991 adversely affected employment in 1999. Doubling the number of jobs in the initial location in 1990-1991 is associated with 2.9 percentage points higher employment probability in 1999. Considering that the 1999 employment rate was 43% among the refugees, this is a considerable effect.

In this context, the extent to which applicants have incentives to contribute prior art is an important question. This paper uses data on examiner and applicant citations in U.S. patents to examine this question. The data show that applicants contribute a surprisingly low share of citations to previous patents and routinely fail to identify even their own previous patents. However, there are also stark differences across fields. Within fields, and even within firms, there is self-sorting: applicants contribute more prior art for their more important inventions. The results suggest that incentives to search for prior art vary across industries and inventions, which reflects underlying differences in the strategic reasons for obtaining patent protection.","Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Sampat, BN (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,"Sampat, Bhaven/0000-0001-7387-6706",,,,,28,57,60,1,18,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

The forecasting device is a Bayesian predictive density which accommodates variability from an unknown error term, uncertainty from unknown coefficients, and uncertainty from unknown stochastic regressors. We illustrate how the predictive density of a forecast changes as more regressors are observed and therefore fewer are unobserved. An example where the local-area wheat yield depends on the rainfall during three periods germination, growing and flowering is used to illustrate the methods.

The results of this study indicate that the NPV is just as popular as, and sometimes more so than, the IRR. Furthermore, compared to previous studies, risk is incorporated into evaluating capital budgeting projects more often.

This paper reports on the findings of the VIBAT London study (www.vibat.org) which considers the role of the transport sector in reducing CO2 emissions in London. The analysis develops a transport and carbon simulation model (TC-SIM) for London. Within this, users are able to consider the implementation of a series of potential policy packages-low emission vehicles, alternative fuels, pricing regimes, public transport, walking and cycling, strategic and local urban planning, information and communication technologies, smarter choices, ecological driving and slower speeds, long distance travel substitution, freight transport and international air. They can select variable levels of application to help achieve headline CO2 emission reduction targets. The roles of carbon rationing and oil prices are also considered. TC-SIM can be played in different user modes: as 'free riders', 'techno-optimists', 'enviro-optimists', 'complacent car addicts' and other typical travel market segments, including a 'free role'. Game playing or scenario testing such as this helps to highlight perceived levels of homogeneity of views within certain cohorts, the development of entrenched positions and the likely success in achieving objectives. The paper develops various policy packages, scenarios and pathways aimed at reducing transport CO2 emissions. It argues that strategic CO2 emission reduction targets are very ambitious relative to current progress, and that we need to act more effectively across a wide range of policy mechanisms, with a 'high intensity application' of many of the options, to get near to achieving these targets. A critical issue here will be in communicating and gaining greater 'ownership' of future lifestyle choices with stakeholders and the public, and participation tools such as TC-SIM could become increasingly important in this area.

Therefore it constitutes an interesting phenomenon from the perspectives of economic geography, geopolitical policy and international small business management. In this qualitative study, we investigate the offshoring decisions in 10 Norwegian small and middle-sized enterprises (SMEs) that have established manufacturing capabilities in low cost countries. The focus lies on their initial motivation for offshoring production, selection of location, choice of entry mode, evolution of foreign production capabilities, and finally, foreign market sales initiation and development. By analysing the findings in this study from different theoretical perspectives we conclude that combining Dunning's eclectic paradigm with behavioural internationalisation models offers valuable insight in the initiation and organisation of offshore manufacturing facilities among small firms. However, to fully understand the external influence on offshore location decisions among SMEs we should incorporate business network theories and theories from economic and social geography.","[Aspelund, Arild] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Econ & Technol Management, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Butsko, Vitali] ABB AS, N-0666 Oslo, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); ABB,"Aspelund, A (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Econ & Technol Management, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",arild.aspelund@iot.ntnu.no; vitali.butsko@no.abb.com,,,,,,,49,14,18,4,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Comparative static analyses are conducted to determine the effect of changes in interest rate, stumpage price of the trees selected for harvest, the stumpage value of the residual growing stock, and the future land value on the decision variables. The model is then applied to study the uneven-aged management of a loblolly-shortleaf pine stand in south central U.S. to determine the length of the cutting cycle and the level of residual growing stock for the first cutting cycle as well as for a case involving four cutting cycles. Sensitivity analyses reveal that for the uneven-aged loblolly-shortleaf pine stand both the length of the cutting cycle and the level of the residual growing stock are very sensitive to changes in land value in the future, in the stumpage prices of trees selected for harvest, in the stumpage prices of the residual growing stock, and in the interest rate.

This study will compile literature that highlighted possible references to CSFs of ERP implementations, definition of complex projects and ERP are compared with project management and project governance impacts. By analyzing highly likely CFS and RFs mentioned in literature, CSF and RFs will be mapped to project complexities involved in any ERP implementation. This is an exploratory study as it is based on literature review to understand ERP implementation and validations. The future research needs to include data collection from ERP adopters and longitudinal analyses of trends based on advances in ERP project management and governance capabilities in different ERP implementations. This article will be significant contribution to current body of knowledge because it helps us understand ERP application implementation as a complex project instead of linear system as currently documented in the literature. This article has outlined the conceptual revisions needed to extend the new project management approach from its current linear way of looking into project management of ERP projects. The article suggests that ERP project management is best understood within the context of environmental complexities. This paper is the first attempt to explore ERP implementations based on current enterprise environment and how to meet those CSF and RFs from complexity perspective.","[Ghosh, Saumyendu] Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Ghosh, Saumyendu] Univ Maryland, George Washington Univ, Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Skibniewski, Miroslaw J.] Bialystok Tech Univ, Dept Management, Bialystok, Poland",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; George Washington University; Bialystok University of Technology,"Ghosh, S (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 1188 GL Martin Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",sghosh12@umd.edu; mirek@umd.edu,"Skibniewski, Miroslaw J./P-5310-2018","Skibniewski, Miroslaw/0000-0002-7102-753X",,,,,54,21,33,7,36,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The aim is to contribute to the debate on public financial flows within the territory of the Czech Republic as it has been recognised by both scholars and some policy-makers on the international scene that explicit regional development support might induce only limited regional impact in comparison to vigorously pursued sectoral and other public policies. It is argued that the volume of finance allocated within the system of parliamentary grants represents significant share of investment part of the state budget. In total, the share counts to 14,7% on average over the investigated period i.e. CZK 12 billion annually. Moreover, the nature of grants supported by members of the Chamber of Deputies corresponds to the spheres addressed within the ministerial subsidies programmes, for instance, within the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports or the Ministry for Regional Development. In other words, parliamentary grants sponsor activities according to regional subjective interests of the involved actors and not on the basis of objective criteria. The results of the regional analysis carried out on the NUTS 4 level confirm that there are significant disparities among Czech districts in the received financial volume per capita. Indeed, the Moravian districts recorded the above average financial allocations with respect to the Czech average. Accordingly, these regions were more successful in obtaining of the total number of grants. As a result, detected pattern of the regional distribution of parliamentary grants might bring significant spatial impact. Moreover, it might influence developmental opportunities of particular municipalities of the same level of the settlement hierarchy as these public sources are allocated to the territory missing any objective evaluation of the real needs.","[Hana, David; Maceskova, Marie] Charles Univ Prague, Prirodovedecka Fak, Katedra Socialni Geog & Regionalniho Rozvoje, Urbanni & Regionalni Lab, CR-11636 Prague 1, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Hána, D (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Prirodovedecka Fak, Katedra Socialni Geog & Regionalniho Rozvoje, Urbanni & Regionalni Lab, CR-11636 Prague 1, Czech Republic.",david.hana@centrum.cz; marie.maceskova@gmail.com,"Hána, David/D-1149-2017","Hána, David/0000-0001-8199-3013",,,,,29,1,1,0,11,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The developmental trajectory of offshore wind energy in Northwestern Germany. After the crisis in the shipbuilding industry the hopes for new regional developmental impulses are based upon the boom in offshore wind energy production. The paper examines whether there exist direct or indirect links between the new and the old regional industrial trajectory. The results indicate that these links are only of indirect nature. The core stimuli for the development were the ports in which seagoing vessels are able to land and a strong market pull effect. The crisis in contrast only generated an indirect push effect and the shipbuilding industry provided human capital and specialized infrastructure from which the new industry could benefit, but which could have been created elsewhere as well.","[Mossig, Ivo; Schroeder, Heike] Univ Bremen, Inst Geog, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Fornahl, Dirk] BAW Inst Reg Wirtschaftsforsch GmbH, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",University of Bremen,"Mossig, I (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, Inst Geog, Bibliotheksstr 1, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",mossig@uni-bremen.de; d.fornahl@baw-bremen.de; h.schroeder@uni-bremen.de,,"Fornahl, Dirk/0000-0001-7585-4367",,,,,55,5,5,0,19,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

Unlike most Western cities where the different realms of life (residential, work, religious, public, etc.) are spatially segregated, here they are all functionally and spatially integrated. A close examination of slum spaces in Dharavi, Mumbai, reveals such overlapping spatial patterns and raises some fundamental questions. Is there a proper definition of the slum? How should we conceive of the slum community and its spatial features? How useful or problematic are Western concepts of residential segregation, ghettos and enclaves? It is argued that the historical persistence of urban slums points to their indispensability, with the tacit (if inconsistent) approval of the state. Slums not only provide shelter to a large urban labour force but also a milieu that is conducive to intense social organisation and economic production.","Univ Miami, Urban Studies Program, Dept Geog & Reg Studies, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA",University of Miami,"Nijman, J (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Urban Studies Program, Dept Geog & Reg Studies, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",Nijman@miami.edu,,,,,,,58,54,59,1,59,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

The case of Germany, France and the United Kingdom. Contrary to the already encompassing literature on the differentiated effects of the Great Recession on states, this paper takes a regional economic perspective. To answer the research question which factors might explain the spatially unequal development of unemployment rates at the regional level, a cross-section data-set is used. Percentage point increase of regional unemployment rates between 2008 and 2009 is used as the dependent variable and a set of regional and national variables as independent variables; a multiple linear regression model is estimated. After detecting spatial autocorrelation for the OLS-estimators, the model is re-estimated and a spatial error model with ML-estimators is computed. It turns out that the share of low-skilled employees has a significant positive effect on the change of regional unemployment rates. Furthermore, financial centres showed a significantly better resilience than other regional economies. Because of the strong influence of national variables in these models, separate models are estimated for France and the UK. It is shown that the same variables have quite different effects. This questions the existence of a common explanation for regional unemployment dynamics in Europe.",,,,,,,,,,,45,2,2,0,17,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

Analysis of first trading period indicated that in 2005 just 3 installations from total 93 installations included in GHG emission trading scheme emitted into atmosphere more GHG emissions than the GHG emission allowances they have been allocated for. In general during 20052006 enterprises of the Republic of Lithuania did not use 10.955,3 thousands allowances, 9.692 thousands allowances out of which were transferred, and acquired additionally from other EU countries 575.0 thousands allowances.

Because of reduced caps for 2008-2012 Lithuania and other new member states have announced legal challenges against the EC due to reduced allocations however economic crisis of 2008 corrected the threats of GHG emission shortage and the first results of GHG emission trading in 2008-2012 indicated the surplus of emission allowances in Lithuania and some new member states as well.","[Streimikiene, Dalia] Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Sociocultural Res Inst, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Streimikiene, D (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Sociocultural Res Inst, Muitines Str 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",dalia@mail.lei.lt; rasapusinaite@yahoo.com,"Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAF-2180-2020","Streimikiene, Dalia/0000-0002-3247-9912",,,,,15,2,2,0,6,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

While elaborating scientific discussions in social science interface it is intended to find the answers to the following issues: how decision taking is influenced by internal and external business environments; how to communicate during crisis period; how to prepare efficient crisis communication plan. The paper introduces communication as a social institution system and as a strategic management function which can solve modern socioeconomic challenges in a business environment: necessity to create trust between internal and external company stakeholders; business activation through developing responsible corporate culture. The first part of the paper gives theoretical background of communication concept with the emphasis on communication place in the management structure. On the basis of these theoretical insights it is possible to state that crisis management requires cooperation within separate introduced social phenomenon structures: efficient internal and external communications; identification of persons and their roles that are defined by special position and responsibility; efficient collective decision taking; control; cooperation responsibility and communication. Applying deductive logic in the second part of the paper practical recommendations are supplied the plan of effective crisis communication.

These initiatives are notable for the ways in which they privilege long-vilified populations for immediate placement into housing with no social or medical services required. While this represents a significant break from social service protocols that previously demanded compliance with service requirements, the article argues that understanding chronic homelessness initiatives as economic rather than social programmes reveals the ways in which they enable the reproduction of the same neo-liberal conditions that produce housing insecurity and deprivation. The article concludes by reframing housing issues in terms of racial subordination, which suggests that, in the neo-liberal context, social abandonment and economic investment may persist side by side.","CUNY, Grad Ctr, Program Sociol, New York, NY 10016 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Willse, C (通讯作者)，CUNY, Grad Ctr, Program Sociol, 365 5th Ave, New York, NY 10016 USA.",CWillse@gc.cuny.edu,,,,,,,53,50,84,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

This evidence is consistent with the view that constitutional judges have a vested interest in centralization or that there is self-selection or both. These insights are used to draw lessons for the reform of the European Court of Justice. Self-selection should be reduced by requiring judicial experience-ideally with the highest national courts.

A number of pragmatic responses is proposed: practitioners and academics should attempt to spread a better understanding of this complexity; this community should also engage those who commission PTP in a debate about the need for monitoring and its purpose; the community should openly accept that PTP is not yet a mature intervention; efforts should be made to convince those who commission PTP to appreciate the value of research conducted to understand PTP's impact as opposed to simply measuring it; and the PTP community should participate more actively in the drive to improve methods used to gauge behavioural change in travel resulting from the intervention.

In contrast to results reported from previous TravelSmart applications, the Melbourne program did not induce a statistically significant change in the average daily VKT when measured I year after the intervention. Multiple regressions revealed that the variability in change in VKT was better explained by socio-demographic variables than by the TravelSmart treatment. The change in VKT was also found to be strongly negatively correlated with the average daily vehicle kilometres recorded in the before survey-indicating the possibility of the 'regression-to-the-mean' effect well known in the road safety literature. The conditions under which the regression-to-the-mean effect may create the illusion of a positive TravelSmart program impact on the reduction in daily average VKT are examined. It is concluded that, in the context of voluntary travel behaviour change evaluations, greater attention should be paid to instrument reactivity arising from the impact of the before travel survey on TravelSmart uptake and/or on change in VKT, and to regression-to-the-mean effects.

Using a novel original database, the article compares the distribution of the general population and the creative class across 444 city regions in 8 European countries. It finds that the two groups are both distributed according to the rank-size rule, but exhibit different distinct phases with different slopes. The article argues that the two distributions are different because market thresholds for creative services and jobs are lower than thresholds for less specialized services and jobs. The article hence concludes that centrality exerts a strong influence upon urban hierarchies of creativity and that the study of creative urban city hierarchies yields new insights into the problem of centrality.","[Lorenzen, Mark; Andersen, Kristina Vaarst] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Innovat & Org Econ, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Lorenzen, M (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Innovat & Org Econ, Kilevej 14A,3, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",mark@cbs.dk; kva.ino@cbs.dk,"Andersen, Kristina Vaarst/T-3874-2018","Andersen, Kristina Vaarst/0000-0002-0181-6832",,,,,78,48,57,3,45,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

At present the carbon emissions balance of the South African economy is not well understood, especially the carbon emissions associated with imports and exports. An investigation was done of known economic input-output and life cycle analyses models addressing this shortcoming. The results reveal that South Africa is a major exporter of carbon; at least 129 per cent more carbon is associated with a dollar earned from exports than a dollar spent on imports, and the carbon footprint of the outflows on average, equates 37 per cent of the total carbon emissions of the economy.

This paper focuses on D&W's central criticism of a study by Zimmerman; specifically, that the estimated standard errors on the subset of his regressions that suggest a deterrent effect are downward biased due to autocorrelation. The method that D&W rely upon to adjust Zimmerman's standard errors is, however, potentially problematic, and is also only one of several methods to address the presence of autocorrelation. To this end, Zimmerman's original models are subjected to several parametric corrections for autocorrelation, all of which result in statistically significant estimates that are of the same magnitude to his original estimates. The paper also presents results obtained from an alternative model whose specification is motivated on theoretical and statistical grounds. These latter results also provide some evidence supporting a deterrent effect. Finally, the paper discusses D&W's use of randomization testing and their contention that executions are not carried out often enough to plausibly deter murders.","US Fed Trade Commiss, Bur Econ, Washington, DC 20580 USA",,"Zimmerman, PR (通讯作者)，US Fed Trade Commiss, Bur Econ, Antitrust 1,601 New Jersey Ave NW,Rm 8103, Washington, DC 20580 USA.",pzimmerman@ftc.gov,,,,,,,26,13,14,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

The main result of this paper is that vertical integration occurs only if the initial installed-base difference between the upstream networks is sufficiently small, and in that case, industry is configured with two vertically integrated networks, which yields highest incentives to invest in quality of interconnection. When the installed-base difference is sufficiently large, there is no integration in the industry, and neither of the firms have an incentive to invest in quality of interconnection. An industry configuration in which only the large network integrates and excludes (or raises cost of) its downstream rival does not appear as an equilibrium outcome: in the presence of a large asymmetry between the networks, when quality of interconnection is a strategic variable, the large network can exercise a substantial market power without vertical integration. Therefore, a vertically separated industry structure does not necessarily yield procompetitive outcomes.","Harvard Univ, Harvard John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Dogan, P (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Harvard John F Kennedy Sch Govt, 79 JFK St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",pinar_dogan@ksg.harvard.edu,,,,,,,23,3,3,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Despite this, competition authorities frequently refrain from intervening against excessive prices. The non-interventionist approach is based, among others, on the premise that high prices encourage new entry and thereby should be feared less. According to this view, in many cases, excessive prices are likely to be competed away and make intervention redundant. This paper questions this conventional view and reconsiders whether excessive prices are indeed self-correcting. It illustrates how, in the majority of cases, excessive prices will not attract new entry of viable competitors, whether entry barriers are high or low. Furthermore, it shows how, at times, the prohibition of excessive prices may encourage, rather than discourage, entry. By doing so, this paper narrows and focuses the arguments against intervention. Accordingly, it concludes that if excessive pricing is not to be prohibited, it should not be because it is thought to be self-correcting, but rather for reasons such as the need to stimulate investment or difficulties of implementation, which should be assessed on a case by case basis.","[Ezrachi, Ariel] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Gilo, David] Tel Aviv Univ, Buchmann Fac Law, Tel Aviv, Israel",University of Oxford; Tel Aviv University,"Ezrachi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",ezrachi@law.ox.ac.uk; gilod@post.tau.ac.il,,"Gilo, David/0000-0002-8644-5080",,,,,21,33,35,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Firms that are located near the frontier are also more likely to be acquired than to exit by liquidation if they cannot survive as free-standing enterprises. This suggests that product location in the technology space acts as a signal of firm quality. Greater R&D efforts increase the probability of surviving; in the event that the firm does exit, however, its R&D efforts do not significantly influence whether it exits via acquisition or exits via liquidation.","[Nesta, Lionel] Obser Francais Conjonctures Econ, Dept Rech Innovat & Concurrence, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Fontana, Roberto] Univ Pavia, Dept Econ, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Fontana, Roberto] Bocconi Univ, KITeS, I-20139 Milan, Italy",University of Pavia; Bocconi University,"Nesta, L (通讯作者)，Obser Francais Conjonctures Econ, Dept Rech Innovat & Concurrence, 250 Rue Albert Einstein, F-06560 Valbonne, France.",roberto.fontana@unibocconi.it; lionel.nesta@ofce.sciences-po.fr,,,,,,,45,75,85,2,37,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

A morally managed and a self-interested firm compete in a market in which their corporate social performance (CSP) provides product differentiation. Some citizens have altruistic or warm glow preferences for products with associated CSP, personal giving to social causes, holding shares in firms providing CSP, and contributing to social pressure to increase CSP. Social pressure is delivered by an activist NGO funded by voluntary contributions by citizens. The model characterizes an equilibrium in the product market, the capital market, and the market for social pressure. The equilibrium establishes a price for CSP and for activist-induced social pressure. The theory provides predictions of the market values of firms, the prices of products, firm profits, target selection, contributions to the activist, and the amount of CSP supplied. For example, if citizens do not distinguish between morally motivated CSP and CSP induced by social pressure, the activist is more likely to target the softer, morally motivated firm. Higher quality activists are better funded, target self-interested firms, and obtain greater corporate social performance. Lower quality activists target morally managed firms.","Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Baron, DP (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",dbaron@stanford.edu,,,,,,,38,172,192,3,70,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

We explored a possibility to extend the Ekvall's concept of creative climate for innovativeness from the level of individual organization to the national level. The main research goal was to identify fragments of national creative climate and to prove its relation to innovativeness. As the measurement for national innovativeness we took the Summary Innovation Index. The fragments of national creative climate were identified by 25 questions and answers selected from different public opinion polls published in the Eurobarometers. Using hierarchical clustering we clustered all EU member states and compared them with the clusters that identify Innovation Leaders, Innovation Followers, Moderate Innovators, and Catching-up countries. We found membership of both sets of clusters similar, which means that two essentially different sets of variables arriving from two completely different sources led to comparable result. We also identify top ten variables that contributed the most to distingnishing between Creative climate clusters. Finally, we argued that understanding creative or innovative climate in the EU countries is an important national policy-making tool that could complement hard macro-economic indicators that arc focused on innovative performance only, and not also on innovative socio-cultural environment. We wished-for a unified approach in the EU to develop an objective measurement for creative climate at country level. We also discussed some research challenges linked to this idea.","Univ Primorska, Fac Management Koper, Koper, Slovenia",University of Primorska,"Bavec, C (通讯作者)，Univ Primorska, Fac Management Koper, Cankarjeva 5, Koper, Slovenia.",cene.bavec@guest.arnes.si,"Saraiva, Dora/JJD-1722-2023",,,,,,36,8,9,0,16,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Our results, for Ireland in the year 2000, show that it is possible to derive more appropriate measures of total resources than have been derived using standard methods. The results indicate that the greatest impact comes from the inclusion of imputed rent for owner occupation as part of the resource measure. When this is done, the rate of resource poverty for older people is substantially reduced, in line with results which use indicators of standard of living as well as cash incomes (consistent poverty).","[Callan, Tim; Keane, Claire] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"Callan, T (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.",,,"Callan, Tim/0000-0002-3403-4191",,,,,48,10,10,1,7,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

Broadly speaking, organisational responses to this could include ignoring employees' non-work lives (separation), active involvement (integration), or creating flexibility and tolerance, thereby enabling employees to manage conflict (respect). This study investigates whether such response types impact differently on employee commitment. The findings suggest that a separation response decreases affective commitment, moderated by greater non-work involvement or role conflict. A respect response increases affective commitment, moderated by high non-work involvement, role conflict, hindrance coping or lower career commitment. Continuance and normative commitment were not affected. These findings suggest that managers might take a role in employees' non-work lives by creating flexibility and tolerance at work. However, managers should probably avoid implementing paternalistic approaches that attempt active involvement.","[Lee, Gregory John; Steele, Clare Louise] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Lee, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",,,"Lee, Gregory/0000-0002-2518-3515",,,,,43,2,5,0,11,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Endorsements can either be in the form of a celebrity acting as a spokesperson for an organisation or the organisation can create a spokesperson to act as an endorser. The problem that faces marketers is that little scientific proof exists if students perceive celebrity endorsements and creative spokespersons differently with regard to their expertise and trustworthiness. The aim of this study was to determine the attitudes of respondents with regard to expertise, trustworthiness and attractiveness of created spokesperson and celebrity endorsements in advertisements. This knowledge will provide marketing professionals with the strategic advantage of how and when to make use of an endorser. Ohanian's (1990) measurement scale of perceived expertise, trustworthiness and attractiveness was adopted in a self-administrative questionnaire for this article. Respondents (n=185) were exposed to six visual images of endorsers namely: three celebrities and three created spokespersons. It was found that attractiveness should not be used as a factor when comparing created endorsers with celebrity endorsers. The respondents perceived both endorsement applications as highly credible and professionals need to consider each application's advantages and disadvantages when deciding which application will be more effective for their advertising strategy. In the long term the organisation might find it more cost effective to create its own spokesperson due to the risk of possible characteristics changes or negative associations of celebrity endorsers. Revoking advertisements after celebrity endorsers have received negative publicity or changed character can lead to great financial losses. Created endorsers, on the other hand, provide the organisation with greater control and the ability to change to adapt to the organisation's market and advertising needs.","[van der Waldt, D. L.

This paper discusses how arrest avoidance behavior may affect cocaine consumer and dealer response to law enforcement. Dealers avoid arrest by making quick and easy sales; thus, pure-gram price is negatively related to dealer enforcement. Consumers avoid arrest by accepting high prices rather than searching for lower prices. Thus, pure-gram price is positively related to consumer enforcement. Because the implications from arrest avoidance conflict with traditional models of how enforcement should affect prices, I also empirically examine the relationship. Using purchase-level data from the Drug Enforcement Administration and legal penalty data, I find a negative, significant relationship between dealer enforcement and pure-gram price and a positive, significant relationship between consumer enforcement and pure-gram price. Both are consistent with the intuition of arrest avoidance.","Coll William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA",William & Mary,"Freeborn, BA (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",,,,,,,,22,4,8,0,4,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Results of the study indicate that SMA techniques are quite established among service companies in Malaysia as all techniques were moderately adopted. The most widely used techniques are financial performance measures, strategic pricing, value chain costing, quality costing and benchmarking. The results also indicate the uses of certain SMA techniques are significantly different between different sizes and business strategies. It is suggested that the need to provide high quality services during face to face meeting with customer or the moment of truth for the professional services might be a potential explanation on difference in the level of SMA practices between mass service and professional service. This study identifies intense competition and customized services are the underlying reasons of SMA practices variations among service companies. The understanding of SMA practices in service industry provides some insights into the level of management accounting innovation in an industry that has received minimal attention by prior researchers.","[Amiruddin, Rozita; Auzair, Sofiah Md.; Maelah, Ruhanita; Majid, Ainun Abd] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Sch Accounting, Fac Econ & Business, Bangi, Malaysia",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,,rozita@ukm.my,"Maelah, Ruhanita/V-3732-2018",,,,,,50,0,0,0,7,UNIV KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA,BANGI,"INST TENAGA, BANGI 43600, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-942-923-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,235,257,,,,,,23,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBC87,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306479500011,0

Inspired by Bruno Latour's work, we first describe the use in supermarkets and chain stores of one hybrid category, the mass-gift, which is neither a commodity nor a gift. Through our empirical investigation of sales interactions we critically describe the emergence of a vibrant mass-gift economy in which the meaning of 'gifts' and 'commodities' as well as their hybrid forms is infused with ambiguity which is strategically played out by agentive social actors throughout the sales process. We suggest going beyond depictions of mass-gifting as merely a calculative strategy for promoting sales. Instead, we illustrate how mass-gifting establishes a relational space in which actors can negotiate the ambivalence of the cultural script of the 'gift': they can re-qualify the seller-buyer relationship as a socially binding one; and they can use the ambiguity infused into the notion of the mass-gift to express economic might and generate symbolic as well as material gains.","[Bird-David, Nurit; Darr, Asaf] Univ Haifa, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; [Bird-David, Nurit] Harvard Univ, Dept Anthropol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Haifa; Harvard University,"Bird-David, N (通讯作者)，Univ Haifa, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",adarr@univ.haifa.ac.il,"Bird-David, Nurit/GRS-8646-2022",,,,,,59,36,39,3,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The aim is to contribute to the international entrepreneurship literature by exploring the relatively under-researched issue of international opportunity creation (Zahra and George, 2002b). To achieve this aim, the study draws on both entrepreneurship and internationalization literatures to review briefly relevant work on experience and networks, linking those to the entrepreneurship literature on the opportunity recognition process. A theoretical framework is developed which identifies experience- and network-based antecedents and dimensions of the international opportunity concept. The empirical component of the study comprises semi-structured interviews with managing directors (MDs) of nine internationalizing Scottish SMEs. Firms participating in the study had previously completed a programme tailored to internationalizing SMEs with growth potential, namely, the Global Companies Development Programme (GCDP), funded and run by Scottish Enterprise. Findings show that the international opportunity process is multistage, including both network-based and 'solo' instances of opportunity creation. Antecedents to international opportunity are not separated in time from the process of international opportunity creation; on the contrary, they are an integral part of the process.","[Casulli, Lucrezia] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,,,,,,,,,0,2,2,0,2,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"GLENSANDA HOUSE, MONTPELLIER PARADE, CHELTENHAM GL50 1UA, GLOS, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84720-830-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,20,36,,,,,,17,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BSP51,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285291900004,0

This is almost equivalent to causing their brain or mind to be designed in a modular way.

Index Tracking Problems are often complex in nature because of constraints on the portfolio structure and the chosen measure for the Tracking Error, quickly defying the use of traditional deterministic methods. Heuristic search and optimization methods, on the other hand, can deal with this complexity and therefore appear as ideal choice to solve this class of problems.

As a result one would expect to observe significant differences in individual banks' strategies. Contrary to our expectations, the majority of banks in tire Slovenian banking market pursue the same competitive strategy. They operate as universal banks implementing high growth strategies focused almost exclusively on expanding their market share in the domestic market. We model differences in the quality of services between banks and show that only those banks which invest in competitiveness-promoting activities can develop strategies that are viable in the long run.

Service quality is an important strategic weapon in retail contexts, particularly in developing defensive marketing strategies. The measurement of service quality in a retail setting is somewhat different from the measurement of service quality in other pure service settings. The most widely known and discussed scale for measuring service quality -SERVQUAL- has not been successfully adapted to and validated in a retail store environment. The retail service quality scale' (RSQS) [1] has been validated in the USA, Hong Kong, and Korea, but not in other cultural settings. Only a limited number of studies have attempted to measure service quality in retail settings, so there is a significant gap in the literature regarding this area of research. The present study addresses this gap by applying the RSQS among 648 customers of a large chain of retail stores in Northern Cyprus. The study also proposes and tests two hypotheses regarding the relationship between retail service and customers' behavioural intentions. The results confirm the applicability of the original five dimensions of the RSQS in the setting of Northern Cyprus. Retail service quality is shown to be positively related to behavioural intentions (intention to repurchase and intention to recommend). Multi-regression analyses reveal that the dimensions of physical aspects', problem solving', and reliability' have the greatest impact on customers' behavioural intentions. The study also analyses the relationship between certain demographic characteristics and perceptions of service quality. The results, managerial implications, and suggestions for future research are discussed in detail.","[Nadiri, Halil; Tuemer, Mustafa] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Business Adm, Gazimagusa, North Cyprus, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University,"Nadiri, H (通讯作者)，Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Business Adm, POB 95, Gazimagusa, North Cyprus, Turkey.",halil.nadiri@emu.edu.tr; mustafa.tumer@emu.edu.tr,"Tumer, Mustafa/J-4376-2015",,,,,,50,9,9,2,26,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

And to what extent, do they have adapted the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) mechanism for performance evaluation of their operations and departments? The significant objectives of this research are: 1) seeking to exploit practical performance evaluation techniques, and 2) reporting the BSC'S adaption among the TSE firms. In effect, four perspectives of the BSC, promoted by Kaplan & Norton (1992, 1996 & 2004), including financial, customer, internal process, and learning & growth, are extracted in the framework of different hypothesis. The population of this research encompasses all firms listed in the TSE for the year 2006. Totally, 200 qualified and active firms were identified, and a valid and reliable questionnaire was conveyed to them. However, only 68 of the questionnaires were complete and, therefore could be extricated in this study. The generated data were analyzed by t-test, binominal test and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) statistical techniques. The major findings of the study revealed that the most dominant traditional performance evaluation measures employed by the TSE firms are: 1) Net income (35.3%), 2) Operating income (32.4%), and 3) Total income (23.5%) accordingly, and only 4.4% of them are exploiting cash flows and ROI as their first priority. In addition, 38.2% of the respondents have indicated that they are utilizing Operating income as the second priority, and 39.7% of them are exerting Net income as the third priority. On the other hand, almost 92.6% of selected companies are not explicitly engaged with the BSC. However, most of them are embarking some non-financial measures in their performance evaluation systems. Age, educational degree, field of the study, and years of practical experience of the respondents were not statistically significant in providing the aforementioned results, but organizational position demonstrated a significant effect on the BSC'S adaption.","[Namazi, Mohammad; Abhari, Hamid Allahyari] Shiraz Univ, Shiraz, Iran",Shiraz University,,mnamazi@rose.shirazu.ac.ir; Hamid_al75@yahoo.com,"Namazi, Mohammad/I-4390-2014","Namazi, Mohammad/0000-0002-0342-7603",,,,,26,0,0,0,5,UNIV KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA,BANGI,"INST TENAGA, BANGI 43600, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-942-923-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,270,296,,,,,,27,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBC87,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306479500013,0

The family business was considered to be such a company in which members of one family hold at least two strategic management functions. There were used questionnaire surveys in order to obtain detailed data from individual firms. Data were then transferred to the SPSS program, subjected to the primary analysis and correlation analysis. Characteristics of family businesses were used as inputs for the NetLogo agent-based simulation. Agent-based models can be applied in numerous problem domains, typically in computer science, biology or medicine. In case of economy, agent metaphor can be used for modelling companies, decision makers, employees, customers etc. acting in the market. Our agent-based model allowed us to observe developmental stages of two abstract companies: family business and non-family business. The simulation enables experimenting with different settings of parameters (independent variables) that describe companies. The objective of the simulation was to identify the differences between the family and non-family businesses in sense of the Greiner's theory of the organization growth. The agent-based simulation results showed that family businesses in the first phase of their development grow in terms of amounts of asset and sales. This grow is faster than grow of non-family businesses. The break occurs at the stage of leadership crisis, where family businesses are starting to lag in size behind the non-family businesses. Our findings of the simulation experiments correspond with the findings in the area of family businesses research made in other European countries and in the USA.","[Odehnalova, Pavla] Masaryk Univ, Ekon Spravni Fak, Katedra Podnikoveho Hospodarstvi, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic; [Olsevicova, Kamila] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fak Informat & Managementu, Katedra Informacnich Technol, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno; University of Hradec Kralove,"Odehnalová, P (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Ekon Spravni Fak, Katedra Podnikoveho Hospodarstvi, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic.",63229@mail.muni.cz; kamila.olsevicova@uhk.cz,"Marciánová, Pavla/AAA-3534-2020; Marciánová, Pavla/ABA-9195-2021","Marciánová, Pavla/0000-0002-4835-8293",,,,,21,7,8,0,16,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The authors distinguish between the spatial embeddedness of ties as dispersed or concentrated. They explore the differential effects of local bridging tie embeddedness on new venture internationalization, based on a case study pertaining to each spatial embeddedness type. The cases concern a Bangalore (India) start-up engaged in spatially dispersed joint activity with Microsoft India, within the Bangalore software cluster; and a Cambridge (UK) venture with spatially concentrated links to a local venture capital (VC) firm, located within the Cambridge electronics cluster. The authors posit that the spatial embeddedness of local ties could have differential effects on the internationalization of new ventures in terms of: (1) differing trajectories of opportunity creation; (2) distinct knowledge-bases that are accessed; and (3) varying potential constraining effects. An implication is the utility of a holistic approach whereby internationalizing new ventures cultivate and utilize both forms of network relationships. Future research directions highlighted include the development of organizational capabilities by international new ventures (INVs) through interacting with local bridging ties such as multinational corporation (MNC) subsidiaries and VC firms; and the influence of local bridging ties on internationalization routines.","[Prashantham, Shameen] Univ Glasgow, CIER, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Prashantham, S (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, CIER, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,6,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"GLENSANDA HOUSE, MONTPELLIER PARADE, CHELTENHAM GL50 1UA, GLOS, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84720-830-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,166,184,,,,,,19,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BSP51,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285291900013,0

Where capitalism is coordinated, as in much of northern Europe, political systems are consensus-based with proportional representation (PR); consensus politics and coordinated capitalism reinforce each other in generating relatively low inequality and strong welfare states. Where capitalism is liberal - the Anglo-Saxon countries - political systems are competitive with majoritarian voting: mutual reinforcement of politics and capitalism generates relatively inegalitarian outcomes and safety-net welfare states. The second half of the article develops a model of hierarchical capitalism to show how this reinforces and is reinforced by a Latin American political system with majoritarian presidents and PR legislatures to generate high and persistent inequality and reduce development options.","[Schneider, Ben Ross] MIT, Dept Polit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Soskice, David] Duke Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Durham, NC 27705 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Duke University,"Schneider, BR (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Polit Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave,Room E53-470, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",brs@northwestern.edu; soskice@duke.edu,,,,,,,52,100,126,3,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Companies in Slovak republic are still lagging in electronic commerce using, and to ensure expansion in this field, is necessary current status identification and moreover comparison with advanced states of EU. This article is focused on description of selected areas in Slovak chemical and machinery sectors, which are Gross Domestic Product main contributors, especially production of automobile, and activities in these sectors are crucial for future economic development of Slovak republic. In this article the survey of ICT usage based on European eBusiness w@tch methodology was conducted with special focus on most perspective areas. Based on questionnaire survey, the results in the field of on-line buying and selling adoption and related activities of mentioned sectors are presented and current status is compared with percentage average of electronic business exploitation among companies in the old member states. Together with current status also some positive trends in using electronic buying and selling within chemical and machinery sectors, in a period of three years, are identified. One of the most important and relatively positive issues is that, although Slovak companies has big gaps in e-procurement and e-selling adoption, in the case if the company already use such a solution, they use this on very high level of complexity and functionality.

These contributions have identified social and spatial polarisation associated with globalisation, deindustrialisation and the increasing income inequalities arising from these. However, various 'moderating' factors were identified to explain why different outcomes were emerging in European cities than in their American counterparts. In this context much of the literature has focused on types of national welfare state and as these arrangements have come under pressure across Europe it may be expected that differences from the USA may decline. However there are other literatures that, rather than emphasising the importance of national welfare states, refer to the stronger interventionist traditions of European governments and the distinctive characteristics of European cities. Differences in these dimensions within Europe - including those related to urban planning and decommodified housing - do not correlate with typologies of national welfare states and suggest continuing divergence within Europe and between Europe and the USA. Working within this framework, this introduction to a special issue argues that although European welfare states have weakened, other factors continue to sustain differences between European and American cities. When looking at newly emerging spatial patterns, the major economic and political changes experienced in countries in Central and Eastern Europe are important in explaining why these countries often show causes and effects that differ from their counterparts in Western Europe.","[Van Kempen, Ronald] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Murie, Alan] Univ Birmingham, CURS, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",Utrecht University; University of Birmingham,"Van Kempen, R (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, POB 80-115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",R.vanKempen@geo.uu.nl; A.S.Murie@bham.ac.uk,,,,,,,152,99,104,1,83,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Nevertheless, the object of interest could be categorized to different spheres: causes of corruption, results of corruption, analyses of corruption level in accordance with states, concrete corruption causes, anti-corruption experience in single countries and so on. However, a great deal of scientists defends against research on corruption and affirms that,,what should not have been, it even may not be. After all, even anti-corruption legislation had originated practically always behind schedule (in England not till year 1889) because there dominated hypocritical tendency to affirm that the problem of corruption in this country does not exist. Although there had been written a number of books about corruption during overpast decades, really scientific (not only tabloid and journalistic) books and articles on the theme of corruption exist only on a small scale, both in terms of foreign and internal literature. Approaches to corruption are fragmented and only few approaches try to view to corruption as economic problem. That is why we attempt to map the reflection of corruption in historical development of economic theories in this text. This article is concerned with problems of corruption and its theoretic reflection in historical development of economic theories. In this context we analyse the period of origin of early economic thinking, the period of separation of economics as independent branch of science and the period of development of economics during nineteenth and twentieth century that reflected paradigm changes within economic theories. We lay specific stress on analysis of the theory of public choice and the conception of new institutional economics. In the paper we appear from the fact that corruption was, is and as well as in the future it will stay with the most probability one of the possible forms of economic behaviour of economic entities with significant impact on quality of economy of individual as well as economy of government. Our purpose in submitted paper is to discuss whether and which way the problems of corruption was analysed and interpreted by economists during historical development of economic theories.","Univ Pardubice, Fak Ekon Spravni, Ekon Ustav, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Volejniková, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fak Ekon Spravni, Ekon Ustav, Studentska 84, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic.",jolana.volejnikova@upce.cz,,,,,,,26,7,7,0,14,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The scholarly polemic has shown that none of the liability regimes recognized thus far in the literature efficiently satisfies both social goals. Following a Law and Economics approach, this paper develops an innovative regime that may comprise an optimal corporate liability framework in most settings. The Compound Corporate Liability Regime developed in this paper is a two-layer strict liability regime. Under this regime, corporations that self-report their employee misconduct incur a sanction that is reduced by the variable enforcement costs saved due to their self-reporting. Such a liability framework aligns social and corporations' interests, and thereby satisfies both social goals of corporate liability regimes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Yet the empirical question, whether people actually do value facing distinct platforms when they vote, remains open. In this paper I seek to remedy that situation by systematically addressing the question using cross-national survey data. Specifically, I investigate whether satisfaction with democracy depends on the number and/or the substance of the choices that are available to people when they vote. The analysis offers strong support for the idea that what matters most to voters is the substance of electoral choices. Although the number of choices also matters, the significance of this factor is conditional on being able to vote for a party that represents one's views, or on voting for the winner.","NYU, Wilf Family Dept Polit, New York, NY 10003 USA",New York University,"Harding, R (通讯作者)，NYU, Wilf Family Dept Polit, New York, NY 10003 USA.",robin.harding@nyu.edu,,,,,,,14,8,8,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

By means of a hazard model, we examine the effect of agglomeration economies and pre-entry entrepreneurial experience on the survival chances of publishing firms. Although such survival analyses have been conducted for manufacturing industries, they are scarce for cultural and service industries. Based on a unique data set of all book publishers founded between 1880 and 2008 in the Netherlands, this article demonstrates that the clustering of book publishers in the Amsterdam region did not increase the survival of Amsterdam firms in general. Instead, prior experience in publishing and related industries had a positive effect on firm survival. Publishing firms with such prior experience, like spinoffs, did perform better in Amsterdam. Interestingly, the Amsterdam cluster did not function as an attractor for publishing firms from other regions, but rather acted as an incubator for firms that relocated to other regions.","[Heebels, Barbara; Boschma, Ron] Univ Utrecht, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht URU, Fac Geosci, Dept Econ Geog, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Boschma, R (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht URU, Fac Geosci, Dept Econ Geog, Heidelberglaan 2,POB 80115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",r.boschma@geo.uu.nl,,,,,,,55,49,53,0,53,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

To this end, companies need to know their customers' needs and do their best to satisfy them. Customers want to feel important and, therefore, companies should be concerned not only about selling, but also about knowing the real customer satisfaction/dissatisfaction level. From a logical viewpoint, this matter should be included in the business behavior pattern. Barroso (2008) and Coca (2008), in previous issues of this publication, also agree with this premise. However, real practices show that this is not always the case. Even though customers always want to feel well treated, some companies seem to forget this basic premise yet, nevertheless, obtain positive results. This work aims to analyze to what extent companies are able to convert initially dissatisfied customers into loyal customers. Through descriptive statistics and the Partial LI Ieast Squares (PLS) technique, conclusions are that some companies behave in a manner opposite to the customers' expectations and do not aim to regain their satisfaction. Nevertheless, user opinion is very revealing and suggests that it is possible to convert an initially dissatisfied client into a faithful client. The concept of service recovery processes in a study of the Spanish mobile phone industry is taken as a referent.","[Cambra-Fierro, Jesus] Univ Zaragoza, Area Mercadotecnia, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Cambra-Fierro, J (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Area Mercadotecnia, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain.",jjcamfie@upo.es; rruiben@upo.es; jmberpin@upo.es; rvascar@upo.es,"Cambra-Fierro, Jesús/K-8325-2014; Ruiz-Benitez, Rocio/AAZ-3948-2020; , Rosario/E-2589-2013","Ruiz-Benitez, Rocio/0000-0001-5343-8573;",,,,,41,1,1,0,15,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

In doing so, this study is based on three theoretical premises: first, that the voters reward or punish parties according to their performances relative to the macroeconomic conditions; second, that the popularity of the political parties in Turkey are closely connected to their performances in local elections; and third, that the centre-periphery distinction affects the fortunes of the political parties in Turkey. The contribution of this analysis is the introduction of an explicit model on which can forecast the impact of economic and political variables on the elections in Turkey by using reliable, public and macro level data. Our findings show that the dynamics of the evaluation of political parties in Turkey follow a similar pattern to those of contemporary democracies, being driven by both economic and political factors.  ... why did AKP win?

In this paper we conduct a comparative analysis to identify systematic sources of influence on direct price elasticity estimates in the context of freight transport, distinguishing between road, rail, and sea transport, using published direct price elasticities from 12 elasticity-derivative studies from five countries. The study focuses on revealed preference elasticities defined by the freight rate for tonnes and tonne kilometres of inter-city freight movements. Systematic sources that explain differences in direct price elasticities include the demand elasticity measure, mode, commodity class, model estimation form, country, and temporal nature of data (e.g., cross-section). Analysts can utilise the model outputs to adjust the empirical evidence from specific studies to control for differences that impact on the behavioural implications of comparative evidence.

Consequently, strategic legislators and bureaucrats must take capacity into account in designing programs. This article develops a theory of endogenous organizational capacity. Capacity is modeled as an investment that affects a policy's subsequent quality or implementation level. The agency has an advantage in providing capacity investments and may therefore constrain the legislature's policy choices. A key variable is whether investments can be targeted toward specific policies. If it cannot, then implementation levels decrease with the divergence in the players' ideal points and policy-making authority may be delegated to encourage investment. If investment can be targeted, then implementation levels increase with the divergence of ideal points if the agency is sufficiently professionalized, and no delegation occurs. In this case, the agency captures more benefits from its investment, and capacity is higher. The agency therefore prefers policy-specific technology.

One beneficial strategy is to use constituent forecasts that have diverse information. In this paper we consider the idea of diversity being accomplished by using different time aggregations. For example, we could create a yearly time series from a monthly time series and produce forecasts for both, then combine the forecasts. These forecasts would each be tracking the dynamics of different time scales, and would therefore add diverse types of information. A comparison of several forecast combination methods, performed in the context of this setup, shows that this is indeed a beneficial strategy and generally provides a forecasting performance that is better than the performances of the individual forecasts that are combined. As a case study, we consider the problem of forecasting monthly tourism numbers for inbound tourism to Egypt. Specifically, we consider 33 individual source countries, as well as the aggregate. The novel combination strategy also produces a generally improved forecasting accuracy. (C) 2010 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Production costs per hectare were determined, as were income, number of applications of agrochemicals, labor utilization, days of germination for the seedlings and accumulated fresh mass. In an area of 2 hectares with drip irrigation, hybrid ovation melon plants were cultivated. Two treatments were evaluated, one with the use of plastic mulch and the other without the use of plastic. This was a randomized block experiment; each experimental unit consisted of 20 plants selected at random. Evaluations were performed weekly. Statistical analysis detected differences between treatments evaluated for variable accumulated fresh mass. The greatest value of this variable was obtained using plastic mulch (1.67 kg); when no plastic was used, it was 0.80 kg. Plants germinated in the fields at three days for both treatments, so the plastic did not influence germination. Producers get better returns per hectare (17,704 Bs F) in each cycle, with fewer applications of chemicals (10); they are less exposed to contact with the products and use 37 days less of staff time, providing an alternative to the current labor shortage in the Miranda municipality.","Univ Zulia, Fac Agron, Dept Ciencias Sociales & Econ, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela",,"Nava, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Zulia, Fac Agron, Dept Ciencias Sociales & Econ, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela.",juancarlosnaval@hotmail.com,,,,,,,15,1,1,0,8,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

Comments on Crandall-Jackson and Wright",REVIEW OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Monopolization; Regulation; Microsoft; Loyalty discounts; Exclusion; Antitrust and innovation,,"That prominent antitrust cases have been in the high-tech arena is not surprising, since high-tech industries are often susceptible to the scale economies that lead to highly concentrated or monopoly markets. Crandall and Jackson's observations on the IBM case are on point. Regarding AT&T, the salient observation is that recent changes in legal doctrine may make it impossible to bring antitrust cases in regulated industries. The problem with the Microsoft case was not that it was right or wrong, but that it was fundamentally incoherent. Wright's critique of the Federal Trade Commission's case against Intel is problematic because buyers in exclusion cases tend to be better off, not victims as they would be under collusion or anticompetitive mergers. As these observations apply more generally to cases in sectors that are not associated with high-tech, I offer a few thoughts on some antitrust issues that are particular to high-tech sectors, specifically how the prospect of innovation could affect market definition in merger cases and, more broadly, whether dynamic efficiencies reduce the need for antitrust enforcement.","Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County,"Brennan, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, 1000 Hilltop Circle, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA.",brennan@umbc.edu,,,,,,,7,2,2,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

Implications of the results are discussed, and avenues for future research are offered.","Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Sch Tourism & Hospitality Management, TRNC, Gazimagusa, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University,"Karatepe, OM (通讯作者)，Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Sch Tourism & Hospitality Management, TRNC, Via Mersin 10, Gazimagusa, Turkey.",osman.karatepe@emu.edu.tr,"Karatepe, Osman M./H-7108-2012","Karatepe, Osman M./0000-0003-3120-8755",,,,,76,60,66,4,62,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The franchising framework is characterised by a strong decentralisation of responsibilities, a considerable degree of freedom for the responsible authorities regarding contract design, a sound financial basis for awarding contracts, and the free choice of authorities between tendering procedures and direct awarding of franchise contracts. This paper analyses the key outcomes of this franchising approach. We conclude that regionalisation of responsibilities and franchising positively impacts on service provision, patronage, customer satisfaction, service quality and costs, in particular through better targeting of services. However, these positive outcomes could have been even greater if the failures in the institutional set-up, foremost the vertical integration of the DB group and insufficient regulation, were resolved. Overall, competitive tendering appears to bear further potential for additional cost savings and quality improvements, although for already competitively awarded contracts the improvements will not be as great as those from the first round.","[Link, Heike] German Inst Econ Res DIW, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Merkert, Rico] Cranfield Univ, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Cranfield University,"Link, H (通讯作者)，German Inst Econ Res DIW, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",hlink@diw.de; r.merkert@cranfield.ac.uk,,"Merkert, Rico/0000-0001-9939-7199",,,,,51,7,7,0,12,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

Our results suggest that de-restriction is appropriate for those authorities that fail to regulate the market properly, but also that quantity restrictions may be a characteristic of a well-managed taxi market.",,,"Aquilina, M (通讯作者)，25 N Colonnade, London E14 5HS, England.",Matteo.aquilina@gmail.com,,,,,,,11,2,6,0,14,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.
