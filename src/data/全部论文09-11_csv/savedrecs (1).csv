It is often argued that auctions allocate rights to the highest-valued users and thereby maximize resource rents. We counter that rents are not fixed in situ, but rather depend additionally upon the innovation, investment, and collective actions of fishers, who discover and enhance stocks and convert them into valuable goods and services. Our analysis shows how grandfathering increases rents by raising expected rates of return for investment, lowering the cost of capital, and providing incentives for collective action.","[Libecap, Gary D.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Arnason, Ragnar] Univ Iceland, Dept Econ, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Anderson, Terry] Bozeman Montana Hoover Inst, PERC, Bozeman, MT 59718 USA; [Libecap, Gary D.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of Iceland; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Libecap, GD (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",tla@perc.org; ragnara@hi.is; glibecap@bren.ucsb.edu,,,,,,,99,33,34,0,23,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4703-1,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

This article analyses the impact of mutual fund cash flows on the relation between size and performance, demonstrating that performance determines asymmetric variations in fund assets, particularly in mutual equity funds. Therefore, the more efficient funds generate broad enough cash flow entry that increases the relative size of the fund, leading to an implicit and positive relation between size and performance. So, if the average size over the period sample is used as a measure of size, such a relation would be biased. When the initial size is used, this bias is avoided and, in general, an insignificant relation is found between size and performance. These results are controlled by mutual fund costs using gross returns to estimate performance. The evidence is robust, and shows only weak evidence of a negative relation between size and performance for the balanced funds that is driven by a low positive relation between costs and size; precisely, the contrary that is expected from the hypothesis of the presence of economies of scale.","Univ Jaume 1, Dept Finanzas & Contabilidad, Castellon de La Plana 12070, Spain",Universitat Jaume I,"Matallín-Sáez, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Dept Finanzas & Contabilidad, Campus Riu Sec, Castellon de La Plana 12070, Spain.",matallin@cofin.uji.es,"Matallín-Sáez, Juan Carlos/ISB-0396-2023",,,,,,26,3,4,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We also find evidence that policies that help women to continue in the same job after childbirth decrease the family gap. Of all the countries we study, mothers in Southern Europe suffer the biggest family gap and our analysis indicates that this is due to the bad combination of labour market policies in these countries.

Within Asia, Hong Kong has a larger banking sector as a whole, but the position is similar if we focus on the offshore side of it, where Singapore is growing faster than Hong Kong. Furthermore, Singapore is being more active as a banking platform for international corporates while Hong Kong remains larger in terms of banking relations. In fact, Hong Kong continues to have one of the highest concentrations of large banking institutions in the world. Such an international banking platform, together with the increasing local presence of Chinese banks, offers Hong Kong a unique opportunity to become a major banking center, probably the largest offshore center in Asia. Whether Hong Kong reaps this opportunity will very much depend on how it navigates among the opportunities that China offers in its current situation of capital controls without losing its international clout. In fact, the Hong Kong banking system should benefit from the business from China coming offshore due to capital controls (including not only renminbi [RMB] settlements but also issuance of RMB-denominated bonds). However, it should also look for non-Chinese-related banking business so as to ensure that it remains distinguishable from China's domestic banking system in the years to come.","Univ Lingnan, Lingnan, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",,"García-Herrero, A (通讯作者)，Univ Lingnan, 8 Castle Peak Rd, Lingnan, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",alicia.garcia-herrero@bbva.com.hk,,"Garcia Herrero, Alicia/0000-0003-4916-7293",,,,,6,11,11,0,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

We decompose Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth into the scale and technical change components and analyse variability of plants' productivity by constructing transition matrices. We observe a cross-sectional dispersion in plant-level productivity growth in the industry. Even though the industry aggregate shows a small TFP growth rate -0.3%, quartile rank analysis shows that while the lowest productivity quartile plants average 1.9% loss in productivity, the highest productivity quartile plants average 1.1% growth annually. Our results show considerable movements of plants in their productivity rank categories overall and across age groups, and we find that the scale effect contribution to TFP growth accounts for about 90% of TFP growth on average in the industry. These plants extract scale efficiencies over technological progress to fuel TFP growth. The youngest plants start with the lowest productivity growth at the initial time period, but they catch up older plants productivity, which present the highest average growth rate through years.

Railtrack took over the ownership of BR's fixed infrastructure in April 1994 and its parent company, the Railtrack Group, was floated in May 1996 on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). Despite the group posting some excellent financial results in the early years, Railtrack's record on infrastructure improvement and safety was frequently criticized. This apparent inconsistency between shareholder interests and public service obligations culminated in Railtrack being placed in administration in October 2001. In view of this apparent inconsistency and the High Court claim for additional compensation brought against the government by a group of 49 000 small investors, the reaction of the stock market to 19 key events is modelled. Among other things, we find when Railtrack announced after the fatal derailment of a high-speed train near the Hertfordshire town of Hatfield that there would be a 6-month programme of emergency track repairs, the Group's share price was marked down, but it did not plummet. Even though Railtrack was in panic mode, it appears that investors decided to hold onto their shares, believing the panic would have no long-term repercussions.

The successful developing and implementation of this strategy depend largely on establishing regional cooperation and a network that addresses to similar agricultural needs, priorities and practices, science based on regulations that should be able to protect public health and environment and to stimulate economic development, regional and global trade, modern agricultural practices, advanced food and feed production industry. The germs of such a regional cooperation and networking are developed by the Black Sea Biotechnology Association (BSBA), established in June 2004, as a public non-profit organization that has proved to be a very promising example of cooperative achievements. This example deserves to be followed and extended on a large scale inside all Europe and even outside the continental limits. Very valuable information has been accumulated during fourteen years of genetic modified organisms (GMOs) cultivation (since 1996), continuously spreading in a number of 25 countries on different continents, under the dedicated management of International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Application (ISAAA), led by remarkable specialist dr. Clive James. The global impact of GMOs cultivation consists in higher level of productivity and economic benefits, as well as a considerable reduction of pesticide use, a decreasing of CO(2) emission and soil, water and biodiversity preservation. The up-to-date evaluation of GMOs cultivation and use has not registered any negative effect on the human and animal health, the biodiversity, the consequences of the gene-flood to the conventional crops, the environmental resources. There are some strong reasons to join our efforts for promoting GMOs adoption in agricultural systems, without any further delay and to improve public perception of biotechnology achievements.","[Hera, Cristian] Acad Romana, Bucharest, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Hera, C (通讯作者)，Acad Romana, Bucharest, Romania.",hera@acad.ro,,,,,,,7,2,2,0,131,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Alternative procedures were compared based on out-of-sample performance over 1995/96 through 2006/07. The results of this study demonstrate that kernel density, quantile distribution and best fitting parametric distribution (logistic) methods provided confidence intervals calibrated at the 80% level prior to harvest and 90% level after harvest. The kernel density-based method appears most accurate both before and after harvest with the final value falling inside the forecast interval 77% of the time before harvest and 92% after harvest, followed by quantile regression (73% and 91% before and after harvest, respectively) logistic distribution (73% and 90% before and after harvest, respectively) and histogram (66% and 84% before and after harvest, respectively).

Yet, the degree to which households apply this construct in their charitable giving practices remains unclear. This study examines the practice of tithing using data from a national expenditures survey including 56 663 households. Despite the pervasiveness of the tithing concept, religious donors did not appear to be targeting a specific 10% giving level. This may have resulted from varied definitions of income for tithing purposes or the presence of small charitable gifts made without reference to income. While the likelihood of religious giving increased with income, the likelihood of tithing fell dramatically. As a group, tithers had less income, but were wealthier, more educated, older and gave more to nonreligious charity than did other households. Religious tithers who also gave to nonreligious charities were wealthier, older and more highly educated than tithers who gave only to religious organizations.","[James, Russell N., III] Univ Georgia, Dept Housing & Consumer Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Jones, Keely S.] Univ Georgia, Dept Publ Adm & Policy, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"James, RN (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Dept Housing & Consumer Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",rjames@uga.edu,,"James, Russell/0000-0002-1887-8183",,,,,40,7,15,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The relevance of the performance measurement at the electricity sector is determined by starting the process of gradual electricity market liberalization which changes performance conditions of companies operating in this sector. Scientific literature within the context of the analysis of such processes impact on the performance measurement and PMS in this sector is poor and fragmentary. This paper is the first one in which it is analyzed the performance measurement in Lithuanian electricity companies. Theoretical background of the research is based on the assumptions that the changing environment of an organizational the performance has a direct impact on the changes of performance measurement which, in its turn, are realized in close connection with the projects on reorganizing PMS (Ponikvar, Tajnikar and Pushnik, 2009; Gimzauskiene and Valanciene, 2009; Gimzauskiene and Kloviene, 2010). According to this approach, the appropriate changes in electricity market allow to presume by increasing the importance of the evaluation of non-financial indicators, herewith and the relevance of the application of modern PMSs. Following these presumptions, the features of the performance measurement and changes of PMS due to electricity market liberalization were analyzed. The research was performed in free types of electricity companies in order to explore the specification of performance measurement and the impact of market liberalization on it in different types of companies. In total four Lithuanian grand electricity companies were researched which were selected by handily selection method. The main results disclosed that due to short time electricity market liberalization still has not had considerable impact on the performance measurement of companies. Traditional attitude to performance measurement mostly based on financial indicators and traditional functions of performance measurement was dominant. However, the research revealed that the importance of non-financial indicators was growing. These changes were mostly related with the increasing relevance of the measurement of strategy implementation, customers and other stakeholder satisfaction and workers evaluation. Together with the indicators of these ranges it was envisaged the increasing relevance of the application of modern PMSs, especially in the company of electricity generation. The research disclosed that the increasing competition between independent suppliers gradually increased the importance of a competitive strategy formation and the measurement of non-financial indicators. Therefore, in this company the application of modern PMS as the means of strategy implementation was foreseen more relevant in comparison with other types of electricity companies.","[Jasiukevicius, Linas; Christauskas, Ceslovas] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44239 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Jasiukevicius, L (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 20, LT-44239 Kaunas, Lithuania.",linas.jasiukevicius@gmail.com; ceslovas.christauskas@ktu.lt,"Christauskas, Ceslovas/AAR-3035-2021",,,,,,43,4,4,0,13,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The authors adopt a proactive approach to the construction of robust schedules to cope with multiple disruptions during project execution, applicable to two processes starting policies (as soon as possible or no sooner than on a predefined date). The proposed method, based on simulation technique and mathematical programming, was illustrated by an example. The results obtained by means of the proposed method were compared, in terms of schedule stability, to those of the float factor heuristic and starting time criticality heuristic procedures.

But it seems that the inflationary effects of the modification of VAT are negligible.","[Lupu, Adriana; Coloiu (Cretu), Daniela] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Lupu, A (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",adi_andreea2001@yahoo.com; daniela_cretu7@yahoo.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-606-12-0139-6,,,,2011,,,,,,,427,436,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH0UM,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000396639300061,0

Coming up with theoretically-motivated and practical policy options in such cases has proven difficult. Deterministic intertemporal general equilibrium models yield what appear to be feasible optimal price paths, but only by assuming away many key uncertainties, nor do they specify how the possibility of new information should affect the policy path. Bayesian models allow limited uncertainty and optimal learning based on observed effects of policy changes, but suggest a discouraging delay before optimal policy can be identified. A full insurance model suggests that risk aversion and 'fat-tailed' probabilities of catastrophe imply an implausibly (or at least impractically) large risk premium, implying that practical policy decisions depend so critically on uncertain parameters as to be unavoidably arbitrary. This paper proposes an entirely new approach based on the observation that the situation giving rise to a complex intertemporal externality also yields an observable state variable that contains information relevant to the identification of the optimal policy path. I derive a simple transformation by which the state variable can yield a good approximation to the optimal externality price. I outline assumptions sufficient to yield the transformation, and present numerical examples that illustrate its ability to follow linear and nonlinear first-best price paths. A specific application to greenhouse gases is proposed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It can be perceived statically, i.e. as a specific structural fluxion of the market which implies 'tension' between enterprises, or dynamically, i.e. as a process or 'struggle' of market participants in the course of which a new situation is formed. The position of the enterprise in the market as well as its potential in the competitive struggle is traditionally described as competitiveness. In regard of the necessary knowledge that the companies as the participants of the market must have at their disposal, the procedure of selection of resources and actions to facilitate the acquisition of future competitiveness is of the utmost importance in theoretical and practical studies. In other words, it is necessary to define in advance the state of things which can lead to gaining competitive advantage. This state should be determined by studying the expected efficiency of actions performed on the basis of the enterprise's competitive potential and which can be regarded as the potential of successful competition. The above mentioned circumstances are the main motif to introduce an additional element into the structure of competitiveness which can provide the possibility for all concerned (researchers, experts, managers) to identify and assess the resources and related actions which are to determine future competitiveness of the enterprise. Ability to compete consists of two interrelated parts, i.e. ability as physical possibilities to do something (resources, labor, equipment, raw materials, operating abilities, etc.) and knowledge, i.e. knowing how to efficiently make use of competitive potential (how much and, which is most important, what resources are necessary and how they are to be utilized). This work suggests the competitive ability assessment model which consists of five successive and interrelated elements: - formation of the list of resources, operational capabilities and external circumstances; - identifying the importance of resources, capabilities and external circumstances within the framework of the sector; - assessment of the enterprise's strength' of competitive potential elements (competition instruments); - assessment of the enterprise's management competencies (i.e. knowing how to compete); - synthesis of the assessed results and the formation of opinion about the enterprise's capability to compete. The assessment of competitive ability is not an end in itself. The measured level of this ability can serve as a certain instrument to be used in making managerial decisions. The further summary of the results or the decision to make use of partial indexes depend on the needs of those applying this instrument (i.e. the goals of the planned analysis).","[Mickeviciene, Monika; Zitkus, Leonas] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44320 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Mickeviciene, M (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Kestucio St 8, LT-44320 Kaunas, Lithuania.",mon_mic@yahoo.com; leonas.zitkus@ktu.lt,,,,,,,74,3,3,1,24,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The economic situation of countries currently using the common currency the euro was compared with the present substantially different. Candidates for membership in the euro zone must strictly realize the Maastricht criteria if they are interested to entry the euro zone. The Maastricht criteria is the necessary condition for euro adoption, and therefore the analysis of impact of the Maastricht criteria on the economy should be the essential part of the analysis of euro adoption. The paradox is that most member states these limits for selected macroeconomic country does not fulfill. The question thus arises whether there is time to change the setting, the Maastricht criteria to better suit the current economic situation. This paper does not aim to find an alternative.

Here we evaluate the joint impacts of exchange rate appreciation on trade flows and country surpluses using a general equilibrium trade model with a simple monetary structure in which the trade surplus is endogenously determined in the exchange rate setting country and the exchange rate is exogenous. We illustrate its application to the Chinese case using calibration to 2005 data. Our results, while elasticity dependent, suggest that the impacts of Renminbi (RMB) revaluation on the surplus are proportionally larger than on trade flows, and that changes in trade flows can be substantial. Different treatments of China's processing trade have small impact on changes in China's trade flow under RMB appreciation, but significant impacts on the change in the surplus. Results are elasticity dependent: larger substitution elasticities in preferences yield larger effects on trade flows and the surplus. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Our analysis emphasizes three aspects of artistic markets: the predominance of superstars, the important role of promotion expenditures, and the difficulties of talent-sorting. In the short run, piracy reduces superstars' earnings and market share and increases the number of niche and young artists. In the long run, copying can also have a positive effect on high-quality artistic creation by helping more young artists start their careers, which increases the number of highly talented artists in subsequent periods. The long-term impact of levies on copy equipment on artistic creation depends on whether their yields primarily accrue to superstars who already receive rents or are allocated to help young artists.

The childbirth decisions of households are planned jointly with decisions about lifecycle consumption. The model is calibrated using data for Australia drawn, where possible, from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Wave 7 survey. The simulations show that changes in family benefits are likely to have both timing and quantum effects on childbirth but of a small magnitude, which tends to support findings using alternative empirical approaches. The simulations also indicate the effects of indirect family benefits, such as paid maternity leave and policies to reduce the time that mothers spend out of the labour force following child birth.","[Guest, Ross] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia; [Parr, Nick] Macquarie Univ, Dept Business, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus; Macquarie University,"Guest, R (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Gold Coast Campus, Qld 4222, Australia.",r.guest@griffith.edu.au,"; Parr, Nicholas/G-3985-2012","Guest, Ross/0000-0002-7171-3054; Parr, Nicholas/0000-0002-7539-912X",,,,,29,7,7,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

In a lobbying contest between the two interest groups, consumers and producers, their relative political contributions determine the probabilities of the policy-maker choosing their respective bliss points: free trade or autarky.

Estimation of a discrete time hazard model indicates that faculty members at universities with mandatory retirement at age 65 have exit rates at age 65 that are around 30 to 38 percentage points higher than those of their counterparts at universities without mandatory retirement. This overall difference in exit rates is found when the sample is restricted by discipline, professional rank and type of university. Similar results are found for both men and women; however, the magnitude of this effect is somewhat smaller for women. Restricting the analysis to include faculty members who received their highest degree at age 34 or older does not affect the magnitude of the difference in exit rates between faculty at universities without mandatory retirement and those at universities with mandatory retirement. The estimated survival probabilities indicate that only 22.7% of faculty members employed at age 64 at universities without mandatory retirement will continue to be employed at the same university at age 72.

Government expenditure is tax-financed on a pay-as-you-go basis. A utilitarian judge chooses expenditures to maximize a social welfare function. The nonlinear solution is found to involve the ratio of a welfare-weighted average income, which depends on the inequality aversion of the judge, to arithmetic mean income. An approximation for this ratio is found that produces explicit solutions for the optimal composition. The result is used to obtain an indication of implicit inequality aversion for a range of countries.","[Moslehi, Solmaz] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3145, Australia; [Creedy, John; Li, Shuyun May] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",Monash University; University of Melbourne,"Moslehi, S (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Caulfield Campus, Clayton, Vic 3145, Australia.",solmaz.moslehi@gmail.com,"Li, Shuyun May/O-6198-2015","Li, Shuyun May/0000-0001-5825-866X",,,,,22,2,2,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

This paper analyses the extent to which trust decreases with social distance, using data from a survey conducted in a village in rural Cameroon. Participants are asked a number of questions about trust in people with varying levels of social distance: fellow group members, fellow villagers, people from neighbouring villages and people in general. The results indicate that the level of trust diminishes as social distance (the radius of trust) increases. There is more trust in fellow group members than there is in other villagers, and more trust in fellow villagers than there is in those outside the village. I also analyse the correlation between the respondents' characteristics and trust. A substantial part of the variation in levels of trust can be explained by observable individual characteristics. The main correlates of trust are education, whether the respondent is divorced and the number of years lived in the village. Divorced persons are significantly less trusting, while increases in the number of years lived in the village are associated with increases in the levels of trust. People who have completed primary education are significantly more trusting. In only one case (trust in fellow villagers) is age significantly correlated with trust, and its effect is negative. Income is significantly positively correlated with trust in fellow villagers and trust in people from neighbouring villages as well, but uncorrelated with trust in people in general. Respondents' personal characteristics are insignificantly correlated with trust as social distance increases.","Univ Otago, Dept Econ, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand",University of Otago,"Etang, A (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dept Econ, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.",alvin.etang@otago.ac.nz,,,,,,,39,3,4,3,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

We require agents' preferences to be weakly separable between the lifetime paths of consumption and labor. However, we allow for intertemporal nonseparabilities in preferences like habit formation. In this environment, we derive a generalized version of the Inverse Euler Equation and use it to show that intertemporal wedges characterizing optimal allocations of consumption can be strictly negative. We also show that preference nonseparabilities imply that optimal differentiable asset income taxes are necessarily retrospective in nature. We show that under weak conditions, it is possible to implement a socially optimal allocation using a social security system in which taxes on wealth are linear, and taxes/transfers are history-dependent only at retirement. The average asset income tax in this system is zero. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Inefficient financial system, and poor corporate governance, may be bypassed by two-way capital flows in which domestic savings leave the country in the form of financial capital outflows but domestic investment takes place via inward FDI. While financial globalization always improves the welfare of a developed country with a good financial system, its effect is ambiguous for a developing country with an inefficient financial sector or poor corporate governance.

Agricultural crops obtain phosphorus from the pool in the soil that can be replenished by recycling of organic material, or by application of inorganic fertilizer, originating from mines, largely concentrated in three countries only: Morocco/Western Sahara, China and USA. A complicating factor is that the phosphorus rock contains other substances as well, including the heavy metals cadmium and uranium. These substances currently end up in fertilizer and in phosphogypsum where they may pose threats to human and animal health. Hence scarcity and environmental considerations call for action to close the phosphorus cycle. The paper compares two options for intervention: mandatory recycling versus a ban on imports of contaminated phosphorus, and argues in favor of the second.","Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Ctr World Food Studies SOW VU, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Keyzer, M (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Ctr World Food Studies SOW VU, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",M.A.Keyzer@sow.vu.nl,,,,,,,29,24,24,2,50,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,NOV,2010,158.0,4,,,,,411,425,,10.1007/s10645-010-9150-5,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,667CV,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000283171100005,0

A particular attention is drawn on the relative importance of education parity to mitigate the most pressing wage inequality, together with the role of labour market segmentation. Decompositions of the gender wage gap are performed for different points in the wage distribution, different age cohorts and different types of wage employment. Our results indicate that while differences in education contribute to a non-negligible share of the gender wage gap, about half of the education wage gap can be explained by selection across job characteristics. The sources of the wage gap tend also to vary quite substantially across age groups, types of employment and wage levels. Finally, our results suggest that some form of discriminatory practices may contribute to the wage gap both directly through the unexplained component and indirectly through job selection.","[Kolev, Alexandre; Robles, Pablo Suarez] Univ Paris Est Creteil Val Marne, ERUDITE, Fac Econ Sci & Management, F-94010 Creteil, France; [Kolev, Alexandre; Robles, Pablo Suarez] Int Labour Org ITC ILO, Int Training Ctr, I-10127 Turin, Italy",Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC),"Robles, PS (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Est Creteil Val Marne, ERUDITE, Fac Econ Sci & Management, 61 Ave Gen Gaulle, F-94010 Creteil, France.",p.suarez-robles@itcilo.org,,,,,,,38,5,6,1,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

This paper asks whether vertical integration relaxes those financial constraints. It shows that vertical integration trades off the benefits of joint liability against the costs of rendering the supply chain more opaque to external investors. In contrast to the commonly held view that pervasive input and capital market imperfections are conducive to vertical integration, the model predicts that the motives for vertical integration are not necessarily higher in developing countries. In particular, vertical integration is more likely to arise at intermediate levels of investor protection and better contract enforcement with suppliers reduces vertical integration only if financial markets are sufficiently developed. Evidence supporting both predictions is discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Reduced form price equation estimates indicate that the cross elasticity of E85's price with respect to the price of gasoline does not differ significantly from unity, so that any rise in gasoline prices will be matched (in percentage terms) by a corresponding rise in the price of E85.

Moreover, such a switch would increase bidder expected surplus by at most 0.02 percent.","[Hortacsu, Ali] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [McAdams, David] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",University of Chicago; Duke University,"Hortaçsu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,,,,,,,44,75,92,1,14,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-3808,,,J POLIT ECON,J.

We find that futures prices tend to be higher than spot prices. The average convenience yield is therefore negative, but varies by season and depends on the storage levels in hydro reservoirs. The average realized return on holding a long position in the futures market is also negative. The negative convenience yield and risk premium contrast empirical findings in most other commodity markets. We argue that differences between the supply and demand sides in terms of risk preferences and the ability to take advantage of short-term price variations can contribute to explain the observed relationship between spot-and futures prices. In addition, our analysis shows that the relationship between spot and futures prices is clearly linked to the physical state of the system, such as hydro inflow, reservoir levels, and demand.

To this end this paper develops a continuous space representation of a simulated population. It presents a statistical matching approach for assigning simulated households from a spatial microsimulation model to unique spatially-referenced residential locations. The allocation is based on a random assignment after splitting the simulated households into two groups: those predicted to reside in apartments and those predicted to reside in houses.

The spot price is assumed to follow an exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process with an added compound Poisson process. In this way, the model allows for mean-reversion and possible jumps. All parameters are modulated by a hidden Markov chain in discrete time. They are able to switch between different economic regimes representing the interaction of various factors. Through the application of reference probability technique, adaptive filters are derived, which in turn, provide optimal estimates for the state of the Markov chain and related quantities of the observation process. The EM algorithm is applied to find optimal estimates of the model parameters in terms of the recursive filters. We implement this self-calibrating model on a deseasonalised series of daily spot electricity prices from the Nordic exchange Nord Pool. On the basis of one-step ahead forecasts, we found that the model is able to capture the empirical characteristics of Nord Pool spot prices. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A sequence of land redistributions enables the beneficiaries to educate their children and thus to escape from poverty. A successful land reform allows the transition of a society from an agriculture-based state of poverty to a human capital-based developed economy. We find that a temporary state of inequality among the poor is unavoidable. Finally, we discuss the political economy of land reform, whether access to land markets should be allowed for beneficiaries of land reforms, and property rights issues.","[Siemers, Lars-H.

The general consensus is that with less debt burden poor countries suffering from debt overhang will be able devote more resources towards investment thereby promoting their own growth and thus benefit their creditors in the long run. An open question is which mechanism is best to relieve debt burden. In this paper, we adopt experimental methods to study the effectiveness and efficiency of debt forgiveness and debt buyback. We find that creditors tend to reduce more debt under Forgiveness than Buyback. Debtors under Forgiveness are not significantly more reciprocal than under Buyback. After controlling for the amount of debt relief, creditors are significantly worse off under Forgiveness whereas debtors are indifferent between the two schemes. From the viewpoint of promoting debt relief, debt forgiveness appears to be a more effective tool to achieve this goal. Nevertheless, if one is to maximize the overall efficiency, debt buyback is superior to debt forgiveness in making best of each relief dollar.","[Lei, Vivian; Vesely, Filip] Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA; [Lei, Vivian] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Tucker, Steven] Univ Canterbury, Dept Econ, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Vesely, Filip] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; City University of Hong Kong; University of Canterbury; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Lei, V (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA.",vlei@uwm.edu,"Tucker, Steven J/P-6426-2017; Tucker, Steven/B-1051-2009","Tucker, Steven/0000-0002-5273-8096",,,,,18,1,1,0,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

We combine these observations and test experimentally whether digital options - a type of derivative that has recently been introduced to a wider audience via online prediction markets - can reduce price bubbles in a laboratory setting.

We classify countries in terms of their degree of rigidity in the labor market, and use a matching model with labor/leisure choice, bargaining frictions, and labor income taxation to capture these rigidity differences. Added flexibility improves economic performance in different ways depending on whether income taxation is high or low. Feeding income taxation rates estimated from the countries at hand, we find that the model is able to replicate the observed rigidity levels. The model is also shown to reproduce well cross-country differences in non-employment population ratios and the share of part-time jobs. In the absence of rigidity differences, taxation shows little promise to replicate cross-country differences, as it has insufficient quantitative effects on production and productivity. However, the interaction of rigidity and income taxation is crucial in explaining the empirical patterns of the non-employment rate and of the share of part-time jobs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We review, then, several empirical papers dealing with cost-sharing effects with respect to three main issues: moral hazard-contrast, redistributive effects and health care cost-containment. The findings of empirical literature indicate that the use of cost-sharing in health care gives rise to the classical political economy trade-off between equity and efficiency However, while distributive effects are demonstrated, gains in terms of efficiency and cost containment are not clearly verified by empirical literature; thus, cost sharing policies seem to be desirable only when combined with mechanisms that promote access to the most vulnerable categories.",,,,,"Carrieri, Vincenzo/AAS-9319-2021","Carrieri, Vincenzo/0000-0001-8742-3820",,,,,84,4,4,0,13,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

We run a laboratory experiment where, in sequence, networks are generated endogenously within an anonymous group and subjects play a trust game. The experimental design includes two main treatments and a baseline: in the baseline subjects play a trust game with no networks being formed, in treatment NT the network building phase precedes the trust game, and in treatment TN the network game is played at the end. This allows us to identify the two main factors through which networks impact on trust and trustworthiness: information accrued to subjects through social interaction (when this occurs first) and reputation (when it follows). We find that in NT, the overall level of trust is lower but offers are directed to more trustworthy recipients. A common past history matters in determining whom to trust (information value of networks). In TN, continuation play enforces higher levels of trust and trustworthiness (reputation and enforced reciprocity).

We estimate the distribution of guesses conditional on whether they were made by individual bettors or betting pools. We document two major distinctions between the two sets of guesses: (1) the distribution of guesses made by groups of bettors appears to conform more to the distribution of historical break-up dates than the distribution of guesses made by individual bettors, and (2) the distribution for groups has less mass in its tails and displays lower variability than the distribution for individuals. We argue that these two pieces of evidence are consistent with the hypothesis that group decisions are more moderate, either because groups have to reach a compromise when their members disagree or because individuals with extreme opinions are less likely to be part of a group.","[Adams, Renee] Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Ferreira, Daniel] London Sch Econ, CEPR, London, England",University of Queensland; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Adams, R (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",,"Adams, Renee/HJA-6535-2022; Adams, Renee/B-1197-2011","Adams, Renee/0000-0002-3144-2552;",,,,,41,35,39,2,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

In search and matching models, aggregate productivity shocks generate such fluctuations: via inputs in the matching technology, they affect the rate at which workers and firms come into contact. Quantitatively, this mechanism has been found to be negligible in a calibrated textbook model, but also more than sufficient if wages are completely rigid. We study a weaker concept of rigidity based on worker rents (wages in excess of the value of unemployment). We show that volatility is subject to an upper bound if worker rents are weakly procyclical, thus at best rigid. Quantitatively, with Rent Rigidity, the mechanism accounts for at most 20% of the variance of the job-finding rate. In light of this result we reexamine the question whether asymmetric information on gains from trade amplifies fluctuations. We analyze a series of bargaining solutions, and conclude that asymmetric information at best makes rents rigid. Our analysis provides a unifying perspective on a very lively debate.

In the first part of the paper, we argue that tax competition for profits is likely to be imperfect in the sense that the jurisdiction with the lowest tax rate does not necessarily attract all shifted profits. Under this assumption, tax competition between a large number of identical countries may lead to either a symmetric equilibrium with no profit shifting or an asymmetric equilibrium where firms shift profits from high-tax to low-tax countries. In the second part of the paper, we introduce tax havens. Starting from a symmetric equilibrium, tax havens unambiguously reduce the tax revenue of countries due to a 'leakage effect' tax havens attract tax base from countries and a 'competition effect' the optimal response to the increased tax sensitivity of tax bases involves a reduction of tax rates. Starting from an asymmetric equilibrium, however, tax havens also raise the tax revenue of countries through a 'crowding effect' tax havens make it less attractive to compete for profits and thus induce low-tax countries to become high-tax countries. We demonstrate that the latter effect may dominate the former effects so that countries, on balance, benefit from the presence of tax havens. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It argues, instead, that the introduction of the relatively weak assumption of (minimal) individual liberty is required for recognition, and that while recognition is necessary, it is insufficient for redistribution. It also considers the sustainability of voluntary redistribution in a liberal society, and voluntary recognition in an authoritarian society. Finally, the approach is applied to the problems of discrimination, genocide, and ethnic conflict. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, the speed of reforms have been remarkably different across countries. We empirically investigate this cross-sectional and temporal variation in entry liberalization of OECD countries during the 1990s. A unique data set obtained by merging different sources on political, government and regulatory institutions - as well as private interests and ideologies - allows us to explore in detail several dimensions of the political economy of liberalization. Our findings indicate majoritarian electoral systems as important drivers for change, while independent industry regulators slow down such reforms. Furthermore, powerful industry incumbents hold up the liberalization process and governing bodies that favor a small welfare state accelerate it. The focus on separate elements of countries' institutions aims to shed light on the underlying structure of decision-making processes, providing a base for more structural political economy studies on regulatory change.

As far back as 1991, Pissarides had argued that the influence of capital stock on the performance of the labour market is crucial but not well understood, a research area which is particularly relevant for Australia. This article attempts to fill this void by estimating a multi-equation labour market model comprising labour demand, wage setting and labour supply equations. The model is used to examine the causes of the unemployment upturn in 1973-1983 and the subsequent decline in 1993-2006. Our results show that (i) the main determinants of the unemployment rise in the 1970s and early 1980s were wage-push factors, the two oil price shocks and the increase in interest rates, and (ii) the acceleration in capital accumulation was the crucial driving force of unemployment in the 1990s and 2000s. Furthermore, although the recent boom in the terms of trade is equally important, its downward effect on unemployment was partially reversed by the resulting decrease in net foreign demand.","[Sala, Hector] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ Aplicada, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Karanassou, Marika] Univ London, Dept Econ, London, England; [Karanassou, Marika; Sala, Hector] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany",Autonomous University of Barcelona; University of London; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Sala, H (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ Aplicada, Edifici B Campus UAB, Bellaterra 08193, Spain.",hector.sala@uab.es,"Sala, Hector/K-6370-2017","Sala, Hector/0000-0002-3043-2790",,,,,66,7,7,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

First, we demonstrate that the incentive for cost-reducing investment is relatively higher than the incentive to increase product differentiation. Second, depending on initial conditions: (i) firms activate both types of investment from the very outset to the steady state; (ii) firms initially invest in only one R&D activity and then reach the steady state either carrying out only this activity or carrying out both; or (iii) firms do not invest at all in either type of innovation.

This paper measures pro-poor growth across countries. We show how the concept of pro-poor growth in income per capita can be applied easily to a set of economies in the course of growth. This approach enables us to highlight the link to income convergence studies. The empirical investigations consider the experience of five Balkan countries during the period 1989-2005. The results show that many episodes of growth are not pro-poor because poverty and inequality worsen between Balkan countries. Although economic reforms seem to have a positive effect on well-being in Balkan countries, the overall effect on growth has been small for most countries.","[El Ouardighi, Jalal] Univ Strasbourg, BETA, Strasbourg, France; [Somun-Kapetanovic, Rabija] Fac Econ, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"El Ouardighi, J (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, BETA, Strasbourg, France.",,,,,,,,26,3,3,0,11,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0012-8775,,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

Such rankings do not effectively measure research quality, which should be the essence of any evaluation. These quantity rankings are not objective; two citation rankings, based on different samples, produce entirely different results. For that reason, an alternative ranking is developed as a quality indicator, based on membership on academic editorial boards of professional journals. It turns out that the ranking of individual scholars based on that measure is far from objective. Furthermore, the results differ markedly, depending on whether research quantity or quality is considered. Thus, career decisions based on rankings are dominated by chance and do not reflect research quality. We suggest that evaluations should rely on multiple criteria. Public management should return to approved methods such as engaging independent experts who in turn provide measurements of research quality for their research communities.","[Rost, Katja] Univ Zurich, Inst Org & Adm Sci, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Frey, Bruno S.] Univ Zurich, Inst Empir Res Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich; University of Zurich,"Rost, K (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Inst Org & Adm Sci, Univ Str 84, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",,"Frey, Bruno/AAW-9103-2021; Rost, Katja/N-3420-2013","Rost, Katja/0000-0002-7752-7818",,,,,85,82,90,2,54,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

This implies an intergenerational chain transmitting the attitude towards the formation of human capital from one generation to the next. We incorporate this intergenerational chain into an OLG-model with endogenous human capital formation. In absence of any state intervention such an economy might be characterized by multiple steady states with low or high human capital levels. There are also steady states where the population is permanently divided into different groups with differing human capital and welfare levels. Compulsory schooling is needed to overcome steady states with low human capital and welfare levels. Tax financed education subsidies can lead to further pareto-improvements. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Consistent with previous research, this study finds that broadband adopters increase their overall Internet usage. However, broadband adoption is associated with an increase in relatively few specific applications, like downloading music and online purchasing. Among socially desirable activities that governments seek to increase by encouraging broadband adoption, only researching health information rises among broadband adopters. Usage of job and career websites and usage of government sites does not rise as people move from dial-up to broadband. Among offline activities, broadband adoption lowers time spent playing video games but has no statistically significant effect on other activities like reading magazines and watching TV. OLS with person-level fixed effects and the difference-in-differences matching estimator yield similar findings. The results are somewhat sensitive to the time period studied, which could indicate that adopters at different stages of the technology's diffusion respond differently to broadband adoption; it could also reflect the rapid changes in online activities and broadband technology.

It became clear, though, that bioenergy cannot be evaluated independently of the rest of the economy and that national and international feedback effects are important. Computable general equilibrium (CGE) models have been widely employed in order to study the effects of international climate policies. The main characteristic of these models is their encompassing scope: Global models cover the whole world economy disaggregated into regions and countries as well as diverse sectors of economic activity. Such a modelling framework unveils direct and indirect feedback effects of certain policies or shocks across sectors and countries. CGE models are thus well suited for the study of bioenergy/biofuel policies. One can currently find various approaches in the literature of incorporating bioenergy into a CGE framework. This paper gives an overview of existing approaches, critically assesses their respective power and discusses the advantages of CGE models compared to partial equilibrium models. Grouping different approaches into categories and highlighting their advantages and disadvantages is important for giving a structure to this rather recent and rapidly growing research area and to provide a guidepost for future work.

Building on alternating move games and models of rational inattention, the players' actions may be rigid. i.e., infrequent. This rigidity in the timing of moves makes the game more dynamic and asynchronous, acting as a commitment mechanism. Therefore, it can enhance cooperation and often eliminate inefficient equilibrium outcomes present in the static (normal form) game. Interestingly, (i) this can happen even in a finite game (possibly as short as two periods) and (ii) without reputation building. Furthermore, (iii) the required degree of commitment may be under some circumstances arbitrarily low and under others infinitely high. Our main example comes from macroeconomics in which various rigidities have played a central role. Investigating the Kydland-Prescott-Barro-Gordon monetary policy game, we derive the necessary and sufficient degree of long-term policy commitment to low inflation under which the influential time-inconsistency problem is eliminated.

A stochastic frontier production method is applied to a panel dataset from 2000 to 2007. The simultaneous study of these three measures makes it possible to study individual effects more precisely than otherwise. The study shows that the three reform initiatives are all able to improve technical efficiency in state-owned coal mines. The finding of a significant efficiency improvement from relinquishing state ownership provides an alternative to privatization.

Employment in multinationals could be more volatile than employment in domestic firms if multinationals were facing more volatile demand or if they react more to aggregate developments.

When households display levels of disappointment aversion consistent with the experimental evidence. a version of the model parameterized to match the volatility of output and consumption growth generates unconditional expected asset returns and price of risk in line with the historical data. For the model with Epstein-Zin preferences to generate similar statistics, the relative risk aversion coefficient needs to be about 55, two orders of magnitude higher than the available estimates.

To address this question we combine data on the head office locations of publicly traded U.S. firms with information on the receipts of local charitable organizations. Cities like Houston, San Jose, and San Francisco gained significant numbers of corporate headquarters over the past two decades, while cities like Chicago and Los Angeles lost. Our analysis suggests that attracting or retaining the headquarters of a publicly traded firm yields approximately $3-10 million per year in contributions to local non-profits. Likewise, each $1000 increase in the market value of the firms headquartered in a city yields $0.60-1.60 to local non-profits. Most of the increase in charitable contributions is attributable to an effect on the number of highly-compensated individuals in a city, rather than through direct donations by the corporations themselves. The increased private sector donations from the presence of corporate headquarters do not seem to crowd out government grants to local charities. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Is this debt simply backed by future taxation with no inflationary consequences? Or will the circulation of region debt induce monetization by a central bank? We argue here that both outcomes can arise in equilibrium. In the model economy, there are multiple equilibria which reflect the perceptions of agents regarding the manner in which the debt obligations will be met. In one equilibrium, termed Ricardian, the future obligations are met with taxation by a regional government while in the other, termed Monetization, the central bank is induced to print money to finance the region's obligations. The multiplicity of equilibria reflects a commitment problem of the central bank. A key indicator of the selected equilibrium is the distribution of regional debt holdings. We show that regional governments, anticipating central bank financing of their debt obligations, have an incentive to create excessively large deficits. We use the model to assess the impact of some policy measures within a monetary union as well as dollarization. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The human capital of an individual depends on both his (subjectively) random ability and his investment in education. Individual investment in education is financed through a loan contract with income-contingent terms of repayment. Investment decisions are based on public signals (test outcomes) which screen all agents for their abilities. We find that better information, which allows more efficient screening, enhances aggregate human capital formation but may, at the same time, stifle aggregate investment in education.

Our model may explain why the poor make some choices that do not appear to help them escape poverty.

The short-run analysis shows that, when offshoring is sufficiently high, further increases in offshoring benefit the poor country and hurt the rich country. But these effects may be reversed in the long run as countries adjust their research efforts in response to increased offshoring. In particular, in the long run, the rich country always gains from increased offshoring, whereas poor countries see their static gains partially eroded by a decline in their research efforts.","[Rodriguez-Clare, Andres] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16803 USA; [Rodriguez-Clare, Andres] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Rodríguez-Clare, A (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, 608 Kern Grad Bldg, University Pk, PA 16803 USA.",andres@psu.edu,,,,,,,52,46,58,0,20,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7707,1945-7715,,AM ECON J-MACROECON,Am.

The empirical decomposition is based on a proportional hazards model. The approach based on rank invariant estimators is borrowed from the literature on failure time data and has been adapted by Donald et al. (Rev Econ Stud 67:609-633, 2000) to analyse differences in wage distributions. Extending this approach and using natural splines to allow for nonlinear regression effects we isolate three different underlying forces for wage differentials: differences in characteristics, differences in weights of characteristics and differences in the returns-to-skill functions. The analysis reveals that country differences in returns-to-skill functions contribute most to observed wage differences while differences in observed characteristics contribute surprisingly little.","[Behr, Andreas] Univ Munster, Inst Econometr, D-48143 Munster, Germany; [Poetter, Ulrich] Univ Bochum, Fac Social Sci, D-44801 Bochum, Germany",University of Munster; Ruhr University Bochum,"Behr, A (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Inst Econometr, Stadtgraben 9, D-48143 Munster, Germany.",andreas.behr@wiwi.uni-muenster.de; ulrich.poetter@ruhr-uni-bochum.de,,,,,,,26,5,6,0,9,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

Our data contain information on (i) the defaulter countries and their creditors and (ii) bilateral foreign direct investment (FDI) flows. With these we can study how FDI flows are affected by sovereign default by distinguishing between those flows coming from defaulters' creditor countries and others. According to our estimations, this distinction is crucial since the decline of FDI in flows after default is markedly concentrated on those flows originating in defaulters' creditor countries. The decay in FDI flows is higher in the years closer to the default date and for countries that have defaulted more times. We do not find evidence that countries shut their doors to defaulters' investment abroad, which is also a cost of default suggested in the literature. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The breaks generated by these shocks can be taken to reflect stochastic changes in agents' decisions or beliefs triggered by extraordinary economic events. Our model specifies that both the timing and size of breaks are stochastic. The last property of it enables us to investigate qualitative effects that large shocks can have on economic relationships. As an empirical application of our model, the paper investigates the stability the oil-economy relationship since the early sixties. From the six large oil-shocks identified by our data, the paper shows that only the first oil shock at the end of 1973 has caused a major long term adverse effect on economic activity. All the large oil price shocks that have happened since then did not have any significant negative effects on the slope of the oil-economy relationship. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Emissions reductions targets established by the protocol will be met by domestic policies and by three international flexible mechanisms: clean development, joint implementation, and emissions trading. Following a value-theoretic and class-based approach, the purpose of this paper is to analyze these flexible mechanisms. In particular, the paper investigates the nature and adoption of flexible mechanisms, and their class and environmental links and implications. Carbon-intensive capitalist firms and developed economies are found to be exerting great influence on the shaping and implementation of flexible mechanisms. Environmental effectiveness and justice, and equal sustainable development raised and claimed by worker-citizens, social movements, local communities, and developing countries have not been secured. Thus flexible mechanisms do not present a real challenge to current institutions and practices for sustainable climate conditions for the workers-citizen of the world.","[Vlachou, Andriana] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens 10434, Greece; [Konstantinidis, Charalampos] Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",Athens University of Economics & Business; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Vlachou, A (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, 76 Patiss St, Athens 10434, Greece.",vlachou@aueb.gr,,,,,,,37,22,22,0,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

Regional and periodic differences in environmental efficiency, environmental quantity and environmental change indexes in China's manufacturing sector are examined for the period between 1998 and 2002. Within the framework of data envelopment analysis and distance functions, environmental quantity and environmental change indexes are measured as variants of the Malmquist quantity index. The overall environmental efficiency of China's manufacturing sector is very low, indicating substantial potential to reduce pollution emissions in China's manufacturing industries.

In particular, in high inflation economies, inflation is negatively related to economic activity. By comparison, inflation may be positively correlated with output in low inflation countries. We present a neoclassical growth model with money in which the incidence of liquidity risk is inversely related to aggregate capital formation. Interestingly, there may be multiple monetary steady-states where the effects of monetary policy vary. In poor economies, the financial system is highly distorted and higher rates of money growth are associated with less capital formation. In contrast, in advanced economies, a Tobin effect is observed. Since inflation exacerbates distortions from a coordination failure in the low-capital steady-state, individuals become much more exposed to liquidity risk. Consequently, optimal monetary policy depends on the level of development. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

By conducting multinomial analysis that incorporates both factors, we found a significant relationship between firm performance and CEO dismissal, while, consistent with most previous studies, a standard logit analysis of CEO turnover revealed no clear relationships.

In the Project Management praxis it is very difficult to estimate a real amount of planned tasks work. Student's Syndrome is the term from Project Management that describes the influence of a human factor on the work effort. Although a task is practically completed, resource's work effort dramatically decreases; then, the task is finished on time but no time slack is obtained. This observation is in concordance with common results of the First Parkinson's Law. The First Parkinson's Law and the Student's Syndrome commonly occur in many tasks in which human labour forces participate as one of the allocated resources. Effective management and the good motivation of human resources can minimize a negative influence of this syndrome and this law. The paper deals with a mathematical model of Student's Syndrome. The model integrates an analytical description of a trend, variability and time influence of the work effort. The model of this syndrome has been derived and verified based on the work efforts analysis. The mathematical model mentioned above helps the project managers to stimulate the human resources and consequently to save project costs. The paper describes changes in Student's Syndrome distribution corresponding with the work effort and resource allocation. The Student's Syndrome model can be used for minimizing the negative impacts of these syndrome and law during the task progression.","[Bartoska, Jan; Subrt, Tomas] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Syst Engn, Fac Econ & Management, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,,bartoska@pef.czu.cz; subrt@pef.czu.cz,"Bartoška, Jan/C-8992-2017; Subrt, Tomas/H-8542-2018","Bartoška, Jan/0000-0003-0935-5978; Subrt, Tomas/0000-0002-4437-1431",,,,,10,0,0,0,4,"UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,CESKE BUDEJOVICE, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZ-370 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-218-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,7,11,,,,,,5,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS47,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287979900002,0

But, why the measurement of urban (at the same time regional or national) competitiveness is so important? The answer to this question is related to the fact, that if the competitiveness cannot be measured, it cannot be improved. As the cities compete directly among other cities on regional, national and global level, the constant improvement of the urban competitiveness will increase the productivity, visibility, popularity, attractiveness, quality of life etc. of the city and at the same time of the region and the country. While the academic understanding of urban competitiveness is still forming, the factors of urban competitiveness are still being identified, the urban competitiveness levels of analysis are still being modelled in the scientific literature, the competitiveness of a city can be measured in different ways: analyzing one or several factors of urban competitiveness, using theoretical models of urban competitiveness, creating composite indices, etc. As every method has its advantages and disadvantages, scientists seek to find the most reliable, methodologically justified, understandable, convenient to use and objective method, which could be accepted generally and widely used in urban governance. The core factors of urban competitiveness based on sustainable development perspective, the indicator system for measuring urban competitiveness, the stages and the main aspects of the composite index for measurement the urban competitiveness are presented in the article. The theoretical background is empirically tested on the basis of the data of 24 Lithuanian cities from 10 Lithuanian regions during the period of 2007-2009. The results of the measurement of urban competitiveness in Lithuanian regions and advantages and disadvantages of the use of urban competitiveness index are presented in the article. The strategic aspects of the improvement of the competitiveness of Lithuanian cities are also provided in the article. The new created Lithuanian urban competitiveness index, presented in the article, is one of the ambitions to promote the methodological background for urban governance and improvement the competitiveness of Lithuanian cities.","[Bruneckiene, Jurgita; Guzavicius, Andrius] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Cincikaite, Renata] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Bruneckiene, J (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",jurgita.bruneckiene@ktu.lt; andrius.guzavicius@ktu.lt; renata.cincikaite@vgtu.lt,"Činčikaitė, Renata/AAY-4446-2021",,,,,,50,23,25,1,36,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The results suggest that banking efficiency falls during initial reform period when banks adjust to enhanced competition but increases in more advanced stages of reform. While in general foreign and private banks show superior efficiency and factor productivity than do state-owned banks, the relative performance of foreign banks worsens after the consolidation stage of the financial reforms is over. We show the importance of link between bank size, asset quality and bank branches with efficiency indexes and also note that every 10% increase in share of nonperforming to total loans decreases banking efficiency by 6 to 10%.","[Burki, Abid A.] Lahore Univ Management Sci, Dept Econ, Lahore, Pakistan; Quaid I Azam Univ, Dept Adm Sci, Islamabad, Pakistan",Lahore University of Management Sciences; Quaid I Azam University,"Burki, AA (通讯作者)，Lahore Univ Management Sci, Dept Econ, Lahore, Pakistan.",burki@lums.edu.pk,,,,,,,25,37,39,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The second study assessed the influence of price framing and seller's motive framing on the same variables as in the first study.

A comparison of the models of WB and DBM, which are both micro-founded computable general equilibrium models using the same data, reveals that DBM strongly outperforms WB. We argue that the shortening of the time horizon and the quantity adjustment following the dramatic shock explain why our model performs much better.

That is, when foreign producers are given advantages over domestic producers by government subsidies or other interventions that lower their costs, domestic firms may argue that their own governments should either provide comparable assistance or should protect them from competing with the foreign firms on grounds of fairness. Economic analysis easily shows that granting these requests is usually harmful for the domestic economy as a whole, but that may not prevent such policies from being implemented. Therefore this paper examines what the further effects of such policies may be. The main conclusion that emerges is that policies to level the playing field most often overcompensate those who request them, making them better off than if the playing field had not been tilted against them in the first place.","Univ Michigan, Ford Sch Publ Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Deardorff, AV (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ford Sch Publ Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",alandear@umich.edu,,"Deardorff, Alan V/0000-0002-4954-7520",,,,,8,0,0,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Capital should flow to where its return is highest, which ought to be where capital is scarce. Yet recent data suggest the opposite-net capital flows from developing countries to industrialized countries. This paper examines the role of financial market development in the accumulation of international reserves. In countries with underdeveloped capital markets, the government's accumulation of reserves may substitute for what would otherwise be private-sector capital outflows. Effectively, these governments are acting as financial intermediaries, channeling domestic savings away from local uses and into international capital markets, thereby offsetting the effects of domestic financial constraints that lead to excessive private-sector exposure to potential capital shortfalls.","[Dominguez, Kathryn M.

Sustainability of surroundings depends on a safe transportation, especially on the safe transportation of dangerous goods by different auto transport kinds. The aims of our research concern an approach for development of the architecture of decision support system with integrated embedded components for monitoring and evaluation of transportation processes of dangerous goods. Mobile technology provides a potentially convenient and truly ubiquitous platform for detection of the objects and the contextual information such as the location, region awareness, etc. A location-based reminder application runs on wireless equipments. Reminders can be more helpful when rich contextual information is used to present necessary information at appropriate time moments in appropriate places. Devices sense and interact with their physical environment through sensors. In general terms, any aspect of the device that enables it to sense and interact with its physical environment may be considered as a sensor. The combination of web service protocols (e. g. SOAP) with session initialization protocol (SIP) enables P2P accessibility by introducing sensor's listener and context retriever as programming components in the developing communication architecture of servers and users. We are using an appropriate interface structure (components, scenarios) for service control, and integrate data-mining, knowledge-based techniques for recognizing a concrete situation of the moving object. The integration of distributed information systems and the means of wireless communication systems (i.e., programming components, protocols, sensors, and devices) are needed. The paper describes an approach of designing the architecture of the system that uses wireless technologies for monitoring dynamic objects with implementation of probabilistic methods for evaluation of risk of possible types of scenarios of accident events which can occur in transportation of dangerous goods. Some wireless protocols are used in establishing the object's geographical coordinates, monitoring and fixing the state behavior of the moving dangerous transportation objects.","[Dzemydiene, Dale] Mykolas Romeris Univ, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Dzindzalieta, Ramunas] Inst Math & Informat, LT-08412 Vilnius, Lithuania",Mykolas Romeris University; Vilnius University,"Dzemydiene, D (通讯作者)，Mykolas Romeris Univ, Ate G 20, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania.",daledz@mruni.eu; ramunas.dzindzalieta@teo.lt,,,,,,,39,9,9,0,22,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-8619,,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Only the integration of intermediate goods markets unambiguously leads to a reduction of asymmetries while the integration of finals goods markets and the integration of financial markets increase the dispersion of inflation rates and business cycles. The result builds on the intensive use of financial markets, i.e. the current account, to adjust externally and smooth the consequences of asymmetric shocks. This mechanism implies a disconnection of country-level outputs and/or inflation rates to ensure that agents return to their initial asset position in the long run.","[Eyquem, Aurelien] Univ Lyon, CNRS, GATE, UMR 5824, F-69342 Lyon, France; [Eyquem, Aurelien] Ecole Normale Super Lyon, F-69342 Lyon, France; [Poutineau, Jean-Christophe] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, CREM, UMR 6211, F-35065 Rennes, France; [Poutineau, Jean-Christophe] Ecole Normale Super, F-35065 Rennes, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Rennes; Universite de Rennes; Ecole Normale Superieure de Rennes (ENS Rennes),"Eyquem, A (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon, CNRS, GATE, UMR 5824, 15 Parvis Rene Descartes,BP 7000, F-69342 Lyon, France.",aurelien.eyquem@ens-lyon.fr; jean-christophe.poutineau@univ-rennes1.fr,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,5,DE BOECK UNIV,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

The optimum solution gives a number of vehicles going on arcs of the communication network and the amount of goods being transported on the arcs. Consequently, cyclical routes and depots are proposed for all vehicles. First, the multi-graph, in which each directed arc corresponds to exactly one vehicle, is generated. The multi-graph satisfies the condition that the number of arcs entering each node equals the number of arcs outgoing the node. Heuristic method to load goods on a vehicle in the pickup node and to transport it to the delivery node without reloading on another vehicle is proposed.

These facts should call for a larger concern with financial imbalances by the central bank. Adapting the model by Caplin and Leahy (1996)-where a central bank, which is uncertain about the state of the economy and its reaction to policy, seeks an optimal search strategy to influence private agents' responses-by substituting the central bank's price stability objective with a financial stability one, we find that the monetary authority should follow a less aggressive policy than the one suggested by the original model. However, initial conditions play a crucial role in determining the degree of gradualism by the policy maker with the policy becoming more and more aggressive as the initial interest rate shrinks.

Therefore, a clear understanding of what the factors influencing the evolution of female participation rates are in Europe is essential for a successful design of policy measures aiming at increasing participation rates. This article provides empirical evidence on the role that institutions have played in determining participation rates of women in the European labour markets. Our findings discard any doubt on the influence of institutions on women's participation in Europe. The strictness of labour market institutions negatively affects female participation rates. We also find that institutional features aimed at reconciling motherhood with professional life such as maternity leave schemes and part-time work favour participation rates of prime-age women. Additionally, fertility rates and education enrolment have been relevant for the evolution of participation rates during the sample period considered for prime-age and young females, respectively, while cohort effects drive the developments of older females.","[Genre, Veronique; Salvador, Ramon Gomez; Lamo, Ana] European Cent Bank, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Lamo, A (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Kaisserstr 29, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany.",ana.lamo@ecb.int,,,,,,,38,19,22,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this paper, we develop a two-sector dynamic general equilibrium framework to quantify these opportunity cost effects. We find that the efficiency and welfare gains of reallocating government resources from non-productive public sector pensions to productive public education and infrastructure investments are larger than the welfare effects created by classic public pension reforms that simply reduce savings and tax distortions by making pensions less generous. Calculating transitions to the post-reform steady state, we find that welfare losses for the generation born before the reform are offset by welfare gains by the generations born after the reform.","[Glomm, Gerhard] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Jung, Juergen] Towson Univ, Towson, MD 21252 USA; [Tran, Chung] Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University System of Maryland; Towson University; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Glomm, G (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",gglomm@indiana.edu; jjung@towson.edu; changmin0211.lee@samsung.com; chung.tran@unsw.edu.au,,"Jung, Juergen/0000-0003-3791-6293; Tran, Chung/0000-0001-8252-469X",,,,,35,2,2,0,7,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

In the main part of the paper we will work with the sample of almost three hundreds of commercial US banks which will be separate into the groups of defaulted and non-defaulted banks on the basis of historical information. Subsequently, we will stepwise apply the mentioned above scoring models on this sample to derive several models for estimation of PD. Further we will discuss the drawbacks and advantages of the particular models and compare reached results.","[Gurny, Petr] VSB TUO, Dept Finance, Sokolska 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic; [Gurny, Martin] VSB TUO, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava; Technical University of Ostrava,"Gurny, P (通讯作者)，VSB TUO, Dept Finance, Sokolska 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",petr.gurny@vsb.cz; martingurny@seznam.cz,"Gurny, Petr/I-3746-2018","Gurny, Petr/0000-0003-3863-1142",GACR (Czech Science Foundation Grantova Agentura Ceske Republiky) [402/08/1237]; SGS [SP2010102],GACR (Czech Science Foundation Grantova Agentura Ceske Republiky); SGS,The paper is based on research activities sponsored through GACR (Czech Science Foundation Grantova Agentura Ceske Republiky) project No. 402/08/1237 and SGS research project No. SP2010102.

Specifically, we investigate the robustness of the relationship between aid and physical capital investment in Less Developed countries (LDCs) using two different measures of aid and five measures of the policy environment. We find that external aid has a positive and significant impact on physical capital investment given the support of the sample data we use. This effect is robust to the measurement of aid as well as the policy environment. However, the character of the positive relationship between aid and investment varies with the combination of the aid measure and the policy environment. We find that conditional on inflows, the better the policy environment, the higher the investment rate, all things being equal. The results have implications for aid research and aid policy.","[Gyimah-Brempong, Kwabena] Univ S Florida, Dept Econ, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Racine, Jeffrey S.] McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada",State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; McMaster University,"Gyimah-Brempong, K (通讯作者)，Univ S Florida, Dept Econ, 4202 E Fowler Ave, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",kgyimah@coba.usf.edu,"Racine, Jeffrey/N-9476-2014","Racine, Jeffrey/0000-0002-5680-3705",,,,,48,7,7,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Using a large dataset containing every home sale in the state of Massachusetts over 8 years, this paper simultaneously measures the impact of the mix of land-uses in the immediate neighborhood of a home on property values and the impact of a locally-implemented program, the Community Preservation Act (CPA), which provides funds for local open-space and historic preservation as well as affordable housing. I exploit the panel nature of the dataset to conduct a difference-in-differences analysis using local as well as house level fixed effects to overcome omitted variables bias. My results indicate that, on average, passage of the CPA reduces property values by about 1.5% in Massachusetts towns. However, when Tallow the CPA effect to differ by county, I find some heterogeneity - it increases property values in some communities and reduces them in others. Variation in local spending priorities appears to have little impact on property values or the effect of the CPA. Finally, I find that cropland and pasture, as well as low-density residential development, are the most preferred local land-uses, and that homes are more expensive as one increases distance to highways and active rail lines.","Clarkson Univ, Potsdam, NY 13676 USA",Clarkson University,"Heintzelman, MD (通讯作者)，Clarkson Univ, Potsdam, NY 13676 USA.",mheintze@clarkson.edu,"Heintzelman, Martin D/T-6548-2017",,,,,,20,5,6,0,15,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

A basic theoretical model predicts that trip duration should increase with temporal closures and decrease with an individual quota system. Therefore, we propose and apply an empirical trip duration model. Estimations are based on data for the pelagic fleet in central-southern Chile. Conforming to the theoretical predictions, the results indicate that temporal closures tend to increase trip duration, whereas individual quotas reduce it. Moreover, the regulatory regimes also affect the magnitude of the impact that other determinants have on trip duration. The results are consistent with increased efficiency in fleet operation under an individual quota system.","[Hernandez, Angie; Dresdner, Jorge] Univ Concepcion, Dept Econ, Concepcion, Chile",Universidad de Concepcion,"Dresdner, J (通讯作者)，Univ Concepcion, Dept Econ, Casilla 160-C, Concepcion, Chile.",jdresdne@udec.cl,,"Dresdner Cid, Jorge/0000-0002-8371-4628",,,,,27,4,4,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The current crisis, however, is fundamentally different in that even the main remittance-sending countries have been adversely affected. The global nature of this crisis raises several questions such as whether the remittances slowdown will also last for a short time or developing Asia should prepare for a long period of remittance stagnation. This study examines remittances data of several Asian countries to shed light on such questions. The results suggest that while remittance flows to key recipients in the region have slowed down, there has not been a sharp drop. Furthermore, there is no indication that the remittance flows will slow down further, suggesting that the flows should be back on a higher growth path in a few years. It is unlikely, however, to see the same growth rates of the past, given that an important share of that growth during the last two decades was due to better recording of remittances and an increased use of wire transfers on the part of migrants. The study also provides policy options to deal with the future outlook of remittances.","[Jha, Shikha; Sugiyarto, Guntur] Asian Dev Bank, Mandaluyong City, Metro Manila, Philippines; [Vargas-Silva, Carlos] Univ Oxford, Int Migrat Inst, Oxford, England",Asian Development Bank; University of Oxford,"Jha, S (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, Mandaluyong City, Metro Manila, Philippines.",,,,,,,,31,11,12,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1226-508X,,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

Inflation came down from almost triple digits to single digits between 2001 and 2005. This particular episode of the Turkish economy sets a genuine case study for investigating the possible changes in the behaviour of inflation expectations upon a regime shift. Accordingly, this study analyses inflation expectations in Turkey, focusing especially on the post-2001 transition phase. We first conduct classical tests of unbiasedness and efficiency using aggregate survey data between August 2001 and October 2007 to get a statistical benchmark for rationality; we find that classical tests reject full rationality hypothesis for all series except next month's Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation expectations. Then, we carry out Time-Varying Parameter (TVP) estimates based on a Kalman filter to see how the coefficients in the classical test equations evolve over time. This framework allows us to see whether there is convergence to rationality in terms of unbiasedness and efficiency. We find that forecast performance has improved through time, as the coefficients on the test equations shows movement towards values implied by unbiasedness and efficiency hypotheses, supporting the learning hypothesis.","[Kara, Hakan; Kucuk-Tuger, Hande] Cent Bank Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey; [Kucuk-Tuger, Hande] London Sch Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England",Prime Ministry Turkey; Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Kara, H (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy, Istiklal Cad 10, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey.",hakan.kara@tcmb.gov.tr,,,,,,,36,4,4,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We quantify whether these policy measures have led to a reduction in hidden unemployment in DI. A side effect of the reforms may be increased pressure on UI. Therefore, we simultaneously estimate reverse substitution, that is, hidden disability in UI. To this end, we employ a sample of firms in the Dutch AVO database from the period 1993 to 2002. Using instrumental variables in a bivariate Tobit specification, we identify the hidden components in both respective schemes. The estimation results indicate that about 3% of all dismissals took place through DI, which implies that about one quarter of the DI enrolments observed in our sample in fact consists of hidden unemployment.

A quasi-perfect equilibrium is known to be sequential, and our algorithm thus resolves a conjecture of McKelvey and McLennan in the positive. A quasi-perfect equilibrium is also known to be normal-form perfect and our algorithm thus provides an alternative to an algorithm by von Stengel, van den Elzen and Talman. For the case of a zero-sum game, we devise variants of the algorithm that rely on linear programming rather than linear complementarity programming and use the simplex algorithm or other algorithms for linear programming rather than Lemke's algorithm.

Therefore, we propose to extend an input-output model with a specific household consumption model, at the core of which is a system of equations explaining the allocation of the households' overall expenditure across different purposes, such as buying food, the consumption of fuel for heating or electricity for cooling, education of children or travelling in terms of total expenditure and relative prices.

The representation of the yield curve is based on the popular latent factor model of Nelson and Siegel (1987), but under a dynamic interpretation due to Diebold and Li (2006). After assuming the data generating process for the latent and macro factors can be represented by a VAR process, the yields-macro model can be regarded as a state-space representation and estimated by a Kalman Filter approach or by using a simplified two-step procedure proposed by Diebold and Li (2006). This article follows the simple two-step method and makes a comparison check with the Kalman Filter estimation, concluding that the basic intuition of the results is not significantly affected by the use of the simplified approach. Estimation results give support to the dynamic interaction between yield curve latent factors and macroeconomic variables. In particular, monetary policy implemented by the Central Bank seems to be influenced by the market players given the significant response of the monetary policy rate to the yield curve factors as shown by impulse-response functions. In addition, the level and slope of the yield curve seems to be responsive to real activity and monetary policy shocks, issues that should be considered by monetary authorities given the dependency of monetary policy effectiveness on the shape of the yield curve.","Univ Diego Portales, Fac Econ & Empresa, Santiago, Chile",University Diego Portales,"Morales, M (通讯作者)，Univ Diego Portales, Fac Econ & Empresa, Manuel Rodriguez 253, Santiago, Chile.",marco.morales@udp.cl,,,,,,,11,7,10,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We aim to provide evidence on tax-motivated transfers from a large dataset of Japanese corporate groups. Using company level data on 33,340 subsidiary time pairs from 1988, 1990, and 1992, we consider testable implications of income shifting in a theoretical model tailored to the Japanese institution of the early 1990s and empirically examine the spread of the profitability distribution, the attrition rate of loss-making subsidiaries, and the propensity to report zero profit. The findings suggest that income shifting was pervasive when Japan had not adopted a formal allowance for group-level tax. The result underscores the importance of accounting for the inter-relatedness of companies, in designing a corporate income tax.","[Onji, Kazuki] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Vera, David] Kent State Univ, Kent, OH USA",Australian National University; University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Kent; Kent State University Salem,"Onji, K (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",kazuki.onji@anu.edu.au; dvera@kent.edu,"Onji, Kazuki/CAF-5594-2022",,,,,,38,2,2,0,11,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

These indicators represent one of the main sources of publicly available intra-annual fiscal information. Nevertheless, they are not formally included in the European multilateral fiscal surveillance process, and have received limited attention from the academic literature analysing fiscal policies and fiscal forecasting in Europe. By focusing on a broad set of indicators (some 50 fiscal revenue and expenditure items for euro area countries) and a mixed-frequency state-space econometric model, we make a case for the use of monthly cash indicators for multilateral fiscal surveillance at the European level. Their formal use in the public discussion would certainly enhance the pre-emptive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, making possible to acknowledge fiscal slippages early enough so that pressure to take corrective measures could be set on governments by EU institutions and the public at large.

We find that energy consumption has a significant impact on macroeconomic activity. In fact, a one ton of oil equivalent permanent reduction in aggregate energy consumption reduces Output by (sic)6340 over the long term. an aggregate impact which hides a wide diversity of effects for different fuel types. More importantly, and since carbon dioxide emissions are linearly related to the amounts of fuel consumed, Our results allow us to estimate the costs of reductions in carbon dioxide emissions from different energy sources. We estimate that marginal abatement costs for carbon dioxide are (sic)45.62 per ton of carbon dioxide per year for coal, (sic)66.52 for oil, (sic)91.07 for gas, (sic)191.13 for electricity and (sic)254.23 for biomass. An important policy implication is that, once the overall economic costs of reducing carbon dioxide emissions are considered, fuel switching is a no-regrets environmental policy capable of reducing carbon dioxide emissions without jeopardizing economic activity and indeed with the potential for generating favorable economic outcomes.

In this context, we analyse the effectiveness of the different urban transport contracts signed by the Spanish Central Government since 1990 in terms of incentives. The main result is that none of these contracts provides the appropriate incentives to public transit operators. Thus, we propose a fixed-quantity contract as an alternative financing mechanism. The fixed-quantity contract is a high-powered incentive contract that allows the regulator to perfectly forecast the amount of public funds to be used in the urban transport system. Moreover, the fixed-quantity contract can be adjusted to attain the equilibrium between incentives and optimal allocation of risk.","[Pilar Socorro, M.; de Rus, Gines] Univ Palmas de Gran Canaria, Dept Appl Econ Anal, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Socorro, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Palmas de Gran Canaria, Dept Appl Econ Anal, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain.",psocorro@daea.ulpgc.es,,"Socorro, M.

Theoretical developments have taken turns with empirical efficiency studies. In this paper we empirically analyse performance differences across university libraries from different countries from a cross-section and a longitudinal perspective. We use the Malmquist index approach to disentangle environmental efficiency from technical efficiency (TE) to highlight performance differences eventually induced by environmental factors beyond the control of library management, as well as to decompose productivity changes over time into changes in TE and changes in technology. In our cross-section analysis we found that North American (NA) libraries are more productive at higher input levels than the European libraries from Germany and Austria at which we looked in this contribution. Moreover, the largest NA libraries are still able to improve performance, as the results of panel data analysis revealed.","[Sommersguter-Reichmann, Margit] Graz Univ, Dept Informat Sci & Informat Syst, A-8010 Graz, Austria; Graz Univ, Dept Finance, A-8010 Graz, Austria",University of Graz; University of Graz,"Sommersguter-Reichmann, M (通讯作者)，Graz Univ, Dept Informat Sci & Informat Syst, Univ Str 15, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",gerhard.reichmann@uni-graz.at; margit.sommersguter@uni-graz.at,,,,,,,48,21,22,2,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Hotels use these practices in order to increase their incomes. However, the economic literature suggests that if YM practices are considered to be unfair, they are likely to influence customers' purchasing intentions negatively, in particular for loyal customers. Our empirical analysis shows that the assumption that the YM induces dissatisfaction in all circumstances is rejected. But when a practice of YM is perceived as unfair, it causes a loss of customers. However, the manner of presenting the YM practices to consumers (positive or negative frame) has a considerable influence on their perception. Lastly, the price changes induced by the YM are not perceived more unfavourably by the loyal customers. From this point of view, there are several managerial levers in the communication of tariff practices and the management of loyalty programs to avoid or reduce the conflicts with customers.","[Sahut, Jean-Michel] Univ Poitiers, CEREGE, Amiens Sch Management, F-80038 Amiens 1, France; [Hikkerova, L'ubica] Univ Mateja Bela Banskej Bystrici, Ekon Fak, Katedra Cestovneho Ruchu & Spolocneho Stravovania, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",Universite de Poitiers; Matej Bel University,"Sahut, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Poitiers, CEREGE, Amiens Sch Management, 18 Pl St Michel, F-80038 Amiens 1, France.",Jean-Michel.Sahut@supco-amiens.fr; lubicahikkerova@yahoo.de,"SAHUT, Jean-Michel/HNT-0171-2023",,,,,,23,1,1,0,15,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

Essentially, we consider a family as a cluster of individuals whose physical activity propensities may be affected by common household attributes (such as household income and household structure) as well as unobserved family-related factors (such as family life-style and health consciousness, and residential location-related factors). The proposed copula-based clustered ordered-response model structure allows the testing of various dependency forms among the physical activity propensities of individuals of the same household (generated due to the unobserved family-related factors), including non-linear and asymmetric dependency forms. The proposed model system is applied to study physical activity participations of individuals, using data drawn from the 2000 San Francisco Bay Area Household Travel Survey (BATS). A number of individual factors, physical environment factors, and social environment factors are considered in the empirical analysis. The results indicate that reduced vehicle ownership and increased bicycle ownership are important positive determinants of weekend physical activity participation levels, though these results should be tempered by the possibility that individuals who are predisposed to physical activity may choose to own fewer motorized vehicles and more bicycles in the first place. Our results also suggest that policy interventions aimed at increasing children's physical activity levels could potentially benefit from targeting entire family units rather than targeting only children. Finally, the results indicate strong and asymmetric dependence among the unobserved physical activity determinants of family members. In particular, the results show that unobserved factors (such as residence location-related constraints and family lifestyle preferences) result in individuals in a family having uniformly low physical activity, but there is less clustering of this kind at the high end of the physical activity propensity spectrum.","[Sener, Ipek N.] Texas A&M Univ Syst, Texas Transportat Inst, Austin, TX 78723 USA; [Eluru, Naveen] McGill Univ, Dept Civil Engn & Appl Mech, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada; [Bhat, Chandra R.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, 1 Univ Stn C1761, Austin, TX 78712 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; McGill University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Bhat, CR (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, 1 Univ Stn C1761, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",i-sener@ttimail.tamu.edu; naveen.eluru@mcgill.ca; bhat@mail.utexas.edu,"Bhat, Chandra/AAC-6965-2019; Eluru, Naveen/B-2965-2012","Bhat, Chandra/0000-0002-0715-8121; Eluru, Naveen/0000-0003-1221-4113",Southwest Region University Transportation Center grant,Southwest Region University Transportation Center grant,This research was partially funded by a Southwest Region University Transportation Center grant.

This model takes into account the ordinal nature of the return intention as the dependent variable while at the same time allowing for possible violation of the parallel lines assumption from the explanatory variables. Perceptions of different aspects of one's home country, particularly the aspect of skill use opportunities, are generally found to have larger impacts on return intention than demographic, education-related, and sociocultural-related factors.

It decomposes into a micro cost that captures the inefficiency in the cross-sectional distribution of total consumption, risky as it is, and a macro cost that captures the additional benefit of eliminating the risk in total consumption, once efficiently redistributed. We consider the risk that a household experiences income mobility and the consequent consumption mobility. U. S. panel data estimates a consumption profile for which we compute the costs. The total cost is 9-18% of total initial consumption for CRRA parameters 1.25-3.5. Of this, 80-90% is the micro cost and only 10-20% is the macro cost. The magnitude of these results, and in particular the relative importance of the micro cost, is in line with previous empirical evidence. Motivated by this evidence we develop the theory of micro cost. Moreover, because the micro cost does not admit a closed form, for general preferences, we lay out an approximation method.","[Tirelli, Mario] Roma Tre Univ, Rome, Italy",Roma Tre University,"Tirelli, M (通讯作者)，Roma Tre Univ, Rome, Italy.",tirelli@uniroma3.it; sergio_turner@brown.edu,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,9,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

The study attempts to find the relationship between a set of variables - attitude, subjective norms, control belief and ethical self-identity belief in formulating the purchase intention. A survey of 100 organic food buyers in the UK was conducted, which was collected through an online survey in the Organic Food Magazine forum. A Multiple linear regression test was conducted using a Stepwise model-building regression method on the data collected to determine the relationship among each of the variables, and derived that positive attitude and consumers' self-identity play a vital role in formulating the purchase intentions towards organic food products. But a major finding is that the influence of family, friends and environmental groups as well as the high price of organic food does not affect the consumers' purchase intention, and it remains quite low among the UK organic food buyers. Therefore, a need exists for a research to consider 'altruistic' motives, which are now pertinent in explaining and predicting consumption of organic products along with the 'egoistic' concerns which may have initially explained organic food purchasing. This study may possibly have implications for advertisers of organic products, as organic consumption is shown to be equally dependant on ethical values and attitudes. These perceived benefits should be given importance when marketing organic food products to consumers.","[Zia, Maria] COMSATS Inst Informat Technol, Dept Management Sci, Lahore, Pakistan; [Akram, Muhammad] Univ Punjab, Hailey Coll Commerce, Lahore, Pakistan; [Ali, Imran] IQRA Univ Islamabad, Islamabad, Pakistan",COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI); University of Punjab; Iqra University,"Zia, M (通讯作者)，MA Jinnah Bldg,Def Rd,Off Raiwind Rd, Lahore, Pakistan.",mariazia23@gmail.com,,,,,,,30,0,0,3,65,NATIONAL ACAD MANAGEMENT,KYIV,"VUL PANASA MYMOGO 26, KYIV, 01011, UKRAINE",1993-6788,,,ACTUAL PROBL ECON,Actual Probl.

Research areas with high potential returns to further analysis are identified. Several examples from my own recent experimental work with Patrick Nolen are also presented.

In particular, we pay special attention to the cross-subsidization which will be eliminated by the structure regulation. It is established that if horizontal externalities between the goods are not too strong, then the monopoly has a socially optimal price structure. In contrast, the oligopoly always distorts the price structure. We also demonstrate that the monopoly will cross-subsidize a product if and only if this product has a relatively low absolute advantage.","[Chang, Ming Chung] Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Ind Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",National Central University,"Chang, MC (通讯作者)，Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Ind Econ, Taipei, Taiwan.",,,,,,,,54,1,1,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

This explains, it is argued, why asset and currency prices are so much more volatile than and often clearly out of line with what we would otherwise consider to be their underlying determinants. What is rarely addressed, however, is how those expectations are formed. This paper fills the void by proposing a specific view of agents' expectations based on the mental model they employ to understand currency movements. The paper derives this schematic by examining market participants' psychological propensities and the world view of the subculture of which they are members.

The plan entails funds being collected to construct barrier-free rental housing. The housing will generate positive rental profits, which will, in turn, lead to the increase in the supply of barrier-free rental housing.

Using two different subjective questions from the Russian data RLMS (Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey), we assume a correspondence between, first, the perception of income that household members report and their true income sharing, and, second, between their answer to a satisfaction question and their utility. We show that answers given by different members of the household bring pertinent information on income sharing and utility in the household. In particular, we find a significant effect of the female-male wage ratio in reported income perception and satisfaction differentials between household members. Our data covers the transition period (1994-2003) characterized by massive economic and social changes in Russia. We investigate the evolution of intra-household welfare distribution by exploiting the episode of the financial crisis of 1998 to distinguish two periods: pre- and post-crisis. Our empirical strategy consists of applying probit-type models allowing the parameters to change in a discrete manner between two periods and accounting for discrete unobserved heterogeneity.","[Kalugina, Ekaterina] Univ Nantes, F-44322 Nantes 3, France; [Kalugina, Ekaterina] CEE, Ctr Employment Studies, F-44322 Nantes 3, France; [Sofer, Catherine] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, CES, F-75013 Paris, France; [Radtchenko, Natalia] Evry Univ, F-91025 Evry, France; [Radtchenko, Natalia] CREST, F-91025 Evry, France",Nantes Universite; Universite Paris Saclay,"Kalugina, E (通讯作者)，Univ Nantes, Chemin Censive du Tertre,BP 52231, F-44322 Nantes 3, France.",Ekaterina.Kalugina@univ-nantes.fr; Catherine.Sofer@univ-paris1.fr; Natalia.Radtchenko@malix.univ-paris1.fr,"Sofer, Catherine/AAI-6938-2021","Kalugina, Ekaterina/0000-0002-7784-8566",,,,,55,12,12,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Openness to the United States has significant effects that accelerate growth of exports and/or imports across many countries. The net effects on the trade and current account balances vary across countries. Overall, the evidence supports concerns about adverse spillover effects of a slowdown in the U.S. economy on neighboring countries, necessitating careful mobilization of countercyclical domestic tools to hedge against potential risk and mitigate the severity of economic downturns.","Int Monetary Fund, Western Hemisphere Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Kandil, M (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Western Hemisphere Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",,,,,,,,35,3,7,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

This paper employs a non-parametric tool, the relative distribution, to describe patterns of changes in the entire Italian household income distribution over the period 2000-2004. This approach also allows for a decomposition of the relative density to isolate changes due to differences in location from changes due to differences in shape, thus enabling deeper analysis of income polarization. During the 2000s there was a significant location effect, and also increased income polarization, which has particularly affected incomes below the median. Analyses by social groups, according to the employment status of the household head, show significant re-distribution effects within groups.","[Pittau, Maria Grazia] Columbia Univ, Dept Stat, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Massari, Riccardo] Univ Roma La Sapienza, DCNAPS, Rome, Italy; [Zelli, Roberto] Univ Roma La Sapienza, DSPSA, Rome, Italy",Columbia University; Sapienza University Rome; Sapienza University Rome,"Pittau, MG (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Stat, New York, NY 10027 USA.",riccardo.massari@uniroma1.it; grazia.pittau@uniroma1.it; roberto.zelli@uniroma1.it,,"Massari, Riccardo/0000-0003-3548-8862; ZELLI, Roberto/0000-0002-1967-3470",,,,,21,29,31,0,10,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

Following recent theories of social justice, earnings determinants are divided into two parts: Circumstances, which are characteristics outside individual control and effort representing factors impacting earnings but under individuals' responsibility. Equality of opportunity requires that inequality of circumstances must be corrected while differences of effort must remain unaltered. Circumstances are represented by parental education and occupation, ethnic origin, place of birth and age. Effort is modeled with schooling choices and labour supply decisions. Using the PSID from 1968 to 2001, we provide two alternative assessments of inequality of opportunity using counterfactual distributions. The statistical framework is semi-parametric and builds on duration models.

However, more recently the cost of natural gas has increased from $3/GJ to $7/GJ following the sudden collapse of the East Spar gas field in the North West Shelf. In this article, we analyse the impact of the gas price increase and demonstrate that despite being the most environmentally efficient conventional technology, natural gas combined cycle plant has been squeezed out of the market which in turn will increase forward electricity price risks to WA consumers through greater exposure to CO(2) pricing in the long run.","[Simshauser, Paul] AGL Energy Ltd, Sydney, NSW 2060, Australia; [Wild, Phillip] Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Simshauser, P (通讯作者)，AGL Energy Ltd, Level 22,101 Miller St, Sydney, NSW 2060, Australia.",psimshauser@agl.com.au,"Simshauser, Paul/H-1244-2015","Simshauser, Paul/0000-0003-1857-550X",,,,,18,11,11,0,7,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC PAPERS,ADELAIDE,"UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS, ADELAIDE, SA 5001, AUSTRALIA",0004-900X,,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

This paper analyses mutual relationships between growth processes in centres and their surrounding hinterlands in 19 Finnish regions. Annual population data from the period 1970-2004 are used. A novel testing procedure based on an extension of the Granger causality definition in a panel data context is applied. Heterogeneity between regions is allowed.

North's works on institutional change, his focus shifted from formal institutions and highly rational actors to the links between culture, cognition, and the evolution of institutions. This has led to a corresponding shift in his basic explanation of institutional change: In his earlier works, institutional change is mainly caused by actions of highly rational utility-maximizing political actors. In his later works, the evolution of a society's institutions is above all a function of changes in the dominant belief system. The paper tries to contribute to the obvious task of bringing these two explanations of institutional change together. My synthetic approach rests basically on a Northian framework supplemented with three further elements: firstly, with the idea of the transfer of institutions; secondly, with the concept of functional differentiation; and, thirdly, and decisively, with an understanding of culture as a toolkit, leaving room for interest, choice, and strategic action.","[Zweynert, Joachim] Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany; [Zweynert, Joachim] Hamburg Inst Int Econ, Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Zweynert, J (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.",zweynert@hwwi.org,,,,,,,73,27,29,0,22,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

The oil price, through the role of oil in production and consumption, affects aggregate demand and supply in the model. The assumption of rational expectations is relaxed in favor of learning. Oil prices, therefore, affect the economy through an additional channel, i.e. through their effect on the formation of agents' beliefs. The estimated learning dynamics indicates that economic agents' perceptions about the effects of oil prices on the economy have changed over time: oil prices were perceived to have large effects on output and inflation in the 1970s, but only milder effects after the mid-1980s. Since expectations play a large role in the determination of output and inflation, the effects of oil price increases on expectations can magnify the response of macroeconomic variables to oil price shocks. In the estimated model, in fact, the implied responses of output and inflation to oil price shocks were much more pronounced in the 1970s than in 2008. Therefore, through the time variation in the impact of oil prices on beliefs, the paper can successfully explain the observed weakening of the effects of oil price shocks oil real activity and inflation.

The nonlinear model provides a unified econometric framework, not only for pursuing the time profile of interest elasticity, but also to test the linearity of the Japanese money demand function. The test results for the linearity of the Japanese money demand function provide evidence of nonlinearity with a semilog model and linearity with a double-log model.

Workforce gender composition is strongly related to employers' wage policies.

Nevertheless, cooperatives and cooperative-like organizations do play important roles in a number of sectors, suggesting that in some circumstances they are more efficient than other business forms. This paper explores the importance of membership goals on the relative efficiency of the cooperative form of organization. The cooperative cost (and hence production efficiency) advantage is directly linked to the goal alignment between the coopative and its members, and is influenced by the extent of income redistribution between members and the degree of rent seeking that takes place in the organization. When there is no aversion to income inequality. the members produce at their first best levels. However, as aversion to inequality rises, the production profile of the members converges to the production profile generated when the members face an IOF. Regarding rent seeking, if the more (less) efficient members are able to get their profits valued more, total output is increased (decreased). As a consequence, consumers may benefit from the lobbying that occurs inside a cooperative where the powerful members are the most efficient agents.

In Denmark, workers bear less firm-specific risk than workers in the United States do. Collective action thus has an important role to play.

While such an adjustment increases the employer's chances of filling the vacancy, it also more likely results in a match that terminates when the match is hit by match-specific productivity shocks. Drawing on a novel Slovenian vacancy dataset, we find that employers who are searching to fill temporary positions are more likely to hire underqualified workers when search costs are high. We find that search costs are taken into consideration when employers are searching to fill permanent positions in some specifications but not all. These findings suggest that for employers who are searching to fill a permanent position, the benefits of lowering hiring requirements when search costs are high are likely outweighed by: a) high firing costs if an under-qualified worker is hired on a permanent contract or b) the costs of undertaking a new search later if an underqualified worker is hired on a temporary contract. These are novel findings about the employers' hiring practices in the presence of employment protection laws and costly search. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This approach seems especially relevant to shed lights on one issue of importance for tourism destinations: how to achieve sustainable tourism development? Indeed, it has long been empirically observed that tourism development follows a life cycle. After a period of growth, the development of touristic (mountain and seaside) resorts usually stagnate and decline. At least part of the explanation for this pattern is to be found in the evolution of destinations' reputation over time. The present paper investigates the incentives for adjacent tourist resorts to invest in quality in order to maintain their collective reputation. We propose a dynamic model where (1) several adjacent tourist resorts select their tourist flows and (2) invest in order to remedy to the detrimental effects tourism flows have on local environmental amenities. The overall tourist presence and the sum of investments made by tourist resorts jointly define the quality of the touristic product offered by this tourism destination. We assume that this quality cannot be observed by consumers at the time of purchase. However, in this situation of imperfect information, consumers form expectations about the quality of the touristic product offered at any point of time. These expectations define the collective reputation of tourist resorts, determine the position of the tourist resorts' demand curve and constitute the state variable in the differential game. We characterize and compare equilibrium strategies under a noncooperative and investments coordination regimes.","[Claude, Denis; Zaccour, Georges] HEC Montreal, GERAD, Chair Game Theory & Management, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Claude, D (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, GERAD, Chair Game Theory & Management, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",georges.zaccour@hec.ca,"Claude, Denis/AAX-2904-2021; Zaccour, Georges/H-6087-2019","Claude, Denis/0000-0001-7901-5122; Zaccour, Georges/0000-0003-4505-0477",,,,,19,9,9,1,28,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

We test for the presence and persistence of gender differences in performance and the rate of entry into the tournament option and whether these differences are sensitive to the structure of the tournament rewards. In the winner-take-all (WTA) condition, only the best performer in the tournament for each round received a payment ($4.50). In the graduated tournament condition, the same payment ($4.50) was divided among the first, second, and third finishers in the tournament. In the WTA condition, men showed significantly lower forecast errors than women. In addition, a clear sorting effect occurs in the WTA condition. In early rounds of the WTA condition, male entrants into the tournament show significantly lower forecast errors than female tournament entrants. However, the difference disappears over time. After controlling for forecasting skill, gender did not predict entry into the tournament for the WTA condition. However, lower forecasting skill reduced the probability of entry. In the graduated tournament, the situation was reversed. Men entered the tournament at significantly higher rates, even after controlling for skill. Forecasting skill had no impact on the decision to enter the tournament. While the average male entrant to the tournament had lower forecast errors than the average female entrant, the men entered at much higher rates. As a consequence, men were much more likely than women to enter the tournament too frequently. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Although this so-called 'power of asking' is well-known among fundraisers, the existing literature does not pay much attention to the role of donation requests in charitable giving. This paper uses a unique survey that includes a question on whether the respondent is asked to give to estimate the causal effects of charitable solicitations on giving behavior. In order to address the endogeneity of the donation requests due to non-random solicitation of charitable donors, I link this survey to IRS data on charitable organizations and propose identifying instruments. After controlling for the endogeneity, I find that donation requests increase the propensity to give by about nineteen percentage points for those who are asked to give. This effect is robust under different specifications and with different sets of instruments, and is much larger than the estimates from univariate models, which assume that charitable solicitations are exogenous. I argue that this result is counterintuitive and discuss some possible explanations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We find that economies with intermediate levels of education remain in a poverty trap since the level of skills creates sufficient corruption rents but not enough monitoring.

This paper shows that the complexity of the global network of trade imbalances has increased over time in terms of the number of countries involved and of the heterogeneity of their conditions. These findings imply that orchestrating a global exchange rate adjustment plan, as done in the 1980s to tackle a similar problem. is certainly more difficult than it was 20 years ago. We also show, however. that the uncoordinated movements in bilateral exchange rates occurred since the early 2000s did not go in the direction of reducing bilateral imbalances. Rebalancing the world economy. thus, seems to require a rich set of coordinated policy actions and economic changes, involving adjustments in both exchange rates and real variables, which are heterogeneous at the country level. We argue that, provided some conditions are satisfied, the variegated effects of the ongoing financial crisis, and the policy responses this has induced, may help the global and bilateral rebalancing process.

This paper considers a new and salient form of uncertainty, namely uncertainty regarding the environmental characteristics of 'green' innovations. Here, R&D may generate both backstop technologies and technologies that turn out to involve a new pollution problem ('boomerangs'). In the optimum, R&D will therefore typically be undertaken more than once. Extending results from multi-stage optimal control theory, we present a tractable model with a full characterization of the optimal pollution and R&D policies and the role of uncertainty. In this setting, (i) the optimal R&D program is defined by a research trigger condition in which the decision-maker's belief about the probability of finding a backstop enters in an intuitive way; (ii) a decreasing probability of finding a backstop leads to the toleration of higher pollution levels, slower R&D, a slower turnover of technologies, and an ambiguous effect on the expected number of innovations; (iii) learning about the probability of a backstop is driven by failures only and leads to decreasing research incentives; and (iv) small to moderate delays in the resolution of technological uncertainty do not affect the optimal policy.

The banking sectors in the selected set of countries had undergone a remarkable transformation before they achieved EU membership in 2004. We study cost efficiency differences between countries as well as efficiency improvements fostered by intense legislative and regulatory changes and extensive structural and institutional reforms carried out simultaneously. By employing the SFA approach an improvement in cost efficiency was discovered in the period investigated. Some noticeable differences in average cost efficiency among banking sectors can be detected as well. Empirical results also reveal certain significant associations of cost efficiency with country level macroeconomic characteristics, structure of the banking industry, and individual bank features. Analysis of correlating factors shows that the level of competition in the banking sector plays a more important role for cost efficiency improvements than the ownership structure itself. These results might be of interest to policy makers and regulatory authorities as they may provide help in detecting policy measures to create a business environment which would further enhance the cost efficiency of CEE banks.","[Kosak, Marko; Zoric, Jelena] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Zajc, Peter] European Investment Bank, L-2950 Luxembourg, Luxembourg",University of Ljubljana,"Kosak, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Kardeljeva Pl 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",marko.kosak@ef.uni-lj.si,,,,,,,55,21,22,0,16,EUROBALTIC CENTRES EXCELLENCE,RIGA,"RAINA BLVD 19, RIGA, LV-1586, LATVIA",,,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

In particular, we study whether generation firms, which arguably play a dominant role in the restructured electricity markets, have the incentives to fund or support incremental social-welfare-improving transmission investments. We examine this question in a two-node network and explore how such incentives are affected by the ownership of financial transmission rights (FTRs) by generation firms. In the analyzed two-node network, we show both (i) that the net exporter generation firm has the correct incentives to increase the transmission capacity incrementally up to a certain level and (ii) that, although a policy that allocates FTRs to the net exporter generation firm can be desirable from a social point of view, such a policy would dilute the net-importer-generation-firm's incentives to support transmission expansion. Moreover, if all FTRs were allocated or auctioned off to the net exporter generation firm, then it is possible to increase both consumer surplus and social welfare while keeping the net exporter generation firm revenue neutral.

The idea of smart traders is based on the endeavor of market agents to estimate future price movements. By adding smart traders and changes in sentiment we try to improve the original heterogeneous agents model so that it provides a closer description of real markets. The main result of the simulations is that the probability distribution functions of the price deviations change significantly when smart traders are added to the model, and they also change significantly when changes in sentiment are introduced. We also use the Hurst exponent to measure the persistence of the price deviations and we find that the Hurst exponent is significantly increasing with the number of smart traders in the simulations. This means that the introduction of the smart traders concept into the model results in significantly higher persistence of the simulated price deviations. On the other hand, the introduction of changing sentiment in the proposed form does not change the persistence of the simulated prices significantly.","[Vacha, Lukas; Barunik, Jozef; Vosvrda, Miloslav] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Informat Theory & Automat,Inst Econ Studies, CR-11636 Prague 1, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague,"Vácha, L (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Informat Theory & Automat,Inst Econ Studies, CR-11636 Prague 1, Czech Republic.",vachal@utia.cas.cz,"Vosvrda, Miloslav/G-8956-2014; Barunik, Jozef/G-7617-2014; Vacha, Lukas/G-6896-2014","Vosvrda, Miloslav/0000-0001-9821-9059; Barunik, Jozef/0000-0001-5097-2607; Vacha, Lukas/0000-0002-4032-3096",,,,,17,2,2,0,2,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

The revival of flows to the developing countries since 2002 has been different in that inflows to the United States have also been increasing. This suggests the emergence of a pattern of recycling that draws from the surplus countries in the periphery and channels these capital flows increasingly towards U. S. markets.

When the annual rate of inflation is low (below 10%-15%), the frequency of price changes comoves weakly with inflation because movements in the frequency of price decreases and increases partly offset each other. In contrast, the average magnitude of price changes correlates strongly with inflation because it is sensitive to movements in the relative shares of price increases and decreases. When inflation rises beyond 10%-15%, few price decreases are observed and both the frequency and average magnitude are important determinants of inflation. I show that a menu-cost model with idiosyncratic technology shocks predicts the average frequency and magnitude of price changes well over a range of inflation similar to that experienced by Mexico.","Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA,"Gagnon, E (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",,,"Gagnon, Etienne/0000-0002-9516-9532",,,,,24,84,93,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

The typical data utilized in such studies involves repeated measures of auction outcomes, where the variable of interest involves order statistics from the sample of bids from many bids on completed auctions for a particular commodity. This article presents structural estimates of bidding behavior in eBay computer monitor auctions. We exploit characteristics of such repeated measures to analyze the efficiency of private value auctions for a relatively homogeneous good, computer monitors sold on eBay. We discuss how outcomes of the auction mechanism can be analyzed and their equilibrium outcomes assessed and evaluate the consumer surplus that is generated from such auctions. Particular attention is given to the collection of the eBay data from data recovery protocols that monitor in real time and in relative detail, characteristics of a particular auction with heterogeneity controls for different types of monitors and for different reputation effects of the auctioneer. Among other findings, our results point to a rejection of the use of Jump Bidding (Avery, 1998) or Snipe or War bidding (Roth and Ockenfels, 2002). We also find that longer auctions only have a small effect on price and experienced auctioneers respond to this incentive.","[Sickles, Robin C.] Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Hasker, Kevin] Bilkent Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey; [Gonzalez, Raul] Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Fac Econ, Monterrey, NL, Mexico",Rice University; Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University; Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon,"Sickles, RC (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",raugonza@ccr.dsi.uanl.mx; hasker@bilkent.edu.tr; rsickles@rice.edu,"Sickles, Robin/IRZ-2742-2023",,,,,,15,5,10,1,12,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

We find that returning to one's pre-injury employer is associated with more favorable post-injury work outcomes, including higher wages. greater likelihood of job accommodations, and shorter durations of work absence relative to workers who change employers.

First, China's exports to the USA might continue to decline. Second, in the medium term, the higher US inflation rate will lead to a weak dollar, which will negatively affect China's exports. Third, in the long term, when the US Federal Reserve decreases money supply to control inflation, the US economy might enter another recession, hurting China's exports further. Fourth, China's foreign exchange reserve assets might suffer heavy losses when the US inflation rate rises. Conventional foreign exchange investment strategies are insufficient for dealing with these four risks. Investment by China in the major US banks is suggested in the present paper. This strategy would mitigate if not eliminate all four risks.

When the outside option of at least one player is known, the efficient merger decision can be implemented by such a mechanism under plausible budget-balance requirements.

The second procedure first selects the set of maximal elements of the first binary relation, and then within that set, chooses the maximal elements of the second binary relation, and iterates the procedure until the Mth binary relation. We show several distinct sets of conditions for the choice functions representing these two procedures to satisfy non-emptiness and choice-consistency conditions such as contraction consistency and path independence.

Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium theory is part of the crisis wreckage, but turning to old or to New Keynesian theory will be of little use. A balance sheet recession requires that policy address the problems in the private sector's capital as well as its income accounts. We need serious theoretical work on problems of system stability using, for example, agent-based methods.

The post-SDAT meanings of social Darwinism are the product of an unresolved Whiggish tension in SDAT: Hofstadter championed economic reform over free markets, but he also condemned biology in social science, this while many progressive social scientists surveyed in SDAT offered biological justifications for economic reform. As a consequence, there are, in effect, two Hofstadters in SDAT. The first (call him Hofstadter(1)) disparaged as social Darwinism biological justification of laissez-faire, for this was, in his view, doubly wrong. The second Hofstadter (call him Hofstadter(2)) documented, however incompletely, the underside of progressive reform: racism, eugenics and imperialism, and even devised a term for it, Darwinian collectivism. This essay documents and explains Hofstadter's ambivalence in SDAT, especially where, as with Progressive Era eugenics, the two Hofstadters were at odds with each other. It explores the historiographic and semantic consequences of Hofstadter's ambivalence, including its connection with the Left's longstanding mistrust of Darwinism as apology for Malthusian political economy.

Due to signalling activity, a free substitute (negative externality) or complement (positive externality) good appears. For negative or mildly positive externalities, the standard result of signalling at the minimum level obtains. When the positive externality is sufficiently strong, separation occurs, in contrast to the literature, at the maximum rather than at the minimum level of signalling. Very strong positive externalities imply the unique maximum pooling equilibrium.

The existence of competitive storers serves to reduce the monopolist's effective demand when speculators are selling and to increase it when they are buying. This results in the monopolist manipulating the frequency of stockouts, and hence the price-smoothing effects of competitive storage. We find that competitive storage affects both the level and the volatility of price under monopoly. The average price level is higher with storage due to the monopolist's desire to induce stockouts by occasionally keeping the price just at the level that induces a stockout. Although storage does reduce the volatility of prices under monopoly production, prices are more volatile than they would be under perfectly competitive production, even though stockouts occur less frequently under monopoly. These results are demonstrated through closed-form solutions of the two-period version of the model and computational Solutions to the infinite horizon version of the model. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Both our qualitative and quantitative analyses provide grounds for guarded optimism regarding ACFTA's prospects as a vehicle for strengthening the economic partnership between ASEAN and China.","[Park, Donghyun; Estrada, Gemma Esther B.] Asian Dev Bank, Econ & Res Dept, Manila, Philippines; [Park, Innwon] Korea Univ, Div Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea",Asian Development Bank; Korea University,"Park, D (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, Econ & Res Dept, Manila, Philippines.",dpark@adb.org; iwpark@korea.ac.kr; gestrada@adb.org,"Park, Innwon/I-6310-2019","Park, Innwon/0000-0001-8567-7907",,,,,20,17,19,2,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2009,17.0,4,,,,,104,120,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2009.01161.x,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,472XY,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268167800007,0

They are essentially the equivalent of 1929 developed in two stages, one centred on technological innovation, the other on financial innovation. Hence, the frequent references to that crash, to the 1930s and to Bretton Woods, are not simple journalistic metaphors for interpreting the 'credit crunch' and its solution, but rather the intuitive recognition of a fundamental similarity between those events and the current ones. The paper holds that such major boom and bust episodes are endogenous to the way in which the market economy evolves and assimilates successive technological revolutions. It will discuss why it occurred in two bubbles on this occasion; it examines the differences and continuities between the two episodes and presents an interpretation of their nature and consequences.","[Perez, Carlota] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Perez, Carlota] Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England; [Perez, Carlota] Tallinn Univ Technol, Tallinn, Estonia",University of Cambridge; University of Sussex; Tallinn University of Technology,"Perez, C (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",,,,,,,,43,102,117,0,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

This article presents an asymmetric information model of layoffs that explicitly considers the possibility of recall. In this model, high-productivity workers are more likely to be recalled to their former employer and may choose to remain unemployed rather than to accept a low-wage job. In this case, unemployment can serve as a signal of productivity. I present conditions under which all equilibria satisfying the Cho-Kreps intuitive criterion must entail (some) unemployment. Because of productivity gains from valuable job-matches, unemployment may be socially desirable for those workers who were particularly productive with their former employer. If so, a re-employment bonus that encourages low-productivity workers to find a new job but does not discourage high-productivity workers from waiting for recall is an optimal policy from societal perspective. Equity properties of such a policy and its cost effectiveness are analysed.","Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ, Bellaterra 08193, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Rodríguez-Planas, N (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ, Edifici B, Bellaterra 08193, Spain.",Nuria.Rodriguez@uab.cat,,"Rodriguez-Planas, Nuria/0000-0003-3824-7001",,,,,34,2,2,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

We show that estimates of the effects of twinning at higher parities on the outcomes of older children in prior studies do not identify family-size effects but are confounded by inter-child allocation effects because of the endowment deficit and close spacing of twins. However, examining the effects of twinning by birth order, net of the effects stemming from the endowment deficit of twins, can provide upper and lower bounds on the trade-off between the family size and average child quality. Our estimates, based on data from China, indicate that an extra child at parity one or at parity two, net of one component of birth-endowment effects associated with birth weight, significantly decreases the schooling progress, the expected college enrolment, grades in school and the assessed health of all children in the family. Despite the evident significant trade-off between number of children and child quality in China, the findings suggest that the contribution of the one-child policy in China to the development of its human capital was modest.","[Rosenzweig, Mark R.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Zhang, Junsen] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Yale University; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Rosenzweig, MR (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",,,,,,,,27,261,313,7,158,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

However, the absence of exchange rate risk with respect to the other members of the union may reduce the urgency for such reforms. A number of other considerations also suggest that theory is ambiguous about the impact of participating in a currency union on progress in structural reforms. This paper addresses this issue empirically for the euro area. The results suggest that reforms in the euro area seem to have decelerated following the introduction of the euro. but from a fast pace. The paper discusses a number of possible explanations, including reform fatigue, the absence of 11 market punishment, and good-times complacency. Estimates from an empirical growth model suggest that the slowing of reforms may slow down annual output growth by up to 0.2%.

Hypotheses about sectoral transmission of policy and shocks are often more specific than hypotheses about overall transmission. This study employs a stochastic framework to estimate richly specified equilibrium correction models, four-quarters-ahead, for the 10 sub-components of the first targeted measure of the consumer price index, CPIX. The stochastic trends are estimated by the Kalman filter, and interpreted as capturing structural breaks and institutional change, a frequent cause of forecast failure. The trends suggest the design of deterministic split trends for use in recursive forecasting models, towards more accurate overall inflation forecasting. This research also has practical use for monetary policy in allowing identification of sectoral sources of inflation.","[Aron, Janine] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Muellbauer, John N.

In some cases, users are charged for things such as web-based e-mail, wireless Internet access, and software, while in other cases, they aren't. Zero prices offer important benefits, even relative to small positive prices. For one, fee-free access reduces transaction costs - eliminating the need for billing systems as well as, in many cases, account setup, usernames, and the like. Furthermore, zero prices seem to create an environment of experimentation and progress for products and consumers. Finally, consumers overwhelmingly favor zero-price products, even beyond what might be predicted by their ordinary efforts to maximize consumer surplus. Yet experience in other contexts offers cause for concern. Although marginal costs may be near zero for many levels of use of online resources, costs generally eventually increase as usage nears a capacity constraint given by technological capability or system design. More generally, experience in other contexts repeatedly reveals overconsumption, scarcity, and even hoarding when resources are provided without charge. With competing forces both supporting and opposing zero prices, typical Internet-related activities - like surfing the web, web searches, and e-mail, along with behind-the-scenes practices like domain names and the allocation of IP (Internet protocol) addresses - present a natural context to reevaluate our sense of the tradeoffs that arise between free and a positive price.","Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Business Adm, Boston, MA 02163 USA",Harvard University,"Edelman, B (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Business Adm, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",bedelman@hbs.edu,,,,,,,49,6,7,1,14,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

I illustrate this triangulated model, which I then apply to confront allocative decisions in digital dividend policy, such as the FCC's open access clause in the 700 MHz auction and Ofcom's current review of UHF spectrum release in the 800 MHz band.

The Dutch case endorses the view that corporatist institutions are significant for income distribution. Corporatism also may positively influence productivity. Therefore, the integration of the Successful corporatist Countries into the European Union does not imply that they have to converge to the socio-economic governance structure of the other countries.

The only internationally accepted method of estimating poverty requires a measurement of total consumption based on a time-consuming and resource-demanding measure of household expenditure in an integrated survey over 12 months. Rather than measuring poverty, say, only every fifth year, a model is presented to predict poverty based on a small set of household variables to be collected annually between two 12-monthly household surveys. Information obtained from these light surveys might then be used to predict poverty rates. The key question is whether the inaccuracy in these predictions is acceptable. It is recommended that these models be tested at a country level and if the test results are similar to those found here, that this approach be adopted.","Stat Norway, Div Dev Cooperat, N-0033 Oslo, Norway",Statistics Norway,"Mathiassen, A (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, Div Dev Cooperat, POB 8131, N-0033 Oslo, Norway.",mss@ssb.no,,,,,,,4,8,8,0,3,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

The aim is to identify the specific factors influencing the approach adopted by organizations in these countries and to analyze them so as to detect possible similarities in the behavior of the parties involved. What model can local managers use as a framework? If there is none, can the main variables of a new model for implementing corporate social responsibility be identified that better meets the needs of formerly Communist countries? Since, from a managerial viewpoint, models of corporate social responsibility from western Europe and the USA are inapplicable in eastern Europe, local managers are led to design their own models of implementation. From a theoretical viewpoint, model-building is shown, once again, to entail a simplification of reality that can spawn hard-to-explain paradoxes.

In other words, how recessions arising within one or more countries might percolate across a network of connected economies. An agent based model is set up in which the agents are Western economies. A country has a probability of entering recession in any given year and one of emerging from it the next. In addition, the agents have a threshold propensity, which varies across time, to import a recession from the agents most closely connected to them. The agents are connected on a network, and an agent's neighbours at any time are either in (state 1) or out (state 0) of recession. If the weighted sum exceeds the threshold, the agent also goes into recession. Annual real GDP growth for 17 Western countries 1871-2006 is used as the data set. The model is able to replicate three key features of the statistical distribution of recessions: the distribution of the number of countries in recession in any given year, the duration of recessions within the individual countries, and the distribution of 'wait time' between recessions i.e. the number of years between them. The network structure is important for the interacting agents to replicate the stylised facts. The country-specific probabilities of entering and emerging from recession by themselves give results which are by no means as well matched to the actual data.","[Ormerod, Paul; Heineike, Amy] Volterra Consulting, London SW14 8AE, England",,"Ormerod, P (通讯作者)，Volterra Consulting, 135C Sheen Lane, London SW14 8AE, England.",pormerod@volterra.co.uk; aheineike@volterra.co.uk,,,,,,,27,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

It is worthwhile reducing the scale of observation so as to focus on changes within a single formation. In this respect, the Romanian Social Democrat Party is a worthy subject of study. For several years, its position on Europe has been ambivalent. Some party leaders try to attract underprivileged voters by a pragmatic use of EU norms, which they claim to be able to turn to an economic advantage while reducing the social impact. Rivals blame these claims for keeping Romania from being seen as a reliable EU member state. They use their symbolic resource, acquired during a period of socialization in Brussels or Strasbourg. The party apparatus cannot survive without appeasing each of these two tendencies among party leaders. An alternating distribution of favors maintains the momentum of intraparty groups and keeps one conception of relations with the EU from winning out over the other. The party is thus able to avoid a split, but unable to work out a coherent and stable position on EU membership.","[Roger, Antoine] Inst Etud Polit Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France; [Roger, Antoine] CNRS, IEP Bordeaux, SPIRIT, UMR 5116, F-75700 Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Roger, A (通讯作者)，Inst Etud Polit Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.",a.roger@sciencespobordeaux.fr,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,0,PRESSES UNIV FRANCE,PARIS CEDEX 14,"6 AVENUE REILLE, 75685 PARIS CEDEX 14, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

In a theoretical framework, we show that local principals' incentive payments are likely to clash with those of SASAC as local SCE principals' promote social stability and SASAC bolsters SCE efficiency. A second-best outcome requires a social planner to restrict actions by local principals and to impose taxes/subsidies to address inter-principal externalities.

When comparing this classification with records of economic and political reforms before the breakdown of socialism, an apparent historical regularity emerges. Countries where transition was to an extent endogenous were more likely to choose a gradualist strategy, whereas countries where a strict socialist regime was upheld until its breakdown, were more likely to decide for an orthodox big-bang approach to transition. Some political economy explanations for this regularity are suggested. The second part of the paper explores Slovenia's experience in some detail. We present the discussion on the benefits and pitfalls of its gradual approach to reforms, showing that gradualism may slow down important structural reforms in the second phase of transition and thus negatively affect competitiveness and the long-run growth performance of a country. Moreover. since the gradualist approach to transition has increased institutional rigidity and created a kind of political economic equilibrium, an endogenous changeover to a more dynamic reform agenda is unlikely. We report on the recent more ambitious structural reforms agenda introduced in the country and conclude that it amounts to merely a gradual move away from gradualism. We conclude by offering some tentative political economy interpretations of these developments. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

But with six additional years of data now available for analysis, we think the need for further parsing of older data is of limited value in assessing the more guns, less crime hypothesis. In this comment, we add six years of data to what Moody and Marvell previously analyzed. We show that, whether one looks at the original Lott and Mustard specification, the latest Moody and Marvell specification, or a plausible alternative specification, there is consistent evidence for the unsurprising proposition that RTC laws increase aggravated assault. We address some anomalies in these models and their resulting estimates. The Lott and Mustard model, for example, suffers from omitted-variable bias in failing to control for the impact of incarceration. In addition, the Moody and Marvell model generates odd predictions of the impact of incarceration on crime for most crime categories, and it appears to suggest (anomalously) that crack had no impact on murder. These and other problems raise questions about how well these regressions work to reveal the true effect on crime of RTC laws. For instance, would better data and models reveal that the estimated increases in murder and robbery are also statistically significant, as they are for the related violent crime of aggravated assault? Or might the estimated effect of aggravated assault be altered if we knew the full impact of changing police responses to domestic violence?","[Ayres, Ian; Donohue, John J., III] Yale Univ, Sch Law, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",Yale University,"Ayres, I (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Sch Law, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",,,,,,,,21,21,27,0,20,INST SPONTANEOUS ORDER ECONOMICS,FAIRFAX,"9745 KINGS CROWN COURT #102, FAIRFAX, VA 22031 USA",1933-527X,,,ECON J WATCH,Econ.

We analyze whether media violence affects violent crime in the field. We exploit variation in the violence of blockbuster movies from 1995 to 2004, and study the effect on same-day assaults. We find that violent crime decreases on days with larger theater audiences for violent movies. The effect is partly due to voluntary incapacitation: between 6 P.M. and 12 A.M., a one million increase in the audience for violent movies reduces violent crime by 1.1% to 1.3%. After exposure to the movie, between 12 A.M. and 6 A.M., violent crime is reduced by an even larger percent. This finding is explained by the self-selection of violent individuals into violent movie attendance, leading to a substitution away from more volatile activities. In particular, movie attendance appears to reduce alcohol consumption. The results emphasize that media exposure affects behavior not only via content, but also because it changes time spent in alternative activities. The substitution away from more dangerous activities in the field can explain the differences with the laboratory findings. Our estimates suggest that in the short run, violent movies deter almost 1,000 assaults on an average weekend. Although our design does not allow us to estimate long-run effects, we find no evidence of medium-run effects up to three weeks after initial exposure.","[Dahl, Gordon] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Dahl, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",,,,,,,,25,104,127,2,117,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Firms are composed of two factions whose objectives differ: one is maximizing profit while the other maximizes revenues. The equilibrium concept we model, called Firm Unanimity Nash Equilibrium (FUNE), corresponds to the Nash equilibrium between firms when there is efficient bargaining between the two factions inside both firms. We first show that such equilibria are inefficient, with both firms underproviding quality. We then assume that the government takes a participation in one firm, which introduces a third faction, bent on welfare maximization, in that firm. We study the characteristics of equilibria as a function of the bargaining weight of the welfare-maximizing faction. We show that equilibrium welfare increases with this bargaining weight, especially if consumers care a lot for the average quality of the goods provided. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This paper derives an expression for the willingness-to-pay for a reduction in transport costs from the canonical agricultural household model and uses it to estimate the benefits of a hypothetical road project. Estimation is based on novel cross-sectional data collected in a small region of Madagascar with enormous, yet plausibly exogenous, variation in transport cost. A road that essentially eliminated transport costs in the study area would boost the incomes of the remotest households - those facing transport costs of about $75/ton - by nearly half, mostly by raising non-farm earnings. This benefit estimate is contrasted to one based on a hedonic approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike the previous studies, this study measures FDI inflows into Eastern Europe and also considers liberalization in the service sector. Major findings and implications from this study are as follows. First, the earlier expectation of huge inflows of FDI into the CEEC-10 and modest inflows into Bulgaria-Romania is verified empirically. Second, economic gains from the EU enlargement are expanded in member countries when liberalization in the services sector is considered. Third, the impacts of goods-and-services liberalization in the CEEC-10 and Bulgaria-Romania is not exaggerated greatly even when the Hoekman index is employed.

Rules may range from noncooperative, where players may only act unilaterally, to cooperative, where coalitions of players may act in concert. The dominance relation over feasible networks incorporates player preferences, the rules of network formation, and the degree of farsightedness of players. A specification of the primitives induces an abstract game consisting of (i) a feasible set of networks, and (ii) a path dominance relation. Using this induced game we characterize sets of network outcomes that are likely to emerge and persist. Finally, we apply our approach and results to characterize the equilibrium of some well-known models and their rules of network formation, such as those of Jackson and Wolinsky, and Jackson and van den Nouweland.

Of all the external channels through which the crisis has been transmitted to Latin America, the drop in remittances is the least important. The most widespread negative effects will come from the decline in the volume of international trade and the sharp deterioration in the terms of trade for commodities. In addition, a period of very restricted external private-sector financing lies ahead. The region's economies have entered this crisis in a stronger position than in the past, mainly because public debt is lower and international reserves are large, but this will only partially mitigate the repercussions of the worst global economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s.","[Antonio Ocampo, Jose] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Ocampo, JA (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",jao2128@columbia.edu,,,,,,,23,5,5,0,8,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,APR,2009,,97,,,,,9,32,,,,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,485UI,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000269149900002,0

We argue that openness can increase the size of governments through two channels: (1) a terms-of-trade externality, whereby trade lowers the domestic cost of taxation, and (2) the demand for insurance, whereby trade raises risk and public transfers. We provide a unified framework for studying and testing these two mechanisms. Our main theoretical prediction is that the relative strength of the two explanations depends on a key parameter, namely, the elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign goods. Moreover, while the first mechanism is inefficient from the standpoint of world welfare, the second, instead, is optimal. In the empirical part of the paper, we provide new evidence on the positive association between openness and government size and we explore its determinants. Consistent with the terms-of-trade externality channel, we show that the correlation is contingent on a low elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign goods. Our findings raise warnings that globalization may have led to inefficiently large governments.","[Epifani, Paolo] Univ Bocconi, Milan, Italy",Bocconi University,"Epifani, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bocconi, Milan, Italy.",,"Gancia, Gino/F-8132-2013","Gancia, Gino/0000-0002-9375-261X; EPIFANI, PAOLO/0000-0002-5480-3971",,,,,58,81,89,4,48,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

In this note, we characterize the steady state distribution of wealth and compare it to the initial distribution, obtaining analytical conditions for one to be more skewed than the other. We show that whether wealth inequality increases or decreases during the transition to the steady state depends on simple and intuitive conditions on parameter values. Standard values for these parameters indicate that it is more likely that wealth inequality decreases as the economy accumulates capital.","[Garcia-Penalosa, Cecilia] Ctr Vieille Charite, GREQAM, F-13236 Marseille, France; [Garcia-Penalosa, Cecilia] CNRS, F-75700 Paris, France; [Turnovsky, Stephen J.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"García-Peñalosa, C (通讯作者)，Ctr Vieille Charite, GREQAM, 2 Rue Charite, F-13236 Marseille, France.",penalosa@ehess.uni-mrs.fr,,,,,,,20,7,7,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Job search theory is used to derive theoretical predictions. To deal with effect heterogeneity and selectivity, the effects of interest are estimated by propensity score matching. We apply the method to the German active labor market program system, using a novel data set including self-reported assessments of the variables of interest as well as unusually detailed information on behavior, attitudes, and past outcomes.

This is done for all industries and separately for just high technology industries. Our results indicate that for England and Wales there is a two-way causality between the interregional human-capital employment-migration flows of recent university graduates and the innovation performance of regions.

In addition, changing bilateral differences in personal income distribution during the transition of Central-East European countries towards a market economy contribute to changes in vertical intra-industry trade.","IWH Halle Inst Econ Res, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH),"Gabrisch, H (通讯作者)，IWH Halle Inst Econ Res, Kleine Markerstr 8, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany.",gab@iwh-halle.de,,"Gabrisch, Hubert/0000-0001-8825-4600",,,,,38,4,4,0,8,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

It is known that when a monopoly right is auctioned, auctions select the bidder that is least risk-averse. This firm will choose a higher value of the aftermarket strategic variable than any other firm will do, thereby implying a higher market price under price setting behavior and a lower price due to higher quantity under quantity-setting behavior. This paper extends the analysis to oligopoly aftermarkets and analyzes whether the monopoly result carries over to oligopoly settings. We argue that with multiple licenses and demand uncertainty auctions actually perform even worse from a welfare point of view than the monopoly case would suggest. A strategic effect strengthens the monopoly result with respect to prices, but weakens the result with respect to quantities. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Janssen, Maarten C.

Many economists have argued that efforts to operate adjustably pegged exchange rate regimes have been a major contributor to the unstable middle hypothesis and some have argued that this unstable middle is so broad that only the two corners of hard fixes or floating rates will be stable in a world of high capital mobility-the two corners or bipolar hypothesis. Two recent empirical studies by researchers at the International Monetary Fund reach opposing conclusions on these issues. We examine the issue further and show that conclusions can be quite sensitive to how exchange rate regimes are grouped into categories and the measures of currency crises that are used. In general we find that the dead center of the adjustable peg is by far the most crisis prone broad type of exchange rate regimes, but that countries need not go all the way to freely floating rates or hard fixes to substantially reduce the risks of currency crises.","[Angkinand, Apanard] Univ Illinois, Springfield, IL USA; [Chiu, Eric M.

Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we show that compensation in performance-pay jobs is more closely tied to both observed and unobserved productive characteristics of workers than compensation in non-performance-pay jobs. We also find that the return to these productive characteristics increased faster over time in performance-pay than in non-performance-pay jobs. We show that this finding is consistent with the view that underlying changes in returns to skill due, for instance, to technological change induce more firms to offer performance-pay contracts and result in more wage inequality among workers who are paid for performance. Thus, performance pay provides a channel through which underlying changes in returns to skill get translated into higher wage inequality. We conclude that this channel accounts for 21% of the growth in the variance of male wages between the late 1970s and the early 1990s and for most of the increase in wage inequality above the eightieth percentile over the same period.","[Lemieux, Thomas] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; Columbia Univ, Natl Bur Econ Res, New York, NY 10027 USA; McGill Univ, Natl Bur Econ Res, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada",University of British Columbia; National Bureau of Economic Research; Columbia University; McGill University,"Lemieux, T (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",,"MacLeod, William Bentley/A-8699-2009","MacLeod, William Bentley/0000-0002-9726-7654",,,,,35,275,326,5,85,M I T PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"238 MAIN STREET, STE 500, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1046 USA",0033-5533,,,Q J ECON,Q.

The analysis focuses on the implications of alternative ways of financing payroll tax cuts in closed and small-open neoclassical economies. In our models payroll tax cuts do not necessarily stimulate hours worked in the stationary state. We show, for example, that in the closed economy -paradoxically- long-run aggregate labor hours and the capital stock will be reduced if labor tax proceeds are replaced by capital taxation. If instead government purchases of the capital good (or government labor services) are decreased, manhours are left unchanged in the long-run, while capital formation is spurred. In the small-open economy it is only if the offsets are a fall in entitlement spending or a rise in the wealth tax that aggregate manhours are increased -otherwise steady state hours worked are invariant.

Empirical evidence from both linear and non-linear models confirms that terrorism has a large significant negative impact on economic activity.

This paper re-examines the relationship between exports and economic growth in five industrialized economies (Canada, Italy, Japan, UK, and the US) with emphasis on the effect of nonlinearities on the causal relationships. Results from linearity tests show that nonlinearities do exist in the dynamic relationship between exports and GDP growth. Nonlinear smooth transition autoregressive (STAR) model results suggest that nonlinear Granger causality flows from exports to output growth and vice versa, Predictive accuracy tests further confirm the appropriateness of the nonlinear models over the linear model specification.

If the CPPI method is applied in continuous time, the CPPI strategies provide a value above a floor level unless the price dynamics of the risky asset permit jumps. The risk of violating the floor protection is called gap risk. In practice, it is caused by liquidity constraints and price jumps. Both can be modelled in a setup where the price dynamics of the risky asset are described by a continuous-time stochastic process but trading is restricted to discrete time. We propose a discrete-time version of the continuous-tune CPPI strategies which satisfies three conditions. The resulting strategies are self-financing, the asset exposure is non-negative and the value process converges. We determine risk measures such as the shortfall probability and the expected shortfall and discuss criteria which ensure that the gap risk does not increase to a level which contradicts the original intention of portfolio insurance. In addition, we introduce proportional transaction costs and analyze their effects on the risk profile. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The question is particularly interesting because (1) Cambodia has incorporated independently monitored labour standards and trade union rights into its labour law and (2) the clothing industry plays a centrally important role in growth of exports, GDP and employment. The paper shows that with the exception of the EU market, the increasingly competitive environment did not undermine expansion of the industry prior to the onset of global recession in 2008. The reason for continued success lay mainly in improved price competitiveness through exchange rate movements and the shift of China towards more upmarket production. Productivity gains seem an unlikely source of continued rapid growth. Finally, an examination of monitoring reports indicates that labour standards did not decline as a result of increased competitive pressures. Changes scheduled to take place in the monitoring system might, however, reduce its independence and permit the growth of a sector of the industry with lower standards.","Macquarie Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Business & Econ, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University,"Beresford, M (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Business & Econ, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",melanieb@efs.mq.edu.au,,,,,,,42,15,16,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

The first describes the methodological framework of the investigation, insisting on defining the sectoral changes and the relative prices, as well as on their interaction (as expectations and as real processes); the theoretical considerations are algebraically formalized in order to be analyzed statistically. The second chapter is devoted to the data problems, with emphasis on the configuration of input-output tables used in application and on the main trends identified in the structural evolution of the Romanian economy during 1989-2005. The third - as a main one - contains a detailed econometric analysis. The main assumption of the paper is that the downward price rigidity cannot be separated from the corresponding downward output rigidity. They represent an indestructible tandem. In other words, the downward price rigidity is intimately connected not only to the nominal wage low flexibility, but to the slow employment adjustments, too. This approach has many consequences. From this point of view, the orthogonal regression is admitted as a more suitable method as compared to the direct and the reverse OLS. The paper ends with a short set of concluding remarks, including possible extensions of this research.",,,,,"Dobrescu, Emilian/AAK-4781-2021","Dobrescu, Emilian/0000-0002-6063-1125",,,,,54,5,5,0,3,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

There are several alternative hypotheses for this correlation, including both causal and non-causal pathways. In this paper, I use an instrumental variables/fixed effects approach to examine whether there is evidence that an individual's mental health status spills over on his or her spouse's mental health status. Results from the IV-FE specifications that use spousal job problems as an instrument are large in magnitude. In particular, spousal mental health status is estimated to have a greater influence on an individual's mental health status than his or her own mental health endowment and is similar in magnitude with his or her own physical health status. Although not conclusive, these findings suggest that within-family spillovers of mental illness could be economically important and that policies that reduce mental health problems for individuals likely have unmeasured benefits for their family members.","Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Fletcher, J (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",jason.fletcher@yale.edu,"Fletcher, Jason/C-7449-2011",,"NIAAA NIH HHS [RL1 AA017542-01, RL1 AA017542] Funding Source: Medline; NIA NIH HHS [R01 AG027045-01, R01 AG027045] Funding Source: Medline",NIAAA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA)); NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,31,23,30,0,12,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The analysis is conducted with a dynamic computable overlapping generations model where in the spirit of Becker [Becker, Gary (1965), A theory of the allocation of time, The Economic journal, Vol. 75, pp. 493-517.] and Heckman [Heckman, James (1976), A life-cycle model of earnings, learning and consumption,The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 84, pp. 511-544], leisure has a quality-time feature and labour supply and human capital investment decisions are endogenous. The role of human capital in the growth process is based oil the framework used by Mankiw et al. [Mankiw, N. Gregory, Romer, David and Weil, David N. (1992), A contribution to the empirics of economic growth, Quarterly journal of Economics, Vol. 107, no. 2, pp. 407-437]. The paper indicates that Population ageing creates more opportunities for Young individuals to invest in human capital and supply more skilled labour at middle age. Consequently, the reduction in labour supply of young adults initially lowers productive capacity and exacerbates the economic costs of population ageing. However, current and future middle-age cohorts are More skilled and work more, which eventually raises productive capacity and significantly lowers the cost of population ageing. Finally, these results suggest that the recent increase in the participation rate of older workers might be the beginning of a new trend that will amplify over the next decades.

The analysis reconciles the conflicting results in previous studies that find advertising to be undersupplied in homogeneous product markets, but oversupplied in differentiated product markets when the degree of differentiation is small. In equilibrium, purely informative advertising is undersupplied when brands are sufficiently close substitutes and oversupplied when brands are more differentiated. Product differentiation also has welfare implications for the effect of technological change in the advertising sector. in response to an advertising cost innovation, equilibrium prices fall and the market converges to the socially optimal resource allocation for brands that are sufficiently close substitutes, whereas equilibrium prices rise and divergence occurs when brands are more differentiated.

It examines the effects of dividend payment status and the change in dividend payment on the relation between current stock returns and future earnings. The results show that dividends contain value relevant information about future earnings and that this information is incorporated into current stock returns. In particular, we find that firms that pay dividends at the current year exhibit higher levels of share price anticipation of earnings than nondividend-paying firms. We also find that the change in dividends is positively related to changes in the importance of future earnings news for current stock returns. Finally, we find that the relevance of dividends for forecasting future earnings is greater for loss-making firms than for profitable firms.","Univ Stirling, Dept Accounting & Finance, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland",University of Stirling,"Hussainey, K (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Dept Accounting & Finance, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",khaled.hussainey@stir.ac.uk,"Hussainey, Khaled/AFG-8056-2022",,,,,,5,0,1,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

This information, along with the same for the native population, allows a detailed analysis of the effect of immigration on the balance of the social security system. The main result is that the solvency ratio ( contributions over pensions) of immigrants is clearly above that of natives and will be so until 2055, when both ratios will be well under current values.","[Jimenez-Ridruejo Ayuso, Zenon; Borondo Arribas, Carlos; Lopez Diaz, Julio; Lorenzo Lago, Carmen; Rodriguez Sumaza, Carmen] Univ Valladolid, E-47002 Valladolid, Spain",Universidad de Valladolid,"Ayuso, ZJR (通讯作者)，Univ Valladolid, E-47002 Valladolid, Spain.",zenon@eco.uva.es,"Borondo Arribas, Carlos/D-5544-2016",,,,,,55,0,1,0,4,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,2386-4176,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2009,,188,,,,,73,121,,,,,,49,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,441BK,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000265744100004,0

In the analysis, we assert that S&E occupations and non-S&E occupations differ in the nature of skill requirements and their susceptibility to technological change; and consequently the earnings effects of SBTC also demonstrate a similar impact. For the empirical analysis, the modified Mincerian earnings equations are estimated by quantile regressions as well as the ordinary least squares (OLS) and two-stage estimation method. Fitted to Korean panel data, the earning-enhancing effect of SBTC is observed for male workers, not only for those in S&E occupations but also for those in non-S&E occupations. Such an effect is not observed for women in S&E occupations, and rather turns even negative for women in non-S&E occupations; envisaging a relatively large occurrence of work interruption of married women in Korea, we conjecture that this may reflect women workers' skill deterioration taking place during a work interruption. The earnings effect of SBTC is most apparent for male workers in the higher quantiles of earnings distribution, implying that those who are highly educated and have high unobserved ability gain most from SBTC.","[Jung, Jin Hwa] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Res Inst Agr & Life Sci, Seoul, South Korea; [Choi, Kang-Shik] Yonsei Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Yonsei University,"Jung, JH (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Res Inst Agr & Life Sci, Seoul, South Korea.",jhjung@snu.ac.kr,,,,,,,21,2,3,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

In the case of deficit which results from increased budgetary expenditure the discussion concentrates on such issues as how lasting are the changes in employment, output and prices caused by deficit spending and to what extent the crowding-out effect would raise interest rates and lead to a reduction of households' expenditure. The influence of the deficit on economic activity is ambigious because much depends on what households do when new treasury bills flow into their portfolios. Economic crises make this influence quite uncertain as households' expectations tend to become unstable and their decisions unpredictable. In such a situation the success of the budget deficit policy depends on the ability of policy makers to moderate the behaviour of households.","Szkola Glowna Handlowa, Katedra Teorii Syst Ekon, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Krawczyk, M (通讯作者)，Szkola Glowna Handlowa, Katedra Teorii Syst Ekon, Warsaw, Poland.",marcin.krawczyk@sgh.waw.pl,,,,,,,24,3,3,0,8,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2009,,5,,,,,559,578,,,,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,527MJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272370900001,0

A special focus is placed on the 10% biofuel target in the EU. In particular we analyze the development in the biofuel sectors, the effects on agricultural production and prices, and finally overall welfare implications. One of the main findings is that the EU emission targets alone lead to only minor increases in biofuel production. Additional subsidies are necessary to reach the 10% biofuel target. This in turn increases European agricultural prices by up to 7%. Compared to a cost-effective scenario in which the EU 20% emission reduction target is reached, additional welfare losses occur due to separated carbon markets and the renewable quotas. The biofuel target has relatively small negative or even positive welfare effects in some scenarios. (C) 2009 Elseviei B.V.

Like earlier RAS variants, KRAS can: (a) handle constraints on arbitrarily sized and shaped subsets of matrix elements; (b) include reliability of the initial estimate and the external constraints; and (c) deal with negative values, and preserve the sign of matrix elements. Applying KRAS in four case studies, we find that, as with constrained optimisation, KRAS is able to find a compromise solution between inconsistent constraints. This feature does not exist in conventional RAS variants such as GRAS. KRAS can constitute a major advance for the practice of balancing input-output tables and Social Accounting Matrices, in that it removes the necessity of manually tracing inconsistencies in external information. This quality does not come at the expense of substantial programming and computational requirements (of conventional constrained optimisation techniques).","[Lenzen, Manfred; Gallego, Blanca; Wood, Richard] Univ Sydney, Ctr Integrated Sustainabil Anal, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Wood, R (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Ctr Integrated Sustainabil Anal, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",r.wood@physics.usyd.edu.au,"Wood, Richard/E-4111-2015; Lenzen, Manfred/D-3161-2013","Wood, Richard/0000-0002-7906-3324; Lenzen, Manfred/0000-0002-0828-5288",,,,,54,96,99,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

The severity of poverty in the Russian Federation is found to stem largely from transient, rather than chronic, spells of economic hardship. Exposure to transient poverty is strongly influenced by household levels of workforce participation, educational assets and physical assets, as well as by local economic conditions. Workforce participation and physical assets also mitigate exposure to chronic poverty. The importance of these determinants of transient and chronic poverty appears to change in the pre-crisis and post-crisis periods. But the severity of chronic poverty does not increase, suggesting that the combined movement towards a market economy and the financial crisis did not generate a new underclass of chronically poor households.","[Mills, Bradford F.] Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Mykerezi, Elton] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Mills, BF (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",bfmills@vt.edu,,"Mykerezi, Elton/0000-0002-8131-1163",,,,,27,4,5,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2009,21.0,3,,,,,283,306,,10.1080/14631370903090590,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,596GR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277673700002,0

There exists no evidence on the asymmetry in the inflation response to output gap. The persistence of inflation is found to be much lower than in linear models.

Prior literature has focused on measuring the Pigouvian tax but has paid little attention to the fiscal rationale. This paper presents an analytical and simulation framework for assessing the optimal levels, and welfare effects, of alcohol taxes and drunk driver penalties, accounting for both externalities and how policies interact with the broader fiscal system. Under plausible parameter values and recycling possibilities, the fiscal component of the optimal alcohol tax may be as large, or larger, than the externality-correcting component. Therefore, fiscal considerations can significantly strengthen the case for higher alcohol taxes. They also raise the welfare gains from alcohol taxes relative to those from drunk driver penalties, and they warrant differential taxation of individual beverages on an alcohol equivalent basis.","[West, Sarah E.] Macalester Coll, St Paul, MN USA",Macalester College,,parry@rff.org; wests@macalester.edu; ramanan@rff.org,"Laxminarayan, Ramanan/ABD-5050-2021","West, Sarah/0000-0002-1937-3881",,,,,72,17,17,0,14,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The partially time-varying character of our multilateral resistance variables overcomes the bias present in earlier studies that solely rely on country or country pair fixed effects. Applying the augmented gravity equation to the process of European Union (EU) integration during the 1990s, we find robust evidence that the Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with the Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) have substantially increased intra-group trade, in the case of the Czech and Slovak Republic and Slovenia at the expense of the Rest of the World (ROW). Since decreasing multilateral trade resistance negatively influences a country's bilateral imports but may be positively correlated with a bilateral FTA, earlier East-West studies, which ignored the relative price term's time-varying character, tend to be downward biased. Indeed, our results indicate that once we correct for the omitted variable bias, the FTAs with the CEECs created 7 to 20% more new trade compared with the scenario where only time-invariant country pair effects were included.","[Spies, Julia] Inst Appl Econ Res IAW, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Marques, Helena] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; University of Manchester,"Spies, J (通讯作者)，Inst Appl Econ Res IAW, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany.",jspies@uni-hohenheim.de,"Marques, Helena/A-8235-2008","Marques, Helena/0000-0002-9257-7848",,,,,38,15,16,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

In this study, we provide empirical evidence on complete pass-through in export prices in Turkey using aggregate data on the manufacturing sector. Our data do not however support complete pass-through in import prices in Turkey. This contradicts with the findings of the existent literature, which typically concludes that the degree of pass-through in import prices is higher than the one of export prices. This can be interpreted as a result of competition between import and import substituting industries where importers fall short of competing successfully with import substituting sectors. Although Turkish importers can be responsive to exchange rate changes to a certain degree in the short-run, in the long-run, they seem to lose their market power perhaps as a result of swift competition. A complete exchange rate pass-through to export prices in Turkey implies that the Turkish manufacturing export sector has the competitive strength to transmit exchange rate movements into their prices.","[Yazgan, M.

Under revenue-sharing, each team member receives an equal share of team Output; under leader-determined shares, a team leader has the power to implement her own allocation. Both arrangements are vulnerable to opportunistic incentives: under revenue-sharing team members have an incentive to free ride, while under leader-determined shares leaders have an incentive to seize team output. We find that most leaders forego the temptation to appropriate team output and manage to curtail free riding. As a result, compared to revenue-sharing, the presence of a team leader results in a significant improvement in team performance. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We find that the intensity of IIT increases with the reduction of trade barriers. This is expected as greater competition from imports leads individual plants in the domestic industry to specialize in the manufacturing of unique varieties. The analysis suggests that horizontal (market seeking) multinational activities in the domestic industries exert a negative influence on IIT. This is consistent with the view that horizontal multinationals displace exports to the host country. At the same time, our results indicate that IIT will be stimulated to the extent that the entry of multinationals induces intra-industry specialization. We also analyse the role of product differentiation and plant level scale economies in determining IIT.","Indira Gandhi Inst Dev Res, Bombay 400065, Maharashtra, India",,"Veeramani, C (通讯作者)，Indira Gandhi Inst Dev Res, Gen AK Vaidya Marg, Bombay 400065, Maharashtra, India.",veeramani@igidr.ac.in,,,,,,,29,7,7,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The method consists of two steps. First, areas that influence sustainability level of the budding (e.g. building architecture, design, in-built materials) are identified. For each area, several elements and corresponding indicators are determined. Depending on their nature, the indicators are expressed either in quantitative or qualitative terms. The impact areas and their corresponding elements influence all three aspects of sustainability. In the second step, the indicators are aggregated according to their influence on individual sustainability aspects. Special attention is placed to the determination of weights assigned to the indicators in order to make the assessment method relevant in the local context. Initially, the consensus-based method within the research team was used as a technique for aggregated indicators' weighting. Later, the open discourses among the developers and stakeholders, as well as surveys, were employed to determine the aggregated indicators' weights. The proposed method is applied to a selected sample budding, and the analysis of the results is carried out. The results obtained show that the completeness and reliability of the input data is crucial for the reliability of the proposed assessment method. Subjectivity in evaluators' judgments required to score some indicators needs to be reduced by introducing adequate training of the assessors. The feedback from the potential users shows that the method has a potential for wider future implementation in practice.","[Zavrl, Marjana Sijanec] Bldg & Civil Engn Inst ZRMK, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Zarnic, Roko; Selih, Jana] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Civil & Geodet Engn, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Zavrl, MS (通讯作者)，Bldg & Civil Engn Inst ZRMK, Dimiceva 12, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",marjana.sijanec@gi-zrmk.si; roko.zarnic@fgg.uni-lj.si; jana.selih@fgg.uni-lj.si,,,,,,,28,47,49,1,17,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Five different wage measures are compared: the standard hourly wage rate; hourly wage earnings including overtime and bonus pay; the effective wage, which takes into account unpaid overtime; and monthly earnings, with and without additional pay. None of the hourly wage measures exhibits cyclicality except for the group of salaried workers with unpaid overtime. Their effective wages show a strongly procyclical reaction to changes in unemployment. Despite acyclical wage rates, salaried workers without unpaid overtime experienced procyclical earnings movements if they had income from extra pay. Monthly earnings were also procyclical for hourly paid workers with overtime pay. These findings suggest that cyclical earnings movements are generated by variable pay components, such as bonuses and overtime pay, and by flexible working hours. The degree of earnings procyclicality revealed for the German labor market is comparable to the United States. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This disconnection between the father's and the mother's schedules may be undesired as such, and may represent an additional component in the overall cost of children as traditionally considered. This article analyzes the impact of children on their parents' schedules, using the French time use survey data (INSEE 1998-1999). The comparison of female and male schedules makes it possible to measure the leisure synchronization of dual-earner couples. We show that the presence of children within a household significantly reduces joint leisure time, and the more so if they are young. Parental schedule adjustments are severely limited by work constraints. The parents' difficulties in coordinating their schedules in order to spend time together is expressed as a deprivation of leisure which is larger for joint than for individual time. Finally, for couples with children, greater housework synchronization does not free up enough time to maintain joint leisure time.","[Pailhe, A.; Solaz, A.] INED, Paris, France; [Barnet-Verzat, C.] Univ Nantes, LEN CEBS, Nantes 3, France",Nantes Universite,"Pailhé, A (通讯作者)，INED, Paris, France.",ariane.pailhe@ined.fr,"Pailhe, Ariane/Q-1772-2016",,,,,,32,17,20,1,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

This paper examines whether male international migration provides a leeway for women to enter the labour market and/or to increase their labour supply. In line with previous studies, we find a decrease in wage work particularly in urban areas. However, women living in rural areas and affected by migration are much more likely to be employed in non-wage activities (i.e. unpaid family work) and subsistence work compared to women in non-migrant households. Furthermore, we find evidence that this labour supply response is driven by the household's need to replace the migrant's labour rather than by a loosening of a financing constraint on family enterprises made possible by the flow of remittances.

These individuals are some of the most disadvantaged in society due to their multiple capability restrictions. Current political rhetoric focused on reducing the number of individuals out of the labour force to improve their living standards may offer a means of improving the lives of these most disadvantaged individuals. Indeed, of those in Freedom poverty, 80% are not in employment. But these individuals also have poor health and/or a poor education and these capability limitations may act as barriers to their labour force participation. Indeed, 49% of individuals in freedom poverty who were out of the labour force cited ill health as the reason for this (39% cited their own ill health, and 10% cited another's ill health). Not only will these individual's ill health act as a barrier to their engaging in the labour force, but ill health will also contribute to reduced quality of life. Political promises to improve the lives of citizens should not focus narrowly upon increasing labour force participation rates, but should take a holistic view of the lives of individuals taking note in particular of how health may be restraining their quality of life.

Although Indonesia is underbanked, most commercial banks have been unresponsive to unmet effective demand. The behavior of banks has been in their own short-term best interests, primarily because of the unintended consequences of Indonesia's financial sector reregulation after the East Asian crisis and contradictory monetary policies, which have produced a prudentially sound but inefficient, narrow, and homogenized banking oligopoly. Indonesia should not respond to financial exclusion by artificially pumping out and administratively allocating more credit. Instead, it should promulgate smart regulation so that banks maintain their sound risk management without pursuing noncompetitive and noninclusive business practices.","[Rosengard, Jay K.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Prasetyantoko, A.] Atma Jaya Catholic Univ, Jakarta, Indonesia",Harvard University; University Katolik Indonesia Atma Jaya,"Rosengard, JK (通讯作者)，Harvard Kennedy Sch, 79 John F Kennedy St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jay_rosengard@harvard.edu,,,,,,,30,38,40,1,59,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1832-8105,1748-3131,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

The existing literature identifies optimal investment size and timing without the possibility of debt financing, as well as the effect of debt financing on investment timing without the option to choose investment size. This paper contributes to the literature by identifying the optimal size, optimal timing and optimal financing for an investment when the firm controls all three decisions (as it usually does in practice). The investment size and investment :rigger are generally positively related: when investment is delayed (accelerated) it is larger (smaller) in size, thus the overall effect on investment is ambiguous. However, when tax rate or bankruptcy cost is increased, the trigger rises and size falls, hence the effect on investment is unambiguously negative. The effect of debt financing on investment depends on the amount of debt used; with the optimal amount of debt, investment is delayed relative to the no-debt case, and this delay can be economically significant; however, the investment, when eventually made, will be larger in size. Overall, it is not appropriate to ignore either the firm's ability to choose investment size or its option to use debt financing, when modeling the investment decision. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The model allows analyzing the macroeconomic costs in terms of GDP, the change in employment, as well as the impacts on production of specific energy-intensive sectors. Various 2020 climate scenarios are evaluated depending on the GHG mitigation pledges. We find that the cost for the developed countries is around 0.5% of GDP in 2020 for the more ambitious pledges, whereas the GDP effects are more heterogeneous across developing countries and Russia, reflecting the different pledges and the assumptions in the reference scenario across these countries. Further, the article explores whether there is a form of double dividend in the EU when the revenues from auctioning or taxation of GHG emissions are used to reduce the social security contributions of employees. We conclude that GDP and employment perform better compared to the free allocation of permits when more sectors are subject to auctioning or GHG taxes and the additional government revenues are used to reduce the cost of labour.

The concept of sustainable development has become widespread amongst government agencies, politicians, corporations and other organizations throughout the world. By the end of 2007, around 129,031 organizations worldwide have implemented environmental management systems (EMS) and certified it according to ISO 14001. About 100 of them are located in Latvia and 40 of them are construction companies. There is a lack of national evaluations of ISO 14001 in many countries, but in many countries no complete lists of the national certified / registered sites exist at all. In Latvia a list of ISO 14001 sites has been complied and regularly updated by the Latvian association for Quality. In spite of the fact that in Latvia increase using of ideas of ecological manufacture and environmental management, nevertheless there has been no any serious scientific study of Latvian experience of ISO 14001. The purpose of this study is to describe experiences and effects of EMS in construction companies, based on study conducted for the construction industry in Latvia. The results show that ISO 14001 often leads to reduced environmental impact, especially in the area of waste. A strong driving force behind implementation is the expected improvement of the organizations' images. Legal compliance tends to be difficult to implement, but on the other hand, it works well in daily practice. To develop EMS into Sustainability Management Systems, the two most important challenges are to improve the coordination between the EMS and the organizations' strategies and to improve learning process and direct participation of all employees.","[Tambovceva, Tatjana; Geipele, Ineta] Riga Tech Univ, Fac Engn Econ & Management, LV-1048 Riga, Latvia",Riga Technical University,"Tambovceva, T (通讯作者)，Riga Tech Univ, Fac Engn Econ & Management, Mezha St 1-7-213, LV-1048 Riga, Latvia.",tatjana.tambovceva@rtu.lv; ineta.geipele@rtu.lv,"Gerhards, Guntis/D-5197-2009; Geipele, Ineta/D-5489-2013; Tambovceva, Tatjana/G-2828-2010","Tambovceva, Tatjana/0000-0002-9516-1530; Geipele, Ineta/0000-0002-2963-087X",,,,,37,13,13,0,22,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-8619,,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

I show that coattail voting is the outcome of the optimal reelection scheme adopted by a representative voter to motivate politicians' efforts in a retrospective voting environment. I assume that an office-motivated politician (executive or member of congress) prefers her counterpart to be affiliated with the same political party. This correlation of incentives leads the voter to adopt a joint performance evaluation rule, which is conditioned on the politicians belonging to the same party or to different parties. Two-sided coattail effects then arise. On the one hand, an executive's success props up, while failure drags down, her partisan ally in the congressional election, which implies a presidential coattail effect. On the other hand, the executive's reelection itself is affected by a congress member's performance, which results in a reverse coattail effect. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We explore the way that finance influences the distribution effects of inflation in the demand-side of a money/credit-using economy; we suggest a new Phillips curve that encapsulates the impact of financial commitments on wage and profit claims. We argue that high debt and cash payment commitments are likely to be associated with a positive demand-side effect of inflation on the rate of employment; and that they might be conducive to a negative supply-side effect of employment on the inflation rate.","[Argitis, Georgios] Univ Athens, Dept Econ, Athens 10559, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,"Argitis, G (通讯作者)，Univ Athens, Dept Econ, 8 Pesmatzoglou St, Athens 10559, Greece.",gargeitis@econ.uoa.gr,"Dafermos, Yannis/U-3944-2019","Dafermos, Yannis/0000-0002-8127-6249",,,,,96,3,4,1,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Our empirical approach is motivated by an extension to the Melitz (2003) model of heterogeneous firms in which exporters are subject to a one-time sunk cost and also a per-period fixed cost. With imperfect information a firm may enter export markets but shortly exit when it learns its per-period fixed costs. We apply this insight to disaggregated export data and confirm that indeed most export relationships are very short lived. We then show that the survival issue is a significant factor in explaining differences in long run export performance. We find that developing countries would experience significantly higher export growth if they were able to improve their performance with respect to the two key components of the intensive margin: survival and deepening.

Second, the conditional volatility functions reveal an asymmetric and heteroskedastic behavior which is dramatically different between carbon spot and futures logreturns. The results for spot prices are also robust to subsamples' decomposition. Third, we show in an out-of-sample forecasting exercise that nonparametric modeling allows reducing the prediction error by almost 15% compared to linear AR models. This latter result is confirmed by the Diebold-Mariano pairwise test statistic. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, there is little evidence about how important each component of these programs is towards achieving these outcomes. This paper tests the importance of conditionality on one specific outcome related to human capital formation, school enrollment, using data collected during the evaluation of Mexico's PROGRESA program. We exploit the fact that some beneficiaries who received transfers did not receive the forms needed to monitor the attendance of their children at school. We use a variety of techniques, including nearest neighbor matching and household fixed effects regressions, to show that the absence of these forms reduced the likelihood that children attended school with this effect most pronounced when children are transitioning to lower secondary school. We provide substantial evidence that these findings are not driven by unobservable characteristics of households or localities. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The switching right is granted a finite number of times per year, i.e. it is American style with multiple exercise possibilities. In consequence, the pricing and the risk management is based on the switching strategy which maximizes the value of the guarantee put-option. We analyze the optimal stopping problem in the case of one switching right within different model classes and compare the exact price with the lower price bound implied by the optimal deterministic switching time. We show that, within the class of log-price processes with independent increments, the stopping problem is solved by a deterministic stopping time if (and only if) the price process is in addition continuous. Thus, in a sense, the Black and Scholes model is the only (meaningful) pricing model where the lower price bound gives the exact price. It turns out that even moderate deviations from the Black and Scholes model assumptions give a lower price bound which is really below the exact price. This is illustrated by means of a stylized stochastic volatility model setup. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A priori, one would expect to find evidence in favor of an intertemporally balanced budget, or fiscal sustainability, for these states, especially those characterized by a relatively high degree of fiscal stringency. We test this hypothesis for a panel of 47 state local government units (1961-2006) using four budget balance definitions and several subsamples defined based on regional classifications, or presence of certain balanced budget requirements (BBRs). Our results, obtained from panel estimation techniques that allow for general forms of serial and cross-sectional dependence, suggest that a sufficient condition for strong sustainability is consistently satisfied for the full sample and all subsamples in relation to balances that include special funds and/or federal grants. However, we find evidence consistent with the weak version of sustainability for the full sample and some regional subsamples (particularly Far West dominated by California) in at least one of the two balances that exclude these items. Finally, the BBRs seem to matter only in relation to the sustainability of the more narrowly defined balances. We discuss the implications of these findings for the role of fiscal rules and federal grant policies. (C) 2011 Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We find significant evidence that asset price volatility increases the variability of government revenue. A 1% increase in equity price volatility increases government revenue variability by 0.37-0.44%. An increase in residential property price volatility increases revenue volatility by about 0.15-0.22%, whereas this effect diminishes to 0.11% in case of commercial property price. This evidence reflects the automatic increase of government revenue variability due to asset price movements and supports arguments in favour of adjusting fiscal variables for both business cycle and asset price changes.

Using a new data set that characterizes central bank monetary policy committees (MPCs) in more than 30 countries from 1960 through 2006, we find a U-shaped relationship between MPC size and inflation; our results suggest that the lowest level of inflation is reached at MPCs with an intermediate size of about five to nine members. Similar results are obtained for inflation variability. Other MPC characteristics also matter for monetary policy outcomes, though to a smaller degree.

Workers are heterogeneous (autonomous or non-autonomous) and according to their preferences they choose between these two organizational forms. In addition, preferences evolve through intergenerational transmission mechanisms. This setting allows for a reciprocal interplay between the evolution of workers' autonomy and the industrialization process that generates multiple development paths. Thus, the initial degree of autonomy within the workforce may have long-run implications for the level of industrialization. Finally, taking into account a complementarity between autonomy and incentives to invest in human capital, we conclude to a non-monotonic impact of workers' autonomy on the growth process.

As a consequence of the recent crisis, a large fraction of the Dutch pension funds had to submit restoration plans for the recovery of their buffers. Such plans will have to rely primarily on a mix of reduced benefit indexation and increased pension contributions. Hence, a discussion has emerged whether indexation should be differentiated across the various groups of participants in a pension fund. We investigate this issue numerically, developing an applied many-generation small open-economy OLG model with heterogeneous agents. The pension system consists of a first-pillar PAYG component and a second pillar with a pension fund. In our stochastic simulations, we hit the economy with a variety of unexpected demographic, economic and financial shocks. We compare uniform indexation of pension rights across all fund participants with alternatives such as status-contingent indexation in which pensions are protected against price inflation. While the aggregate welfare consequences are small, group-specific consequences are more substantial with the workers and future born losing and retirees benefitting from a shift away from uniform indexation. The exception is a scheme which links indexation directly to the fund's asset performance. Under this scheme the retired benefit without other groups losing. The welfare effects are primarily the result of systematic welfare redistributions rather than of shifts in the benefits of risk sharing. Contribution rates always have to rise substantially from their initial levels to maintain the system's sustainability. An increase in the retirement age that leaves existing pension rights untouched does little to avoid this rise with its adverse labour market consequences.","[Beetsma, Roel M. W.

In present-value terms, men lose an average of 1.4 years of predisplacement earnings if displaced in mass-layoff events that occur when the national unemployment rate is below 6 percent. They lose a staggering 2.8 years of predisplacement earnings if displaced when the unemployment rate exceeds 8 percent. These results reflect discounting at a 5 percent annual rate over 20 years after displacement. We also document large cyclical movements in the incidence of job loss and job displacement and present evidence on how worker anxieties about job loss, wage cuts, and job opportunities respond to contemporaneous economic conditions. Finally, we confront leading models of unemployment fluctuations with evidence on the present-value earnings losses associated with job displacement. The 1994 model of Dale Mortensen and Christopher Pissarides, extended to include search on the job, generates present-value losses that are only one-fourth as large as observed losses. Moreover, present-value losses in the model vary little with aggregate conditions at the time of displacement, unlike the pattern in the data.","[Davis, Steven J.] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Von Wachter, Till] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",University of Chicago; Columbia University,"Davis, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,,,NIA NIH HHS [R01 AG032758] Funding Source: Medline,NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,85,224,296,1,33,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

To that end, first, we synthesize the commonly used concepts and corresponding measures in three classes, namely, movement, temporal dependence and equalization of incomes. Second, since the unit of analysis is country, we reformulate the Inability indicators to take into account the countries sizes. Third, in the empirical approach, we compare income mobility in the SEE (South-Eastern Europe) region and in the EU (European Union) countries over the 1990-2009 time period. The results suggest that, in the long-term, income mobility is greater in the SEE than in the EU. However, the opposite holds in the last decade. Moreover, income mobility is mostly a divergent process in the SEE region, whereas the EU experienced a convergent mobility. In addition, unlike the EU, income mobility has disequalized longer-term incomes in the SEE region throughout the period of study Accordingly, these results can serve as a basis for decision-making in the field of regional development policies that are used in the process of European integration.","[El Ouardighi, Jalal] Univ Strasbourg, Bur Econ Theor & Appl, Pole Europeen Gest & Econ, F-67085 Strasbourg, France; [Somun-Kapetanovic, Rabija] Fac Econ Sarajevo, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia & Herceg",Universite de Lorraine; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; University of Sarajevo,"El Ouardighi, J (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, Bur Econ Theor & Appl, Pole Europeen Gest & Econ, 61 Ave Foret Noire, F-67085 Strasbourg, France.",jalal@unistra.fr; rabija.somun@efsa.unsa.ba,,,,,,,29,1,1,0,4,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIVERSITY PULA,PULA,"PRERADOVICEVA 1-1, PULA, 52 100, CROATIA",1331-677X,,,EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

If governments allow automatic fiscal stabilizers to work fully in a downswing but fail to resist the temptation to spend cyclical revenue increases during an upswing, the stabilizers may lead to bias toward budget positions. This paper assesses to what extent some items of the Croatian central government budget operate to smooth the business cycle. For disentangling automatic stabilizers from discretionary measures, this research relies on the European Commission methodology. Results show that the structural budget balance was on average 1.74% of GDP in deficit in the period between 1995 and 2009. Automatic stabilisation in Croatia is relatively weak and supplemented by discretionary measures, which led to destabilizing the economic activity in a pro-cyclical manner in Croatia in several observed periods.","Juraj Dobrila Univ, Dept Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula 52100, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Gnip, AG (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ, Dept Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Preradoviceva 1, Pula 52100, Croatia.",agrdovic@efpu.hr,,,,,,,53,5,5,0,6,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIVERSITY PULA,PULA,"PRERADOVICEVA 1-1, PULA, 52 100, CROATIA",1331-677X,,,EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Legal unbundling means in our model that a downstream firm owns the upstream firm, but this upstream firm is legally independent and maximizes its own upstream profits. We allow for non-tariff discrimination by the upstream firm and show that under quite general conditions legal unbundling never yields lower quantities in the downstream market than ownership separation and integration. Therefore, typically, consumer surplus will be largest under legal unbundling. Outcomes under legal unbundling are still advantageous when we allow for discriminatory capacity investments, investments into marginal cost reduction and investments into network reliability. If access prices are unregulated, however, legal unbundling may be quite undesirable. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It describes an endogenous economic logic that is based on the institutional characteristics of capitalist firms in the non-financial sector, especially the flexibility of the inputs that they can call upon and of the size of the market that they can supply. This perspective naturally generates a realistic theoretical account not only of the source of economic growth, but also of the evolution of market structure, the forces that produce divergence in, for example, profit rates, a starting point for explaining price-setting and a language for describing firms' economic power. It draws on previous traditions, especially those based on the works of Marx and Schumpeter, but differs from them in important respects.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London W2 1PG, England",Imperial College London,"Joffe, M (通讯作者)，Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, St Marys Campus,Norfolk Pl, London W2 1PG, England.",m.joffe@imperial.ac.uk,,,,,,,92,5,6,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Different to previous perspectives, we target the issues of cointegrating relationships, causalities, and market efficiency based on different market states under different maturities of oil futures. In our empirical analysis, except for market efficiency, long-run cointegrating relationships and causalities between spot and futures oil prices have significant differentials among futures maturities and the performances of spot oil markets. Furthermore, the response of spot prices to shocks in 1-month futures oil prices is much steeper in high spot prices than in low spot prices. This phenomenon is consistent with the prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979), in that the value function is generally steeper for losses than for gains. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

While state bailouts were politically sensitive, policy-makers had little alternative but to supply funds to financial institutions that were viewed as 'too big to fail', or TBTF. In this paper, I review the history of, and the rationale for, the TBTF policy. I argue that, from a policy perspective, the most important costs of the TBTF problem are incurred ex ante, in the form of distorted incentives that arise as a consequence of distortions to the capital markets, and to the choice of banks' scale and scope. I argue that it is impossible credibly to withdraw the TBTF policy, and, hence, that it should be managed so as to minimize the costs of these distortions. In this context, I discuss the role of policy in institutional design, in the restriction of bank scope, and in designing appropriate capital regulations.","[Morrison, Alan D.] Said Business Sch, Oxford, England; [Morrison, Alan D.] Univ Oxford Merton Coll, Oxford OX1 4JD, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Morrison, AD (通讯作者)，Said Business Sch, Oxford, England.",alan.morrison@sbs.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,70,21,23,0,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Only the latter share mechanisms of competitive selection of the fittest analogous to those envisaged by the standard neoclassical model in economics. The biological counterparts of protectionism, subsidies and conflicts enable complex organisms to exit from long periods of stasis and to increase their capacity to adapt efficiently to the environment. Because of their interlocking complementarities, most institutions share the laws governing the structure and change of complex organisms. We concentrate on the complementarities between technology and property rights and consider historical cases in which organisational stasis has been overcome by mechanisms different from (and sometimes acting in spite of) competitive pressure. The evolution of institutions cannot be taken for granted; but even when institutions seem frozen forever by their interlocking complementarities, their potential for change can be discovered by analysis of those interactions.","[Pagano, Ugo] Univ Siena, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Pagano, Ugo] Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary",University of Siena; Central European University,"Pagano, U (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, Via Laterina 8, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",Pagano@unisi.it,,"Pagano, Ugo/0000-0002-9917-5091",,,,,50,23,25,2,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,,,J I ECON,J.

The supply side shock is modeled as a reduction in total factor productivity, whereas the demand side shock is caused by a drop in exports. The model builds upon the small one-sector two-good open economy framework described in Turnovsky (2000, chapter 11.3). In contrast to this standard framework, in which Walrasian labor markets are assumed, search unemployment and wage bargaining are introduced, and unemployment results from time consuming and costly matching of vacancies with searching agents. Using a plausible calibration of the model, the dynamic adjustments of unemployment, output, and other economic key variables are analyzed. We find that a negative export shock primarily has effects on consumption and welfare, but not on unemployment and output, whereas the supply side shock leads to considerable responses of unemployment, output, consumption and welfare. If both shocks together hit the economy, the changes in consumption and welfare almost double. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The Stolper Samuelson effect is incorporated into an intra-industry trade liberalization (intra-ITL) hypothesis where skilled labor opposes protectionism in all countries engaged in intra-industry trade because skilled workers gain at the expense of unskilled workers from multilateral trade liberalization within the skill-intensive sector. We examine empirical evidence on whether skilled individuals are more supportive of trade liberalization than unskilled individuals across 31 countries with different levels of intra-industry trade and skill endowments. We find that the extent to which countries engage in intra-industry trade in high-tech commodities is strongly linked with the intensity of opposition to protection by skilled labor. Regression results strongly support our hypothesis that skilled workers, almost everywhere, are more likely to support free trade.","[Benarroch, Michael] Univ Winnipeg, Fac Business & Econ, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada; [Beaulieu, Eugene; Gaisford, James D.] Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",University of Winnipeg; University of Calgary,"Beaulieu, E (通讯作者)，Univ Winnipeg, Fac Business & Econ, 515 Portage Ave, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada.",beaulieu@ucalgary.ca; m.benarroch@uwinnipeg.ca; gaisford@ucalgary.ca,,,,,,,20,12,16,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We distinguish between exit by closing down activity and exit by merger or acquisition (M&A). Using a large sample of Dutch manufacturing firms, we explore the relationship between firm exit, age and innovative capabilities, in high and low innovation intensive industries. We find that for entrepreneurial firms, innovation may go some way towards compensating for the liability of newness, but also makes them more attractive M&A targets. More specifically, entrepreneurial firms in high-tech industries do not seem to improve their chances of survival by innovating; when technological change is rapid, innovation, especially in products, is necessary to participate in the innovation race in an industry, but is not sufficient to guarantee survival. In contrast, in low-tech industries, process innovation is a critical condition for the survival of entrepreneurial firms. In this context, entrepreneurial firms that are able to bring new product ideas, introducing 'exceptional' variations into a stable environment, are most likely to exit by M&A, thereby transferring their knowledge and capabilities to the incumbent firms.","[Marsili, Orietta] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Cefis, Elena] Univ Bergamo, Dep Econ, I-24127 Bergamo, Italy; [Cefis, Elena] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Sch Econ, NL-3511 BG Utrecht, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; University of Bergamo; Utrecht University,"Marsili, O (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Burg Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands.",elena.cefis@unibg.it; omarsili@rsm.nl,"Cefis, Elena/AAJ-3162-2020","Cefis, Elena/0000-0001-9960-4354; Marsili, Orietta/0000-0002-4879-6701",,,,,46,68,79,1,51,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

This gives rise to incentives for unsound state fiscal policy. We test whether states with softer budget constraints have higher debts and deficits, receive more bailout funds, spend funds less efficiently, and are more likely to allocate funds to programs benefiting special interests. Exogenous variation in soft budget constraints across states and over time allows the identification of the effect of budget constraint softness on state fiscal policy. We take advantage of the fact that in Germany the states' political influence per state citizen is exogenous and varies because voting weights differ in the upper chamber of the German parliament. The stronger the political influence per state citizen, the softer the budget constraint. We show that states with softer budget constraint have higher deficits and debts, and receive more bailout funds. Further, overrepresented states are less efficient in spending public funds and are more prone to respond to rent seeking by interest groups.","[Fink, Alexander; Stratmann, Thomas] George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Fink, A (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",afink2@gmu.edu; tstratma@gmu.edu,,,,,,,46,16,18,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,AUG,2011,64.0,3,,,,,366,395,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2011.00511.x,0.0,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,794BD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000292868300004,0

A comparison between two alternatives needs a standard and ultimately, truth is the standard of science. Comparatism follows the objectivist tradition. The most significant deviation from major ideas in the objectivist school is proposing a less dominating role for falsification. The comparatism perspective is then applied to some controversies of methodology in economics. Comparatism is claimed to be a descriptive model for much of science and to be a normative model for constructive guidance of scientific inquiry. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Understanding these linkages can make MFI evaluation more accurate and, further, can help to locate microfinance in the broader picture of economic development. We collect data on 373 MFIs and merge it with country-level economic and institutional data. Evidence arises for complementarity between MFI performance and the broader economy. For example, MFIs are more likely to cover costs when growth is stronger; and MFIs in financially deeper economies have lower default and operating costs, and charge lower interest rates. There is also evidence suggestive of substitutability or rivalry. For example, more manufacturing and higher workforce participation are associated with slower growth in MFI outreach. Overall, the country context appears to be an important determinant of MFI performance; MFI performance should be handicapped for the environment in which it was achieved. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

New estimates of job satisfaction show the critical role played by unmeasured worker heterogeneity. They reveal that flexible contracts are a strong negative determinant of satisfaction with job security but are often a positive determinant of other dimensions of job satisfaction. As a consequence, flexible contracts have either a weak negative influence or no influence on overall job satisfaction. Moreover, flexible contracts generally have no impact on overall life satisfaction of the employed. These results appear broadly consistent with the presence of equalizing differences.","[Green, Colin P.] Univ Lancaster, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YT, England; [Heywood, John S.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",Lancaster University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Green, CP (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YT, England.",c.p.green@lancaster.ac.uk; heywood@uwm.edu,"Green, Colin P/K-3966-2012","Green, Colin/0000-0001-6156-4676",,,,,59,42,45,1,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

(ii) Stiffer competition among commercial banks implies that loan rates correlate more tightly with the policy rate. In my model, the degree of monopolistic competition in the banking sector has a sizeable impact on the pass-through of changes in the policy rate.

Subsidy benefits depend partially on job duration, with higher subsidy rates above certain job-duration thresholds. I estimate the relationship between a firm's WOTC/WtW participation and its eligible workers' job durations. Using unique Wisconsin administrative data, I find that workers' subsidy rates (determined by hours worked) have the expected relationship to participation: Firms with a larger fraction of workers exceeding the programs' job-duration thresholds are more likely to claim the WOTC/WtW. I also find no evidence that firms systematically modify the job duration of their workers to maximize subsidy payments.","Univ Florida, Dept Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Hamersma, S (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Dept Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",sarah.hamersma@cba.ufl.edu,,,,,,,17,10,14,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0095-2583,,,ECON INQ,Econ.

Does this impact investment portfolio decision-making, in particular, optimal asset allocation between value and growth strategies over various investment horizons? This paper adopts a new approach to address these questions by examining portfolio allocation between value and growth stocks over various investment horizons. This new approach is based on wavelet analysis, which decomposes the returns of a particular investment strategy across multiple investment horizons. The key empirical results show that the success of pursuing the value strategy (short-selling growth stocks and going long on value stocks) is impacted by the approach used to classify value and growth stock returns. We explore two common alternatives: Fama-French versus Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500/Barra portfolios. The results using Fama-French portfolios show that as the investment horizon increases, the optimal mean allocation of investors tilts heavily away from growth stocks, particularly for lower and moderate levels of risk aversion. Interestingly, for S&P 500/Barra portfolios the allocation weights between value and growth do not vary much. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Employees of the firm are taken to form their own distinct reference group. It is shown that screening workers with equal ability according to their social preferences is then not possible within the firm. In consequence, the firm distorts production by its employees with low ability, or it excludes workers with low ability and a high propensity for social comparisons. This highlights that firms can use both contractual and organizational measures to reduce the costs arising from workers' social preferences. Further, information on workers' social preferences reduces the latter's impact on employment contracts without changing it qualitatively.","[von Siemens, Ferdinand A.] CESifo, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [von Siemens, Ferdinand A.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Econ, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"von Siemens, FA (通讯作者)，CESifo, Roetersstr 11, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",f.a.vonsiemens@uva.nl,,,,,,,36,21,21,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

In the process, they have provided some of the most credible observational evidence in support of the hypothesis. The magnitude of the impacts is generally large.

The significant economic unit is taken to be the household. Each household is made of two agents, positively sorted by wage, who engage in the non-cooperative home production of a household public good. This leads to an inefficient laissez-faire equilibrium. We consider three policy instruments, a tax rate on labour income, and two types of transfer to the household (cash versus in-kind). The in-kind transfer is one of the inputs in the home production process. Since the pre-intervention equilibrium is inefficient, there is a general consensus among the agents that some corrective taxation is needed; however, those at bottom of the income distribution, who prefer a redistributive (as opposed to corrective) policy, favour a combination of high taxes and cash transfers, while those at the top would rather have low taxes and in-kind provision. Assuming, as seems plausible according to the empirical evidence, that political participation and income are positively correlated, we find that the decisive agent, i.e. the one whose preferred policy wins at the political equilibrium, has income above the mean.

The results show that, overall, the monetary policy variables respond to economic growth and the inflation rate, but the magnitudes of the responses are much weaker than those observed in market economies. Money supply responded actively to both the inflation rate and the real output and had certain effects on the future inflation rates and real output. The official interest rates, on the other hand, responded passively to the inflation rate and did not respond to the real output.

Growth is knowledge-driven and the optimal timing of technology switching is determined by welfare maximization. The optimal path exhibits discrete jumps in endogenous variables: technology switching implies sudden reductions in consumption and output, an increase in the growth rate, and instantaneous adjustments in saving rates. Due to the positive growth effect, it is optimal to implement the new technology when its current consumption benefits are substantially lower than those generated by old technologies.","Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Econ Res, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Valente, S (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Econ Res, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",svalente@ethz.ch,,,,,,,31,15,15,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Market incompleteness in our framework has two dimensions. First, in the Bewley tradition, only a limited set of instruments for consumption smoothing is available. Second, entrepreneurs' capital rental is subject to collateral constraints. As is well known, it is harder to self-insure against more persistent shocks, and the welfare cost of missing consumption insurance increases with shock persistence. On the other hand, with collateral constraints, an increase in shock persistence leads to better allocation of production factors through entrepreneurs' self-financing, and the welfare cost of imperfect capital rental markets decreases with shock persistence. The overall welfare cost of market incompleteness can be increasing, decreasing, or even non-monotone in shock persistence, depending on the relative strengths of its two components the cost of missing insurance and the cost of imperfect capital markets.

Moreover, it has been shown that a shift in capital structure towards more debt results in a reduction of R&D investments. This article complements this literature by compartmentalising R&D activities into its components, 'R' and 'D'. In particular, we distinguish research from development as these activities not only differ in their nature but also, to a large extent, take place sequentially. Our results show that 'R' investment is more sensitive to a firms' operating liquidity than 'D' indicating that firms have to rely even more on internal funds for financing their research compared with development activities.

This paper explores in a general equilibrium framework the sectoral and welfare implications of a unilateral domestic GHG control policy combined with a BTA scheme. Using the Canadian economy as an illustration, we assess the extent to which BIAS achieve their objectives and analyze the impacts of different methods of recycling the BTA proceeds to support domestic industries. Our simulation results suggest that imposing BTAs on the imports of non-fossil and energy-intensive products reduces or removes completely the negative competitiveness impacts that domestic industries suffer from. The use of the proceeds of the BTAs to support domestic energy-intensive industries improves their competitiveness and, more importantly, in some cases, overprotects them, as it allows them to even increase their output in comparison to the benchmark without emissions control. Our results also shed light on the existence of heterogeneity in the composition of energy-intensive industries as far as the recycling method of the BTA proceeds is concerned. Energy-intensive industries that are more oriented toward the domestic market are better off with the recycling of the BTA proceeds towards gross output than towards exports alone. Finally, abstracting from the environmental benefits of reduced emissions, we find that a BTA entails a higher welfare cost to households. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Absent limited commitment, the increase in financial linkages should improve risk-sharing opportunities and foster consumption smoothing. However the data show that for several countries financial liberalization leads to enhanced consumption volatility. This fact can be rationalized using a small open economy model where foreign lending to households is constrained by a borrowing limit motivated by limited enforcement. Borrowing is secured by collateral in the form of durable investment whose accumulation is subject to adjustment costs. In this economy an increase in the degree of capital account lib eralization increases consumption volatility (even relative to output volatility) as agents are unable to exploit risk-sharing opportunities. In presence of risk-averse agents an increase in financial integration reduces welfare.","[Faia, Ester] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Money & Macroecon, Kiel IfW, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Faia, E (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Money & Macroecon, Kiel IfW, House Finance,Grueneburgpl 1, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany.",faia@wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de,,,,,,,43,6,6,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

J,"Freitag, S",,,,"Freitag, Stephan",,,Adopting external currencies for trade growth in the Pacific,ASIAN-PACIFIC ECONOMIC LITERATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,UNION; MONEY; AREAS,"This article reviews the currency and trade experiences of the six Pacific states that issue their own currencies: Fiji, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu. At independence, these states were advised to adopt their own currencies by the colonial powers, the International Monetary Fund, and other international organisations. The former imperial countries dominated Pacific trade, but empirical data indicate that a large and increasing proportion of trade, now with emerging Asia, denominates its trade in US dollars. This article shows that the six Pacific states manage their currencies in relation to the US dollar. Optimal currency area theory suggests that independent Pacific states would gain substantially by adopting the US dollar in the place of their own currencies. Gravity-model estimations for all Pacific islands were used to test this hypothesis. The results suggest that replacing their own currencies with an external currency, such as the US dollar, would substantially stimulate the independent Pacific states' trade.","Univ Leipzig, Dept Econ & Business Adm, Leipzig, Germany",Leipzig University,"Freitag, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leipzig, Dept Econ & Business Adm, Leipzig, Germany.",,,,,,,,50,3,3,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0818-9935,,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

Such migration is likely to affect the world distribution of income both directly, through the mobility of people, and indirectly, as the prospect of migration affects the rate of return to education in both the sending and receiving economies. This migration pattern will therefore affect human capital accumulation and fertility decisions in both the sending and receiving economies. This paper analyzes these effects in a dynamic two country model of the world economy where agents in both countries make optimal fertility and human capital decisions. The implications of the analysis for the world distribution of income are derived in the light of recent empirical findings of the brain drain literature. The analysis shows that the current trend towards predominantly skilled emigration from poor to rich countries may in the long run increase inequality in the world distribution of income as relatively poor countries grow large in terms of population. In the short run however, it is possible for world inequality to fall due to rises in GDP per capita in large developing economies with sufficiently low skilled emigration rates.

The paper shows that the most promising models are the ones that induce fluctuations of TFP and the labor wedge. On the other hand, models of financial frictions that translate into a bond or capital wedge are not successful in explaining output drops in Latin America.

The results vary depending on the period, the region, and the type of industry considered. The GMM estimates suggest a significant ICT effect on growth during the 90s both in the US and in the EU. This effect for the EU was strong in the early 90s and weakened afterwards, as opposed to the US where it strengthened in the late 90s. The results of the pooled mean group estimator confirm that the long run growth contribution of ICT was significantly positive in the industries of both regions and over the entire period 1980-2000.

The recursive and rolling regression results suggest that the narrow money-demand function has remained largely stable irrespective of ongoing financial reforms in Indonesia since the late 1980s and/or financial crises in the late 1990s. The Quandt-Andrews breakpoint and the Hansen-Johansen stability tests results however suggest that the narrow money-demand relationship had a structural break in the early 1990s. This corresponds to a period of time when the banking and financial reforms in Indonesia took effect.

This paper attempts to fill this important gap in the literature. The paper begins with modifying the empirical predictions previously-derived from the tournament theory to the context of transition economies in which state ownership still plays a significant role in publicly-traded firms. Specifically, we test the following two hypotheses. First, the winner's prize will need to increase in order to prevent each contestant from lowering his/her effort level in the face of a larger contestant pool. Such an optimal response of the winner's prize to the size of the contestant pool is more evident for China's listed firms that are less controlled by the state. Second, the winner's prize will also need to rise in order to prevent each contestant from reducing his/her effort level in the face of greater market volatility (or more noise in the performance measure used to determine the tournament winner). Using comprehensive financial and accounting data on China's listed firms from 1998 to 2002, augmented by unique data on executive compensation and ownership structure, we find evidence in support of both hypotheses. Finally, we also find evidence suggesting that an increase in the winner's prize will result in improved firm performance due to enhanced managerial effort, and that the performance effect of the winner's prize is greater for China's listed firms that are less controlled by the state. As such this paper provides yet another piece of evidence that ownership restructuring may be needed for China to successfully transform its SOEs to efficient modernized corporations and reform its overall economy.

After a brief look at history, focus shifts to the post-Soviet period so as to shed light on the relations between power-holders and opponents. For this purpose, the social and political situation at the local level is observed in Omsk, where the activities of the regional branch of the Iabloko Party and of its activists have been studied. With respect to legislation, this analysis inquires into the way the opposition can use existing electoral laws. In the realm of politics, the opposition's various actions - the organization of demonstrations, debates and meetings with other opposition forces - are reviewed. To understand the forms of this activism and the methods used by its supporters, events in Omsk during the 2008-2010 period are discussed, as well as the response of the local political police, the aim being to determine the origins and conditions of existence of the opposition and to describe its prospects.","[Kostarev, Sergei] Omsk State Univ, Omsk, Russia; [Kostarev, Sergei] Sect Omsk Iabloko, Omsk, Russia",Dostoevsky Omsk State University,"Kostarev, S (通讯作者)，Omsk State Univ, Omsk, Russia.",skostarev@yandex.ru,,,,,,,16,0,0,1,4,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

A large seller of permits exercises market power no differently than a large supplier of an exhaustible resource. However, whenever the large agent's endowment falls short of his efficient endowment - allocation profile that would exactly cover his emissions along the perfectly competitive path - market power is greatly mitigated by a commitment problem, much like in a durable-goods monopoly.

In particular, it has been argued that DT might be an 'apparent' phenomenon, in fact amounting to a simple reorganisation of production across national and sectoral boundaries. The empirical studies that try to support this hypothesis, however, cannot be deemed conclusive as they suffer two methodological drawbacks: a non-(sub-)systemic sectoral level of analysis and a not truly global empirical approach. In order to overcome these drawbacks, the paper carries out an investigation of the actual extent to which DT occurred in the OECD area over the 1980s and the 1990s with two modifications: a sector instead of a subsystem perspective, retaining both direct and indirect relations and a 'pseudo-world' of seven OECD countries, thus taking into account the 'global' dimension of the phenomenon. Our results strongly support the DT hypothesis: although the weight of market services in the manufacturing subsystem increases, providing a counterbalance to manufacturing decline, subsystem shares significantly decrease, thus confirming DT as a more fundamental trend of the investigated period.","[Montresor, Sandro] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40125 Bologna, Italy; [Vittucci Marzetti, Giuseppe] Univ Trento, Dept Econ, I-38110 Trento, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Trento,"Montresor, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Str Maggiore 45, I-40125 Bologna, Italy.",sandro.montresor@unibo.it; giuseppe.vittucci@economia.unitn.it,"Marzetti, Giuseppe Vittucci/AAG-2246-2020; Montresor, Sandro/K-1833-2019","Marzetti, Giuseppe Vittucci/0000-0003-3093-8000; montresor, sandro/0000-0002-1195-901X",,,,,56,46,49,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

This paper carries out a cross-country analysis of the determinants of financial market efficiency using panel cointegration with a view to recommending policy options for improving the efficiency of the financial sector intermediation process in Kenya. The study finds that the major contributors to the differences in financial sector inefficiency in Kenya compared to the other countries in the study are high bank operating costs, default risk and financial market structure. The study recommends, among other measures, that the government through the Central Bank need to collaborate with the commercial banks and establish a working credit reference bureau to enable easy identification of credit worthy customers in order to reduce default risk; there is also need by the central bank to license more new banks to increase competition and reduce bank concentration. The study also recommends increased use of technology including phone-banking and e-banking to reduce operation costs of the banks. The paper concludes that contrary to the findings from other cross-country analysis, the factors that lead to financial market in/efficiency varies from one country to the other.

We contrast two financing regimes, free-to-air and pay-TV. We find that a higher viewer responsiveness to advertising decreases revenues and entry in the free-to-air regime.

The idea is that stock market prices overshoot and undershoot their long-run equilibrium values which are determined by the development in the real economy. The overshooting is triggered primarily by a loose monetary policy. With our model we explain the genesis of the global financial crisis (GFC) 2008/2009 primarily as the result of a loose monetary policy in the USA. Following the overshooting and crash in the stock market the real economy dropped into a recession. After modelling the interaction of three markets with different speed of adjustment-money, stocks and goods-for a closed economy we expand it to an open economy and lastly study the spillovers of a financial market crisis between countries (from a large to a small country) by introducing the transmission channels of external trade or cross-border financial transactions. A long-lasting monetary easing as exhibiting by the Fed and the ECB since 2007 and 2008, respectively could-according to our model-generate another boom-bust cycle.","[Breuss, Fritz] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, A-1103 Vienna, Austria; [Breuss, Fritz] Vienna Univ Econ & Business WU, Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Breuss, F (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, A-1103 Vienna, Austria.",fritz.breuss@wifo.ac.at,,,,,,,57,8,8,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,FEB,2011,38.0,1,,,SI,,131,152,,10.1007/s10663-010-9140-5,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,022VR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000309992700009,0

They, however, tended to overemphasise the risks outside their control and to neglect those, at least partially under their control. Central banks should and could have acted already in 2005. Academic studies and their own assessments clearly indicated an accumulation of risks. Monetary authorities didn't react as (1) they believe in self-regulating markets, and (2) in monetary instruments' ineffectiveness to prevent bubbles, as well as (3) their tendency to assigning an extremely low probability to potential risks. This is not untypical for expert assessments: Risk assessment for complex systems is extremely complicated. If feasible at all, it would require extraordinarily complex techniques to take into account the tight coupling of system components and their complex interaction. This will not be possible in the foreseeable future. As a result reducing the system's complexity appears to be the only way to reduce the probability and the severity of future financial crises.","[Tichy, Gunther] Austrian Acad Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Tichy, Gunther] Inst Wirtschaftsforsch, Vienna, Austria",Austrian Academy of Sciences,"Tichy, G (通讯作者)，Austrian Acad Sci, Vienna, Austria.",gtichy@oeaw.ac.at,,,,,,,65,0,0,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,FEB,2011,38.0,1,,,SI,,107,130,,10.1007/s10663-010-9143-2,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,022VR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000309992700008,0

Despite their popularity throughout the developing world, relatively little is known about their effect on children's health outcomes. This paper evaluates the impact of the Mexican conditional cash transfer program, Progresa, on two important health outcomes: infant and neonatal mortality. It exploits the phasing-in of Progresa over time throughout rural Mexico to identify the impact of the program. The paper shows that Progresa led to a large 17% decline in rural infant mortality among the treated, but did not reduce neonatal mortality on average. The benefit-cost ratio is between 13 and 3.6. Tests for heterogeneity show larger declines for some groups including those municipalities whose pre-program levels of mortality were above the median, and those that prior to the program had higher illiteracy rates, and less access to electricity.

The analysis is based on data, acquired through qualitative research interviews with both members and non-members of the two selected clusters (Clutex, a textile cluster, and Plastr, comprised of firms operating in the plastic industry). The results provide no decisive proof concerning the contribution of clusters to firm competitiveness; however, the interviewed firms recognise and appreciate several advantages of their cluster membership, such as joint research, joint purchasing of materials, improved marketing opportunities, etc. Surprisingly, much more intensive links were discovered in the case of the Clutex cluster, whose members are not concentrated in one region, as are Plastr's members, but are spread over several regions.

To determine the magnitude of the effects of European monetary fluctuations on the Romanian economy, we employ a Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) model identified using long-term restrictions that comprises key Romanian macro-indicators and the variables considered suitable for isolating the European monetary policy shocks. Our findings are important to establish the degree of vulnerability of the Romanian economy to external disturbances and the degree of fulfilment of the prerequisites for becoming a full member of the Economic and Monetary Union.","[Bobeica, Gabriel] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Dept Money & Banking, Bucharest 701631, Romania; Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, DOFIN, Bucharest 701631, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Bobeica, G (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Dept Money & Banking, Bucharest 701631, Romania.",gabriel.bobeica@fin.ase.ro,"Bobeica, Gabriel/B-6771-2011",,,,,,20,2,2,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Nontrading or infrequent trading is not an issue because the PSI-20 includes only the 20 most traded shares. The tests are performed using daily, weekly and monthly returns for the whole period and for five sub-periods which reflect different trends in the market.

Consistent with findings in the international literature, these studies have concluded that unions compress the distribution of wages in South Africa, and more specifically, that racial inequality is lower in the union sector than in the non-union sector. In this paper, we explore whether unions in South Africa are associated with comparable gender wage effects among African workers, using data collected in the nationally representative Labour Force Surveys. Contrary to initial expectations, we find that when wage estimations control for broad occupational sorting by gender in union and non-union employment, then the gender wage gap is larger in the union sector than in the non-union sector. We also consider how possible selection into union status affects our estimates, and demonstrate the difficulty of addressing this problem in the South African context by evaluating a variety of selection models.","[Casale, Daniela; Posel, Dorrit] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Dev Studies, Durban, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Casale, D (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Dev Studies, Durban, South Africa.",casaled@ukzn.ac.za,"Casale, Daniela/HTL-3497-2023; Posel, Dorrit/AAF-7750-2021","Casale, Daniela/0000-0003-1337-1196; Posel, Dorrit/0000-0002-3343-875X",,,,,36,20,23,2,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

A conspicuous product in this context is a luxury good for which demand is increasing in brand image. Brand image here means the ability of a consumer to impress observers by conspicuously displaying consumption of the good. Brand image is built up when the good is priced high enough to make it exclusive, and eroded if the good is discounted. Recession is modeled as having two effects: it reduces demand and it freezes capital markets so borrowing is not possible. In pricing the conspicuous product the firm faces the following trade-off. Reducing price helps maintain sales volume and cash flow in the face of reduced demand, but it also damages brand image and thus long-term demand. The paper analyzes the firm's pricing policy facing scenarios of mild, intermediate and severe recessions, while taking the threat of bankruptcy into account. For an intermediate recession the optimal solution is history-dependent. The results have implications for policy interventions in capital markets and for timing of mergers and acquisitions.

However, there have been few published studies on scale economies, and none on scope economies, for drug abuse treatment costs. We estimate a restricted cost function for 17 hospitals in Washington State that provided inpatient and/or outpatient drug abuse treatment during the years 1997-2004. We find significant evidence of scale economies for hospitals that provide only outpatient drug abuse treatment services. The marginal costs of outpatient services are even smaller for hospitals that produce both outpatient and inpatient drug abuse treatment services. Further, these joint-production hospitals exhibit diseconomies of scope, or specialization economies. These results all imply that recent trends towards additional outpatient treatment services will enhance cost efficiency.","[Cohen, Jeffrey P.] Univ Hartford, Econ Finance & Insurance Dept, Hartford, CT 06117 USA; [Paul, Catherine Morrison] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of Hartford; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Cohen, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Hartford, Econ Finance & Insurance Dept, Hartford, CT 06117 USA.",professorjeffrey@gmail.com,,"Cohen, Jeffrey/0000-0001-5467-7584",,,,,21,2,3,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

If Country risk is shaped by the crisis, it, in turn, may influence the manifestation of the crisis. A current example is the sovereign country risk component, which meets the characteristics that make it able to prolong the depression.

We derive an estimator that is consistent with endogenous plan selection by using the quasi-experimental variation caused by peculiarities of the Medicare reimbursement system for HMOs. We find that, relative to traditional Medicare, enrollment in an HMO without drug coverage increases mortality while enrollment in an HMO with drug coverage has no significant impact. The economic value of the reduction in mortality from drug coverage far outweighs the costs.

It has been ascertained that if an enterprise creates and uses a knowledge management system, it increases investment attractiveness of the enterprise and favors growth of goodwill of the company. This system gives the enterprise an opportunity to minimize consumption of resources for creating and adopting product and process innovations, reduce time of transition to production of new product types. Thereby, the knowledge management system enables the enterprise to avoid a gap of financial and economic performance indicators in turbulent environment of market activity. Moreover, the knowledge management system is an effective tool of adaptation of personnel to changes in a competitive strategy of the enterprise, e.g., related to transition to production of new generations of products, changes in a structure of its lifecycle by means of new business processes related to executing engineering work within after-sale service. The knowledge management system is demonstrated in the paper as the whole set of interconnected subsystems, of which the main are subsystems of formation, spread and employment of knowledge. The authors have analyzed functions of these subsystems and ascertained influence of the subsystems on a process of forming the fundamental value of a high-technology enterprise. The authors regard the process of creating the knowledge management system as a dynamic process characterized by continuous update and development of knowledge. This requires transformation of knowledge from implicit (individual) into explicit, which would he accessible to those members of personnel that need this knowledge. Thus, the knowledge management system of a high-technology enterprise should be created as an open-ended system. Only in such system a process of integrating knowledge that has already been accumulated at the enterprise with knowledge that is being acquired or updated could be realized in the best possible way. Such integration is a key precondition for increasing effectiveness of utilization of the whole range of knowledge by an enterprise.","[Baranov, Vyacheslav] Russian Presidential Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm, Inst Business Studies, Prospekt Vernadskogo 82 A, Moscow 119571, Russia; [Zaytsev, Alexander] Moscow State Text Univ AN Kosygin, Moscow 119071, Russia",Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy & Public Administration; Kosygin State University of Russia,"Baranov, V (通讯作者)，Russian Presidential Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm, Inst Business Studies, Prospekt Vernadskogo 82 A, Moscow 119571, Russia.",baranow@nln.ru; az-inform@mail.ru,"Baranov, Vyacheslav/HLH-2557-2023; Batova, Marina/AAG-1943-2020","Batova, Marina/0000-0001-5417-1348",,,,,9,1,1,0,5,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-755-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,147,+,,,,,,2,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT98,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300261200016,0

Additionally, we find a highly statistically significant negative relationship between states that were traditionally Republican but voted for President Obama in the 2008 election (Blue states) and traditionally Red states. Furthermore, our findings suggest that there is a statistically significant positive relationship between union representation for a state and per capita funding and between per capita electoral votes and per capita funding.

The 'credibility rationale', argues that hawks may actually be necessary to initiate peace agreements. The 'bargaining rationale' predicts that while doves are more likely to secure peace, post-conflict hawks may be rationally selected. The 'social psychological rationale' captures the idea of a competition over which group can form the strongest identity. Dove selection can be predicted during conflict, but hawk selection post-conflict. Finally, the 'expressive rationale' predicts that regardless of the underlying nature of the game the large group nature of decision-making in rendering individual decision makers non-decisive in determining the outcome of elections may cause them to make choices based primarily on emotions. Finally, the paper analyses the extent to which the theories can throw light on Northern Ireland electoral history over the last 25 years.","Univ Strathclyde, Dept Econ, Glasgow G4 0GE, Lanark, Scotland",University of Strathclyde,"Jennings, C (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Dept Econ, Glasgow G4 0GE, Lanark, Scotland.",colin.jennings@strath.ac.uk,"Jennings, Colin/HIR-3150-2022","Jennings, Colin/0000-0002-5554-3825",,,,,41,4,5,1,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

The demand is equally likely to be found anywhere in a fixed interval of feasible product characteristics, with the ex-post differentiation of tastes parametrized to reflect the degree of uncertainty. It turns out that, for uncertainty big enough, the presence of a linear component in the cost function no longer rules out an analytical solution to the game, which is a common problem in spatial competition models. In particular, a subgame-perfect equilibrium is shown to exist in which the firms' locations approach the socially efficient ones as uncertainty further increases, regardless of the curvature of the cost function. When the demand uncertainty reaches maximum, mill-pricing is equivalent to spatial price discrimination under the most general conditions.","Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Krol, M (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",michal.krol@manchester.ac.uk,"Krol, Michal/AAH-7963-2020","Krol, Michal/0000-0002-5512-214X",,,,,20,2,2,1,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

First, the level of informal employment has risen significantly over the period, despite strong economic growth and the introduction of a range of market-oriented reforms. Secondly, the level of inequality in earnings seems to have remained more or less constant over the period, in contrast to the experience of other countries at a similar stage of transition. We show that informal employees earn significantly less than those in the formal sector, controlling for a range of other variables, and informality plays an increasingly important role in explaining earnings inequality.","[Krstic, Gorana] Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ, Belgrade, Serbia; [Sanfey, Peter] EBRD, London, England",University of Belgrade; European Bank of Reconstructon & Development,"Krstic, G (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ, Belgrade, Serbia.",vgkrstic@eunet.rs; sanfeyp@ebrd.com,"Krstic, Gorana/ABA-1858-2020","Krstic, Gorana/0000-0003-3171-8050",,,,,32,19,23,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

Given that no later work was ever published by Sraffa, we are left to wonder what would have come after the prelude. This paper suggests that the core of the critique might have been the marginal method itself. By carefully distinguishing between published and unpublished work, we shows that Sraffa's opposition to the marginal method follows several threads, some of which were developed over a period of nearly 35 years, such as the belief that economic theory should use only measurable and observable magnitudes, the critique of the 'fundamental' symmetry between production and consumption, and the disagreement with the Marshallian concept of equilibrium.

This is consistent with the interpretation that momentum returns may compensate for the risk of momentum trading on short-term horizons and that the short-term oriented momentum traders are not in a position to perform long-term arbitrage.","Leibniz Univ Hannover, Dept Econ, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Menkhoff, L (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Dept Econ, Koenigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",menkhoff@gif.uni-hannover.de,,,,,,,47,5,6,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In each period, the firm sets the quantity produced observing only the selling price and the slope of the demand curve at that quantity. Given this information and through a learning process the firm estimates a linear subjective demand curve. We show that the steady states of the dynamic equation are critical points of the objective profit function. Moreover, results depend on convexity/concavity of the demand. When the demand function is convex and the objective profit function has a unique critical point: the steady state is a globally stable maximum; conversely when then steady state is not unique, local maximums are locally stable, while local minimums are locally unstable. On the other hand when the demand function is concave, the unique critical point is a maximum: there can be stability or instability of the critical point and period two cycles around it via a flip bifurcation. Moreover, through simulations we can observe that, with a mixed inverse demand function, there are different dynamic behaviors, from stability to chaos and that we have transition to complex dynamics via a sequence of period-doubling bifurcations. Finally, we show that the same results can be obtained if the monopolist is a price setter. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Effective analysis and evaluation of competitiveness must be based on pre-defined concept of competitiveness. In the case of regional competitiveness evaluation, we find, due to a lack of uniform approach, the problem with the basic concept and definition of regional competitiveness. Because of the absence of mainstream approach to regional competitiveness evaluation, there is a space for individual approach application. Example of such an approach can be portrait by macro-econometric modelling using regional panel data model that presents some link between micro and macro-econometric modelling and allows the elimination of imbalances caused by the data sets aggregation. This aim of the paper is formulation of an econometric panel data model with techniques using dummy variables for assessing regional competitiveness of the Visegrad Four countries. Theoretical background of the paper is based on the knowledge of theoretical concept and issues of regional competitiveness and productivity in the context of growth theories. The empirical part of the paper is focused on the application of panel nonlinear regression model for 35 regions at NUTS level 2 of the Visegrad Four. The level of regional competitiveness is analyzed by selected indicators evaluated performance of the EU growth strategies objectives until 2010. Selection of explanatory variables in the panel model appropriately reflects the level of competitive potential in the NUTS 2 regions of the Visegrad Four in the reference period 2000 - 2008. Use of econometric panel data model seems to be appropriate, since it marks better capture of the dynamics of changes and fixed or stochastic effects that have occurred in the proposed explanatory variables. Based on the estimation of the panel model, econometric and economic verification, final part of the paper includes a comparison of results for all explanatory variables in NUTS 2 regions, which are cross-sectional and time used to determine the order of influence of each NUTS 2 region of Visegrad Four to the overall competitiveness of the European Union. For purposes of the model, the overall EU competitiveness is approximated with the average volume of GDP for 271 NUTS 2 regions in EU27, according to the NUTS 2006 classification methodology.","[Nevima, Jan; Melecky, Lukas] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Math Methods Econ, Dept European Integrat, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,,jan.nevima@oao.cz; lukas.melecky@vsb.cz,"Melecky, Lukas/AAY-7847-2021; Nevima, Jan/AAC-5530-2021; Melecky, Lukas/A-8078-2015","Melecky, Lukas/0000-0001-8889-6400; Nevima, Jan/0000-0002-4788-9009; Melecky, Lukas/0000-0001-8889-6400",,,,,19,15,16,0,10,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-755-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,348,361,,,,,,14,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT98,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300261200038,0

A methodology where causality is imposed and tested within an empirical co-integrated demand model, not prespecified, is suggested. The methodology allows different causality of different products within the same demand system. The methodology is applied to fish demand. On the German market for farmed trout and substitutes, it is found that supply sources, i.e. aquaculture and fishery, are not the only determinant of causality. Storing, tightness of management and aggregation level of integrated markets might also be important. The methodological implication is that more explicit focus on causality in demand analyses provides improved information. The results suggest that frozen trout forms part of a large European whitefish market, where prices of fresh trout are formed on a relatively separate market. Redfish is a substitute on both markets. The policy implication is that increased production of trout causes a downward pressure on fresh trout prices, but frozen trout prices remain relatively unaffected.","[Nielsen, Max; Jensen, Frank] Univ Copenhagen, Danish Inst Food & Resource Econ, Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Setala, Jari; Virtanen, Jarno] Finnish Game & Fisheries Res Inst, Helsinki, Finland",University of Copenhagen; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke),"Nielsen, M (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Danish Inst Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",max@foi.dk,"Nielsen, Max/F-4544-2015","Nielsen, Max/0000-0002-4283-1852",,,,,48,23,24,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Variation in the timing of joint-custody reforms across states provides a natural-experiment framework with which to examine within-marriage investment in children. The probability of children's private school attendance declines by 12% in states that adopt joint-custody laws. We also find evidence linking joint-custody reform to higher rates of labor force participation for married mothers, which may indicate less time devoted household production. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

These initiatives were consolidated in 2003 following the enactment of a new 'Law on National Education System'. The effectiveness of this policy is questioned by comparing the expenditure and enrolment rates between Indonesia and other High Performing Asian Economies (HPAEs) - Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia from 2000 to 2007. Privatisation of educational institutions, not greater government involvement, has been the norm across most of the other HPAEs during the 2000s. Privatisation leads to improvements in the quality and cost of education. Enrolment rates indicate that the quality of education has not improved in Indonesia as compared to other HPAEs. Improvements in quality will become a particularly important issue for Indonesia as it continues to cope with the challenges brought about by China and India's unprecedented growth as labour-intensive manufacturing powerhouses.","RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Posso, A (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",alberto.posso@rmit.edu.au,,"Posso, Alberto/0000-0003-4226-7072",,,,,19,3,4,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

The analysis covers the period 1993-2009. All the calculations are performed on five three-year subperiods and one two-year subperiod: 1993-95, 1996-98, 1999-2001, 2002-04, 2005-07 and 2008-09. The analysis is composed of three steps: data selection, correlation analysis and regression analysis. The correlation analysis is based on the coefficient of partial correlation to exclude the impact of the global crisis. In the regression analysis we build 10 alternative variants of empirical models of economic growth. Our results suggest that the most important economic growth determinants in the CEE countries are investment rate (including FDI), human capital measured by the education level of the labour force, financial sector development, good fiscal stance (low budget deficit and low public debt), economic structure (high services share in GDP), low interest rates and low inflation, population structure (high share of working-age population), development of information technology and communications, high private sector share in GDP and favourable institutional environment (economic freedom, progress in market and structural reforms). Our study indicates that the CEE countries have developed in line with the hypothesis of income level convergence (both in absolute and conditional terms). This means that less developed CEE economies grew on average faster than more developed ones.","Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Próchniak, M (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",mproch@sgh.waw.pl,,,,,,,37,64,64,0,58,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2011,23.0,4,,,,,449,468,,10.1080/14631377.2011.622566,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,883HL,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299624800003,0

We use a two-level nested logit model to model the interdependence between merger decisions and the distressed state of banks. Both bank-specific variables and macroeconomic variables are deployed to predict banking distress. In line with other recent papers, we challenge the view that specific bank indicators such as CAMEL category and bank size are more significant determinants of banking distress than macroeconomic variables. A comparison of model fits and out-of-sample forecasts indicates that the unordered NL model statistically outperforms a standard logit model by substantial margins. Our empirical study shows that 67% of the distressed banks in our sample are involved in merger transactions and that weak financial status systematically increases the likelihood of a bank being involved in a merger. Distressed state-owned banks are less likely to be a target of a merger transaction. However, global economic conditions do not significantly affect the decision of distressed banks to initiate a merger policy. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Studies on related topics are few and scarce, if compared, for example, to studies on information systems or web services. The main purpose of this study is to investigate consumers' usage behavior in mobile services to provide pointers for future development of this field. Specifically, this study attempts to identify variables influencing the use of mobile service consumers. We developed an information technology acceptance model to determine usage characteristics and usage trends in mobile services and predict consumers' usage behavior based on patterns discerned from these characteristics and trends. Information technology acceptance models are a useful tool for understanding the behavior of consumers of services such as mobile services, combining aspects of a technology and service good, from the perspective of behavioral science. This study, comprehensively concerned with mobile service marketing-related issues, considers both factors influencing consumers' usage behavior and also technical aspects of services. Factors influencing the behavior of mobile service consumers are investigated empirically, by examining them in a real-world context. The expected outcomes of this study are as follows: First, it will predict consumers' usage behavior with regard to mobile services based on usage characteristics at the level of task management, and discern identifiable and recurring patterns. Second, it will awaken providers to the importance of technical and functional performance and a clear understanding of consumers' needs for the success of marketing mobile services.","[Lee, Jungmann] Hoseo Univ, Cheonan, Chungnam Prov, South Korea; [Oh, Young Sam] Inha Univ, Inchon, South Korea; [Kim, Seung-Ho] Korea Inst Ind Evaluat, Taegu, South Korea; [Sawng, Yeong-Wha] Elect & Telecommun Res Inst, Taejon, South Korea",Hoseo University; Inha University; Electronics & Telecommunications Research Institute - Korea (ETRI),"Lee, J (通讯作者)，Hoseo Univ, Anseodong 268, Cheonan, Chungnam Prov, South Korea.",ywsawng@gmail.com; kshuri@gmail.com; mann@hoseo.edu; yso@inha.edu,"Sawng, Yeong-Wha/IAL-9778-2023; Alves, Luciano/G-3655-2011","Sawng, Yeong-Wha/0000-0002-6152-2625",,,,,33,7,7,0,22,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

It can, therefore, not be ruled out that the refusal of UIP condition is simply the outcome of a misspecification of a commonly used model and an elaborate data snooping process. In order to overcome this specification problem, this paper uses the precise form of UIP and examines its empirical validity based on a sample of ASEAN-5 member countries. Using the heterogeneous panel cointegration tests, our empirical results indicate that the gross domestic return and the uncovered gross foreign return are cointegrated in the long run. The long-run cointegrating coefficients are then estimated using the fully modified OLS (FMOLS) and the dynamic OLS (DOLS) proposed by Pedroni. The estimated long-run coefficients suggest that UIP only holds for Singapore. These results indicate that the Singapore financial market is highly integrated with the US market. As for the other four countries, the precise UIP hypothesis is strongly rejected suggesting that the financial markets in these emerging economies have not fully liberalized and, therefore, limited the international financial market integration. By examining international finance market linkages between ASEAN-5 and the US economy, we provide some policy implications that can be used as guiding tools for financing and investment decisions in ASEAN-5.

Due to significant fluctuations of user demands during the day and from day to day, the determination of required number of agents appears as actual giving the opportunities for efficient management. The purpose of this paper is to develop a mathematical model for optimal resource allocation in a call center in order to provide a satisfactory quality of service at all times, without having more agents than necessary. The objective is to find the best staffing levels or schedule that minimizes the daily costs while satisfying all constraints. To solve this problem, we propose here a two-level dynamic programming (DP) algorithm that determines the required staffing levels by shifts. The algorithm enables optimal allocation of available human resources such that the operation costs are reduced as much as possible. The practical sample is demonstrated in a case of a call center for public traffic and transport systems in metropolitan.

Although we have not yet seen a collapse of Chinese property prices, their increases so far are comparable to those in the other two episodes and a careful comparative study is warranted. The present paper first examines the behavior of asset prices, of property prices in particular, in the three cases, and highlights some similarities. The paper emphasizes the role played by extremely easy monetary policy in generating bubble-like asset price behavior in the three cases. The reason for easy monetary policies is investigated. In the US case, the monetary authority was concerned about the risk of deflation in the early to mid-2000s. The experiences of Japan and China are quite similar in that the monetary authorities of both countries were seriously concerned about the possible deflationary effects of exchange rate appreciation on the economy. The implications of such a finding for the future of Chinese macroeconomic policy are discussed.","Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Ueda, K (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.",ueda@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,,,,,11,9,11,4,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2011,19.0,1,,,,,47,62,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2011.01226.x,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,717IS,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287037500003,0

Personal experience with a country influences one's perception about a country as well as its products. The mechanism of this influence is complex and still evolving, presenting a research problem of this study. On the basis of previous studies, the authors of this article suggest a different model of research. This model segregates conative and cognitive aspects of the country image, and argues that conative ones may be interpreted as one's psychic closeness to a country. The aim of the article is to test the model, analyzing how personal experience with a country and demographic parameters impact on psychic closeness, image of a country and general evaluations of products from that country. The study is performed in Lithuania, on the basis of mail survey, developed on the judgemental sampling approach. Germany was used as a target country for measuring respondents' psychic closeness, country image and general evaluations of products from this country. The main constructs were measured on the basis of modified scale proposed by R. Parameswaran & M. Pisharodi (1994). Personal experience with a country was measured by registering visits to the country or temporary living in it. In total, 539 questionnaires were included in the analysis. The analysis revealed appropriateness of the study approach and allows us to highlight some differences, occurring on the basis of personal experience. It was confirmed that the country image depends on personal experience from the country and that general evaluation of products also depends on personal experience from the country. However, the link between personal experience and psychic distance requires further analysis and testing. In addition, some differences were observed on the basis of various demographic parameters of respondents. More general interpretation of findings is difficult due to the scope of the study, since the major parameters are measured on the basis of just two countries. This complicates segregation of country-specific observations from the general ones. Despite this limitation, the study suggests further steps in researching the issue, since the overall model has proved its appropriateness.","[Urbonavicius, Sigitas; Dikcius, Vytautas; Navickaite, Skirmante] Vilnius Univ, LT-01513 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Urbonavicius, S (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Sauletekio Av 9, LT-01513 Vilnius, Lithuania.",sigitas.urbonavicius@ef.vu.lt; v.dikcius@gmail.com; skirmante.navickaite@gmail.com,"Urbonavicius, Sigitas/AAJ-5474-2020","Urbonavicius, Sigitas/0000-0003-4176-2573",,,,,39,5,5,1,12,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

A total of 23 studies yielded 575 coefficients measuring exchange rate pass-through to import prices and consumer prices for 23 developed and 12 transition economies. The MRA results confirm the finding of many particular analyses that exchange rate pass-through is less than complete. In addition, exchange rate pass-through is higher to import prices than to consumer prices; and exchange rate pass-through is higher in the long run than in the short run. Regarding transition and developed economies, MRA suggests that there is no statistically significant difference in exchange rate pass-through to import prices. Yet, exchange rate pass-through to consumer prices is significantly and substantially higher in transition than in developed economies. This finding is consistent with the caution of many monetary authorities in transition economies regarding exchange rate flexibility.","[Pugh, Geoffrey Thomas] Staffordshire Univ, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Stoke On Trent ST4 2DE, Staffs, England; [Velickovski, Igor] Natl Bank Republ Macedonia, Skopje, Macedonia",Staffordshire University,"Pugh, GT (通讯作者)，Staffordshire Univ, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Stoke On Trent ST4 2DE, Staffs, England.",geoff@plainfigures.com,"Pugh, Geoffrey/AAG-5009-2019","Pugh, Geoffrey/0000-0002-9596-1757",,,,,40,11,11,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The model permits only two types of equilibrium terminations that resemble, respectively, the two kinds of labor market separations that are typically observed in practice: involuntary layoffs and voluntary retirements. The model allows for the simultaneous determination of a large set of important labor market variables including equilibrium unemployment and labor force participation.

Using US census microdata, I find that multi-unit firms operate a greater number of restaurants and larger individual restaurants in larger Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). This evidence of increased profitability goes hand in hand with increases in capacity utilization through longer operating hours and more intensive production of meals and nonmeals output at individual establishments. Greater capacity exploitation is consistent with efficient firms, rather strategic behaviour, such as product proliferation or location preemption to limit rivalry. Furthermore, these results hold true for multi-unit firms but not for large national chain systems, suggesting that efficiency gains accrue from firm-specific capital, not just from marketing or distribution scale economies.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Yeap, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 1994 Buford Ave,Room 337B, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",cayeap@umn.edu,,,,,,,18,3,6,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Qualitative evidence focusing on three key countries in Asia - China, Japan, and South Korea - is also marshaled to sustain the contention that Asian governments have used the recent economic crisis to reinvigorate industrial policies, targeting apparent growth poles and apparently environmentally friendly technologies and sectors.

Our model of an endogenous franchising network underscores the trade-off between the cost associated with specifying and enforcing the contractual terms and the cost associated with broadening the relationships with multiple franchisors. We show that when the contracting cost relative to the relational cost is high and when the economies of specialization is low, a non-exclusive franchise contract is an optimal contractual arrangement to mitigate franchisor opportunism.","[Chu, Chih-Ning] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Coll Management, Dept Business Adm, Taipei, Taiwan; [Liu, Wai-Man] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Chung Yuan Christian University; Australian National University,"Chu, CN (通讯作者)，Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Coll Management, Dept Business Adm, Taipei, Taiwan.",cnc@ntu.edu.tw,"Liu, Wai-Man/AFM-7297-2022",,,,,,10,1,1,0,7,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1361-374X,,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

After comparing quality disclosure with other quality assurance mechanisms and describing a brief history of quality disclosure, we address two sets of theoretical issues. First, why don't sellers voluntarily disclose through a process of unraveling and, given the lack of unraveling, is it desirable to mandate seller disclosure? Second, when we rely on certifiers to act as the intermediary of quality disclosure, do certifiers necessarily report unbiased and accurate information? We further review empirical evidence on these issues, with a particular focus on healthcare, education, and finance. The empirical review covers quality measurement, the effect of third-party disclosure on consumer choice and seller behavior, as well as the economics of certifiers.

Long-run mark ups are decreasing in the discount factor and in productivity, and increasing in the exit rate and in the entry costs. Dynamic inefficiency can emerge due to excessive entry under Cournot competition. Positive temporary shocks attract entry, which strengthens competition so as to reduce the mark ups temporarily and increase real wages: this competition effect creates an intertemporal substitution effect which boosts consumption and employment.

Externality-correcting terms appear also in the expressions for the taxes on non-polluting goods as well as in the expressions for taxes on the polluting goods unless preferences are additively quasilinear either in one of the non-polluting goods or in the labor supply. On the other hand, in the presence of direct emission taxes, one can use emission taxes for externality correction and leave commodity taxes for revenue raising.

As we show, the observed preference reversals in intertemporal choice are consistent with constant discounting and can alternatively be explained by decreasing absolute risk aversion together with the individual's risk perception. This risk may concern the size of the actual outcome or the endowment consumption stream to which the outcome is added. Both types of uncertainty naturally appear in the context of intertemporal choice. We show how relative degrees of changes in risk over time can determine choices. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The extent to which candidates move closer to the center is constrained by flip-flopping costs, and candidates choose divergent policies in the general election.

Islamic Banking and Finance (IBF) involves wider ethical and moral issues than simply 'interest-free' transactions. Its advocates argue that these make it more economically efficient than conventional banking and promote greater economic equity and justice. To what extent, then, do actual Islamic Banking practices live up to the ideal, and how different are they from conventional banking? A preliminary investigation shows that, three decades after its introduction, there remain substantial divergences between IBF's ideals and its practices, and much of IBF still remains functionally indistinguishable from conventional banking. This runs counter to claims by IBF advocates that it would rapidly differentiate itself from conventional banking. However, despite not providing an alternative to conventional banking and finance, IBF does strengthen a distinctly Islamic identity by providing the appropriate Islamic terminology for de facto conventional financial transactions.

This paper aims at answering this question using a meta-analysis based on a data set that comprises 137 program evaluations from 19 countries. The empirical results of the meta-analysis are surprisingly clear-cut: Rather than contextual factors such as labor market institutions or the business cycle, it is almost exclusively the program type that seems to matter for program effectiveness. While direct employment programs in the public sector frequently appear detrimental, wage subsidies and Services and Sanctions can be effective in increasing participants' employment probability. Training programs - the most commonly used type of active policy - show modestly positive effects. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It is found that, under a fixed-fee contract, the patent holder prefers exclusive licensing. However, under a royalty or two-part tariff contract, the patent holder favours non-exclusive licensing. Moreover, in contrast to the standard argument by Kamien and Tauman, we show that, from the perspective of the patentee, royalty licensing can be superior to fixed-fee licensing, if the degree of innovation is small. Two-part tariff licensing generates a monopoly outcome in the final market and hence reduces both consumer surplus and social welfare, if the innovation is low.","[Li, Changying; Wang, Junmei] Nankai Univ, Inst Econ, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Li, Changying] Nankai Univ, Ctr Transnat Studies, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China",Nankai University; Nankai University,"Li, CY (通讯作者)，Nankai Univ, Inst Econ, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China.",changying.li@nankai.edu.cn,"WANG, YING/JLM-9219-2023; cheng, shu/IZE-4788-2023",,,,,,27,42,45,3,38,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0249,,,ECON REC,Econ.

First, our results highlight the importance of the impact of firms' access to finance on their entry decision into the export market. However, better financial health neither increases the probability of remaining an exporter once the firm has entered, nor the size of exports. Second, we find that financial constraints create a disconnection between firms' productivity and their export status: productivity is only a significant determinant of the export decision if the firm has a sufficient access to external finance. Finally, an increase in a country's financial development dampens this disconnection, thus acting both on the number of exporters and on the exporters' selection process. These results contribute to the literature documenting the role of fixed costs and of the extensive margin of trade in total trade adjustment, and provide micro-level evidence of the positive impact of financial development on trade found by previous literature.

Resolving this empirical puzzle is highly important because, firstly, asset correlations are a key driver of credit risk and, secondly, both data sources are widely used to calibrate risk models of financial institutions. By means of a simulation study, we explore the hypothesis that differences in the correlation estimates are due to a substantial downward bias characteristic of estimates based on default rates. By varying the time horizon, the default probability, the asset correlation and the number of firms in the portfolio, we investigate these estimators in a systematic comparative study. Our results suggest that correlation estimates from equity returns are more efficient than those from default rates. This finding still holds if the model is misspecified such that asset correlations follow a Vasicek process which affects foremost the estimates from equity returns. The results lend support for the hypothesis that the downward bias of default-rate based estimates is an important although not the only factor to explain the differences in correlation estimates. Furthermore, our results help to quantify the estimation error of asset correlations dependent on the true values of default probability and asset correlation.

Domestic capital accumulation, subject to installation costs, is the engine of economic growth in this framework. Crucial in deriving the balanced growth rate is the effective rate of return that arises from agents' status preferences. This results not only in a common balanced growth rate for consumption, the domestic capital stock, and net international financial assets, but also saddle-path dynamics in response to structural shifts. We investigate the short- and long-run dynamics of the model by considering the following standard fiscal shocks: (i) government expenditure, (ii) capital tax, (iii) tax on international financial assets, (iv) consumption tax. Among our results, we find that a permanent fiscal expansion leads to a temporary increase in growth and that a rise in the consumption tax results in a temporary decrease in growth.","Inst Adv Studies, Dept Econ & Finance, A-1060 Vienna, Austria",,"Fisher, WH (通讯作者)，Inst Adv Studies, Dept Econ & Finance, Stumpergasse 56, A-1060 Vienna, Austria.",fisher@ihs.ac.at,,,,,,,17,8,8,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We use unique Romanian survey data that enables us to isolate pure gifts from other private transfers. We explicitly focus on the importance of community-wide social norms, and find that they indeed play a major role for both the occurrence and the values of gifts. More exactly, our results suggest that the overall predominant gift motive among Romanian households is a norm of reciprocity. Moreover, this norm seems to be dominating for gifts to middle- and high-income households. Even though poor households receive to the same extent, norms of both impure altruism and reciprocity tend to be important. Hence, although the poor may not reciprocate gifts to the same extent as the rich, they still receive, since there is a social norm to give, especially to the poor. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We find that doubling the province of work's population density reduces the chances of being an entrepreneur by 2-3 percentage points. This result holds after controlling for regional fixed effects and is robust to instrumenting urbanization. Provinces' competition, urban amenities and dis-amenities, cost of labour, earning differentials between employees and self-employed workers, unemployment rates and value added per capita account for more than half of the negative urbanization penalty. Our result cannot be entirely explained by the presence of negative differentials in returns to entrepreneurship between the most and the least densely populated areas. In fact, as long as they succeed in entering the most densely populated markets, young entrepreneurs are able to reap-off the benefits of urbanization externalities: the elasticity of entrepreneurs' net monthly earnings with respect to population density is 0.02-0.03.

The UK water industry is one example of such a regime-indeed, it has emphasized the importance of maintaining the number of independent companies in order to preserve the robustness of the modeling. For example, in 2007, the Competition Commission considered whether the merger between Mid Kent Water and South East Water might prejudice the ability of the regulator (Ofwat) to make comparisons across water companies for the purposes of assessing performance and setting price controls. In this paper, we examine this issue and provide specific recommendations to regulators. Our cross-sectional results show that the impact of this merger is not significant. We demonstrate that joint estimation of all the sub-models using the 'seemingly unrelated regression' (SUR) procedure in a cross-section and/or panel data framework can dramatically improve the accuracy of the modeling. Moreover, the merger does not affect the confidence intervals significantly under such approaches, which still remain far superior to those under Ofwat's cross-sectional approach. Based on these results, we recommend that Ofwat and other regulators adopt SUR and/or panel data analysis and thereby reduce their reliance on having sufficient numbers of independent companies.","[Kumbhakar, Subal C.] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Horncastle, Alan P.] Oxera Consulting Ltd, Oxford OX1 1JD, England",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton,"Kumbhakar, SC (通讯作者)，SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",kkar@binghamton.edu; Alan.Horncastle@oxera.com,,,,,,,25,1,1,1,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

The interplay between these two types of corruption gives rise to a complex bidding problem that we tackle with numerical methods. Our results indicate that corruption does not only redistribute surplus away from the seller, but also distorts efficiency.

Also consistent with theory, both correlations are stronger when the supplying industry accounts for a large fraction of the producer's costs.

Tests using current survey data confirm substantial partial correlations and possible different 'effects' in mutual social control, institutional performance and homogeneity of values but no difference in work ethics.

We use a semiparametric model with a rich panel of manufacturing firms in Romania from 1995 to 2003 to estimate firm-level markups. We find that markups are higher in more concentrated industries and less exposed to foreign competition. Trade integration appears to generally increase competitive pressure on markups. Industries exposed to more international competition experience a larger change in markups following integration into the European Union's Common Market. However, as the initial impact of tariff reduction fades away, higher markups become an important element in firms' pricing strategies. We also find that foreign firms and private domestic firms charge significantly higher markups on average than state-owned enterprizes. Journal of Comparative Economics 38 (3) (2010) 340-356.

In this paper, we review the recent evolution of thinking and evidence regarding the effectiveness of activist fiscal policy. Although fiscal interventions aimed at stimulating and stabilizing the economy have returned to common use, their efficacy remains controversial. We review the debate about the traditional types of fiscal policy interventions, such as broad-based tax cuts and spending increases, as well as more targeted policies. While there have been improvements in estimates of the effects of broad-based policies, much of what has been learned recently concerns how such multipliers might vary with respect to economic conditions, such as the credit market disruptions and very low interest rates that were central features of the Great Recession. The eclectic and innovative interventions by the Federal Reserve and other central banks during this period highlight the imprecise divisions between monetary and fiscal policy and the many channels through which fiscal policies can be implemented.",CONSUMER RESPONSE; HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION; INCOME; CREDIT; TAXES; STATE; SALIENCE; REBATE; OUTPUT; MACRO,,"[Auerbach, Alan J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Harris, Benjamin H.] Brookings Inst, Econ Studies Program, Washington, DC 20036 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Brookings Institution,"Auerbach, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",auerbach@econ.berkeley.edu; wgale@brookings.edu; bharris@brookings.edu,,,,,,,86,69,78,0,24,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Both methods use 175 sample cities as described by De Vries (1984) in England, France, the Netherlands, and Spain as the basic unit of account.

Taking an extensive definition of the productive process of wind electricity as our starting point, we obtain results which allow us to identify, on the one hand, an essentially ex ante efficiency measure and, on the other hand, aspects of relevance for wind farm development companies (developers), technology suppliers and operators in terms of their economic impact. These results may also be of interest for regulators and other stakeholders in the sector. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of the simultaneous use of DEA and SFA methodologies.

This is an important proximate determinant of China's high growth rate. This paper gathers together the available evidence to explain why investment is so high: factors both on the demand and on the supply side, and in the latter case the availability of both resources and funds. It analyzes the rate of return on capital and its evolution, and the factors that have kept it up. It draws on the literature to explain the high saving rate, and considers why the imperfect capital market and institutional deficiencies have not constrained investment.

Two kinds of necessary and sufficient conditions for the factor price equalization condition are given.

This paper aims to assess the degree to which the South African Reserve Bank's (SARB) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has, since the introduction of inflation targeting, successfully communicated to the public its policy analysis, and, in particular, the expected future policy changes. It follows international literature in constructing a numerical index that is used to reflect the information content of the SARB's communications, specifically the monetary policy statements that accompanied each of the MPC meetings since 2000. This method allows us to judge, systematically, the degree to which the MPC has communicated successfully, and the evolution of that success over the past nine years. We find evidence that the MPC has succeeded in signalling their likely future policy decision with consistency over this period.

We give evidence that all time series contain certain periodic (mostly annual) patterns, and show how to use the wavelet transform, a tool of multiresolution analysis, for filtering purpose. The wavelet transform is also applied to separate the long-term trend from the short-term oscillation in the seasonal-adjusted log-prices. In all time series we find evidence for dynamic volatility, which we incorporate by using a bivariate GARCH model with constant correlation. Eventually we fit various models from the existing literature to the data, and come to the conclusion that our approach performs best. For the error distribution, the Normal Inverse Gaussian distribution shows the best fit. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

While a variety of agri-environmental modelling tools exists, ex-ante policy assessment tools capturing the institutional dimension are rare and need to be improved. In this paper, we introduce a standardized procedure for ex-ante modelling institutional aspects for policy implementation: the 'Procedure for Institutional Compatibility Assessment' (PICA). PICA has been designed as an explorative and flexible, yet formalized methodology that enables policy-makers to identify, at an early stage, potential institutional incompatibilities. After relating PICA to relevant approaches for policy assessment, we elaborate on its four distinct steps, use a core element of the EU Nitrate Directive to illustrate its function, and then provide model validation by means of a test case.","[Theesfeld, Insa] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Schleyer, Christian] Berlin Brandenburg Acad Sci & Humanities, Berlin, Germany; [Aznar, Olivier] Irstea, Clermont Ferrand, France",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO); INRAE,"Theesfeld, I (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe, Halle, Saale, Germany.",Theesfeld@iamo.de,", IAMO/G-2328-2012; Schleyer, Christian/I-6868-2012; Theesfeld, Insa/AAE-2214-2020","Schleyer, Christian/0000-0002-9604-1653; Theesfeld, Insa/0000-0002-0200-756X",,,,,57,23,24,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

LMP markets are typically coupled with periodic auctions of financial transmission rights (FTRs) to hedge transmission price risks. While LMP designs offer considerable advantages, forward price discovery in these markets requires participants to form efficient expectations on spot congestion price differences. In this paper, we examine trends in the efficiency of one of the early LMP markets, the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO), analyzing a panel data set of over 9000 contracts over a six-year period beginning September 2000. We show that NYISO FTR markets were inefficient in their early years, but that market participants learned to predict forward prices and thus efficiency improved for FTRs not solely within the New York City/Long Island sub-region. FTRs within this sub-region, which has a number of special characteristics, remain relatively inefficient. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The panel tests are based on the well known KPSS test (cf. Kwiatkowski et al.) which considers two models: stationarity around a deterministic level and stationarity around a deterministic trend. There is no study, as far as we know, on the statistical properties of the test when the wrong model is used. We also consider the case of the simultaneous presence of the two types of models in a panel. We employ two asymptotics: joint asymptotic, T, N -> infinity simultaneously, and T fixed and N allowed to grow indefinitely. We use Monte Carlo experiments to investigate the effects of misspecification in sample sizes usually used in practice. The results indicate that the assumption that T is fixed rather than asymptotic leads to tests that have less size distortions, particularly for relatively small T with large N panels (micro-panels) than the tests derived under the joint asymptotics. We also find that choosing a deterministic trend when a deterministic level is true does not significantly affect the properties of the test. But, choosing a deterministic level when a deterministic trend is true leads to extreme over-rejections. Therefore, when unsure about which model has generated the data, it is suggested to use the model with a trend. We also propose a new statistic for testing for stationarity in mixed panel data where the mixture is known. The performance of this new test is very good for both cases of T asymptotic and T fixed. The statistic for T asymptotic is slightly undersized when T is very small (< 10).","[Hadri, Kaddour] Queens Univ Belfast, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland; [Rao, Yao; Bu, Ruijun] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England",Queens University Belfast; University of Liverpool,"Hadri, K (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, 25 Univ Sq, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland.",K.Hadri@QUB.ac.uk,,,,,,,25,5,5,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0307-3378,,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Nested and non-nested tests are used to select a specification for each country, and in-sample predictive capacity and stability are analyzed. Higher-dimension models tend to perform better than parsimonious models with one lead and one lag.

The questions raised in the paper is whether there has been a trend towards more economic mobility, and whether conclusions about change based on a joint classification of both mother and father differ from those based on conventional classifications. These questions are addressed on the basis of register data on the earnings of the total Norwegian population of mothers, fathers and children from 1967 and onwards. The analyses focus on the earnings of the cohorts born between 1955 and 1970, and their earnings at the age of 34-35. The results do not support the argument in previous research that intergenerational economic mobility has increased in Norway. Moreover, the results based on a conventional approach differ from those based on a joint classification including the earnings of both mother and father. Using the latter approach there is no indication of a trend towards greater openness.","Univ Oslo, Dept Sociol & Human Geog, N-0317 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Hansen, MN (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Sociol & Human Geog, POB 1096, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.",mnhansen@sosiologi.uio.no,,,,,,,33,24,25,1,18,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

As an economist and as someone who served 13 years on the School Committee in Brookline Massachusetts, until May 2009, I have been appalled by the limited ability of districts to analyze these data; I have been equally appalled by the cavalier manner in which economists use test scores and related measures in their analyses. The summary data currently provided are very hard to interpret, and policymakers, who typically lack statistical sophistication, cannot easily use them to assess progress. In some domains, most notably the use of average test scores to evaluate teachers or schools, the education community is aware of the biases and has sought better measures. The economics and statistics communities have both responded to and created this demand by developing value-added measures that carry a scientific aura. However, economists have largely failed to recognize many of the problems with such measures. These problems are sufficiently important that they should preclude any automatic link between these measures and rewards or sanctions. They do, however, contain information and can be used as a catalyst for more careful evaluation of teachers and schools, and as a lever to induce principals and other administrators to act on their knowledge.","[Lang, Kevin] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Lang, Kevin] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lang, Kevin] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany",Boston University; National Bureau of Economic Research; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Lang, K (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",lang@bu.edu,,"Lang, Kevin/0000-0002-8497-1706",,,,,10,17,24,0,10,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Before 2005 when the yuan/dollar rate was credibly fixed, it helped anchor China's domestic price level. But gradual RMB appreciation from July 2005 to July 2008 created a one-way-bet that disordered China's financial markets in two respects: (i) no private capital outflows to finance China's huge trade surplus leading to an undue build up of official exchange reserves and erosion of monetary control, and (ii) a breakdown of the forward exchange market in 2007-2008 so that exporters could no longer get trade credit - probably worsening the severe slump in Chinese exports. But after July 2008, the credit crunch induced an unexpected unwinding of the dollar carry trade leading to a sharp appreciation in the dollar's effective exchange rate. The People's Bank of China (PBC) then stopped RMB appreciation against the dollar. China's forward exchange market was restored and monetary control regained. Now the PBC can better support the fiscal stimulus by promoting a parallel expansion of bank credit.(1) But, since March 2009, the fall in the dollar (with the RMB tied to it) again threatens to undermine the yuan/dollar rate and China's monetary stability.","[Mckinnon, Ronald; Lee, Brian; Wang, Yi David] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Mckinnon, R (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",mckinnon@stanford.edu; brianbj.lee@gmail.com; dyiwang@stanford.edu,,,,,,,7,7,10,0,20,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Demographic and environmental pressures are found to have a less important direct impact, although they may have an indirect impact on migration through conflict and job opportunities.

A prudent government deliberately underestimates future national income and the tax base, especially if the variance and persistence of shocks hitting the tax base are large and the tax rate is high. As a precaution the tax rate is thus set higher and public spending lower to build precautionary buffers. This leads to gradual reductions in debt and debt service over time and thus, depending on political preferences, cuts in taxes or increases in public spending. Prudence offsets the intertemporal spending, tax and debt biases resulting from common-pool distortions. Appointing a strong finance minister with as many voting rights as the spending ministers combined ensures that the intratemporal common-pool distortions of an excessively large public sector are eliminated. A strong and prudent minister of finance can thus offset the impatient profligacy of squabbling spending ministers. However, if voters care about outcomes on election eve, finance ministers are tempted to build excessive precautionary buffers early on to dish out tax cuts and boost spending on election eve. Too much prudence may thus be abused for short-run electoral gains.","[van der Ploeg, Frederick] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [van der Ploeg, Frederick] Univ Amsterdam, Mlnt, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Oxford; University of Amsterdam,"van der Ploeg, F (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",rick.vanderploeg@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,27,14,15,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

We use a new data set to compare the drop in activity in the industrialized countries for seven activity indicators. This is done under the assumption that the recent crisis leveled off in mid-2009 for production and will do so for unemployment in 2010. Our data indicate that the recent crisis indeed had the potential to be another Great Depression, as shown by the speed and simultaneity of the decline in the first nine months. However, if we assume that a large second dip can be avoided, the drop in all indicators will have been smaller than during the Great Depression. This holds true specifically for GDP, employment and prices, and least for manufacturing output. The difference in the depth in the crises concurs with differences in policy reaction. This time monetary policy and fiscal policy were applied courageously, speedily and partly internationally coordinated. During the Great Depression for several years fiscal policy tried to stabilize budgets instead of aggregate demand, and either monetary policy was not applied or was rather ineffective insofar as deflation turned lower nominal interest rates into higher real rates. Only future research will be able to prove the exact impact of economic policy, but the current tentative conclusion is that economic policy prevented the recent crisis from developing into a second Great Depression. This is also a partial vindication for economists. The majority of them might not have been able to predict the crisis, but the science did learn its lesson from the Great Depression and was able to give decent policy advice to at least limit the depth of the recent crisis.","[Aiginger, Karl] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Aiginger, Karl] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, A-1030 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Aiginger, K (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",Karl.Aiginger@wifo.ac.at,,,,,,,57,2,6,0,8,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAY 25,2010,4.0,,,,,,,,201018,,,,,42,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,865AR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298283400001,0

Yet, banks' response to international macroeconomic conditions remains largely unexplored. We use a novel dataset on banks' international portfolios to answer three questions. First, what are the long-run determinants of banks' international portfolios? Second, how do banks' international portfolios adjust to short-run macroeconomic developments? Third, does the speed of adjustment change with the degree of financial integration? We find that, in the long-run, market size has a positive impact on foreign assets and liabilities. An increase in the interest differential between the home and the foreign economy lowers foreign assets and increases foreign liabilities. Foreign trade has a positive impact on international bank portfolios, which is independent from the effect of other macroeconomic variables. Short-run dynamics show heterogeneity across countries, but these dynamics can partly be explained with gravity-type variables.","[Blank, Sven; Buch, Claudia M.] Univ Tubingen, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Blank, S (通讯作者)，Univ Tubingen, Mohlstr 36, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany.",sven.blank@uni-tuebingen.de; claudia.buch@uni-tuebingen.de,,,,,,,24,5,5,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

The combined impacts of these two policy initiatives are studied in detail on trade flows, real output, employment and investment both at the aggregate and industry levels in China, the U.S., Canada and other countries/regions. The simulation results suggest that China's real gross domestic product (GDP) would increase by over 2 percent, mainly due to a large increase in the output of textiles and apparel industries. India too would gain considerably in these two industries from the removal of the trade barriers. Textiles and apparel industries will face considerable adjustment challenges in North America particularly in the U.S. and Canada, implying output and employment losses ranging between 20 and 30 percent. However, the output and employment gains in other North American industries will be more than offset the losses in textiles and apparel industries. Bilateral trade between China and North American economies would increase between 15 and 20 percent, but over all economic gain would be modest. Asian economies will also experience significant increase in trade with China and the output impacts are positive but modest. (C) 2010 Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Non-stationarity of the real exchange rate is tested within a Markov regime-switching framework. Two new concepts of PPP are defined that allow for real exchange behaviour to switch between stationary and non-stationary regimes (partial PPP) or between stationary regimes of differing degrees of persistence (varied PPP). The results indicate that each country is characterized by at least one stationary regime. Indeed, five countries are characterized by two such regimes. Further analysis indicates that the Asian crisis of 1997 gave mixed impetus to the achievement of long-run PPP.","Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Sch Management, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand",University of Waikato,"Holmes, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Sch Management, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand.",holmesmj@waikato.ac.nz,"Holmes, Mark/A-4117-2010","Holmes, Mark/0000-0002-1771-9324",,,,,25,6,6,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

Our cascade measure is designed to detect informational cascade in high-frequency stock market prices. First, we find evidence of cascades on approximately 12% of the days when the NYSE experiences, on average, large price increases. This percentage increases to about 20% on days experiencing large price decreases, on average. Second, we find evidence that the interarrival times of trades in those stocks exhibiting significant informational cascades are generated by a nonlinear stochastic process. Third, the evidence supporting cascades is largely confined to smaller stocks and to stocks followed by fewer security analysts. Last, the occurrence of cascades appears to correlate with the incorporation of fundamental information into security prices.","[Patterson, Douglas M.] Virginia Tech, Dept Finance, RB Pamplin Coll Business, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Sharma, Vivek] Univ Michigan, Dearborn, MI 48128 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Patterson, DM (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Dept Finance, RB Pamplin Coll Business, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",amex@vt.edu,,"Patterson, Douglas/0000-0001-5829-082X",,,,,46,3,3,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We employ an instrumental variable (IV) projection method to approximate inflation expectations, and show that the inference based on this approach can differ significantly from the one based on rational expectations. More importantly, using an IV test for serial correlation in the GMM context, we find that the error term in the stylized NKPC model is significantly serially correlated. To compensate for the serial correlation problem, we propose an extended framework which can be easily rationalized in terms of sticky price setting of backward-looking firms. Empirical results show that further lags of inflation are needed in the hybrid specification of the NKPC in order to rule out serial correlation in the Euler equation.","[Zhang, Chengsi] Renmin Univ China, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Sch Finance, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Clovis, Joel] Univ E Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",Renmin University of China; University of East Anglia,"Zhang, CS (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Sch Finance, 59 Zhong Guan Cun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",Zhangcs@ruc.edu.cn; J.clovis@uea.ac.uk,,,,,,,42,8,9,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

It presents evidence suggesting that periods when short-term interest rates were persistently and significantly below what Taylor rules would prescribe are correlated with increases in asset prices, especially as regards housing, though no systematic effects are identified on equity markets. Significant asset price increases, however, can also occur when interest rates are in line with Taylor rules, possibly associated with periods of financial deregulation and/or innovation. Finding also some support for a link of countries' pre-crisis monetary stance with the extent to which their financial sectors were hit during the recent crisis, the paper argues that accommodating monetary policy over the period 2002-2005, probably in combination with rapid financial market innovation, would, in retrospect, seem to have been among the factors behind the run-up in asset prices and financial imbalances-the (partial) unwinding of which helped trigger the recent financial market crisis.","OECD, Dept Econ, F-75775 Paris 16, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Ahrend, R (通讯作者)，OECD, Dept Econ, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",Rudiger.Ahrend@oecd.org,,,,,,,42,19,22,0,9,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,APR 14,2010,4.0,,,,,,,,201012,,,,,31,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,865AL,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298282700001,0

Canada's trail-blazing experience demonstrated that a flexible exchange rate can operate in stable and effective manner under a high degree of capital mobility. Equally important, it showed that monetary policy needs to be conducted differently under a flexible exchange rate and capital mobility. In 1962, Canada returned to the Bretton Woods system as a prodigal son, after a period of controversial monetary policy. This paper critically analyzes the interaction between Canadian and IMF officials regarding Canada's exchange rate policy in view of the economic circumstances and the prevailing wisdom at the time. It also examines the impact on IMF research and policy because the Canadian experience influenced the work of Robert Mundell and Marcus Fleming, resulting in the development of the Mundell-Fleming model. Thus, the Canadian floating rate experience not only had important implications for the IMF and the Bretton Woods system, but also for macroeconomic theory and policy in open economies.","[Schembri, Lawrence L.] Bank Canada, Int Dept, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Bordo, Michael D.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA; [Gomes, Tamara] Bank Canada, Financial Stabil Dept, Ottawa, ON, Canada",Bank of Canada; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Bank of Canada,"Schembri, LL (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, Int Dept, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",bordo@econ.rutgers.edu; tgomes@bankofcanada.ca; lschembri@bankofcanada.ca,,,,,,,65,2,3,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.
