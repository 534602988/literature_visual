At that time, the Texas price reflected a reasonably competitive market. There have been dramatic increases in the demand or gas, and there are various bottlenecks in the supply of gas. As a result, the price of gas in Texas now reflects the quasi-rents created by these bottlenecks. We show that it is optimal for the Mexican government to use the netback rule based on the Texas price of gas to set the price of gas in Mexico even though the Texas market cannot be considered a competitive market, and the Texas price for gas reflects quasi-rents created by various bottlenecks.","[Brito, Dagobert L.] Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Brito, Dagobert L.] Rice Univ, Baker Inst, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Rosellon, Juan] CIDE, Mexico City 01210, DF, Mexico; [Rosellon, Juan] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Mexico City 01210, DF, Mexico",Rice University; Rice University; Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

Markets work because they remunerate good judgment and punish mistakes. Indeed, modern contract theory is based on the assumption that principals are less risk averse than agents. We investigate if the risk preferences of entrepreneurs are different from those of laborers by implementing experiments with a random sample of the population in a fast-growing, small-manufacturing, economic cluster. As assumed by theory, we find that entrepreneurs are more likely to take risks than hired managers. These results are robust to the inclusion of a series of controls. This lends support to the idea that risk preferences is an important determinant of selection into occupations. Finally, our lotteries are good predictors of financial decisions, thus giving support to the external validity of our risk measures and experimental methods (JEL C93, D81, D86).","[Castillo, Marco; Petrie, Ragan] George Mason Univ, Interdisciplinary Ctr Econ Sci, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Torero, Maximo] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA",George Mason University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Castillo, M (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Interdisciplinary Ctr Econ Sci, 4400 Univ Dr,MSN 1B2, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",mcastil8@gmu.edu; rpetrie1@gmu.edu; m.torero@cgiar.org,"Petrie, Ragan/AAQ-2892-2021","Petrie, Ragan/0000-0002-9101-1666; Torero, Maximo/0000-0002-4863-3371; Castillo, Marco/0000-0003-0756-7184",,,,,23,14,16,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

Making use of a model of vertical and horizontal differentiation, within which jurisdictions compete by providing public goods and levying taxes in order to attract firms and shoppers, this paper characterizes the noncooperative equilibrium. It also evaluates the welfare implications for the jurisdictions of a popular policy of tax coordination: The imposition of a minimum tax. It is shown that the interaction of the two markets affects the intensity of tax competition and the degree of optimal vertical differentiation chosen by the competing jurisdictions. Though the noncooperative equilibrium is, as it is typically the case, inefficient such inefficiency is mitigated by the strength of the interaction in the two markets. A minimum tax policy is shown to be effective when the strength of the interaction is weak and ineffective when it is strong.","[Kotsogiannis, Christos] Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Exeter EX4 4PU, Devon, England; [Serfes, Konstantinos] Drexel Univ, Bennett S LeBow Coll Business, Dept Econ & Int Business, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Exeter; Drexel University,"Kotsogiannis, C (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Rennes Dr, Exeter EX4 4PU, Devon, England.",c.kotsogiannis@exeter.ac.uk; ks346@drexel.edu,,"Kotsogiannis, Christos/0000-0002-1081-4046",,,,,22,8,10,1,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

This paper studies the evolution of such norms in a conflict. Individuals play with the same opponent for a number of rounds, during which they adapt their behavior according to a myopic best response dynamic. The payoffs earned during this equilibration period enter into the cultural evolutionary process that determines which norms that survive. It is found that if agents play against the same opponent for sufficiently many times, then only norms that reduce conflict relative to the Nash equilibrium survive. If instead agents meet the same opponent only once, then only agents that play the Nash equilibrium survive. By way of example it is also shown that in the intermediate case the outcome of evolution can be either that conflict reducing norms or Nash behavior dominates. These results indicate that the common practice of disregarding equilibration in models of preference evolution is not without a cost.","Stockholm Sch Econ, Dept Econ, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm School of Economics,"Mohlin, E (通讯作者)，Stockholm Sch Econ, Dept Econ, POB 6501, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden.",erik.mohlin@hhs.se,,,,,,,30,5,5,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

However, mean reverting processes are rarely used in investment models in the literature. In most models, geometric Brownian motion processes are used for tractability. In this paper, a firm's entry and exit decisions when the output equilibrium price follows an exogenous mean reverting process are examined, and then compared to the decisions of the firm under the usually employed assumption of lognormally distributed output price, presented in Dixit (1989a). By extending previous work by Sarkar (2003) to account for costly reversibility, we show that mean reversion has a significant effect, not only on firm-specific entry and exit decisions, but also on the balance of entering and exiting firms in an industry/market. Thus it would be erroneous to use the more tractable geometric Brownian motion process as an approximation for a mean-reverting process in models and investigations of aggregate industry investment.

This paper explains the cause of this anomaly. Deviations in the forward market are caused by an increase in US dollar-to-RMB conversion restrictions. Given that Chinese monetary authorities want to prevent market participants from taking advantage of the predictable appreciation of the RMB, China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange has to tighten up the control on US dollar-to-RMB conversions. Under the tightened conversion restrictions, similar deviations will resurface in the forward market whenever hot money inflow increases. One way to avoid covered interest rate parity violations in the forward market is to decrease hot money inflow into China by maintaining a stable and credible exchange rate policy.","Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Wang, YD (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",dyiwang@stanford.edu,,,,,,,16,5,7,1,14,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,APR,2010,18.0,2,,,,,96,120,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2010.01191.x,0.0,,,25,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,569WR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275634000006,0

In this form, producers and consumers rely on demand and price forecasts to decide their bidding strategies, allocate assets, negotiate bilateral contracts, hedge risks, and plan facility investments. A basic feature of efficient market hypothesis is the absence of correlations between price increments over any time scale leading to random walk-type behavior of prices, so arbitrage is not possible. However, recent studies have suggested that this is not the case and correlations are present in the behavior of diverse electricity markets. In this paper, a temporal quantification of electricity market correlations is made by means of detrended fluctuation and Allan analyses. The approach is applied to two Canadian electricity markets, Ontario and Alberta. The results show the existence of correlations in both demand and prices, exhibiting complex time-dependent behavior with lower correlations in winter while higher in summer. Relatively steady annual cycles in demand but unstable cycles in prices are detected. On the other hand, the more significant nonlinear effects (measured in terms of a multifractality index) are found for winter months, while the converse behavior is displayed during the summer period. In terms of forecasting models, our results Suggest that nonlinear recursive models (e.g., feedback NNs) should be used for accurate day-ahead price estimation. In contrast, linear models can suffice for demand forecasting purposes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The focus of this study is to investigate the presence of increasing returns to agglomeration in the spatial structure of wages in France, using the methodology developed by Fingleton and initially used in the UK. The central finding is the statistically significant presence of such returns to density for France, as was the case for the UK in the original study. Compared to Fingleton's original work, it is shown that returns to density play a larger role in explaining French labour productivity, while commuting plays a smaller role than in the UK.","[Barde, Sylvain] OFCE, Dept Res Innovat & Competit, F-06560 Valbonne, France",,"Barde, S (通讯作者)，OFCE, Dept Res Innovat & Competit, 250 Rue Albert Einstein, F-06560 Valbonne, France.",sylvain.barde@ofce.sciences-po.fr,"Barde, Sylvain/AAF-3768-2020","Barde, Sylvain/0000-0003-1465-8236",,,,,20,8,8,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

However, the link between variations in the degree of inequality and variations in poverty is not well documented. The literature, for instance, does not provide any satisfying tool for predicting how a small relative variation in the Gini index may be associated with a variation in the headcount index. In the present paper, we define a family of Lorenz curve transformations that can directly be interpreted in terms of relative variations of known inequality measures. Then, we extend Kakwani's (Rev Income Wealth 39(2):121-139, 1993) methodology for the calculation of inequality elasticities of poverty. Improvements are threefold with respect to Kakwani's work. First, our formulas are not confined to the sole Gini index. Secondly, they embrace the uncertainty and the complexity of the mechanical link between inequality and poverty. Third, using some flexible functional form, one can easily perform an accurate estimation of the point inequality elasticities of poverty corresponding to observed variations of a given income distribution. We also propose a simple measure that may be helpful to assess how pro-poor are inequality variations by comparing the observed elasticities with the set of theoretical elasticities that could be obtained from the initial income distribution.","Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, Fac Droit Sci Polit Econ & Gest, F-06050 Nice 1, France",Universite Cote d'Azur,"Bresson, F (通讯作者)，Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, Fac Droit Sci Polit Econ & Gest, Ave Doyen Louis Trotabas, F-06050 Nice 1, France.",florent.bresson@unice.fr,,,,,,,41,4,4,1,13,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

The paper shows that the decision to enter a new market as well as the choice whether to invest at home or abroad depend on global monetary and productivity conditions. I find that a domestic monetary expansion might favor or deter start-up investments, depending on whether the potential entrant is a national or a multinational firm. Moreover, a structural policy change, as an increase in the degree of monetary stabilization, has a positive impact on trend investments in all sectors. Firms' dynamics, in turn, amplifies consumption and employment spillovers in the world economy. I Stress that this may have non-negligible consequences for welfare. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We construct a model in which individuals make labor/leisure choices over their lifetimes subject to uncertainty about their dates of death. In an environment with high mortality, an individual who saves for retirement faces a high risk of dying before he can enjoy his planned leisure. In this case, the optimal plan is for people to work until they die. As mortality falls, however, it becomes optimal to plan, and save for, retirement. We analyze our model using two mathematical formulations of the survival function as well as data on actual changes in the US life table over the last century, and show that this uncertainty effect of declining mortality would have more than outweighed the horizon effect by which rising life expectancy would have led to later retirement.","[Weil, David N.] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Kalemli-Ozcan, Sebnem] Univ Houston, Houston, TX USA; [Kalemli-Ozcan, Sebnem; Weil, David N.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Brown University; University of Houston System; University of Houston; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Weil, DN (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",David_Weil@brown.edu,,"Weil, David/0000-0002-1092-6056",NICHD NIH HHS [R24 HD041020] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,37,40,51,1,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

This paper attempts to answer the question of why, when given two consumers with the same income level and socio-economic background, does one consumer choose to replace an older, malfunctioning household product while the other chooses to have the product repaired for further reuse. To help address this question an enhanced replacement model is presented and empirically tested. The replacement model has been around for some time, helping consumers and firms make capital budgeting decisions.

We develop a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model in which bank capital mitigates an agency problem between banks and their creditors. As a result, the capital position of banks affects their ability to attract loanable funds and therefore influences the business cycle through a bank capital channel of transmission. We find that the bank capital channel greatly amplifies and propagates the effects of technology shocks on output, investment and inflation. Moreover, bank capital shocks create sizeable declines in output and investment. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

We consider a two-country, two-good, two-factor general equilibrium model with sector-specific externalities. We show that some country's expectation-driven fluctuations can spread throughout the world once trade opens even if the other country has determinacy under autarky. We thus prove that under free trade, globalization and market integration can have destabilizing effects on a country's competitive equilibrium. Finally, we characterize a configuration in which opening to international trade improves the stationary welfare at the world level but deteriorates the stationary welfare of the country that imports investment goods and exports consumption goods. We conclude that in opposition to the standard belief, international trade might not be beneficial to all trading partners in the long run.","[Nishimura, Kazuo; Venditti, Alain; Yano, Makoto] Kyoto Univ, Inst Econ Res, Kyoto, Japan; [Venditti, Alain] Groupement Rech Econ Quantitat Aix Marseille, CNRS, Marseille, France; [Venditti, Alain] EDHEC, Nice, France",Kyoto University; Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Catholique de Lille; EDHEC Business School,"Nishimura, K (通讯作者)，Kyoto Univ, Inst Econ Res, Kyoto, Japan.",venditti@ehess.univ-mrs.fr,,,,,,,17,8,9,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1742-7355,1742-7363,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

The auditing profession is based on what looks like a structural infirmity: auditors are paid by the companies they audit. An old German proverb holds: Whose bread I eat, his song I sing. While this saying was originally meant as a prayer of thanksgiving, the old proverb takes on a darker meaning for those who study the auditing profession. This paper begins with an overview of the practice of audits, the auditing profession, and the problems that auditors continue to face in terms not only of providing audits of high quality, but also in providing audits that investors feel comfortable trusting to be of high quality. It then turns to a number of reforms that have been proposed, including ways of building reputation, liability reform, capitalizing or insuring auditing firms, and greater competition in the auditing profession. However, none of these suggested reforms, individually or collectively, severs the agency relation between the client management and the auditors. As a result, the conflict of interest, although it can be mitigated by some of these reforms, continues to threaten auditors' independence, both real and perceived. In conclusion, I'll discuss my own proposal for financial statements insurance, which would redefine the relationship between auditors and firms in such a way that auditors would no longer be beholden to management.","NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10006 USA",New York University,"Ronen, J (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10006 USA.",jronen@stern.nyu.edu,,,,,,,67,25,27,0,18,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Using quarterly data from the mid-1990s, convergence is evaluated through a series of unit root and cointegration tests. Both univariate and panel tests are performed, including tests for a large number of combinations of inflation and interest rates satisfying the Maastricht inflation and long-term interest rate criteria. It is generally found that nominal convergence in inflation has been attained among the NMS. There is, however, less evidence of convergence in long-term interest rates. Possible exceptions include Estonia and the Czech Republic and, to a lesser extent, Slovakia which has since joined the euro area. There is also a large degree of consistency between the various unit root and cointegration tests in both the univariate and panel variations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Some new time-series econometric methods that have been recently developed to conduct unit root and cointegration tests are used in the analysis, allowing for an endogenously determined structural change in the time period studied. It also proposes a new type of dynamic externalities, called Network dynamic externalities, to represent knowledge spillovers resulting from the whole agglomerated area via transportation networks, and shows that they have cointegrated relations with the total factor productivity (TFP) of the manufacturing, finance, wholesale and retail trade, as well as the overall industries. In addition, evidence is also found that Marshall-Arrow-Romer (MAR) dynamic externalities, which are associated with own industrial production concentration, affect the TFP of most industries selected for estimation. However, Jacobs dynamic externalities, which are represented by the diversity of industrial production, only contribute to the TFP of the services industry, and Porter dynamic externalities, which are expressed by the competitiveness within industries, do not influence the selected industrial TFP.

The skill premium affects both the profitability of education and the profitability of migration. We propose a two country, median voter model, where the equilibrium tax policy is shaped by the desire of the median voter to promote skill formation and to avoid emigration of skilled individuals. Our paper shows that the effect of an increase in the skill premium on redistributive programs depends on the initial level of the skill premium. Below a critical level, an increase in the skill premium is met by an increase in the tax rate. Beyond this level, however, a further rise in the skill premium leads to a fall in the tax rate, and hence a sharp increase in post-tax inequality.","[Bjorvatn, Kjetil; Cappelen, Alexander W.] Norwegian Sch Econ & Business Adm, N-5035 Bergen, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Bjorvatn, K (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ & Business Adm, N-5035 Bergen, Norway.",Kjetil.Bjorvatn@nhh.no,"CAPPELEN, ALEXANDER/AAY-1676-2021",,,,,,10,1,1,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Using survey data, we construct indices of university autonomy and competition for both Europe and the United States. We show that there are strong positive correlations between these indices and multiple measures of university output. To obtain causal evidence, we investigate exogenous shocks to US universities' expenditures over three decades. These shocks arise through the political appointment process, which we use to generate instrumental variables. We find that an exogenous increase in a university's expenditure generates more output, measured by either patents or publications, if the university is more autonomous and faces more competition. Exploiting variation over time in the 'stakes' of competitions for US federal research grants, we also find that universities generate more output for a given expenditure when research competitions are high stakes. We draw lessons, arguing that European universities could benefit from a combination of greater autonomy and greater accountability. Greater accountability might come through increased reliance on competitive grants, enhanced competition for students and faculty (promoted by reforms that increase mobility), and yardstick competitions (which often take the form of assessment exercises). --- Philippe Aghion, Mathias Dewatripont, Caroline Hoxby, Andreu Mas-Colell and Andre Sapir.","[Aghion, Philippe] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Aghion, Philippe] Harvard Univ, Bruegel, CEPR, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Aghion, Philippe; Hoxby, Caroline M.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Libre Brussels, Brussels, Belgium; [Dewatripont, Mathias; Sapir, Andre] Univ Libre Brussels, Bruegel, CEPR, Brussels, Belgium; [Hoxby, Caroline M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Mas-Colell, Andreu] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain",Harvard University; Harvard University; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); National Bureau of Economic Research; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Stanford University; Pompeu Fabra University,"Aghion, P (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, 1805 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",paghion@fas.harvard.edu; mdewat@ulb.ac.be; choxby@stanford.edu; andreu.mas-colell@upf.edu; asapir@ulb.ac.be,"Sapir, Andre/IAS-0343-2023; Hoxby, Caroline M/B-2392-2009","Sapir, Andre/0000-0001-6493-0352; Mas-Colell, Andreu/0000-0003-0312-4730; AGHION, Philippe/0000-0002-9019-1677",,,,,69,166,182,0,87,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0266-4658,,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

The outcome of the study shows an improvement of the Romanian financial system stability during the period 1999-2007. The constructed aggregate index captures the financial turbulences periods like the 1998-1999 Romanian banking crisis and 2007 subprime crisis.

The estimated model accurately matches the empirical distribution function of individual price durations for the US and the euro area. Incorporating these micro-based pricing rules into a DSGE model, we find that nominal shocks have a greater real impact in the fully heterogeneous economy than in the standard Calvo model. We also find that nominal and real shocks bring about a reallocation of resources among sectors.

Our experiment controls for different information levels of voters, as well as the size of the electorate, the distribution of preferences and other theoretically relevant parameters. The design varies the share of partisan voters and the prior belief about a payoff relevant state of the world. Our results support the equilibrium predictions of the Feddersen-Pesendorfer model. The voters act as if they are aware of the swing voter's curse and adjust their behaviour to compensate. While the compensation is not complete and there is some heterogeneity in individual behaviour, we find that aggregate outcomes, such as efficiency, turnout and margin of victory, closely track the theoretical predictions.","[Battaglini, Marco] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Morton, Rebecca B.] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Palfrey, Thomas R.] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",Princeton University; New York University; California Institute of Technology,"Battaglini, M (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,"Battaglini, Marco/0000-0001-9690-0721",,,,,43,97,109,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Their primary innovation is a regime-switching model of the real interest rate. This paper extends that model to include work-in-process and raw material inventories as well as industries that produce to order. A cointegrating model similar to that of MMS is then estimated for all three types of inventories and all industries in both the durables and nondurables sectors. The results reinforce the MMS conclusion of a long-run inverse relationship between the real interest rate and finished goods during the 1967-1997 period. But the results for the durables sectors, work-in-process and raw materials, and the 1997-2007 period are generally much less supportive. Moreover, results for the manufacturing aggregates suggest that the overall responses are small.","Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis,"Bivin, DG (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.",dbivin@iupui.edu,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

While exports have always been important in sustaining Taiwan's economic growth, the driving force behind exports has changed from inward investment to outward investment. The analysis carried out is from an international political economy perspective and takes a historical overview. It argues that the US, Japan and China pursued economic policies based on their own economic interests. These foreign governments' economic policies together with their entrepreneurs' business interests are the more important variables for shaping Taiwan's economic structure. During the 1960s, without the US's financial guarantees for American MNCs and security guarantees for the island, the KMT's foreign investment promotion policy would not have been as successful as it was when Taiwan faced a military threat from China. The US and Japanese economic policies changed, and since the 1970s competition between their businesses in the world market has integrated Taiwan into a regional production network. Subsequent to the Sino-US rapprochement, the US gradually opened up its market towards China. With America's rising trade barriers against Taiwanese-made products, Taiwanese entrepreneurs found profits by investing in China. Even though the Taiwanese Government tried hard to pull back the mounting outward investment in China, it was unable to achieve it. In contrast to the traditional point of view, this paper offers insights into the economic interaction between first the US and Japan and later between the US and China that resulted in Taiwan's economic transformation.","[Chiang, Min-Hua] Commerce Dev Res Inst, Taipei, Taiwan; [Gerbier, Bernard] Univ Pierre Mendes, UFR Econ, Grenoble, France",Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA),"Chiang, MH (通讯作者)，Commerce Dev Res Inst, Taipei, Taiwan.",monastere628@gmail.com,,,,,,,51,3,4,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Such reforms aimed at increasing the employment rates, at improving work quality and labor productivity and social and territorial cohesion; in other words, at updating and upgrading the European labor markets. In order to reach such aims, the flexicurity concept was considered and employed as a key strategic framework. Flexicurity itself may be defined as an integrated strategy aiming to improve both the labor market flexibility and job security, implying successful switching between educational system and labor market, between jobs, between unemployment and inactivity and employment, and between job and retirement. We propose a possible assessment of the performances of the flexicurity policies by using certain composite indicators that allow for a multidimensional appraisal of flexicurity in the EU countries, providing also elements for comparison between the EU countries and regions (especially the New Member States and their regions).","[Chilian, Mihaela-Nona; Albu, Lucian-Liviu; Iordan, Marioara] Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania",,"Chilian, MN (通讯作者)，Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania.",cnona@ipe.ro; albul@ipe.ro; miordan@ipe.ro,"Albu, Lucian Liviu/C-4524-2011",,,,,,20,4,4,0,13,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

We find that the propensity to invest in stocks is strongly associated with cognitive abilities, for both direct stock market participation and indirect participation through mutual funds and retirement accounts. Since the decision to invest in less information-intensive assets (such as bonds) is less strongly related to cognitive abilities, we conclude that the association between cognitive abilities and stockholding is driven by information constraints, rather than by features of preferences or psychological traits.

Increasingly it is recognized that long term relationships with clients are becoming the source of unique value in today's highly competitive markets. This article analyses relationship efforts made by an organization and a client, reveals their links with relationship outcomes. Having generalized the analysis of the concept of relationship, it is stated that long-term relationships develop through repeated interactions between a client and an organization, during which both parties make certain relationship efforts, resulting in the formation of a bundle of bonds that reflect the nature of relationship. Considering the imperatives of the latest marketing theories, recognizing that the focus in marketing has moved from an exchange of the tangible value to one that increasingly includes the intangible value (Vargo & Lusch, 2004), various forms of relationship efforts made by organization are grouped into tangible and intangible relationship effort categories. In the line with the new dominant logic of marketing stating that there should be a focus on clients as active participants' client relationship efforts as a separate construct is distinguished in this article. Acknowledging the importance of extended understanding of relationship outcomes, which take the form of various attitudinal concepts (trust, commitment, attachment), a distinction between positive and negative bonds, is made. It could be reasonably stated that the sector of sport and health clubs enables to reveal the mentioned aspects which are in the focus of this article. This paper integrates theories of organizations' resources (Vargo & Lusch 2004) and clients' resources (Arnould et al., 2006) by exploring the emotional aspects of relationships (the aspects of client involvement, client-to-client interactions), and testing the links between relationship efforts and relationship outcomes. The hypothesis tested in this article confirms that intangible relationship efforts as compared with tangible ones have a stronger impact on positive bonds, whereas tangible relationship efforts besides the impact on positive bonds have also a link with negative bonds. The ascertained relation between client relationship efforts and positive bonds proves the importance of active client role in developing meaningful long-term relationships. However, we advance existing literature and extend previous research by demonstrating that, depending on the type of relationship efforts examined, the magnitude of the effects of relationship outcome structure differs.","[Damkuviene, Milda; Balciunas, Sigitas] Siauliai Univ, LT-78366 Shiauliai, Lithuania",Siauliai University,"Damkuviene, M (通讯作者)，Siauliai Univ, Architektu Str 1, LT-78366 Shiauliai, Lithuania.",milda.d@smf.su.lt; balciunas@cr.su.lt,"Damkuvienė, Milda/JKS-3202-2023","Damkuvienė, Milda/0000-0002-8104-9337",,,,,54,2,3,0,13,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

This article argues that the model can predict the dynamics of the current account series if it is appropriately adjusted to reflect the nature of capital mobility and exchange rate policies in these countries. Using data on Ghana that span across capital control and liberalized regimes this article reports three finding. First, consistent with the existing empirical evidence, the basic model fails to predict the dynamics of the actual current account. Second, extending the basic model to capture variations in interest rates and exchange rates better explains the path of the actual current account balances only during the liberalized regime. Third, tests of asymmetric access to the international financial market indicate that economic agents in Ghana could not use the international financial market to smooth their consumption during the capital control regime. However, the liberalization program that reduced constraints on capital flows has enabled economic agents to use the international capital market to smooth consumption.","[Darku, Alexander Bilson] Univ Lethbridge, Dept Econ, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada",University of Lethbridge,"Darku, AB (通讯作者)，Univ Lethbridge, Dept Econ, 4410 Univ Dr W, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada.",alexander.darku@uleth.ca,"Darku, Alexander B/E-8516-2017",,,,,,21,1,1,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The Balassa-Samuelson effect has major implications for interpretation of the inflation and the exchange rate criteria for European Monetary Union membership. The conclusion is that the Balassa-Samuelson effect explains only marginally the observed inflation differential.

When an action is rationally justified, how can reason deny its legitimacy? This paper concerns critical strategies that have been employed for addressing the resistance of rationality to rational critique, particularly with respect to technology. Foucault addressed this problem in his theory of power/knowledge. This paper explores Marx's anticipation of that approach in his critique of the 'social rationality' of the market and technology. Marx got around the silencing effect of social rationality with something very much like the concept of underdetermination in his discussion of the length of the working day. There are hints of a critique of technology in his writings as well. In the 1960s and 1970s, neo-Marxists and post-structuralists demanded radical changes in the technological rationality of advanced societies. Soon technical controversies spread, primarily through the influence of the environmental movement. The concept of underdetermination was finally formulated clearly in contemporary science and technology studies, but without explicit political purpose. Nevertheless, this revision of the academic understanding of technology contributes to weakening technocratic rationales for public policy. A new era of technical politics has begun.","Simon Fraser Univ, Harbour Ctr, Sch Commun, Canada Res Chair Philosophy Technol,ACT, Vancouver, BC V6B 5K3, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Feenberg, A (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Harbour Ctr, Sch Commun, Canada Res Chair Philosophy Technol,ACT, Room 3598,515 W Hastings St, Vancouver, BC V6B 5K3, Canada.",feenberg@sfu.ca,,,,,,,29,5,6,0,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

It is argued that one of the main stimuli of that change was the growing popularity of transaction cost economics which eased the entry into mainstream economics of what previously had been present only in heterodox economics. After providing a definition of theoretical plurality it is shown that the number of elements in both economic explanans and explanandum has substantially increased. What follows is an inquiry into the ways in which the idea of transaction costs entered mainstream economics. Subsequently, it is claimed that transaction cost economics as put forward by Oliver Williamson served as a theoretical bridge between mainstream economics and heterodoxy. Finally, some methodological insights on the possible interplay between plurality and pluralism in economics are offered.","Uniwersytet Warszawski Oraz, Inst Nauk Ekon PAN, Wydzial Nauk Ekon, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Hardt, L (通讯作者)，Uniwersytet Warszawski Oraz, Inst Nauk Ekon PAN, Wydzial Nauk Ekon, Warsaw, Poland.",lhardt@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Hardt, Łukasz/N-2949-2017","Hardt, Łukasz/0000-0001-6542-5833",,,,,57,3,3,0,8,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,2299-6184,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2010,,1,,,,,9,34,,,,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,580UN,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000276476100001,0

Additionally, the paper looks at what impact assumptions made for the unconditional distributions have on the results obtained with conditional distributions.

Common stochastic stock control models assume indeterminate demand for stock. In some situations we could suppose the demand to have Markov property. This means that current state of demand is dependent on previous state of demand. This situation would determine different way of stock resupply and it leads to different approach when setting-up a stock level, which, of course, affects holding costs. As we require total costs to be as low as possible, it is necessary to develop a new strategy suitable for these situations.

Later, this model has been generalized to a stochastic version. Time horizon in the original deterministic model as well as in modified stochastic one can be considered finite or infinite. We plan to deal with the stochastic model and finite horizon. However, in spite of the classical approach to analyze it we employ a stochastic programming technique. This approach gives a possibility to employ well known results on stability and empirical estimates also in the case of the Ramsey model. However, first we introduce some confidence intervals.

This paper examines how the authority to set the standard and the authority to choose the combination of policies to meet the standard should be allocated between a central government and local governments. In the context of the United States, for example, should standards regarding such public goods as the environment or education be set and implemented by the federal government, by individual state governments, or by both? Because decisions about setting and/or meeting the standard can be non-contractible, an incomplete contracting approach is used. A central finding is that conjoint federalism (the central government sets the standard while the local governments meet the standard), which is the regulatory structure often used in federations such as the United States and the European Union, can be the least efficient form, while a reverse form of delegation, in which local governments choose their own individual standards which the central government then decides how to collectively meet, can be the most efficient.","Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Lin, CYC (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",cclin@primal.ucdavis.edu,"Lin Lawell, C.-Y.

We advance a general equilibrium model in which increased labor supply reduces unskilled unemployment via consumer demand: longer work hours and higher labor force participation imply higher incomes and less (leisure) time. In consequence, home production is reduced in favor of outsourcing domestic tasks to the market, shifting consumer demand toward unskill-intensive goods. Relative demand for unskilled labor rises and unemployment falls. Finally, we provide empirical support for the basic mechanisms of our model for Germany. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Japan faces a rapidly ageing population, the highest life expectancy in the world, a birth rate well below replacement level and a shrinking population. Smaller families find it difficult to provide primary care for the sick, the elderly and those with disabilities, and the welfare system is stretched to the limit. At the same time, Japanese people are increasingly unwilling to undertake work regarded as 'manual labour' or 'unskilled labour'. Thus, the management of border control is related to the labour market and the management of welfare. This is a range of policies which I would like to refer to as involving the management of bodies.

The demand of European Union for the increase of the number of university students gives evidence of this. Wide spectra of specializations of the schools are often overlapping each other. The most remarkable is this trend in economic subjects, where it is possible to say that almost all public universities are offering at least one study program focused on economics. Within this trend it is often beyond power of educators to keep track on which schools are teaching particular subject and for which specializations. Nevertheless such a comparison could lead to consequential cooperation and education enhancement. Therefore we have decided to try, at least for guidance, to compare the education in quantitative methods at universities. In this paper we try to compare the tuition of the operational research at the universities in the Czech Republic and Slovakia using multicriteria decision making methods.

This article tackles that question from both statistical and economic viewpoint. From a statistical viewpoint, aggregation bias criteria are found to signal that the degree of structural heterogeneity among euro-area economies is such that the loss of information entailed by an aggregate modelling approach may be far from trifling. From an economic viewpoint, we investigate the following issue. Are those statistically detectable heterogeneities of any practical relevance when it comes to supporting monetary policy decision-making? To provide an answer to this question, we compute simple optimal monetary policy reaction functions on the basis of either an aggregate model or a disaggregate one, and compare the associated welfare losses. The results suggest that the welfare under-performance of an area-wide-model-based rule is not only nonnegligible, but also robust with respect to a number of sensitivity analyses.","[Monteforte, Libero; Siviero, Stefano] Banca Italia, Dept Econ Outlook & Monetary Policy Studies, Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Siviero, S (通讯作者)，Banca Italia, Dept Econ Outlook & Monetary Policy Studies, Rome, Italy.",libero.monteforte@bancaditalia.it,,,,,,,46,3,4,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The least costly policy involves auctioning all allowances with revenues used to cut income taxes, while the most costly policies involve recycling revenues in lump-sum dividends or grandfathering emissions allowances. The least costly policy is regressive, however, while the dividend policy is progressive. Grandfathering permits is both costly and regressive.

Sigma convergence analysis suggests that the biggest dispersion of wages is typical for salaries paid to low-skilled employees. Estimation results of dynamic panel model obtained with GMM (Generalized Method of Moments) estimator indicate that within the group of 20 EU countries taken into consideration a slow process of wage convergence takes place and its speed does not exceed 5% per year.

We look at both the Encuesta Continua de Presupuestos Familiares and the European Household Community Panel. Our analysis shows that inequality in individual net labor earnings and household net disposable income has decreased substantially. The decreases in the tertiary education premium and in the unemployment rate have been key ingredients to understand this falling trend. Public transfers have played a crucial role in smoothing out the inequality arising in the labor market, but instead the Spanish family does not seem to have been an important insurance mechanism. Regarding household consumption, inequality has fallen much less than inequality in household net disposable income, with the decrease mostly concentrated in the second half of the eighties. This suggests that the reduction in income inequality has affected the sources of permanent differences between households only during the second half of the eighties. Our estimates of the earnings process for the period are consistent with this view. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The technological capabilities improved significantly in both the broader category of electronics and in the specialized category of semiconductors as firms upgraded to participate in the higher levels of knowledge intensities. However, the incidence of participation of firms in the highest levels of five and six knowledge-intensity activities was very low, which has slowed down labour productivity growth in the industry. The statistical results show that technological deepening through increments in skills and research and development personnel will raise labour productivity in the industry significantly. Hence, the paper argues that government policy should stimulate firms' participation in frontier innovation activities to quicken technological catch-up and productivity growth.","Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Rasiah, R (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",rajah@um.edu.my,"Rasiah, Rajah/X-9122-2019; RASIAH, RAJAH/B-9552-2010","RASIAH, RAJAH/0000-0002-6654-3011",,,,,41,39,40,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Formal social protection systems are very limited in reach in Vanuatu and even urban employees who have access to them still rely on informal mechanisms.

The company tends to compete for rapid response to consumer demand and new products and technologies introduced to the market This type of competition in terms of reaction time is described as time-based competition (TBC). Regardless of a number of practicians and scholars admitting in their works that time management will enable the company to achieve competitive advantage, there is still a lack of empirical research for proving this statement. In addition, today the concept of TBC requires a holistic attitude to time-based management that would integrate a great deal of different concepts, methods and tools of management theory, and would adjust production control systems, cost accounting systems and, at the same time, performance measurement systems with regard to time perspective. The problem is that there is no sufficient research on determining the importance of the time factor in the context of management theory or on systematizing various management concepts for establishing what influence they have on the contemporary perception of TBC. Hence, the main objective of this article is to systematize and analyze data provided by scientific literature sources in relation to the concept of TBC and its development in the context of management theory. In the present article the theoretical research involved the systematic and comparative analysis of scientific literature. The first segment of the article includes the definition of TBC, the analysis of advantages and implementation challenges provided by this concept. The second segment of the article involves the theoretical research on the significance of the time factor in the development of management theory and emphasizes the effect and/or contribution of the basic management concepts on/to the formation of the TBC concept and the emerging need for it in the immediate future. Companies engaged in TBC seek to reduce the amount of time devoted during each stage of the general cycle by eliminating non-value adding activities, shortening time and/or efficiently coordinating value adding activities. When response time to consumer needs is shorter than the one demonstrated by rivals, the company can achieve competitive supremacy that is greater and, on a frequent basis, tends to be dominant and is expressed in speed, which contributes to short delivery time, lower costs, higher quality, flexibility and credible delivery. The research demonstrated that although the term TBC is relatively new, the very concept of time-based management has been applied numerous times. The significance of time management dates back to the early 20th century, while dealing with works of classical management theory from a tactical perspective, and later on other concepts of management theory were applied to its development and expansion, for example, the contribution of the Management School to creating quantitative methods for time management; the systematic attitude that was used to prove the significance of time-based information in production and operations management and to stress the importance of process management within the organization both externally and internally, including quick response to changes, the elimination of bottleneck, resource use and management, and the synchronization of all existing links within the whole organization, and that served as foundation for the emergence of the TBC concept; and the dynamic attitude that expanded the concept of TBC by placing emphasis on the importance of time management as a constant process in the changing organization.","[Sapkauskiene, Alfreda; Leitoniene, Sviesa] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Sapkauskiene, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Laisves Av55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",alfreda.sapkauskiene@ktu.lt; sviesa.leitoniene@ktu.lt,"Leitoniene, Sviesa/G-7250-2015; Sapkauskiene, Alfreda/AAF-9934-2019","Leitoniene, Sviesa/0000-0001-8457-5773; Sapkauskiene, Alfreda/0000-0002-0070-4097",,,,,58,14,19,1,14,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The results suggest that income growth has been the principal reason for this expansion, while exchange rate stability and the real price of agricultural products played only a minor role. Multilateral trade liberalization and trade costs, given their long-term stability, are not elements that could have stimulated their growth. Finally, the intensive liberalization of trade which took place in various economic regions, especially in Europe, became a key factor in promoting agricultural trade among the countries participating in regional trade agreements.

The paper presents in a detailed, however concise manner, as the outcome of the economic evaluations and empirical investigations on actions towards climate change taken by the enterprises in Lithuania, Latvia and Poland executed by the author, the set of corporate management measures to solve the tasks arisen with regard to climate change challenges (UN, 1998; EC 2003, 2009; EP, 2009) facing the enterprises and respectively inevitably leading to corporate strategic changes. In this context paper analyses the solutions of strategic changes, specifying the techniques of their application in the context of improvement of the strategic management, rationalization of the corporate management. When executing corporate strategic changes the author propose to use the complex set of measures determined as to ensure the reasonable efficiency of functions of the enterprise as well as its products. In order to ensure rational management of the corporate changes the author recommends to evaluate the efficiency of corporate strategic changes respectively proposing the toolkit created thereof This allows to evaluate the benefit of the executed changes within the enterprise as to identify, the directions and actions needed to continue the increase of the efficiency of the enterprise activity in the context of climate change. The paper reveals the benefit of utilization of the proposed solutions. According to the results of the implementation of the solutions suggested by the authors for the corporate strategic changes the conclusion is also made that the solutions concerned are featured by flexibility of the utilization of the considered techniques thereof as their characteristics can be modified and adjusted to the specifics of business environment.

It further explores the impact of interest volatility on interest rates. Over the period of February 1988 to December 2004, we find that the interest pass-through mechanism of these two markets is noncomplete. In addition, based on the asymmetric threshold cointegration test, we discover the existence of asymmetric cointegration relationship between retail rates and market rate in both markets. In particular, while employing asymmetric EC-EGARCH (1, 1)M model to test for the influence of money-market rate adjustment and volatility on retail rates in short-run, we find robust evidence that there exist the upward rigidity in deposit rate and the downward rigidity in lending rate in both Taiwan and Hong Kong. This finding supports the hypothesis of the collusive pricing arrangements. Furthermore, interest volatility should cause a smaller margin of variation for Taiwan's deposit/lending rates and wider margin for Hong Kong's lending rate.","[Wang, Kuan-Min] Overseas Chinese Inst Technol, Dept Finance, Taichung 407, Taiwan; [Thi, Thanh-Binh Nguyen] Feng Chia Univ, Coll Business, Taichung 407, Taiwan",Feng Chia University,"Wang, KM (通讯作者)，Overseas Chinese Inst Technol, Dept Finance, Taichung 407, Taiwan.",wkmin@ocit.edu.tw,"Wang, Kuan Min/H-5247-2019; Binh, Nguyen Thi Thanh/AAJ-8064-2020","Wang, Kuan Min/0000-0002-0237-0596; Binh, Nguyen Thi Thanh/0000-0003-0622-9300",,,,,32,11,11,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It is based on a combination of several climate protection models, which are the State-contingent Model and the Demeter Model, and the GDP Spillovers Model, known as the Mundell-Fleming model. From the simulation results, it is concluded that whether the United States implements policies on increasing carbon sink or not makes very little difference on the total output in the U.S. and the GDP spillovers toward China. However, the spillover impact of American carbon abatement policies on China experiences a varying trend that rises from negative to positive. These simulation results show that the climate protection policies of one country will have positive impact on the GDP spillovers of another country in the long term. This paper is focused on two conditions while simulating the GDP for both China and the U.S. Condition A within the simulations ignores the impact of GDP spillovers of foreign countries, while condition B takes the impact of GDP spillovers of foreign countries into consideration. Furthermore, this paper presents the simulated GDP of China and the U.S. under different scenarios and analyzes the level of GDP spillovers between the two countries. This paper concludes that carbon abatement policies in the U.S. have a larger and more noticeable GDP spillover effects to China. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A time series of balanced input-output tables for the UK was constructed for the period 1992 to 2004 by using a matrix balancing procedure that is able to handle conflicting external data and inconsistent constraints. Detailed sectoral and country-specific trade data for the UK were compiled and reconciled with the UK input-output data, and economic and environmental accounts for three world regions were integrated in a UK-specific MRIO model. This was subsequently used to calculate a time series of national carbon footprints for the UK from 1992 to 2004. Greenhouse gas emissions embedded in UK trade are distinguished by destination of imports to intermediate and final demand. Most greenhouse gases show a significant increase over time in consumer emissions and a widening gap between producer and consumer emissions. Net CO2 emissions embedded in UK imports increased from 4.3% of producer emissions in 1992 to a maximum of 20% in 2002. The total estimated UK carbon footprint in 2004 was 730 Mt for CO2 and 934 Mt CO2 equivalents for all greenhouse gases.","[Wiedmann, Thomas; Minx, Jan C.] Univ York, Stockholm Environm Inst, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Wood, Richard; Lenzen, Manfred] Univ Sydney, ISA Ctr Integrated Sustainabil Anal, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Wood, Richard] NTNU, Ind Ecol Programme, Trondheim, Norway; [Minx, Jan C.] Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Econ Climate Change, D-1000 Berlin, Germany; [Guan, Dabo] Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Elect Policy Res Grp, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Guan, Dabo] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Harris, Rocky] DEFRA, London, England",University of York - UK; University of Sydney; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Technical University of Berlin; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge,"Wiedmann, T (通讯作者)，Univ York, Stockholm Environm Inst, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",tw13@york.ac.uk,"Wood, Richard/E-4111-2015; Lenzen, Manfred/D-3161-2013; Minx, Jan C/AAC-5948-2019; Guan, Dabo/Y-2406-2019; Wiedmann, Thomas/C-9158-2011","Wood, Richard/0000-0002-7906-3324; Minx, Jan C/0000-0002-2862-0178; Guan, Dabo/0000-0003-3773-3403; Wiedmann, Thomas/0000-0002-6395-8887; Lenzen, Manfred/0000-0002-0828-5288",NERC [NE/G007748/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/G007748/1] Funding Source: researchfish,NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,54,228,240,6,154,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Five spousal variables are considered: the relative wage of the wife compared to her husband, spouse's weekly hours of employment, and the spouse's time in three unpaid activities. Each requires instrumentation in order to address issues of endogeneity and possible selection bias. In addition, in order to handle the problem that there is only a single time diary per household, two alternative strategies are explored: out-of-sample prediction and propensity matching. Using either method, the results show little effect of one spouse on the unpaid time use of parents. Most importantly, relative wage does not appear to affect time use choices of parents. There does appear to be a small consistent effect of one's spouse's leisure time on own leisure time; husband's and wife's leisure time appears to be complementary.","[Connelly, Rachel] Bowdoin Coll, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA; [Connelly, Rachel] IZA, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA; [Kimmel, Jean] Western Michigan Univ, IZA, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA",Bowdoin College; Western Michigan University,"Connelly, R (通讯作者)，Bowdoin Coll, 9700 Coll Stn, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA.",connelly@bowdoin.edu; jean.kimmel@wmich.edu,,,,,,,41,67,76,0,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

With variable capital utilization, the substitution elasticity has little quantitative impact on the minimum degree of increasing returns needed for indeterminacy. However, when capital utilization is constant, a below-unity substitution elasticity sharply raises the minimum degree of increasing returns because it imposes a higher effective adjustment cost on labor hours. Overall, our results show that empirically-plausible departures from the Cobb-Douglas production specification can make indeterminacy more difficult to achieve. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast, firms that have a small technology gap, meaning that they are close to the international best-practice frontier, benefit less than firms with weak prior technical competency.

New Evidence on the Basicness of Academic Patents*,KYKLOS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TECHNOLOGY; DETERMINANTS; KNOWLEDGE,"P>While often presumed in academic literature and policy discussions there is little empirical evidence showing that academic patents protect more basic inventions than corporate patents. This study provides new evidence on the basicness of academic patents using German professor patents linked to patent opposition data from the European Patent Office (EPO). Patent oppositions are the most important mechanism by which the validity of patents filed at the EPO can be challenged. Controlling for patent value, asymmetric information and diverging expectations between the opposition parties, the likelihood of a potentially litigious situation and the relative costs of opposition versus settlement, we find that academic patents are opposed less frequently than a control group of corporate patents. This suggests that academic patents cover rather basic inventions with a low immediate commercial value not threatening current returns of potential plaintiffs. The effect is weaker for academic patents filed in collaboration with the business sector, which suggests that those patents are evaluated as more applied by owners of potentially rival technologies.","[Czarnitzki, Dirk] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Hussinger, Katrin] Univ Maastricht, Dept Org & Strategy, NL-6211 LM Maastricht, Netherlands; [Schneider, Cedric] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Econ, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",KU Leuven; Maastricht University; Copenhagen Business School,"Czarnitzki, D (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",dirk.czarnitzki@econ.kuleuven.be; k.hussinger@os.unimaas.nl; csc.eco@cbs.dk,"Czarnitzki, Dirk/AAV-4124-2021","Schneider, Cedric/0000-0002-4403-104X",,,,,34,25,26,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,NOV,2009,62.0,4,,,,,488,499,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2009.00447.x,0.0,,,12,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,509QK,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271033000004,0

Although this question is of great economic importance, no systematic empirical study has yet addressed it. Therefore, we examine experimentally whether firms with an initial cost advantage are more likely to invest in marginal cost reductions than firms with higher initial costs. We find that the initial competitive advantages are indeed self-reinforcing, but subjects in the role of firms overinvest relative to the Nash equilibrium. However, the pattern of overinvestment even strengthens the tendency towards self-reinforcing cost advantages relative to the theoretical prediction. Further, as predicted by the Nash equilibrium, mean-preserving spreads of the initial cost distribution have no effects on aggregate investments. Finally, investment spillovers reduce investment, and investment is higher than the joint-profit maximizing benchmark for the case without spillovers and lower for the case with spillovers.

However, the dynamic interrelationships among FDI, financial development, and real output, including the long-run equilibrium as well as causality, have not been analyzed. This paper overcomes this major shortcoming by applying recent advances in panel cointegration and panel error correction models for a set of 37 countries using annual data for the period 1970-2002. For the first time, we explore the directions of causality among FDI, financial development, and economic growth and obtain solid, convincing evidence of a fairly strong long-run relationship. Furthermore, the financial development indicators have a larger effect on economic growth than does FDI. From the panel causality tests, while the evidence of a short-run relationship is weak, that of a long-run relationship among the variables is unequivocal. Overall, the findings underscore the potential gains associated with FDI when coupled with financial development in an increasingly global economy.","[Chang, Chun-Ping] Shih Chien Univ, Dept Mkt Management, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",Shih Chien University,"Chang, CP (通讯作者)，Shih Chien Univ, Dept Mkt Management, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",cclee@cm.nsysu.edu.tw; cpchang@mail3.kh.usc.edu.tw,"Lee, Chien-Chiang/AAZ-9983-2020","Lee, Chien-Chiang/0000-0003-0037-4347",,,,,50,127,136,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

A simple model is built, where economies of scale are eliminated in order to study this effect. We use as the key axiom the property that, if an agent does not improve the technology of any coalition he joins, he should not get any part of the gain from cooperation. With properties of linearity and symmetry, this axiom characterizes a well-defined set of rules. From this set, we propose a rule derived from the familiar Shapley value. We show that it is the only rule in that set satisfying an upper-limit property oil individual cost allocations or a monotonicity property when technology improves. We also derive a distinct rule using a property that ensures that no coalition has an incentive to manipulate the individual demands of its members. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We estimate a random-effects Tobit model of moonlighting among working men and women and find that while male moonlighting behavior does not fluctuate significantly with the business cycle, female moonlighting does. The cyclicality of female moonlighting has, nonetheless, varied over the course of the past 35 yr. Female moonlighting seemed to behave countercyclically during much of the 1980s and early 1990s, confirming the popular media belief that moonlighting is more likely to occur during periods of economic distress. Yet, this countercyclical behavior disappears during the 1993-1999 period to become procyclical by the early twentieth century. The recent procyclicality of female moonlighting supports the idea that female workers respond to a need for just-in-time employment following the economic upturn of the mid- to late 1990s.

Control rights may be measured by immediate shareholder votes, the voting rights as traced through ownership chains, or voting power indices that may or may not trace ownership through chains. We compare the ability of various measures to identify the effects of ownership concentration on share valuation using a German panel data set. The widely used weakest-link principle does not perform well in this comparison. Furthermore, measures that trace control through ownership chains do not outperform those that rely on immediate ownership, thus questioning the role of pyramids in the separation of control and cash-flow rights. The paper emphasises that there is a distinction between these two aspects of ownership even without pyramids or preferred stock, identification of which requires measures that, like the Shapley-Shubik index, do not simply equate control rights with voting rights.

Most empirical estimates of the NKPC, typically based on generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation, have found a significant role for lagged inflation, producing a hybrid NKPC. Using U.S. quarterly data, this article examines whether the role of lagged inflation in the NKPC might be due to the spurious outcome of specification biases. Like previous investigators, we employ GMM estimation and, like those investigators, we find a significant effect for lagged inflation. We also use time varying coefficient (TVC) estimation, a procedure that produces consistency under a variety of sources of misspecification. Using two separate measures of expected inflation, we find strong support for the view that, tinder TVC estimation, the coefficient on expected inflation is near unity and that the role of lagged inflation in the NKPC is spurious.","[Tavlas, G.

In particular, we find a significant and positive correlation between the decision to purchase life insurance and subsequent mortality, conditional on risk classification. Individuals who died within a 12-year time window after a base year were 19% more likely to have taken up life insurance in that base year than were those who survived the time window. Moreover, as might be expected when individuals have residual private information, we find that the earlier an individual died, the more likely she was to have initially bought insurance. The primary factor driving the difference between our and the prior literature's findings is that we focus on a sample of potential new buyers, rather than on the entire cross section, to address the sample selection problem induced by potential mortality differences between those with and those without coverage.

R&D subsidies raise the long-run growth rate, but they also raise the level of industry concentration. In the model firms compete for market share through process R&D endogenously determining the market structure within and across industries. Endogeneity of the market structure allows for analysis of changes in the moments of the firm size distribution in response to policy. R&D subsidies primarily benefit large incumbent firms who increase their innovation rates creating a greater technological barrier to entry. Concentration increases with fewer firms and a higher variance in the market shares. In general equilibrium, the greater distortions in the product market cause the wage rate to fall which leads to increased turnover rates. In addition, the analysis demonstrates that the model captures a large number of empirical regularities described in the industrial organization literature, but absent from most endogenous growth models. These features, such as entering firms are small relative to incumbents, the hazard rate of exit is negatively related to firm size, and large firms spend more on R&D than small firms play important roles in understanding the impact of R&D subsidies on the economy.","Drexel Univ, Dept Econ, LeBow Coll Business, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Drexel University,"Laincz, CA (通讯作者)，Drexel Univ, Dept Econ, LeBow Coll Business, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",claincz@drexel.edu,,,,,,,39,12,15,0,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

It fully details the implications of the institutionalization of the Black-Scholes model in an uncertain world populated by individuals who are bounded by the amount of calculation or accounting which is technically possible. Combining model simulations, empirical analysis, and mathematical derivations, the paper proposes that the determinants of the volatility smile might be related to the behavior of traders. In pricing options, they use the widely accepted Black-Scholes formula with a measure of stock volatility that they derive from their subjective beliefs. Moreover, heterogeneity of traders' beliefs and the way traders update their expectations have nontrivial effects, both on equilibrium prices and on the emergence of the implied volatility smile.

Necessarily, this presented landholders with a void. To obtain the enforcement they needed, many turned to institutions affiliated with the fractious Buddhist faith instead. Temples and monasteries enjoyed an exemption from tax on their lands and controlled an array of financial and human resources with which they could adjudicate and enforce claims to scarce resources. To obtain access to that exemption and those resources, landholders commended their rights in land to them, and paid them a share of the harvest. In exchange, the temples and monasteries exempted them from tax, adjudicated disputes internal to the estate and protected their estates against external threats. Effectively, the temples and monasteries competed in a market for basic governmental services. By helping to secure basic claims to property, the temples and monasteries helped to promote investment and growth; by competing against the government itself they helped to forestall the crippling effect of a predatory monopolistic state.

It then makes five arguments. First, the new data reinforce the rejection of neoliberalism as successful capitalist restructuring that could possibly restore or surpass the pre 1970s rate of profit. Second, when the new data are viewed together with the rest of the post-WWII data, it reinforces the appearance of the fall in the rate of profit as a one-step fall between an earlier and a later period. Third, this result argues against understanding the fall in the rate of profit in terms of an increasing organic composition of capital. Fourth, the one-step fall understanding is consistent with understanding profit rate dynamics in terms of the change of economic regimes between the Keynesian compromise period and the neoliberal period. These first four results are all consistent with, though certainly not broad enough to claim to be a proof of all of, the recently reformulated social structures of accumulation theory by Kotz and Wolfson. Finally, when the new data are considered together with several now widely held general beliefs about the near-term performance of the U.

A dynamic theoretical model of firm-level decision-making is estimated with US Census manufacturing data and with industry-level demand-side data. Simulations performed with the estimated model provide a decomposition of the historical record into parts attributable to import competition, to technological progress, and to a secular real-wage increase. Plant closure and a fall in domestic prices are largely associated with technological progress, while downsizing, layoff's and reduction in domestic market share are associated with trade liberalization. The market-clearing domestic price of textiles is identified as a crucial channel in transmitting technology or import price shocks to layoffs and plant closure. (C) 2009 Society for Policy Modeling.

We investigate the effects of meaningful versus abstract context on cross-game learning in a signaling game experiment. With individual decision makers (1 x 1 games) meaningful context promotes positive cross-game learning in moving from a pooling equilibrium to a separating equilibrium, whereas abstract context yields negative cross-game learning. In 1 x 1 games a change in the (meaningful) context which accompanies superficial changes in the game stalls the learning process compared to an abstract context that does not change. In contrast, with two-person teams the same change in meaningful context has no disruptive effect on strategic play, with teams also having substantially higher levels of strategic play than the 1 x 1 games. We relate the effects of meaningful versus abstract context on cross-game learning to the psychology literature on deductive reasoning processes.

Some of these hypotheses have found support in cross-sectional evidence, but it has proven more difficult to determine which factors have caused the observed changes in pay over time. An alternative strategy is to evaluate the fit of plausible explanations out of sample by contrasting them with the evolution in executive pay and the market for managers during earlier time periods. A case study of General Electric suggests that evidence for earlier decades can speak of the recent trends and reveals the limitations of current explanations to address the long-run data.

Since the early 1990s nominal wages in the USA and the UK have followed this wage norm to a large extent. But in Germany, wages have increased below this norm or even decreased, and in Japan this effect has been even more extreme.

Random effects dynamic panel specifications are employed. Results show that co-residential informal care competes with other time demanding activities, such as childcare and employment. Wealthier individuals are less likely to be caregivers, whereas wealthier households have a higher tendency towards care-giving. Evidence of both substitution and complementarity is found between formal and informal care. Informal care and health status are significantly related, with carers more likely to report worse General Health Questionnaire scores than non-carers. Finally, significant dynamic effects are observed with the continuance of the provision of informal care being more likely than the initiation of such activity, while heavy commitment in the past increases the hours provided in the current period.","[Mentzakis, Emmanouil] McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada; [McNamee, Paul; Ryan, Mandy] Univ Aberdeen, Hlth Econ Res Unit, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland",McMaster University; University of Aberdeen,"Mentzakis, E (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, 1280 Main St W, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada.",mentzak@mcmaster.ca,,"McNamee, Paul/0000-0002-4540-8718; Mentzakis, Emmanouil/0000-0003-1761-209X","Chief Scientist Office [HERU1, HERU2] Funding Source: researchfish",Chief Scientist Office(Chief Scientist Office - Scotland),,,54,56,64,1,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

The punishment effect'' postulates that adult children may punish parents who fail to provide spousal care by not providing future care for the nondisabled spouse if and when necessary. Thus, joint children act as a commitment mechanism, increasing the probability that elderly parents will provide care for their disabled spouses. We argue that stepchildren provide weaker incentives for spousal care because the attachment of a stepchild to a stepparent is likely to be weaker than the attachment of children to parents in a traditional nuclear family.

All of the realistic approaches require the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. However, the US currently lacks the infrastructure to do this and the costs of building and operating the required facilities are poorly established. Recent studies have also Suggested that there is a financial advantage to delaying the deployment of such facilities. We consider a system of government owned reprocessing plants, each with a 40 year service life, that would reprocess spent nuclear fuel generated between 2010 and 2100. Using published data for the component costs, and a social discount rate appropriate for intergenerational analyses, we establish the unit cost for reprocessing and show that it increases slightly if deployment of infrastructure is delayed by a decade. The analysis indicates that achieving higher spent fuel discharge burnup is the most important pathway to reducing the overall cost of reprocessing. The analysis also suggests that a nuclear power production fee would be a way for the US government to recover the costs in a manner that is relatively insensitive to discount and nuclear power growth rates.

Using the CGI, I find that a one standard deviation increase in income inequality raises residential income segregation by 0.4-0.9 standard deviations. Inequality at the top of the distribution is associated with more segregation of the rich, while inequality at the bottom and declines in labor demand for less-skilled men are associated with residential isolation of the poor. Inequality can fully explain the rise in income segregation between 1970 and 2000.","[Watson, Tara] Williams Coll, Dept Econ, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA; [Watson, Tara] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Williams College; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Watson, T (通讯作者)，Williams Coll, Dept Econ, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA.",Tara.Watson@williams.edu,,,,,,,32,146,190,0,25,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

We use a neoclassical growth accounting model to identify the sources of growth and more specifically the role of ICT investments. We find that the contribution of ICT investments has increased during the period 1988-2003, but that this contribution is still lower than in the United States. During 1996-2003, ICT capital services contributed 0.75 to the total growth rate. We also examine the role of ICT investments at the industry level; we find that ICT investments have most benefited the Finance, Insurance, Real Estate and Business Services industries, and the Wholesale and Retail Trade industries. Finally, our results show that growth rates of TFP have also risen, a necessary condition to maintain the high growth rates of productivity in the future. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

For instance, in PSID data from 1990, young males with college-educated parents had a 70% chance of attending college. But those with high school drop-out parents had only a 15% chance. In this paper, we analyze the impact of college attendance bonus schemes designed to increase college attendance rates (and PV of lifetime income) Of Youth from disadvantaged backgrounds. Of course, policies that increase the supply of skilled labor may reduce the college wage premium (see Heckman eta]. [Heckman,James, Lochner, Lance and Taber, Christopher, Explaining rising wage inequality: explorations with a dynamic equilibrium model of labor earnings with heterogeneous agents, Review of Economic Dynamics, 1 (1998a), 1-58; Heckman, James, Lochner, Lance and Taber, Christopher, General-equilibrium treatment effects: a study of tuition policy, American Economic Review, 88:2 (1998b), 381-386]). This may have the unintended consequence of wiping out most of the gains to the targeted groups. The strength of such equilibrium effects on wages depends on the substitutability between different types of labor. Thus, it is important to evaluate education subsidies within an equilibrium framework that allows for flexible patterns of substitution across factor inputs. This is exactly what we do here, using an overlapping generations equilibrium model of the U.S. labor market fit to PSID data from 1968 to 1996. The model allows for imperfect substitution among types of labor differentiated by education, gender, age and ten (1-digit level) occupations - a much finer differentiation than has been considered in prior work. We find that very large college attendance bonuses are necessary to equate college attendance rates between youth whose parents had only high school degrees or were high school dropouts and youth whose parents attended at least some college. The size of these bonuses far exceeds any reasonable measure of college costs; suggesting the costs the bonuses overcome are primarily psychic or effort costs. For example, youth from disadvantaged backgrounds may be poorly prepared for college. This suggests that bonuses targeted at college age youth are probably a very inefficient way to reduce inequality. Earlier intervention is likely called for. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We focus on three groups of income earners: the rich (P99-100), the upper middle class (P90-99), and the rest of the population (P0-90). The results show that periods of high economic growth disproportionately increases the top percentile income share at the expense of the rest of the top decile. Financial development is also pro-rich and the outbreak of banking crises is associated with reduced income shares of the rich. Trade openness has no clear distributional impact (if anything openness reduces top shares). Government spending, however, is negative for the upper middle class and positive for the nine lowest deciles but does not seem to affect the rich. Finally, tax progressivity reduces top income shares and when accounting for real dynamic effects the impact can be important over time. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

By using variables which possess forecast power for equity and commodity returns, we document that carbon futures returns may be weakly forecast on the basis of two variables from the stock and bond markets, i.e. equity dividend yields and the junk bond premium. Our results also suggest that the forecast abilities of two variables related to interest rates variation and economic trends on global commodity markets, respectively the U.S. Treasury bill yields and the excess return on the Reuters/CRB Index, are not robust on the carbon market. This latter result reinforces the belief that the EU ETS is currently operating as a very specific commodity market, with distinct fundamentals linked to allowance supply and power demand. The sensitivity of carbon futures to macroeconomic influences is carefully identified following a sub-sample decomposition before and after August 2007, which attempts to take into account the potential impact of the credit crunch crisis. Collectively, these results challenge the market observers' viewpoint that carbon futures prices are immediately correlated with changes in the macroeconomic environment, and rather suggest that the carbon market is only remotely connected to macroeconomic variables. The economic logic behind these results may be related to the fuel-switching behavior of power producers in influencing primarily carbon futures price changes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Larger firms prefer to set higher costs of entry, in order to reduce competition. Second, these costs are endogeneously determined in a political economy equilibrium. Trade opening can lead to higher entry costs when it changes the political power in favor of a small elite of large exporters, who in turn prefer to install high entry barriers.

Specifically, the ratio of bidders' (endogenous) payoffs is analyzed and compared to the ratio of the (exogenous) distribution functions that describe beliefs. Most of the results are inferred from this comparison. In the existing theoretical literature, assumptions of first order stochastic dominance or stronger imply that the latter ratio has very specific properties, but no Such assumptions are imposed here. It is proven that first order stochastic dominance is necessary for bidding strategies not to cross. When this assumption is relaxed in the numerical literature it is done in a manner that leads to exactly one crossing. However, it is straightforward to construct examples with several crossings, Finally, bid distributions will cross in auctions with two bidders whenever second order (but not first order) stochastic dominance applies.

We address this problem by developing an evolutionary simulation model to describe the behavior of business firms as interacting with consumers and recyclers. Market structure, business firms' R&D strategies and consumers' preferences are found to have an important influence here. The simulation results show that improvement in recycling is necessary but not sufficient to solve the issue of increase in waste. Recycling will need to be backed up with an extension in product-life to face such an unwanted increase. Adopting such a strategy could be positive for firms and for the environment because it could lead to high economic performance, both in terms of profits and market share, and to high environmental performance, both in terms of product recyclability and product lifetime. Our results suggest introducing regulation policies aimed at encouraging firms to invest in developing green products, i.e. those which are easily recyclable and which have a long lifetime, and getting consumers to buy them. It would also seem crucial to lend support to innovation outlay for such firms and to favor their seeking to improve product performance.","Univ Montesquieu Bordeaux IV, GREThA, CNRS, UMR 5113, F-33608 Pessac, France",Universite de Bordeaux; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Brouillat, E (通讯作者)，Univ Montesquieu Bordeaux IV, GREThA, CNRS, UMR 5113, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France.",eric.brouillat@u-bordeaux4.fr,,,,,,,18,17,20,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,,,J EVOL ECON,J.

The worldwide tax regime employed by the US potentially distorts this choice by penalizing FDI, relative to FPI, in low-tax countries. On the other hand, weak investor protections in foreign countries may increase the value of control, creating an incentive to use FDI rather than FPI. By combining data on US outbound FPI and FDI, this paper analyzes whether the composition of US outbound capital flows reflects these incentives to bypass home and host country institutional regimes. The results suggest that the residual tax on US multinational firms' foreign earnings skews the composition of outbound capital flows - a 10% decrease in a foreign country's corporate tax rate increases US investors' equity FPI holdings by approximately 10%, controlling for effects on FDI. Investor protections also seem to shape portfolio choices, though these results are not robust when only within-country variation is employed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The experimental design distinguishes between a non-strategic problem where players (individuals or groups of three) make decisions without interaction and a strategic part where players harvest from a common pool. This allows us to correct for differences between individuals and groups in the quality of decisions when testing for differences in competitiveness. Group decisions are either made by majority rule or unanimity. The results show that groups are less myopic than individuals (i.e., they make qualitatively better decisions) but that they are more competitive than individuals when placed in a strategic setting. The net result for groups deciding by majority rule is that they make less efficient decisions in the strategic game than individuals do. We are able to show that this is caused by the median voter departing from her original preference in early periods witha shrinking pool. When groups have to make unanimous decisions they start playing the strategic game more efficiently then individuals do, but they rapidly become more competitive with repetition of the game.

We find that SWC investments made by local governments have a significant negative impact on the extent of erosion and (in recent years) the severity of erosion, whereas SWC investments made by farm households until recently had a significant negative effect on the severity of erosion. In its turn, the severity of erosion is found to have a significant negative impact on agricultural GDP Estimation of the impact of the extent of erosion on agricultural GDP provides mixed results. Based on these results, we derive that one RMB invested in SWC by local governments increases agricultural GDP in 2002 with 0.84-1.25 RMB. Finally, we find that agricultural GDP has a significant negative impact on the rural poverty rate. The resulting indirect effect of SWC investment on rural poverty reduction, however, is small compared to other types of public investment. We conclude that (local) government investments in SWC do not only serve environmental goals, but also make a non-negligible contribution to agricultural growth and rural poverty reduction.

David (Discussion papers in economic and social history, University of Oxford, 1996) offers a reconciliation of the opposing views by suggesting that while productivity per hour worked in agriculture was comparable to productivity in other sectors, the number of hours worked per year was relatively low, creating a large gap in annual output per worker across sectors. We model and extend a version of Davis's reconciliation within a unified growth theory that makes connections between the decline in traditional agriculture and several other features of United States development. The dynamic general equilibrium model is consistent with the structural transformation having minor direct and indirect effects on aggregate labor productivity per hour, but substantial effects on aggregate labor productivity per worker. The model also provides a close match to the trends in schooling, fertility, rates of return to physical capital, and labor productivity growth in the nineteenth century.","[Rangazas, Peter] IUPUI, Indianapolis, IN USA; [Mourmouras, Alex] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis; International Monetary Fund,"Rangazas, P (通讯作者)，IUPUI, Indianapolis, IN USA.",,,,,,,,78,16,16,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

Given a feasible exogenous fiscal policy, productive public spending can, at first, lead to positive short-run and long-run growth in the unique competitive equilibrium. However, although strictly positive growth is possible in the short run, a Ramsey policy with productive public spending does not implement positive capital accumulation in the long run.

This paper investigates how individuals' attitudes toward social and institutional trust are shaped by the political regime in which they live. The German reunification is a unique natural experiment that allows us to conduct such a study. Using data from the German General Social Survey (ALLBUS), we obtain several interesting results. We first show that, shortly after reunification, East Germans displayed a significantly less trusting attitude than West Germans. We then show that the experience of democracy by East Germans since reunification did not serve to increase levels of social trust significantly. In fact, we cannot reject the hypothesis that East Germans, after more than a decade of democracy, have the same levels of social distrust as shortly after the collapse of communism. In trying to understand the underlying forces, we show that the persistence of social distrust in the East can be explained by negative economic outcomes that many East Germans experienced in the post-reunification period. Interestingly, and in sharp contrast to social trust, we also find that the levels of institutional trust in the East significantly converge towards those in the West.

I examine how these higher prices for new models should be divided between quality growth and price inflation based on (a) whether consumer purchases shift toward or away from the new models and (b) whether new-model price increases generate higher relative prices that persist through the model cycle. I conclude that two-thirds of the price increases with new models should be treated as quality growth.

The topic gave rise to concern with the finding of low business utilization ratio of FTAs in sample East Asian countries. This raised the necessity of a survey on the utilization ratio of Korea's FTAs since the country has been promoting FTAs most actively in the region for last several years. This paper tried to study Korean firms' utilization of FTAs under current implementation and the general attitude towards FTAs. One of main findings is that only one out of five Korean firms surveyed utilizes FTAs, although about half of the firms evaluated FTAs to be beneficial for their businesses. This paper asserts that the government has been less successful in promoting useful FTAs for business so far. It emphasizes that the government should push forward various schemes for enhancing the firms' utilization of FTAs rather than voicing up the merits of FTAs.","[Cheong, Inkyo; Cho, Jungran] Inha Univ, Jungseok Res Inst Int Logist & Trade, Inchon, South Korea; [Cheong, Inkyo] Inha Univ, Dept Econ, Inchon, South Korea",Inha University; Inha University,"Cho, J (通讯作者)，Inha Univ, Jungseok Res Inst Int Logist & Trade, Inchon, South Korea.",inkyo@inha.ac.kr,,,,,,,21,8,8,0,7,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Two agents trade goods and nominal assets to smooth consumption across periods and future states, in the presence of cash-in-advance financing costs that have effects on real allocations. We show that higher spot interest rates reduce trade and as a result increase state prices. Hence, states of nature with higher interest rates are also states of nature with higher risk-neutral probabilities. This result, which cannot be found in a Lucas-type representative agent model, implies that the yield curve is upward sloping in equilibrium, even when short-term interest rates are fairly stable and the variance of the (macroeconomic) stochastic discount factor is 0.

While babbling equilibrium play is observed more frequently in conflicting interest cases, a substantial number of players tend to choose truth-telling and credulous play.

Previous literature suggests that innovators are persistently more profitable than non-innovators, but little is known about how this link is moderated by external versus domestic ownership. We consider the link between innovation and profits separately for indigenous innovators and non-innovators and externally-owned plants. We also consider the determinants of innovation over the distribution of plant-level profitability, and find that the determinants of profitability including innovation and external ownership - vary over the distribution from low to high profitability plants.

The thrust of the model is that firms' reliance on bank loans (credit channel) may make aggregate supply sensitive to bank interest rates (cost channel), which are in turn driven by the official rate controlled by the central bank. The model is assessed theoretically by examining whether, and under what conditions, changes in the policy interest rate produce the whole pattern of the observed stylized effects of monetary policy, with no recourse to non-competitive hypotheses and frictions in the goods and labour markets. This result is obtained for parameter values in the range of available consensus estimates, with a caveat concerning labour-supply elasticity to the real wage rate.","Univ Trento, Dept Econ, I-38100 Trento, Italy",University of Trento,"Tamborini, R (通讯作者)，Univ Trento, Dept Econ, Via Inama 5, I-38100 Trento, Italy.",Roberto.tamborini@unitn.it,"Tamborini, Roberto/H-4183-2019",,,,,,45,0,0,2,3,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,APR 22,2009,3.0,,,,,,,,200913,,,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,V20LZ,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000208142800001,0

We then consider the relation between reported job security and OECD summary measures of Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) strictness on the one hand, and Unemployment Insurance Benefit (UIB) generosity on the other. We explicitly recognize that insecure types may attempt to self-select into more secure jobs. After modeling this selection, we find that workers feel most secure in permanent public sector jobs, least secure in temporary jobs, with permanent private sector jobs occupying an intermediate position. We also find that perceived job security in both permanent private and temporary jobs is positively correlated with UIB generosity, while the relationship with EPL strictness is negative: workers feel less secure in countries where jobs are more protected. These correlations are absent for permanent public jobs, suggesting that such jobs are perceived to be by and large insulated from labor market fluctuations.","[Clark, Andrew] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Postel-Vinay, Fabien] Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Bristol BS8 1TN, Avon, England; [Postel-Vinay, Fabien] Univ Paris 01, CEPR, F-75231 Paris 05, France",Paris School of Economics; University of Bristol; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Clark, A (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.",andrew.clark@ens.fr; Fabien.Postel-Vinay@bristol.ac.uk,"Clark, Andrew/A-2388-2012","Clark, Andrew/0000-0001-7004-7654",,,,,31,116,128,1,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

By relating the standard matching approach to the timing-of-events approach, it demonstrates that effects of the treatment on the treated at a given date can be identified although non-treated may be treated later in time. The approach builds on a no anticipation assumption and the assumption of conditional independence between the duration until treatment and the counterfactual durations until exit. To illustrate the approach, the paper studies the effect of training for unemployed workers in France, using a rich register data set. Training has little impact on unemployment duration. The contamination of the standard matching estimator due to later entries into treatment is large if the treatment probability is high.

My instrumental variables strategy overcomes the endogeneity of income that typically contaminates estimates and, unlike related Studies that use natural or policy experiments in reduced-form estimations,, it yields evidence of a positive bias. This suggests that an unobservable characteristic is positively correlated both with income and private transfer receipt and that treating Income as exogenous could lead to an underestimation of the crowding out effect. In contrast, my preferred estimates are negative, significant and not far from minus one, implying an almost complete crowding out. My findings suggest that private transfers could neutralize the changes ill the public transfers for the elderly. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We estimated the parameters of a regression model that analyses factors like political system pressure, administration transparency, and service quality provided by civil servants using data sets for a representative civil servants sample. Using the regression model and ANOVA we came to the conclusion, that the perception of the corruption has significant differences at the level of the four types of public administration institutions analysed in this paper. The main result is that the corruption level in the public administration is negatively influenced by the stability of the remuneration system, by the lack of transparency and by the political system pressure. On the other hand, church, media, and schools have a positive influence on the reduction of the corruption level.","[Andrei, Tudorel; Stancu, Stelian] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Matei, Ani] Natl Sch Polit Studies & Publ Adm, Bucharest, Romania; [Oancea, Bogdan] Artitex Univ, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania,"Andrei, T (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",andreitudorel@yahoo.com; amatei@snapa.ro; stelian_stancu@yahoo.com; oanceab@ie.ase.ro,"Oancea, Bogdan/C-4147-2011; Andrei, Tudorel/C-3731-2012; Matei, Ani/C-4202-2011; STANCU, Stelian/HRB-5488-2023; Andrei, Tudorel/U-6307-2019","Oancea, Bogdan/0000-0001-6987-5137; Matei, Ani/0000-0002-9590-0129; Stancu, Stelian/0000-0002-4727-993X; Andrei, Tudorel/0000-0003-1203-7612",,,,,33,10,10,1,23,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

The minimum discount factor above which tacit collusion can be sustained in a subgame perfect equilibrium is called the critical discount factor delta*. In addition, delta* is often used as an intuitive measure for the stability of a tacit cartel, assuming that a collusive equilibrium is more difficult to sustain when delta* increases. However, according to standard theory the distance delta - delta* between the actual and the critical discount factor does not matter for stability as long as delta > delta*.

This paper quantifies the policy's impact on relative Adelaide retail prices for unleaded petrol through Box-Jenkins autoregressive integrated moving average methodology coupled with Box and Tiao intervention analysis. The analysis uses weekly price data spanning from January 2000 until the beginning of June 2002. It finds the clean fuel policy had a statistically significant impact on relative retail petrol prices, resulting in an increase of almost 1.9 cents per litre and, therefore, costing Adelaide motorists around an extra $15.8 million per annum. Based on claims that the quality of fuel produced by the local Adelaide refiner did not change in response to the implementation of the clean fuel policy, the paper concludes that the increase in relative retail petrol prices was most likely associated with the exercise of market power rather than an increase in refinery production costs.",,,"Davey, A (通讯作者)，GPO Box 1322, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",a.davey@aciltasman.com.au,,,,,,,70,1,1,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

The modeling framework consists of a simple non-monetary endowment economy with overlapping generations. extended to account for stochastic endowments and borrowing constrained households. A benign government chooses the optimal degree of responsiveness of net taxes to individual incomes and an optimal measure of long-run public debt in order to smooth households' consumption across states of nature. In the presence of a deficit constraint for the government, the results point to the desire for lower debt levels than those currently prevailing in European Union countries in order to enable a more effective hedging of personal income uncertainty by means of more active automatic fiscal stabilisers. The optimal degree of automatic stabilisation and debt reduction is conditional on the characteristics of economic cycles.

Addressing the issue requires an understanding of the factors influencing students' success. Studies analysing academic performance use the education production function approach. This approach identifies inputs that are crucial to learning and to achieving certain outputs. Factors that have been investigated in other studies include the impact of lecture attendance on performance, school-leaving exam (matriculation) results, particularly performance in mathematics, and the gender and age of students. This study adds to existing local empirical research by analysing the impact of the tutorial programme as an input. The case study investigates the tutorial programme for first-year economics students at Stellenbosch University using quantitative analysis. Results confirm what previous studies have found, namely that lecture attendance, gender, and matriculation results contribute positively to the performance of first-year economics students. The main finding of the paper is that tutorial attendance also contributes positively to academic performance.","[Horn, P. M.; Jansen, A.

The article summarizes the country's National Accounting history and reviews the elaboration of the historical national accounts. It also analyzes the possibility of erroneous and inconsistent data. It shows there is no reason to pass over the official estimates; on the contrary, they should be incorporated with adequate measures to overcome the lack of homogeneity. Lastly, it describes the methodology used to build the new GDP and GDP per capita series for the whole period. The new data imply important upward corrections of the national accounts prior to 1954, while they are consistent when linked to the official series.

Therefore multinationals may want to locate subsidiaries near sources of technological innovation and domestic firms may take advantage of this closer location by absorbing more easily technological knowledge. Within this context we analyse the interaction between firms' international strategy and innovative performance by using a dynamic oligopoly model where knowledge flows increase with geographical proximity.

Therefore, the venture capitalist delegates the continuation decision to the outsider by ex ante restricting the amount of capital he has under management.

Axioms constrain these distributions, including analogues of preference axioms, such as transitivity, monotonicity and convexity. Results establish a complete representation of theoretically consistent demand. The theory's purpose is empirical application. To this end, the theory has desirable properties. Intrinsically stochastic, econometricians can apply it without adding extrinsic randomness in the form of errors. Random demand is parsimoniously represented by a single function on the consumption set.

Behavior in a contest potentially provides information with regard to one's type and can therefore influence the behavior of the opponents in later contests. This paper shows that if effort is observable, this can induce a ratchet effect in contests: high ability contestants sometimes put in little effort in an early round in order to make the opponents believe that they are of little ability. The effect reduces overall effort and increases equilibrium utility of the contestants when compared with two unrelated one-shot contests. It does, however, also introduce an allocative inefficiency since sometimes a contestant with a low valuation wins. The model assumes an imperfectly discriminating contest.

We find that a price ceiling affects investment decisions in two mutually competing ways: it makes the option to defer investment more valuable, but at the same time it reduces the incentive for firms to strategically underinvest in order to raise prices. We show that while sensible price cap regulation speeds up investment, a low price cap can be a disincentive for investment. There exists an optimal price cap independent of market concentration the competitive investment price trigger - that maximizes investment incentives and in the long term increases industry installed capacity. This optimal price cap becomes less effective and less robust as the market becomes more competitive and as demand volatility increases. Errors in estimation of the optimal price cap have asymmetric effects: underestimation has more dire consequences than overestimation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Among the main results, we highlight a positive correlation between alcohol consumption and traffic mortality rate. Basically, governments implement two kinds of policies to reduce the traffic mortality rate. One is oriented to control the supply of alcohol by increasing alcohol taxes. The other is oriented to preserve traffic security, increasing the number of sanctions for traffic rule infraction. We find evidence that both policies exert a positive influence in the reduction of traffic fatalities. There is no empirical evidence to indicate that being a novice driver increases the tendency to be involved in a mortal traffic accident.","[Arranz, Jose M.] Univ Alcala de Henares, Dept Estadist Estruct Econ & OEI, Madrid 28803, Spain; [Gil, Ana I.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Anal Econ Teoria Econ & Hist Econ, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",Universidad de Alcala; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Arranz, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Alcala de Henares, Dept Estadist Estruct Econ & OEI, Plaza Victoria 3, Madrid 28803, Spain.",josem.arranz@uah.es,"ARRANZ, Jose M./K-9921-2014; ARRANZ, Jose M./AAF-4037-2019; Lacruz, Ana Isabel Gil/AAI-8302-2021","ARRANZ, Jose M./0000-0001-8112-2867; ARRANZ, Jose M./0000-0001-8112-2867; Lacruz, Ana Isabel Gil/0000-0002-7994-923X",,,,,40,7,7,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

To test this hypothesis, we examine the effect of economic insecurity (roughly, the risk of catastrophic income loss) on the smoking behavior of a sample of male working-age smokers from the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79). Using instrumental variables to control for unobserved heterogeneity, we find that economic insecurity has a large and statistically significant positive effect on the decision to continue or resume smoking. Our results indicate, for example, that a 1 percent increase in the probability of becoming unemployed causes an individual to be 2.4 percent more likely to continue smoking. We find that the explanatory power of economic insecurity in predicting tobacco use is comparable to (but distinct from) household income, a more commonly used metric.","[Smith, Trenton G.] Washington State Univ, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",Washington State University,,michaelg.barnes@hartfordlife.com; trentsmith@wsu.edu,"Smith, Trenton/B-5449-2008","Smith, Trenton/0000-0001-6272-8871",,,,,58,31,34,0,13,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

International trade has grown rapidly in value and volume, the composition of trade has altered significantly, and trade flows have been extensively liberalised. Increasing international trade is crucial to the continuance of globalization. Globalization and integration processes are having a major impact on the international trade system. Current economic integration processes (accession of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and other States into the EU) expanded the boundaries of the European Union thus influencing tendencies of changes of nature and pattern of trade specialization. Trade among nations is traditionally explained as arising from the specialization of nations in particular industries as conditioned by the nation's relative factor endowments. Traditional theories such as comparative advantages or factor endowments state that countries with different resources or factor endowments will trade with each other. But empirical evidences show that countries with similar endowments do more trade these days. Based on new theories, monopolistic competition and increasing returns lead to intra-industry trade among countries, whereas the old comparative advantage is still applied for the countries separated by high economic distance. Trade specialization theories distinguish between inter-industry and intra-industry specialization. Inter-industry specialization refers to the simultaneous exchange of different goods. Countries specialize by exploiting their comparative advantages arising from differences in technology, innovativeness and differences in factor endowments. Many studies suggest that more developed countries and more specialized trade structure lead to higher intra-industry trade. To understand why economists have to turn their attention to these aspects, differences between inter-industry trade and intra-industry trade specialization are analysed in this article. Seeking to define the nature and pattern of trade specialization in the Baltic States, the basic theories of trade specialization and methods of measurement of inter-industry and intra-industry trade specialization are analyzed in this article. For analyzing the structure and determinants of country's foreign trade and identification the basis on which competitive advantages are built various measures of trade specialization are determined. Using relative trade advantage index and standard international trade classification, the nature and pattern of inter-industry trade specialization was established in the Baltic States. Using Grubel-Lloyd index and standard international trade classification the nature of intra-industry specialization in trade between the Baltic States and the EU was estimated. On the basis of researches it was determined that intra-industry trade share between the Baltic States and the EU over examined period has been growing rapidly.","[Bernatonyte, Dalia] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Normantiene, Akvile] S Balt Cross Border Cooperat Programme, PL-80822 Gdansk, Poland",Kaunas University of Technology,"Bernatonyte, D (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Laisves Av 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",Dalia.Bernatonyte@ktu.lt; akvile.normantiene@southbaltic.eu,,,,,,,50,21,21,0,10,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We use the MERGE model to evaluate the core EMF scenarios for both the international and the US-specific studies. Our results indicate that a radiative forcing target equivalent to 450 ppmv CO2-e cannot be met even allowing for full participation and overshoot during the entire 21st century. With delayed participation of developing countries, a target of 550 PPMV CO2-e is only attainable with pessimistic assumptions about economic growth, and even then only at very high cost. A target of 650 PPMV CO2-e can be met with delayed participation for a more affordable cost. We highlight sensitivities to the core scenarios in two key dimensions: (i) the effect of the unfolding global financial crisis on the rate of economic growth and (ii) the willingness of initially non-participating countries to agree at the beginning of the next commitment period (i.e. 2012) to join the coalition at a pre-specified date in the future. We find that while the recession does not fundamentally change the crucial role of developing country involvement, advance agreement on their part to future targets could substantially reduce costs for all countries.

But, it happened and it seems the world economic growth has taken an opposite course of development. Specific by its nature, the current crisis has produced devastating consequences in developed countries and has uninterruptedly spread all over the world, becoming a multilateral crisis. Starting as a financial crisis of one country, it has turned into an international financial crisis. The crisis gradually transformed into an economic crisis and in some countries it risk to turn into a social one. Because of its origin, the current world crisis has very complex consequences. Economic and financial weaknesses of developed countries, which are considered the central link of international economic system, have definitely affected the whole system.

Frishling (2002) shows that there are three different models to model stock price with discrete dividends, but only one of these models is close to reality and generates consistent option prices. We follow Frishling (2002) by calling this model Model 3. Unfortunately, there is no analytical option pricing formula for Model 3, and many popular numerical methods such as trees are inefficient when used to implement Model 3. A new stock price model is proposed in this article. To guarantee that the option prices generated by this new model are close to those generated by Model 3, the distributions of the new model at exdividend dates and maturity approximate the distributions of Model 3at those dates. To achieve this, a discrete dividend in Model 3 is replaced by a continuous dividend yield that can be represented as a function of discrete dividends and stock returns in the new model. Thus, the new model follows a lognormal diffusion process and the analytical option pricing formulas can be easily derived. Numerical experiments show that our analytical pricing formulas provide accurate pricing results.","[Dai, Tian-Shyr] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Informat Management & Finance, Dept Informat & Finance Management, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan; [Lyuu, Yuh-Dauh] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Lyuu, Yuh-Dauh] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taipei 106, Taiwan",National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University,"Dai, TS (通讯作者)，Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Informat Management & Finance, Dept Informat & Finance Management, 1001 Ta Hsueh Rd, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.",d88006@csie.ntu.edu.tw,,"LYUU, YUH-DAUH/0000-0003-2079-8825",,,,,22,10,11,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We utilize data from the General Social Survey (GSS) to estimate an economic model of sexual behaviour. Our theoretical approach proceeds by rationalizing, on evolutionary grounds, the existence of sexual activity in individual preference functions, with unobservable costs imposed by religious beliefs and participation. Given the objective of utility maximization, we justify the existence of demand functions for sexual activity that generate empirically testable hypotheses about the effects of religion and religious participation on risky sexual activity. Our results suggest that, at least in the case of heterosexuals, FBOs can indeed influence the risky sexual behaviour that is associated with the transmission of HIV/AIDS.","[Price, Gregory N.] Morehouse Coll, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30314 USA; [Granger, Maury D.] Jackson State Univ, Dept Econ, Jackson, MS 39217 USA",Morehouse College; Jackson State University,"Price, GN (通讯作者)，Morehouse Coll, Dept Econ, 830 Westview Dr, Atlanta, GA 30314 USA.",gprice@murc.org,,,,,,,26,5,5,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

There are two leading views on the nature of the income process in the current literature. The first view, which I call the Restricted Income Profiles (RIP) process, holds that individuals are subject to large and very persistent shocks, while facing similar life-cycle income profiles. The alternative view, which I call the Heterogeneous Income Profiles (HIP) process, holds that individuals are subject to income shocks with modest persistence, while facing individual-specific income profiles. I first show that ignoring profile heterogeneity, when in fact it is present, introduces an upward bias into the estimates of persistence. Second, I estimate a parsimonious parameterization of the HIP process that is suitable for calibrating economic models. The estimated persistence is about 0.8 in the HIP process compared to about 0.99 in the RIP process. Moreover, the heterogeneity in income profiles is estimated to be substantial, explaining between 56 to 75 percent of income inequality at age 55. I also find that profile heterogeneity is substantially larger among higher educated individuals. Third, I discuss the source of identification-in other words, the aspects of labor income data that allow one to distinguish between the HIP and RIP processes. Finally, I show that the main evidence against profile heterogeneity in the existing literature-that the autocorrelations of income changes are small and negative-is also replicated by the HIP process, suggesting that this evidence may have been misinterpreted.

Kwast and de Nicolo (2002) put systemic risk and (conditional) stock price correlations into a unique relation. Adopting this perspective, we provide a dynamic conditional correlation (DCC, Engle, 2002) analysis for the European banking sector. Our sample period covers establishment and advent of the Euro. Apart from time variation of correlation measures we investigate the content of exogenous factor variables to explain correlation patterns. Overall, we find a moderate and stable average level of systemic risk in European banking. The advent of the Euro came along with a 1-year period of short-run transition dynamics. Systemic risk is found to increase over states of high uncertainty in national stock markets and states of small-to-medium variation in European interest rates.","[Herwartz, Helmut] Univ Kiel, Inst Stat & Okonometrie, D-24098 Kiel, Germany; [Siegel, Martin] Univ Cologne, Inst Gesundheitsokon & Klin Epidemiol, D-50935 Cologne, Germany",University of Kiel; University of Cologne,"Herwartz, H (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Inst Stat & Okonometrie, Ohlshausenstr 40, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.",herwartz@stat-econ.uni-kiel.de,"Siegel, Martin/I-3960-2019","Siegel, Martin/0000-0001-8219-8986",,,,,16,0,0,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

After obtaining an estimate of the size of the informal economy in each Russian region from 1992 to 1999, an analysis is performed to find whether reform progress and institutional qualities account for the informal economy. An evaluation of the links between the informal economy and the growth of small enterprises within Russia is then carried out. The findings suggest that Russia's informal economy resulted from a delay in reform and low qualities of institutions. It was found that the growth of small enterprises is positively affected by the informal economy. These results imply that the informal economy helped entrepreneurial activities to grow in the face of government failure, but these informal activities tend to become official over time.","[Kim, Byung-Yeon] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Kang, Youngho] Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Seoul National University (SNU); University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Kim, BY (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",kimby@snu.ac.kr; youngho.kang@colorado.edu,,,,,,,55,17,18,3,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

This implies that the internal comparison of the own wage with wages paid to other workers within the firm affects individual effort determination. By contrast, the standard efficiency wage models only consider a comparison of the own wage with external income opportunities as the only determinant for individual effort. We provide a simple efficiency wage framework in which both the internal and external perspectives can affect individual effort determination. Our framework suggests that the internal reference is essential for the existence of real wage rigidity while the external reference ensures an upward-sloping wage-setting curve.","[Schoeb, Ronnie] Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Koskela, Erkki] Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",Free University of Berlin; University of Helsinki,"Schöb, R (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, Boltzmannstr 20, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",erkki.koskela@helsinki.fi; ronnie.schoeb@fu-berlin.de,,,,,,,18,2,3,0,8,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

The theoretical support for these approaches is rather questionable since it focuses on the effects of shocks on prices and not on their sources. Removing such effects modifies the true generating system of market dynamics because of the non-proportional character of non-linearity. Thus, taking into account that the underlying process of economic time series is highly non-linear we cannot be certain a priori what the impact of new information will be on the dynamic structure of a system. The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate using the methodology of simulations the eventual distortions in time series data arising from the arrival of news when agents follow non-linear trading strategies. We argue that if news can really modify the dynamical behaviour of a system, then the methodology of filtering exogenous distortions needs to be re-examined. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Five climate targets of increasing severity are analyzed, following the EMF-22 experiment. Each target is attempted under two cooperation regimes, a First Best scenario where all countries fully cooperate from 2012 on, and a Second Best scenario where the World is partitioned into three groups, and each group of countries enters the cooperation at a different date, and implement emission abatement actions in a progressive manner, once in the coalition. The resulting ten combinations are simulated via the ETSAP-TIAM technology based, integrated assessment model. In addition to the 10 separate case analyses, the article proposes a probabilistic treatment of three targets under the First Best scenario, and shows that the three forcing targets may in fact be interpreted as a single target on global temperature change, while assuming that the climate sensitivity C-s is uncertain. It is shown that such an interpretation is possible only if the probability distribution of C-s is carefully chosen. The analysis of the results shows that the lowest forcing level is unattainable unless immediate coordinated action is undertaken by all countries, and even so only at a high global cost. The middle and the high forcing levels are feasible at affordable global costs, even under the Second Best scenario. Another original contribution of this article is to explain why certain combinations of technological choices are made by the model, and in Particular why the climate target clearly supersedes the usually accepted objective of improving energy efficiency. The analysis shows that under some climate targets, it is not optimal to improve energy efficiency, but rather to take advantage of certain technologies that help to reach the climate objective, but that happen to be less energy efficient than even the technologies in the reference scenario. This is particularly observable in the power generation sector and in some end-Use sectors. Finally, the article discusses the pros and cons of the stochastic programming treatment of forcing targets, and compares it with the separate simulations of the various deterministic cases.

In an electoral system with 'pork' at the national level, local economic prospects will be a direct function of political support. Because every poll comes with its margin of error, we can exploit the error in sub-national polls to test for whether forward-looking investment in the economy adjusts to shocks in local political behavior. The covariance between the strength of this adjustment and local-level characteristics allows us to identify the locations in which strong 'pork' contracts exist. To illustrate the technique, we provide a theoretical foundation and an empirical exercise using data on Ugandan micro-entrepreneurs during the 2001 presidential election. We find evidence that investor behavior responds in a small but significant way to surprises in electoral support, and this responsiveness is strongest in 'core' electoral districts.","[McIntosh, Craig; Allen, Jacob] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"McIntosh, C (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",ctmcintosh@ucsd.edu; jacoballen@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,1,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The assurance of effective business activity is connected with the changes of enterprise's structure. Such changes create the presumption for a simpler administration and execution of the enterprise's activity, ensures quicker development of the enterprise implementing new popular administration concepts. Outsourcing has been actively used since 1990 as the method of cost reducing; later it transformed into the way of risk reducing, concept of concentration to the main activity; during 30 years of changes it became a modern strategy of enterprises' activity. Outsourcing is quite a new and not very much investigated phenomenon in Lithuania though in the world it is highly expanded and used to ensure the effectiveness of enterprises' activities. Having analyzed the aims of outsourcing presented in scientific literature four main aims can be distinguished: strategic, economic, organizational and motivational. Every distinguished purpose can be used depending on the enterprise's needs, however, they cannot be used to achieve only one objective as having achieved just one aim not always the effectiveness of the enterprise's activity can be ensured. In scientific literature there are presented many types of outsourcing which are classified according to various specifics of outsourcing and are distributed to types having in mind the extent of application of outsourcing; strategic aims of the use; the place of activity's execution; the functions defined Many of authors distinguish business processes and information technologies as the main types of outsourcing; but in other cases different specification of types is given so it can be stated that the presented classifications by the scientists are influenced by the modernity of outsourcing as a means of improving the effectiveness of business; therefore developing business the types can change according to the changes of business environment. Having analyzed outsourcing, some main advantages can be sorted out: the possibility to get the service of high quality and high level; assurance of the enterprise's flexibility when conditions in market change; the use the experience of other enterprise; the implementation of innovations. However, where there are advantages some disadvantages can be found as well: the risk of loosing information, growing costs, dependence on the other enterprise, dishonesty of partners, the loss of control of the enterprise. In Lithuania small business plays a rather high role in ensuring the country's economic and social welfare. However, small business companies encounter a lot of problems. Evaluating the possibilities of outsourcing in small business the empirical research showed that of outsourcing is used in small business in Lithuania and highly spread among companies. The main aims of use of outsourcing in small business companies in Lithuania are cost reducing, increase in productivity, and improvement of quality. The benefit received in a short time is: decrease in the need of personnel, concentration on the main activity increases, reduced costs. The benefit received in a long time perspective is: reduce in administration problems, decrease in time needed for enterprise's management, improvement of product or service quality.","[Mickaitis, Audrius; Zascizinskiene, Gintare] Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Bartkus, Edverdas Vaclovas] Kaunas Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Qual Management, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vilnius University; Kaunas University of Technology,"Mickaitis, A (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Muitines Str 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",audrius.mickaitis@gmail.com; edvardas.bartkus@ktu.lt; zascizinskiene@yahoo.com,,,,,,,37,4,4,0,11,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Using k-months industrial production growth rate model, this article attempts to ascertain whether similar results are obtained for countries from East Europe (Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia). The results suggest that the interest rate spread does indeed have some predictive power over the 24-months across the countries. These results remain qualitative robust to the inclusion of additional variables and to the change of unemployment rate as a different measure of economic activity. Cyclical movements of volatility appear to be unable to account for the usefulness of the spread for forecasting industrial production growth. Finally, it is found that the term spread is a better indicator of future real growth in countries with low and stable inflation (Czech Republic) and not in countries characterized by high and volatile inflation (Hungary).","Univ Thessaly, Dept Econ, Volos 38333, Greece",University of Thessaly,"Papadamou, S (通讯作者)，Univ Thessaly, Dept Econ, Volos 38333, Greece.",stpapada@uth.gr,"Papadamou, Stephanos/I-2580-2019","Papadamou, Stephanos/0000-0002-7700-1912",,,,,25,3,3,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The starting point of the analysis is the standard partial equilibrium model of the mortgage credit market and the identification of the main factors determining the demand for, and supply of, mortgage credits. It is demonstrated that the traditional mortgage banking model, based on durable bilateral relationship between the bank and the debtor, was replaced at the end of 1990. by a new model, based on securitization and globalization of financial markets. Statistical data for 1975-2007 are used to estimate regressions of demand and supply of credits with respect to several key variables. It is shown that the rapid expansion of mortgages credits in the US after 1999 has been mainly the reflection of a major shift of the supply curve, which in turn was caused by a number of factors such as the abundance of financing linked to the inflows of foreign capital, securitization of illiquid credit assets, speculative growth of real estate prices, inconsistency between the traditional methods of risk assessment and the nature of the new financial instruments (derivatives), the implicit government guarantees extended to financial intermediation institutions, and the weakness of banking and proprietary supervision. On the other hand, the shift of the demand curve, caused by factors such as speculation, changes in household incomes, the fall of savings ratio and a low level of interest on mortgage credits, have been of lesser importance.","Wyzsza Szkola Handlu & Prawa R Lazarskiego, Szkola Glowna Handlowa Warszawie, Warsaw, Poland",,"Rosati, D (通讯作者)，Wyzsza Szkola Handlu & Prawa R Lazarskiego, Szkola Glowna Handlowa Warszawie, Warsaw, Poland.",dariusz.rosati@europarl.europa.eu,"Rosati, Dariusz/AAF-3282-2020",,,,,,32,3,3,0,25,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,2299-6184,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2009,,3,,,,,315,351,,,,,,37,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,476TT,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268469400002,0

Taking panel data and using a fixed-effects estimation for a 41-country sample over the time period from 1980 to 2004 and with a total of 129 observations, the paper points out that economic growth is negatively related to an increase in trust. This negative finding is in contrast to most empirical findings using a cross-sectional design. The common knowledge which has governed the nature of discussions in social science and economics for the last ten years, that trust is generally positively related to economic performance, must be seriously questioned. From a policy point of view an increase in trust is crucial for countries with low levels of trust, but can likely be neglected by countries with sufficient levels of trust and may even hamper economic performance in countries with high levels of trust. The relationship is tested in the context of EU countries, OECD countries and developing countries. Interpersonal trust and systemic trust is differentiated.","[Roth, Felix] Ctr European Policy Studies, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Roth, Felix] Ibero Amer Inst, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",,"Roth, F (通讯作者)，Ctr European Policy Studies, Pl Congres 1, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",felix.roth@ceps.eu,,"Roth, Felix/0000-0003-4190-9176",,,,,65,88,92,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,,2009,62.0,1,,,,,103,128,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2009.00424.x,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,395GK,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000262512400006,0

When we combine both types of behavior, average mixed-race behavior is a combination that is neither white nor black, and the variance in mixed-race behavior is generally greater than the variance in behavior of monoracial adolescents, especially as compared to the black racial group. Adolescence is the time during which there is most pressure to establish an identity, and our results indicate that mixed-race youth are finding their own distinct identities, not necessarily 'joining' either monoracial group, but in another sense joining both of them.","[Ruebeck, Christopher S.; Averett, Susan L.] Lafayette Coll, Easton, PA 18042 USA; [Bodenhorn, Howard N.] Clemson Univ, Clemson, SC 29631 USA; [Bodenhorn, Howard N.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Lafayette College; Clemson University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Ruebeck, CS (通讯作者)，Lafayette Coll, Easton, PA 18042 USA.",ruebeckc@lafayette.edu; averetts@lafayette.edu; bodnhrn@clemson.edu,,,,,,,43,4,4,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

In this context, we develop an index of infrastructure stocks and estimate growth-accounting equations to investigate the impact of infrastructure development on output. Overall, the results reveal that infrastructure stocks, labour force and total investment play an important role in economic growth in India. More importantly, we find that infrastructure development in India has a significant positive contribution toward growth than both private and public investments. Further, causality analysis shows that there is unidirectional causality from infrastructure development to output growth. From a policy perspective, there should be greater emphasis on infrastructure development to sustain the high economic growth which the Indian economy has been experiencing for the last few years.","[Sahoo, Pravakar] Univ Delhi, IEG, Delhi 110007, India; [Dash, Ranjan Kumar] NCAER, Delhi 110007, India",University of Delhi,"Sahoo, P (通讯作者)，Univ Delhi, IEG, Delhi 110007, India.",pravakar@iegindia.org,"SSE, Symbiosis School of Economics/AAB-5383-2020","SSE, Symbiosis School of Economics/0000-0001-9139-4081",,,,,51,90,99,3,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

This article is limited to the analysis and interpretation of respondents' answers two open questionnaire questions: What does the word changes mean to you? and How could you describe a successfully acting Organisation?. While analyzing respondents' opinion what the word changes means to them we referred to the components of the word distinguished by psychology science (see The Psychology of Communication, 2007) and while identifying the dimensions of a successful Organisation - to the presented abilities of exemplary companies by Ulrich and Brockbank (2007) and indicators of effectiveness matrix by Carnall (1990).

The analysed concept is not yet realized as a component of changes, alternation, and fluctuation happening in either external or internal Organisation's environment. Whereas semantic construct successful Organisation  in the expression of respondents' opinion first of all is associated with appropriate finance management, a competitive Organisation strategically oriented to a qualitative result. Generalised research data allows to state that theoretical and empirical components of the investigated object form presumptions to widen scientific knowledge about a successful, Organisation managing changes and the aspects of its expression.","[Saparnis, Gintaras; Saparniene, Diana] Siauliai Univ, Fac Social Sci, Architektu Str 1, LT-76001 Shiauliai, Lithuania; [Saparnis, Gintaras; Bersenaite, Jurgita] Siauliai Univ, Dept Management, LT-76001 Shiauliai, Lithuania; [Saparniene, Diana] Siauliai Univ, Dept Publ Adm, LT-76001 Shiauliai, Lithuania",Siauliai University; Siauliai University; Siauliai University,"Saparnis, G (通讯作者)，Siauliai Univ, Fac Social Sci, Architektu Str 1, LT-76001 Shiauliai, Lithuania.",saparnis@cr.su.lt; jurgitabersenaite@gmail.com; diana.s@smf.su.lt,"Saparniene, Diana/JJC-5823-2023","Saparniene, Diana/0000-0002-0597-3309",,,,,55,4,5,1,11,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

It therefore focuses on the topic of the relationship between output, employment, unemployment and inactivity of labour in a transition country. The transition period is from 1980 to 2006. The averages for the whole period 1980-2006 conceal too much. The whole transition period is divided into two sub-periods: the period of the transition crisis and the period of transitional rehabilitation. The thesis is that there were important differences between the two sub-periods as far as the labour market is concerned. Okun's relationships about the responses of employment and unemployment to output changes are valid during both sub-periods. Empirical estimates of the Beveridge relationship and job-matching function do not differ significantly for the first period compared with the second. The conclusion would be that the labour market responded normally during the transition and that the official statistical data do not reflect major systemic changes that the labour market has supposedly experienced during transition.","Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Senjur, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia.",marjan.senjur@ef.uni-lj.si,,,,,,,29,1,1,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2009,21.0,2,,,,,175,189,PII 911726412,10.1080/14631370902778492,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,494DQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000269790300004,0

In this article, I argue that other measures of wage inequality such as the Gini-coefficient do not necessarily rise as well. The Gini-coefficient depends positively on the skill-premium, but the effect of an increase in the relative supply of skilled labour is ambiguous. A simulation of Acemoglu's model shows that the growth in the relative supply of skilled labour has led to increased wage inequality in the past, but will lead to decreasing wage inequality in the future.","Univ Mannheim, MEA, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim,"Weiss, M (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, MEA, L13 17, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",weiss@mea.uni-mannheim.de,,,,,,,8,1,1,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

An alternative approach to environmental accounting is the consumer approach, which includes environmental pressures associated with imports for domestic consumption, wherever these pressures occur. The carbon footprint, for example, is such an approach, in which CO2 or greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are considered from a consumer's perspective. The consumer approach may offer new ways for policies to reduce pressures, and therefore it would be interesting to adopt this perspective in national environmental policy-making and international negotiations. To gain insight into the differences between the approaches, this paper discusses the concepts of both, showing the results of an empirical analysis and going into the application of the two different perspectives in (international) environmental policies. Due to international trade, the environmental pressures accounted for in a producer's and a consumer's perspective are usually not the same for a country. This paper presents a worldwide overview, comparing the outcomes for the two approaches with regard to GHG emissions and land use, for 12 world regions. Furthermore, for GHG emissions, a quantitative comparison was made between 87 countries and regions covering the world. Consumption-related GHG emissions and land use per capita were calculated with a full multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model. MRIO analysis is an attractive method for footprint analyses in an international context. The research shows that, for most developed countries, GHG emissions and land use are higher in the consumer approach than in the producer approach. For most developing countries, the opposite is true. Before applying national targets to the consumer approach - for instance, in climate policies - further improvements and standardisation of methodology and data will be necessary.","[Wilting, Harry C.; Vringer, Kees] Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy PBL, Bilthoven, Netherlands",,"Wilting, HC (通讯作者)，Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy PBL, Bilthoven, Netherlands.",Harry.Wilting@pbl.nl,,"Vringer, Kees/0000-0003-4575-1775; Wilting, Harry/0000-0002-2330-8820",,,,,62,57,60,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

While the results of the econometric evidence relevant to developing economies indicate that both stock markets and banks positively influence the economic growth, the results of econometric evidence relevant to developed economies indicate that only stock markets positively influences the economic growth.","[Yay, Guelsuen; Oktayer, Asuman] Yildiz Tech Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Econ, TR-34349 Istanbul, Turkey",Yildiz Technical University,"Yay, G (通讯作者)，Yildiz Tech Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Econ, TR-34349 Istanbul, Turkey.",gyay@yildiz.edu.tr; aoktayer@yildiz.edu.tr,"Yay, Gülsün/AAZ-6080-2020; Oktayer Buzluca, Asuman/E-7447-2016","Oktayer Buzluca, Asuman/0000-0003-1426-8588",,,,,41,6,8,0,7,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Increased bilateral trade intensity is found to have a positive impact on the correlation of both demand and supply shocks. Intra-industry trade is found to be positively linked to correlations of supply-side shocks but negatively linked to correlations of demand shocks. Our results thus provide support for the argument that aggregate demand spillovers and intra-industry trade, rather than specialization, dominate in the process through which trade flows affect the cross-country transmission of shocks in Europe. At the same time, our estimates suggest that monetary-policy convergence in Europe (the circulation of the euro), while having increased symmetry of supply-side shocks, has had no direct favourable impact on symmetry of demand shocks. By contrast, the process of fiscal-policy convergence is found to have resulted in more correlated demand shocks across the EU member states.","[Zervoyianni, Athina; Anastasiou, Athanasios] Univ Patras, Dept Econ, GR-26110 Patras, Greece",University of Patras,"Zervoyianni, A (通讯作者)，Univ Patras, Dept Econ, GR-26110 Patras, Greece.",athina@upatras.gr,,,,,,,56,7,7,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

This paper constructs a politico-economic model that accounts for this feature based on multiple, self-fulfilling expectations of agents. In this model, agents are identical at birth and can become skilled (or remain unskilled) through educational investment. When agents hold expectations of larger social security benefits, it provides a disincentive to engage in educational investment, thereby resulting in an unskilled majority. In turn, this unskilled majority supports larger social security benefits, which induces the retirement of the elderly and thus results in a lower labor force participation rate. The opposite applies when agents have expectations of smaller social security benefits in their old age.","[Ono, Tetsuo] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan; [Arawatari, Ryo] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",Osaka University; Nagoya University,"Ono, T (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",arawatari@soec.nagoya-u.ac.jp; tono@econ.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Arawatari, Ryo/HKO-6865-2023","Arawatari, Ryo/0000-0001-6875-881X; Ono, Tetsuo/0000-0002-9838-828X",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [20730208] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,34,1,2,1,15,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

First, we apply bivariate DCC-MGARCH models to extract dynamic conditional correlations between European stock markets, which are then explained by interest rate spreads, exchange rate risk, market capitalisation, and business cycle synchronisation in a pooled OLS model. By grouping the countries into euro area countries, old EU member states outside the euro area, and new EU member states, we also evaluate the impact of euro introduction and the European unification process on stock market integration. We find a significant trend toward more stock market integration, which is enhanced by the size of relative and absolute market capitalisation and hindered by foreign exchange risk between old member states and the euro area. Interest rate spreads and business cycle synchronisation are also significant factors in explaining equity market integration. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

He argues with some justice that the dominant discourse in New Institutional Economics insufficiently appreciates the complexity of institutions; as a consequence, the difficulty of transplanting institutions is largely discounted. His case, however, is marred by his attempt to push down his ideological biases by marshalling inchoate, highly questionable and often contradictory ideas as facts. Going beyond a critical examination of the New Institutional Economics inspired discourse in development economics, he advocates his own version of beneficial development policies for LDCs - namely, economic democracy and industrial policies. His proposals are not only highly questionable, but they amount to adopting a double standard of exempting himself from the very criticisms he levies against New Institutional Economics - ignoring the difficulty of importing foreign institutions. Presuming to play God, like many development economists, he ignores the essential fact that an unwilling horse cannot be made to drink.","St Johns Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Jamaica, NY 11439 USA",Saint John's University,"Choi, YB (通讯作者)，St Johns Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Jamaica, NY 11439 USA.",choiyb@stjohns.edu,,,,,,,7,2,2,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,,,J I ECON,J.

This paper proposes two alternative approaches to circumventing the missing data problems in countries where a demographic and health survey (DHS) and an ancillary household expenditure survey are available. One method relies only on the DHS, and constructs a wealth index as a measure of economic advantage. The alternative method imputes consumption from the ancillary survey into the DHS. In both cases, we compute a lower bound estimator of the share of (ex-ante) inequality of opportunity in total inequality. Parametric and non-parametric estimates are calculated for each method, and the parametric approach is shown to yield preferable lower-bound measures. In an application to the sample of ever-married women aged 30-49 in Turkey, inequality of opportunity accounts for at least 26% (31%) of overall inequality in imputed consumption (the wealth index).","[Ferreira, Francisco H.

This speeding up has been accompanied by the reverse of the exchange rate policy of China, which has strongly depreciated its currency before 1994, and then either appreciated or stabilized it. The theoretical arguments suggesting several kinds of real exchange rate impact on labour productivity are developed. An econometric model is then proposed and estimated, using panel data for the twenty-nine Chinese provinces and for the period from 1986 to 2007. The econometric results show that the appreciation of the real exchange rate had a favourable effect on the labour productivity growth, leading to a kind of virtuous circle: the real appreciation of the currency boosts the growth of labour productivity while, according to the Balassa-Samuelson effect, productivity growth tends to push up the real appreciation. Moreover, this favourable effect is stronger in inland provinces than in coastal provinces, contributing to a minimizing of the gap between inland and coastal provinces. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The model is then used to provide fresh insights on complementarities involving team work organization, communication channels, training and hiring, and other human resource management practices, and illustrate how such choice of practices is affected by the firm's output market conditions. Our econometric analysis of new data from japan which provide up-to-date information on the adoption of new team-based instruments for a horizontal coordination system (cross-functional problem solving project teams and Self-Managed Teams) yields results that are broadly consistent with the theory. First, new team-based instruments are more likely to be adopted by firms with well-established formal shop-floor-based communication channels (such as shopfloor committees), while they are much less likely to be adopted by firms with well-established information sharing institutions such as joint labor-management committees, which presumably enhance the efficiency of the vertical control system by minimizing labor-management communication errors. Finally, firms in more competitive markets and those with a higher concentration of sales among a small number of customers are more likely to adopt both types of team, whereas firms facing more erratic price movement tend not to adopt Self-Managed Teams.

This appears to link heterodox economics to the social surplus approach associated with the classical economists and currently with Sraffian economists. However, heterodox economics connects agency with the social surplus and the social product, which the Sraffians reject as they take the level and composition of the social product as given. Therefore the different theoretical approach regarding the social surplus taken in heterodox economics may generate a different but similar way of theorizing about a capitalist economy.

A certain consensus has been reached on the expansionary Keynesian effects of fiscal impulses on the economic activity. However, the existing empirical literature has concentrated on few countries, mostly outside the EU. We check the validity of this result for the EU area using annual data and a panel vector auto-regression approach, with particular attention being paid to robustness across alternative identification assumptions based on Cholesky orderings. Our results show that shocks to public spending positively affect private consumption and investment. According to our baseline estimate, a 1% increase in public current expenditure produces a 0.24% impact rise in private consumption, and a 0.41% impact rise in private investment. The effects are substantial, and die out slowly in the case of private consumption (the cumulative impact amounts to +0.56% after 3 years), but much faster in the case of private investment. A further disaggregation between wage and non-wage components reveals that public salaries have a relatively stronger stimulating role. This is not due to the different weights on GDP of the two components, which have comparable values in our sample. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Simultaneous demand and price (pseudo-supply) equations are estimated to derive these impacts of multimarket contacts in the top 30 air markets in the US multimarket contacts among FSCs do lead to collusive setting of high airfares. However, the effect of multimarket contacts is lower among LCCs, and the degree depends on the number of LCCs in a market.

A common challenge is how to strengthen financial intermediaries for longer term sustainable financing from domestic and external sources for investment serving development purposes. To address this, policymakers should bear in mind policy coherence and consistency from macro, sector, and micro perspectives. For various financial resources to bring about tangible benefits, policymakers should take account of complementarities and synergies among the full range of available financial resources.

We address three questions-how damaged stocks of durable wealth are reinvested, how an ex post portfolio of borrowing or dissaving is reallocated to diversify the asset shocks caused by the disaster, and how formal and informal consumption insurance mechanisms are effective for amending home damage-all of which have been largely unanswered. We obtain three findings. First, people respond to negative income changes and housing damage by reinvesting damaged wealth. Second, households borrow extensively to amend the large housing damage caused by the earthquake. However, they dissave only for minor household asset damage. Third, consumption smoothing is not achieved for nondurable goods that are significantly affected by negative income changes and household asset damage. These findings suggest that asset shocks caused by a large natural disaster are not sufficiently diversified for households, indicating a large gap in designing effective insurance mechanisms.","[Shimizutani, Satoshi] IIPS, Tokyo 1050001, Japan; [Sawada, Yasuyuki] Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Shimizutani, S (通讯作者)，IIPS, Toranomon 30 Mori Bldg,6F Toranomon,3-2-2 Minato, Tokyo 1050001, Japan.",sawada@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp; sshimizutani@iips.org,"Shimizutani, Satoshi/AAZ-9848-2021","Sawada, Yasuyuki/0000-0002-4167-7697",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [19GS0101] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,26,11,12,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Analysis, based on the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) data, reveals that, although causes of the earnings volatility are multi-dimensional, job separations are closely related with substantial earnings changes. Evidence also shows that estimated volatility in the heads' earnings is almost entirely smoothed by a combination of various smoothing measures, with the labor supply of other family members being the most effective measure among them.

Recently there has been debate about introducing similar quotas in private sector jobs. This paper uses a correspondence study to determine the extent of caste based discrimination in the Indian private sector. On average low-caste applicants need to send 20% more resumes than high-caste applicants to get the same callback. Differences in callback which favor high-caste applicants are particularly large when hiring is done by male recruiters or by Hindu recruiters. This finding provides evidence that differences in callback between high and low-caste applicants are not entirely due to statistical discrimination. High-caste applicants are also differentially favored by firms with a smaller scale of operations, while low-caste applicants are favored by firms with a larger scale of operations. This finding is consistent with taste-based theories of discrimination and with commitments made by large firms to hire actively from among low-caste groups. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

An advantage of the proposed model consists in international comparability; money metric scale and more importantly provide solid evidence on human capital significance for economic growth. This new approach in measuring human capital proved robust to the spurious regression problem involving human capital.

The results from the concordance index suggest that Australia's business cycle is becoming increasingly synchronised with those in East Asia, particularly with China and Japan. The correlation coefficients of gross domestic product (GDP) growth and the deviation of real GDP from its trend between Australia and its East-Asian neighbours are also significantly higher since 2000, relative to the correlation coefficients found for the 1990s. The growing importance of East Asia in Australia's economic future implies that the risks facing the economy have changed and Australia needs to engage in more macroeconomic policy dialogues with its neighbouring economies to improve their policy responses.","[Song, Lei Lei] Asian Dev Bank, Off Reg Econ Integrat, Mandaluyong, Philippines; [Tan, Sui-Lay] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst App Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",Asian Development Bank; University of Melbourne,"Song, LL (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, Off Reg Econ Integrat, Mandaluyong, Philippines.",,,,,,,,10,1,1,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-9018,1467-8462,,AUST ECON REV,Aust.

In particular, the group of participants in job creation schemes may be too different from training participants to conduct a reliable comparison. Participants in shorter training programs spend more time in employment than those in longer programs; this is mainly due to less lock-in effects.

Moreover, they coincide with the median(s) of the voters' most preferred alternatives. This important fact is known as the median voter result. Variants of it also apply when single-peakedness fails, but preferences verify other domain restrictions, such as single-crossing, intermediateness or order restriction. Austen-Smith and Banks (1999) also proved that the result holds under single-peakedness, for a wide class of voting rules that includes the majority rule as a special case, and conveniently redefined versions of a median. We extend and unify previous results. We propose a new domain condition, called top monotonicity, which encompasses all previous domains restrictions, allows for new ones and preserves a version of the median voter result for a large class of voting rules.

The gain in school quality as measured by peer and teacher inputs was equivalent to moving from one of the lowest-ranked schools to one at the district average. The reduction in crime comes largely from years after enrollment in the preferred school is complete. The impacts are concentrated among high-risk youth, who commit about 50% less crime across several different outcome measures and scalings of crime by severity.

Players are assigned either to a risky setting (known probabilities of opponent's choices) or to an ambiguity setting (probabilities of opponent's contribution are vague).

In doing so, our analysis focuses on the role of technological progress incorporated into the Chinese economy through capital accumulation and imports, which could be a cause of significant technology transfer from abroad that facilitated industrialization and rapid growth in China. However, as we know that there could be other factors influencing economic development, we have also considered the role played by domestic innovation activities, competitiveness and foreign economic conditions. We focus on examining the short- and long-run effects of the considered variables as well as the direction of their causality. In addition, we investigate the role played by the exchange rate on growth and discuss some policy implications of this effect on the current debate on the appreciation of the Yuan. The empirical results provide evidence that both imports and investment encourage output and labor productivity in the long run, but neither investment causes imports nor imports cause investment. Moreover, we found that during the period considered the real exchange rate influenced output, but not productivity. These findings provide interesting insights on the future Chinese economic policy.

We develop a joint structural Vector Auto Regression (VAR) model of the global crude oil, US gasoline, and US ethanol markets to examine whether the US ethanol market has had any impact on global oil markets. The structural VAR approach provides a unique method for decomposing price and quantity data into demand and supply shocks, allowing us to estimate the distinct dynamic effects of ethanol demand and supply shocks on the real prices of crude oil and US gasoline. Ethanol demand in the US is driven mainly by government support in the form of tax credits and blending mandates. Shocks to ethanol demand therefore reflect changes in policy more than any other factor. In contrast, ethanol supply shocks are driven by changes in feedstock prices. A principle finding is that a policy-driven ethanol demand expansion causes a statistically significant decline in real crude oil prices, while an ethanol supply expansion does not have a statistically significant impact on real oil prices.

We also show that ethanol demand shocks are more important than ethanol supply shocks in explaining the fluctuation of real prices of crude oil and US gasoline.

This paper investigates households' willingness to pay for a renewable energy program in a southwestern state, New Mexico (NM). Using the contingent valuation method, we provide different scenarios that include provision of 10% and 20% of renewable energy supply, to elicit households' willingness to pay (WTP) for the renewable energy. We estimate the WTP for specific shares of renewable energy in the total energy mix as it is a key factor in affecting the price of the energy portfolio in the market. The survey design also allows us to check the scope sensitivity of renewable energy which can help guide the future renewable energy policy. We hope results from this study will offer useful insights to energy regulators and utility companies and help them increase the share of renewable energy supply. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The hypothesis of a critical consumer appears blurred by a decision-making process revealing the persistence of traditional attitudes with a strong sensitivity to price, alongside the emergence of new cohorts of stimulation on customers, as shown by the focus on the attribute quality.

We argue that these findings can be explained by the political elite having an incentive to extend civil liberties but reduce political rights in the presence of oil windfalls to evade redistribution and conflict. We support our argument documenting that there is a significant effect of oil rents on corruption in countries with a high share of state participation in oil production while no such link exists in countries where state participation in oil production is low.

While there is abundant evidence about the labor supply of married women and single mothers, little is known about how young (childless) singles react to financial incentives. The French minimum income (Revenu Minimum d'Insertion, RMI), often accused of generating strong disincentives to work, offers a natural setting to study this question since childless single individuals, primarily males, constitute the core group of recipients. Exploiting the fact that childless adults under age 25 are not eligible for this program, we conduct a regression discontinuity analysis using French Census data. We find that the RMI reduces the participation of uneducated single men by 7-10% at age 25.

For example, when workers compete for promotion, bonuses, or other rewards, they may misrepresent their output (i.e., commit fraud) or increase their output by unacceptable means (e. g., violate regulations). We show how the extent of cheating is determined by the payoffs at stake in the contest, the random component of output, probability of cheating being detected, number of contestants, and the penalty associated with being found to have cheated. We find that while greater enforcement reduces cheating, it may also reduce productive effort. We also identify how two particular aspects of enforcement, the awarding of default victories and use of correlated rather than independent audits, affect cheating behavior.

It finds that the immigrant share of population raises private school enrollment across countries by leading to a decrease in the share of public education spending. The decrease is driven by responses to immigrants from culturally similar and developed countries. This suggests that the role of public schools in promoting social cohesion among diverse populations is weighted against other concerns in education funding decisions in places with immigrant populations.

It is shown that when property rights of the middle class are less protected, there is more competition among the elites. Therefore, in some circumstances, economic performance improves despite insecure property rights. On the other hand, however, when there exists strong competition among the elites, property rights protection for the middle class decreases. Hence, under some conditions, economic performance worsens even though the competition is high.

Yet nationalism, an indicator of successful nation-building, has been empirically linked to protectionism and intolerance, which suggests that dismal performance is a more likely outcome. This paper empirically identifies an inverted U-shaped relationship between nationalism and government effectiveness. The results suggest that the level of nationalism in the population is higher than optimal in most countries. It is further shown that nationalism may mitigate the negative effects of ethnic heterogeneity in former colonies. We find no clear linkages between nationalism and trade openness.

In this paper we use an adapted microeconomic model that determines the value of a country's intellectual capital. For this, we consider intangibles such as human development, economic structure, international trade, foreign image and innovation. This measurement of intellectual capital is divided into human and structural capital and is used to analyse the relationship between these capitals and the economic development of the 27 countries in the European Union (EU27).

A first-passage-time model with jump default barrier is adopted to capture the counterparty effects on the pricing of defaultable claims. Following the framework of Jarrow and Yu (2001), the jump in primary firm's bankruptcy barrier is designed as the loss on capital resulted from secondary firm's bankruptcy. The relevance of market incompleteness in the context of claim-pricing is considered using good-deal asset price bound method by Cochrane and Saa-Requejo (2000). We show that the effects of counterparty's default clearly diminish the uses of debt, which indirectly explains the so-called under-leveraged puzzle. We further find that counterparty effects on capital structure are sensitive to market incompleteness and firm's characteristics, such as tax rate and bankruptcy cost rate. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper this portrayal of institutional economics is rejected and choice is reclaimed for institutionalism. In fact, institutional economics is not committed to an understanding of behavior as mere stimulus-response. Notwithstanding the fact that institutionalism places great emphasis on habit in human conduct, this does not mean that it excludes autonomy, volition or rationality. The paper addresses the notion of habit within the pragmatist-institutionalist tradition with the aim of clarifying this concept, disentangling it from current misconceptions. With the intention of contributing to the development of a theory of choice in institutionalism, it then deals with deliberation and choice in the pragmatist literature, namely in John Dewey's Human Action and Conduct. Finally, the implications of deliberation thus conceived, namely in respect to collective action and institutional change, are highlighted.","[Costa, Ana Narciso] Lisbon Univ Inst, ISCTE, Lisbon, Portugal; [Caldas, Jose Castro] Univ Coimbra, Ctr Social Studies CES, P-3000 Coimbra, Portugal",Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; Universidade de Coimbra,"Costa, AN (通讯作者)，Lisbon Univ Inst, ISCTE, Lisbon, Portugal.",,,"Caldas, Jose Maria Castro/0000-0001-8224-2254; Costa, Ana/0000-0002-7618-8578","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PTDC/CS-ECS/099630/2008, UI/BD/154535/2022] Funding Source: FCT",Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),,,32,6,6,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Moreover, by comparing the changes in labour laws, this article aims to shed some light on the likely influence of reforms on aggregate labour market outcomes and to evaluate whether they might help reduce the high degree of sensitivity of employment with respect to changes in production, a very distinctive feature of the Spanish economy when compared with other EU countries.","Univ Alcala, Alcala De Henares, Spain",Universidad de Alcala,"Serrano, CG (通讯作者)，Univ Alcala, Alcala De Henares, Spain.",,,,,,,,17,12,12,0,9,"UNIV ZARAGOZA DEV COOPERATION CHAIR, SPANISH NETWORK DEV STUDIES",ZARAGOZA,"GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

As a first step, we have conducted a laboratory experiment with 960 participants. We consider investments that direction benefit the non-investing party. While according to standard theory, contracting would useless if renegotiation cannot be ruled out, we find that option contracts significant improve investment incentives compared to a no-contract treatment. This finding might be attributed to Hart and Moore's (2008) recent idea that contracts can serve as reference points. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The results reveal that the trading signals calculated with the VIX level provide large, statistically significant profits that are in excess of the profits from the traditional computation.

The complexity of an integrated representation of economic and electricity systems makes simplifying assumptions appealing, but there is no evidence in the literature on how important the pitfalls may be. The aim of this paper is to provide such evidence, drawing on numerical simulations from a suite of partial and general equilibrium models that share common technological features and are calibrated to the same benchmark data. We report two basic findings. First, general equilibrium intersectoral effects of an economy-wide carbon policy are large. It follows that assessing abatement potentials and price changes in the electricity sector with a partial equilibrium Marshallian demand can only provide a crude approximation of the complex demand-side interactions. Second, we provide evidence that widely used top-down representations of electricity technologies produce fuel substitution patterns that are inconsistent with bottom-up cost data. This supports the view that the parametrization of substitution possibilities with highly aggregated production functions is difficult to validate empirically. The overall picture that emerges is one of large quantitative and even qualitative differences, highlighting the role of key structural assumptions in the interpretation of climate policy projections.

The 2001 U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) provides an excellent opportunity to examine this question as, unlike other bilateral trade agreements, the U.S. tariff cuts were not influenced by Vietnamese industries. Using variation in the structure of the labor force across provinces prior to the trade agreement, I construct provincial measures of U.S. tariffs. To address concerns over confounding trends between changes in provincial poverty and changes in provincial tariffs I follow two approaches: controlling for trends based on observable initial conditions and differencing away time invariant trends using pre-BTA data. I find that provinces that were more exposed to the U.S. tariff cuts experienced faster decreases in poverty between 2002 and 2004. Additionally, I document that the movement of workers across provinces is limited in scale, particularly for those with low levels of education. Finally, I show that the most exposed provinces experienced faster wage growth for workers with low levels of education, but not for highly educated workers. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Using the propensity score matching method (allowing for multiple, mutually exclusive support scenarios) to compare the effects of PCG on different institutions, the present study provides suggestions to help the government make decisions regarding the consolidation of PCG funds. The results suggest that the institutions function differently and target different SME.

Capital utilization decisions and their differential role in determining market prices for capital goods under the two regimes of infrastructure provision serve as a critical transmission mechanism for fiscal policy. A subsidy to private providers of infrastructure is preferable to direct government provision irrespective of how the subsidy or expenditure is financed. The case for private provision is much stronger in economies characterized by high levels of congestion. The choice between private and government provision also has a crucial effect on the design of optimal fiscal policy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We show that on the economy's unique balanced growth equilibrium path, the sign of the correlation between money and output growth depends crucially on: (i) the intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption; and (ii) the liquidity-constrained ratio of consumption to investment expenditure. Moreover, our model economy always exhibits a positive output-growth effect in response to changes of the strength for social status. We also undertake numerical experiments to assess the quantitative importance of our theoretical results under an empirically plausible set of parameters.","[Guo, Jang-Ting] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Chen, Hung-Ju] Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei, Taiwan",University of California System; University of California Riverside; National Taiwan University,"Guo, JT (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, 4123 Sproul Hall, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",guojt@ucr.edu,"Guo, Jang-Ting/AAY-8365-2021; CHEN, HUNG-JU/M-1077-2018","Guo, Jang-Ting/0000-0001-9948-9691; CHEN, HUNG-JU/0000-0001-7775-8571",,,,,29,6,7,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

In this paper we reconsider the transmission of shocks to government spending across these regimes within a standard new-Keynesian model of a small open economy. Because of the stronger emphasis on intertemporal optimization, the new-Keynesian framework requires a precise specification of fiscal and monetary policies, and their interaction, at both short and long horizons. We derive an analytical characterization of the transmission mechanism of expansionary spending policies under a peg, showing that the long-term real interest rate necessarily rises if inflation rises on impact, in response to an increase in government spending. This drives down private demand even though short-term real rates fall. As this need not be the case under floating exchange rates, the conventional wisdom needs to be qualified. Under plausible medium-term fiscal policies, government spending is not necessarily less expansionary in a floating regime.","[Corsetti, Giancarlo] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Kuester, Keith] Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Mueller, Gernot J.] Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany",University of Cambridge; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Philadelphia; University of Bonn,"Corsetti, G (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",gc422@cam.ac.uk; keith.kuester@phil.frb.org; gernot.mueller@uni-bonn.de,,,,,,,22,3,3,0,6,BANCO CENTRAL CHILE,SANTIAGO,"MORANDE 115 2ND PISO, AUGUSTINAS 1180, SANTIAGO, 6500-590, CHILE",0717-3830,,,ECON CHIL,Econ.

The model is solved by a nonlinear method. The posterior distribution of the parameters in the model is found to be bi-modal. The degree of nominal rigidity is high at one mode (sticky price mode) but is low at the other mode (flexible price mode). I find that the degree of nominal rigidity is important for identifying macro shocks that affect the yield curve. When prices are more flexible, a slowly varying inflation target of the central bank is the main driver of the overall level of the yield curve by changing long-run inflation expectations. In contrast, when prices are more sticky, a highly persistent markup shock is the main driver. The posterior probability of each mode is sensitive to the use of observed proxies for inflation expectations. Ignoring additional information from survey data on inflation expectations significantly reduces the posterior probability of the flexible price mode. Incorporating this additional information suggests that yield curve fluctuations can be better understood by focusing on the flexible price mode. Considering nonlinearities of the model solution also increases the posterior probability of the flexible price mode, although to a lesser degree than using survey data information.

These findings are consistent with a model where workers need to gather costly information in order to improve their retirement decision. Second, I use this exogenous variation in knowledge to analyze the optimality of workers' decisions. Several findings suggest that workers do not change their retirement behavior: i) Workers do not change their expected age of retirement after receiving the Statement; ii) monthly claiming patterns do not show any change after the introduction of the Social Security Statement; iii) workers do not become more sensitive to Social Security incentives after receiving the Statement.

There then exist equilibria that sustain the industry monopoly outcome; moreover, as long as retailers can use non-linear tariffs, such equilibria exist irrespectively of whether slotting allowances are allowed or banned. Non-contingent contracts, on the other hand, necessarily lead to exclusion, with or without slotting allowances.

Complementary basic skills such as numeracy catalyze technology adoption, and adoption may be path dependent even when payoffs are certain and independent across agents.","Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Niehaus, P (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",,,,,,,,68,16,22,0,27,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-3808,1537-534X,,J POLIT ECON,J.

The study shows evidence of an increase in the size of the sector with a slowdown in the reforms period. Evidence indicates that the rate of growth varies widely across the two-digit industries but the variation in growth rate is smaller during the 1990s. Textiles and machinery goods were the fastest growing segments of India's unorganized manufacturing sector in the reforms period. The partial factor productivity approach shows that labor productivity has improved in 2000-2001 over 1978-1979 while capital productivity reported a decline in the same period. The sector, on the other hand, registered a fall in total factor productivity (TFP) during the reforms period. It is found that technological progress has been the main contributor to the growth in TFP in the prereforms period while technical regress contributed to the decline in TFP in the reforms period. A completely different picture is noticed since the mid-1990s when the sector made significant progress in TFP primarily attributed to technological progress which outweighed the decline in technical efficiency. It is also found that capital intensity is an essential factor augmenting labor productivity levels in the sector, which is important for improving the wages paid to the workers in the sector.","Ctr Multidisciplinary Dev Res, Dharwad, Karnataka, India",,"Raj, SNR (通讯作者)，Ctr Multidisciplinary Dev Res, Dharwad, Karnataka, India.",rajeshraj.natarajan@gmail.com,"Rajesh, S.N./AAG-7713-2020","Raj, Rajesh/0000-0001-8363-7135",,,,,33,8,8,0,16,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

A sort of Cass Criterion (Cass, 1972 [10]) completely characterizes constrained inefficiency under the hypothesis of uniform gains from risk-sharing (which is always satisfied in stationary economies when the autarchy is constrained inefficient). Uniform gains from risk-sharing also guarantee a finite value of the intertemporal aggregate endowment at a constrained optimum. Hence, no equilibrium exhibits a null interest rate in the long run. Finally, constrained inefficiency occurs if and only if there exists a feasible redistribution producing a welfare improvement at all contingencies. (C)2011 Elsevier Inc.

This allows us to conclude that in post-float Australia the results deviate significantly from the mainstream Friedman paradigm on inflation and its uncertainty. We also critically review the plausibility of rival paradigms e.g. Keynesian-Mundell-Fleming, Friedman-Ball, Cukierman-Meltzer and Holland, explaining this paradoxical behavior.

According to our analysis, linearity is a good approximation only for middle and high income countries. Hence, our main conclusion is that globalization is a powerful weapon against corruption only for middle and high income countries, while for low income countries globalization has no significant impact on corruption.

This will require us to adapt our methods to the nature of an economy-to change how we do economics. It is also argued that the economy is not globally stable but harbours instabilities. The crisis should have cured us of the pretence of knowledge (Caballero 2010) -of the illusion that we understood problems of macroeconomic instability very well and had solved them all to general satisfaction.

Death has two opposing effects on art prices. By irrevocably restricting the artist's oeuvre, prices, ceteris paribus, increase when the artist dies. On the other hand, an untimely death may well frustrate the collectors' hopes of owning artwork that will, as the artist's career progresses, become generally known and appreciated. By frustrating expected future name recognition, death impacts negatively on art prices. In conjunction, these two channels of influence give rise to a hump-shaped relationship between age at death and death-induced price changes. Using transactions from fine art auctions, we show that the empirically identified death effects indeed conform to our theoretical predictions. We derive our results from hedonic art price regressions, making use of a dataset which exceeds the sample size of traditional studies in cultural economics by an order of magnitude.","[Ursprung, Heinrich W.] Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, D-78457 Constance, Germany; [Wiermann, Christian] Roland Berger Strategy Consultants, D-80807 Munich, Germany",University of Konstanz,"Ursprung, HW (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, Box D-138, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",Heinrich.Ursprung@uni-konstanz.de; Christian.Wiermann@de.rolandberger.com,,,,,,,21,37,40,3,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

One important means of supporting the creation of new jobs is to increase competition. In this paper, it is shown that on average the mark-up, i.e. the deviation of prices from marginal cost in the euro area still exceeds the levels observed in the UK and in the US. After completion of the Single Market Programme in 1993, the mark-up has declined in the euro area and even more in the UK. Nevertheless, there is a strong cross-country variation between Member States, with a particularly high mark-up ratio found for Italy. Panel estimations show that total factor productivity growth, labour productivity growth and the labour market performance in the euro area could be improved by reducing the mark-up. This could be achieved by a proper institutional design. More competition could indeed improve the macroeconomic performance.","[Weyerstrass, Klaus] Inst Adv Studies, A-1060 Vienna, Austria; [Jaenicke, Johannes] Univ Erfurt, Fac Econ Law & Social Sci, D-99089 Erfurt, Germany",University of Erfurt,"Weyerstrass, K (通讯作者)，Inst Adv Studies, Stumpergasse 56, A-1060 Vienna, Austria.",klaus.weyerstrass@ihs.ac.at; johannes.jaenicke@uni-erfurt.de,,"Weyerstrass, Klaus/0000-0002-5659-8991; Jaenicke, Johannes/0000-0001-8000-309X",,,,,34,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,JUL,2011,38.0,3,,,SI,,351,380,,10.1007/s10663-010-9161-0,0.0,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,022VX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000309993400005,0

If they do, is it because the grants crowd out donors who feel they gave through taxes (classic crowd out), or is it because the grant crowds out the fundraising of the charities who, after getting the grant, reduce efforts of fundraising (fundraising crowd-out)? This is the first paper to separate these two effects. Using a panel of more than 8000 charities, we find that crowding out is significant, at about 75%. We find this crowding out is due primarily to reduced fundraising. Depending on which types of organizations are included in the analysis, crowding out attributable to classic crowd-out ranges from 30% to a slight crowd-in effect, while fundraising crowd-out ranges from 70% to over 100% of all crowd-out. Such a finding could have important consequences for how governments structure grants to non-profits. Our results indicate, for example, that requirements that charities match a fraction of government grants with increases in private donations might be a feasible policy that could reduce the detrimental effects of crowding out.

We use a sample of players selected in the AFL player draft (National Draft) between 1986 and 2002, and test for escalation effects by examining whether a player's draft order affects his subsequent utilisation by the club to which he was drafted. Utilisation is represented with measures of games played and tenure. Limited evidence of an escalation effect is found. Any relation between a player's draft order and his games played and tenure at the club to which he was drafted is concentrated in the early years of his career, and this apparent relation can be explained by the information about a player's ability that is contained in the player's draft order and by incentives for clubs to provide greater playing experience to higher ability players. Escalation effects in the AFL competition are therefore much weaker than have been found in studies of the US National Basketball Association (NBA). It is suggested that differences in the structure of the competitions may explain why the escalation effect in the AFL would be weaker than in the NBA.

In a context of intense aging processes, mainstream economists argue that the replacement of the pay-as-you-go pensions systems by unfunded individual savings accounts will have a positive impact, at a microeconomic and at a macroeconomic level, and will protect pension systems of the negative consequences of aging. However, these conclusions depend dramatically on the assumptions of rational expectations and perfect information. When we accept the existence of uncertainty, the presumed positive consequences of these reforms disappear, showing the advantages of pay-as-you-go over funded pension systems.","[Ferreiro, Jesus; Serrano, Felipe] Univ Basque Country, Dept Appl Econ 5, Madrid, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Ferreiro, J (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, Dept Appl Econ 5, Madrid, Spain.",,"Ferreiro, Jesus/J-3556-2019; Serrano, Felipe/X-9303-2019","Ferreiro, Jesus/0000-0002-5732-7966; Serrano, Felipe/0000-0002-5993-7178",,,,,16,4,5,0,14,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Are the determinants of US corruption sensitive to the choice of the measure of corruption? Overall, the answer to this question is that the choice of the measure of corruption matters in explaining corruption. However, some findings are robust across measures. For instance, greater educational attainment lowers corruption, while greater judicial employment adds to corruption. Southern states were found to be more corrupt, ceteris paribus. We also provide evidence that it is important to control for enforcement efforts in empirical modeling using convictions as a measure of corruption. Significant differences, however, across corruption measures occur in a number of other instances. Specifically, the effects of urbanization, economic prosperity, population size, media, government spending, and enforcement are sensitive to the measure of corruption. Further, the influences of the nation's foreign neighbors and of the location of the state relative to the nation's capital remain unclear.","[Goel, Rajeev K.] Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61790 USA; [Nelson, Michael A.] Univ Akron, Dept Econ, Akron, OH 44325 USA",Illinois State University; University System of Ohio; University of Akron,"Goel, RK (通讯作者)，Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",rkgoel@ilstu.edu; nelson2@uakron.edu,"Nelson, Michael Shawn/GXF-4934-2022; Goel, Rajeev K/HPD-3780-2023","Goel, Rajeev/0000-0001-9580-3196",,,,,40,78,87,3,52,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,,,ECON GOV,Econ.

On the other hand, when an author cites someone else's work, he gives the impression that he views the cited author as more competent than himself; this is called the signaling effect. These two effects are the main causes of citation bias. Using data from Research Papers in Economics or RePEc, a decentralized database of working papers, journal articles and professional books, we empirically show that a citation bias exists in this field.

First, the dynamic beta measures encompassing both the time-varying technique and state-varying mechanism are significantly better than the constant beta and the pure time-varying and state-varying betas in matching the pattern of stock returns. Second, the misspecified models obtained with inappropriate beta settings could serve as one of the reasons for abnormal returns.","[Li, Ming-Yuan Leon] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Accountancy, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; [Li, Ming-Yuan Leon] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Grad Inst Finance & Banking, Tainan 70101, Taiwan",National Cheng Kung University; National Cheng Kung University,"Li, MYL (通讯作者)，Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Accountancy, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.",,"Li, Leon/H-9013-2016","Li, Leon/0000-0002-2865-6568",,,,,37,0,0,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

We also find that the educational levels of incubator managers and the financial support given to their clients have significant impacts on the number of graduates. However, the number of graduates does not increase with the scale and diversity of the cities in which their STBIs are located or with the presence of foreign ventures and universities in the locality.

It is suggested that since China met its Lewis turning point in about 2004, and a labor shortage became a limiting factor in production, there has been stronger demand for hukou system reform. In the meantime, various levels of government have a point where incentives are compatibile for carrying out reforms. The paper also explores some limitations of the currently implemented reform in certain regions and puts forward relevant policy suggestions.","Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Populat & Labor Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Cai, F (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Populat & Labor Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",caifang@cass.org.cn,,,,,,,25,84,95,4,59,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAY-JUN,2011,19.0,3,,,,,33,48,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2011.01241.x,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,772IJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291227300003,0

We draw on diverse data to demonstrate the unique development trajectory of the industry in China. China has benefited through targeted spin-offs of R&D-oriented foreign direct investment from developed countries driven by the effects of globalization, government-encouraged collaboration between the domestic academia and industry, and the input of overseas returnees. Together with an increasing focus of the government and domestic enterprises on independent innovation, such developments have enabled China to catch up with the global biotechnology industry. However, its small scale and low capacity for commercializing innovations under China's current regulations and other barriers pose challenges for the development of the industry. Suggestions for the sustainable development of China's biotechnology industry are presented in this study.","[Chen, Yantai] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Econ & Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Luo, Laijun] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yaguang] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University of Technology; Renmin University of China; Peking University,"Chen, YT (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Econ & Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",chenyantai@tsinghua.edu.cn; laijunluo@163.com; arg.cheung@gmail.com,"Yu, Yue/JWP-9103-2024; zhang, yuyang/IVV-5089-2023",,,,,,42,9,9,6,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAY-JUN,2011,19.0,3,,,,,105,123,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2011.01245.x,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,772IJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291227300007,0

Moreover, greed and the risk appetite of traders are often blamed for financial instability and there is no evidence how greed and risk aversion affect the effectiveness of regulations in financial markets. We aim to add to this gap in the literature by analyzing how the effectiveness of transaction taxes depend on different behavioral patterns within an agent-based framework. Our simulations indicate that a tax rate of 0.1% demarcates the stabilizing tax regime from the destabilizing one. We figure out that transaction taxes are less effective, either when chartists trade more aggressively, fundamentalists trade less aggressively, agents switch more frequently between trading strategies or only have short memory in their fitness measures. Lower risk aversion of agents, however, makes higher tax rates more effective as indicated by a flatter volatility response curve. We conclude that additional regulations should concentrate on the traders' responsibilities for their risk-exposure.","[Demary, Markus] Cologne Inst Econ Res, D-50668 Cologne, Germany; [Demary, Markus] Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Demary, M (通讯作者)，Cologne Inst Econ Res, Konrad Adenauer Ufer 21, D-50668 Cologne, Germany.",demary@iwkoeln.de,,,,,,,41,11,11,0,21,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

It has two stable short-run equilibria, achieved by expectations adjustment; shifting curves in the medium run can cause a jump from high employment equilibrium to stagnation. Such a leap can arise from endogenous declines in the demand/debt ratio occurring after persistent periods of high employment (cf. Minsky, 1982; Kalecki, 1933). We thus provide an explanation of the U.S. economy falling off a cliff - perhaps as seen during 2007-2009 - as being due to the Great Moderation of 1985-2006; this interpretation is made more plausible by reference to empirical data. The model also allows for milder fluctuations. The model's asymmetries suggest the need for pump-priming by policy-makers to allow recovery after a steep recession. We use a synthesis of the rational and adaptive theories of expectation determination. (C) 2011 Elsevier ay.

We match firms privatized with the use of foreign direct investment (FDI) to a control group of nonprivatized state-owned companies in order to disentangle the effect of self-selection and FDI entry. Evidence suggests that although FDI enters more frequently into companies that already participate in the international trading networks, roughly half the export intensity differential may be attributed to the entry of FDI. On the other hand, selection effects seem to dominate as far as efficiency is concerned, whereas only toward the end of the sample may the positive effect of FDI on profitability be confirmed.","[Hagemejer, Jan] Univ Warsaw, Dept Econ, PL-00325 Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Hagemejer, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Dept Econ, PL-00325 Warsaw, Poland.",,"Tyrowicz, Joanna/I-3270-2019; Hagemejer, Jan/G-6339-2013","Tyrowicz, Joanna/0000-0002-5928-332X; Hagemejer, Jan/0000-0003-0775-3411",,,,,32,8,8,2,17,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0012-8775,,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

Following Chao and Wilson (Am Econ Rev 77:899-916, 1987) and McAfee (Econometrica 70:2025-2034, 2002), our philosophy is that, if the worst-case scenario under coarse matching is not too bad relative to what is achievable by more complex, finer schemes, a coarse matching scheme will turn out to be preferable once the various transaction costs associated with fine schemes are taken into account.

Empirical evidence has, however, been accumulating pointing to an important leading indicator role for money and credit aggregates with respect to long term inflationary trends. Such a role could arise from monetary aggregates furnishing a nominal anchor for inflationary expectations, from their influence on the term structure of interest rates and from their affecting transaction costs in markets. Our paper attempts to assess the informational content role of money in the Indian economy by a separation of these effects across time scales and frequency bands, using the techniques of wavelet analysis and band spectral analysis respectively. Our results indicate variability of causal relations across frequency ranges and time scales, as also occasional causal reversals. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Nachane, D.

It gives rise to interactive innovation-selection dynamics. The model allows studying the combined effects of selection and variety generation on evolutionary-economic change. The developed framework describes a population of boundedly rational entrepreneurs who decide each period on the allocation of investments in different production technologies. They tend to invest in below-average cost technologies, just as under replicator dynamics. In addition, they spend a constant fraction of investments, captured by mutation and recombination rates, on alternative technologies and research on recombinant innovation. As opposed to most previous studies, mutation and recombination are here conceptual variables with a concrete behavioral interpretation, namely describing the decision rules (heuristics) of investors. We compare the dynamics of shares of investments in various technologies for three cases: with constant costs of capital, with costs decreasing steadily and exogenously over time, and with costs depending on the level of cumulative investments. For each model version, we examine under which conditions the coexistence of technological options is feasible and optimal in terms of minimizing the average cost of investments.

In contrast, in this paper, we experimentally test how individual cinema-goers are influenced by two variables that have aroused considerable interest in the literature: critical reviews and the role of box office stars. As regards the former, the results of our experiment indicate that negative reviews by film critics are cues that affect cinema-goers' pre-film assessment of a film yet fail to exert any effect on post-film assessment. As regards the latter, a cast of box office stars is not seen to be an indication of quality per se for our experimental subjects.

The firm faces uncertain income and is subject to tax asymmetries with no loss-offset provisions. The firm has access to unbiased futures contracts in each period for hedging purposes. We impose a liquidity constraint on the firm. Specifically, whenever the net interim loss due to its first-period futures position exceeds a predetermined threshold level, the firm is forced to terminate its risk management program and, therefore, is prohibited from trading the futures contracts in the second period. We show that the liquidity-constrained firm optimally adopts a full-hedge via its second-period futures position to minimize the extent of the income risk and an under-hedge via its first-period futures position to limit the degree of the liquidity risk.","[Wong, Kit Pong] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong,"Wong, KP (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Sch Econ & Finance, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",kpwong@econ.hku.hk,,,,,,,10,1,1,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1361-374X,,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

We find that both the optimal licensing contract and the innovator's licensing revenue are closely related to the patent's strength, i.e., the probability it would be found valid if tested in court. It is shown that, for a relatively weak patent (patent's strength is low), it's optimal for the innovator to charge the royalty rate as high as possible coupled with a negative fixed fee. But for a relatively strong patent (patent's strength is high), contract involving the combination of a medium level royalty rate and a positive fixed fee is optimal. We also discuss how the patent's strength affects the social welfare of a patent. Finally we present two policy suggestions that may alleviate the social welfare loss raised by the licensing of weak patents. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Regarding how banking affects the welfare costs of inflation, we find that, with banking, inflation generates lower welfare costs. We also find that lowering inflation improves welfare not just by reducing consumption/production distortions, but also by avoiding financial intermediation costs. Therefore, understanding the nature of financial intermediation is critical for accurately assessing the welfare gain from lowering the inflation rate. Regarding how monetary policy affects the welfare effects of banking, we find that, when the inflation is low, banking is not active in channeling liquidity; when inflation is high, banking is active and improves welfare; and when inflation is moderate, banking is active but reduces welfare.

One natural hypothesis is that the increase in coverage, as it progressively includes the more vulnerable groups, explains the stabilization of quality and the wider income-related gap. We explore the existence of a sample bias and we find an overestimation of performance of around one fifth of one standard deviation of the SIMCE test when measured by the average score instead of correcting by selection. We also find that the differential between the mean scores of total population and the educated population narrows as income increases. The consequence is that the mean underestimates the income-related educational gap-as measured by the ratio between the highest and lowest income quintiles-by around 10 percentage points. Finally-and unexpectedly-, we do not find that the increased coverage has resulted in an underestimation of the fall in real gaps over time.","[Paredes, Ricardo D.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Ingn, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,,agutierrez@dipres.gob.cl; rparedes@ing.puc.cl,"Paredes, Ricardo D/M-1653-2013",,,,,,17,3,3,0,7,BANCO CENTRAL CHILE,SANTIAGO,"MORANDE 115 2ND PISO, AUGUSTINAS 1180, SANTIAGO, 6500-590, CHILE",0717-3830,,,ECON CHIL,Econ.

In this paper, the public service provider is assumed to maximize utility defined over public service supply to different target groups, given a budget constraint. The production technology is target-group-specific and depends on the ability of each target group to produce service outcomes. Three benchmark allocation principles are identified: equality of treatment (ET), equality of outcome (EO), and equality of marginal cost (EMC). These principles can be considered to be consistent with special cases of a public preference model, which allows for compromises between different allocation principles. The condition of technological dominance implies that there is a clear-cut equity-productivity trade-off, whereas violations of this condition may reduce the significance of the trade-off.","Stat Norway, Res Dept, N-0033 Oslo, Norway",Statistics Norway,"Langorgen, A (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, Res Dept, POB 8131 Dep, N-0033 Oslo, Norway.",audun.langorgen@ssb.no,,,,,,,16,2,2,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

High Speed Rail (HSR). has reached its greatest splendour to become, in late 2010. the largest HSR network of NI and OECD countries. However. the investment policy decisions have been taken in a context devoid of an open and rigorous debate and where economic analysis. which has obtained clear and robust results, has played a marginal role. The marginality of the effect of economic analysis on the investment policy is due to its almost exclusive emphasis on the financial aspects and the reluctance to address multidisciplinary elements that. in practice. have been commonly used as persuasive arguments for government's network design. This paper provides an analysis in terms of objectives and actual effects of high speed projects, taking into account the multiple dimensions in order to complement the economic analysis by favouring its impact in the public policy debate. Among these multiple dimensions, we review the issues concerning the design and structure of the network. the economic costs and social return on investments, as well as the environmental and mobility impacts.","[Albalate, Daniel; Bel, Germa] Univ Barcelona, GiM IREA, Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Albalate, D (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, GiM IREA, Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain.",,"Albalate, Daniel/I-1316-2015; Bel, Germà/A-1388-2008; Albalate, Daniel/N-8124-2019","Bel, Germà/0000-0002-1330-8085; Albalate, Daniel/0000-0002-4940-4589",,,,,32,16,16,0,25,"UNIV ZARAGOZA DEV COOPERATION CHAIR, SPANISH NETWORK DEV STUDIES",ZARAGOZA,"GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

Approximately 6 pesos of every 100 peso increment in remittance income are spent on health. The sensitivity of health care expenditures to variations in the level of international remittances is almost three times greater than their sensitivity to changes in other sources of household income. Furthermore, health care expenditures are less responsive to remittance income among lower-income households. Since the lower responsiveness may be partially due to participation of lower-income households in public programs like PROGRESA (now called Oportunidades), we also analyze the impact of remittances by health care coverage. As expected, we find that households with some kind of health care coverage-either through their jobs or via participation in PROGRESA-spend less of remittance income increments on health care than households lacking any health care coverage. Hence, remittances may help equalize health care expenditures across households with and without health care coverage.","[Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina] San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Pozo, Susan] Western Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University; Western Michigan University,"Amuedo-Dorantes, C (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",camuedod@mail.sdsu.edu; susan.pozo@wmich.edu,"Islam, Md/Q-8401-2018; Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina/AAI-7730-2020","Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina/0000-0002-4750-309X; Pozo, Susan/0000-0001-7608-4886",,,,,38,73,82,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

A puzzle emerges when Phillips curves estimated over 1960-2007 are used to predict inflation over 2008-10: inflation should have fallen by more than it did. We resolve this puzzle with two modifications of the Phillips curve, both suggested by theories of costly price adjustment: we measure core inflation with the weighted median of consumer price inflation rates across industries, and we allow the slope of the Phillips curve to change with the level and variance of inflation. We then examine the hypothesis of anchored inflation expectations. We find that expectations have been fully shock-anchored since the 1980s, while level anchoring has been gradual and partial, but significant. It is not clear whether expectations are sufficiently anchored to prevent deflation over the next few years. Finally, we show that the Great Recession provides fresh evidence against the New Keynesian Phillips curve with rational expectations.","[Ball, Laurence] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Mazumder, Sandeep] Wake Forest Univ, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA",Johns Hopkins University; Wake Forest University,"Ball, L (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",,,,,,,,67,124,133,3,28,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

The bank was split into the new National Bank of Commerce, a commercial bank that assumed most of the original bank's assets and liabilities, and the National Microfinance Bank, which assumed most of the branch network and the mandate to foster access to financial services. The new National Bank of Commerce's profitability and portfolio quality improved although credit growth was slow, in line with the privatization experiences in other developing countries. Finding a buyer for the National Microfinance Bank proved very difficult, although after years under contract management by private banking consultants.

Although in practice lobbying expenditures far exceed campaign contributions, the literature on the political economy of trade policy has focused on the latter. In this paper we develop a model in which informational lobbying costs play a role in determining the structure of protection. In the model, special interest groups can choose to send a signal to the policymaker regarding some information they possess, and the policymaker observes the signal before setting the trade policies. We find that lobbying expenditures directly affect the equilibrium policies. In order to test the predictions of the model we collected data on lobbying expenditures from the Center for Responsible Politics as well as data on trade and industry characteristic variables for the United States from other sources. We perform a structural estimation of the equilibrium trade policies and find support for our model. The empirical evidence indicates that lobbying expenditures play an important role in explaining the variation of protection across sectors. Moreover, the model leads to considerably lower and more reasonable estimates of the weight that the government places on social welfare relative to political contributions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We apply data envelopment analysis (DEA) to measure to what extent Indonesian paper mills are catching up with Finnish mills in terms of technical efficiency. Three questions are addressed: What is the distribution of Indonesian plant technical efficiency vis-a-vis the technological frontier? What is the role of entry, exit, and survival in Indonesia for catch-up in the paper industry as a whole? In what ways do catching-up plants in Indonesia differ from non-catching-up plants? We find that on average the Indonesian paper industry moved closer to the technological frontier during the 1990s. However, catch-up has been a highly localized process in which only a few large establishments have achieved near best-practice performance, while most other plants have stayed behind.","[van Dijk, Michiel] Oxfam NOVIB, NL-2500 GX The Hague, Netherlands; [Szirmai, Adam] UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"van Dijk, M (通讯作者)，Oxfam NOVIB, Mauritskade 9,POB 30919, NL-2500 GX The Hague, Netherlands.",michiel.van.dijk@oxfamnovib.nl,"van Dijk, Michiel/AAE-8203-2019","van Dijk, Michiel/0000-0002-5207-7304",,,,,69,5,5,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Thus, a structural factor analysis indicates that the Great Moderation was characterized by a fall in the importance of aggregate shocks while the volatility of sectoral shocks was essentially unchanged.

A majority view, which we term traditional, focuses on the role of VC in overcoming market failure in the financing of innovative ventures. The policy recommendations emerging from this view involve a mix of monetary incentives and institutional changes that can be applied irrespective of the local context. The second is an evolutionary perspective on VC and VC policy. This is based on a dynamic analysis of the co-evolution between VC and high-tech entrepreneurship, as well as an adaptive view of policy and policymaking (Metcalfe, Econ J 104(425):931-944, 1994). In this setting, policy-makers have to overcome not only market failure but also dynamic system failure associated with the linked emergence of entrepreneurial high-tech clusters. Overcoming traditional market failure becomes a necessary but not sufficient pre-emergence condition for the eventual attainment of the latter policy objectives. This paper surveys the post-2000 literature on VC and VC policy and criticizes some of its assumptions and results. Moreover, it examines the Israeli and UK/Scotland innovation policy frameworks from an historical perspective, which allows us to highlight differences in approaches and impacts. The upshot is that the success of VC policies depends on a number of factors, including the phase of emergence of a VC market and high-tech cluster and the specific country/region institutional setting.","[Rosiello, Alessandro] Univ Edinburgh, ESRC Innogen Ctr, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Avnimelech, Gil] Ono Acad Coll, Entrepreneurial Res Ctr, Fac Business Adm, Kiryat Ono, Israel; [Teubal, Morris] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Econ, Jerusalem, Israel",University of Edinburgh; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Rosiello, A (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, ESRC Innogen Ctr, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",alessandro.rosiello@ed.ac.uk,"Avnimelech, Gil/J-7063-2016","Avnimelech, Gil/0000-0002-7102-809X",ESRC [ES/F028180/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F028180/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,38,11,12,0,45,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,,,J EVOL ECON,J.

In our empirical framework, we examine how the credibility of disclosure and media coverage are associated with the firm-specific volatility of stock returns. The results indicate that both greater accuracy of management forecasts and greater total media coverage contribute to the incorporation of firm-specific information in the stock price. Furthermore, for earnings-related news, the media reporting leads to less firm-specific volatility. Finally, an improvement in forecast accuracy enhances the marginal effect of media coverage of the earnings news toward reflecting firm-specific information. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Consequently, the evidence for naturally occurring games in which the MSNE predicts the outcome well is of great importance, as it can justify the vast use of MSNE in models. The game between the kicker and the goalkeeper in soccer penalty kicks is a real-world game that can be used to examine the application of the MSNE concept or its accuracy, because payoffs are a common knowledge, the players have huge incentives to play correctly, the game is simple enough to analyse, its Nash equilibrium is in mixed strategies, and players' actions can be observed. We collected and analysed the data on the direction of kicks and jumps in penalty kicks in various top leagues and tournaments. Our analysis suggests that the MSNE predictions are the closest to the actual sample data, even though some other prediction methods use information on the marginal distribution of kicks or jumps, whereas the MSNE does not.","[Azar, Ofer H.; Bar-Eli, Michael] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Business Adm, Guilford Glazer Sch Business & Management, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben Gurion University,"Azar, OH (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Business Adm, Guilford Glazer Sch Business & Management, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",azar@som.bgu.ac.il,"AZAR, OFER H/F-1666-2012","AZAR, OFER H/0000-0003-0154-327X",,,,,27,28,31,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We estimate these different types of migration flows using a negative binomial model, augmented with instruments to control for potential endogeneity issues. Our findings demonstrate that long distance migration reflects a disequilibrium model of migration whereas short distance migration largely reflects an equilibrium model of migration. As such, attempts to model interregional migration in general will be mis-specified as the simultaneously-operating underlying mobility systems are quite different in nature.

Conventional wisdom often holds that conservation is best achieved by increased regulation, and that such gains are best achieved in passenger auto transport (fuel efficiency standards or diversion to transit). We argue that the growth of rail freight has conserved carbon fuel use in the United States, and that fuel-saving changes have been facilitated by reduced regulation since 1980. Methods used include estimation of translog cost functions (and related demand functions for fuel) for intermodal rail and for truck, allowing controlled comparisons of modal fuel use. We find intermodal rail (e. g. trailer on flatcar) to be a powerful conserver: if intermodal rail were eliminated, and traffic transferred to over-the-highway truck, extra annual carbon emissions would be nearly 25 Tg. By comparison, if urban passenger transit were eliminated and replaced by autos (according to one study) the extra annual emissions would be only 3.9 Tg.","[Bitzan, John D.] N Dakota State Univ, Coll Business, Dept Management Mkt & Finance, Fargo, ND 58108 USA; [Keeler, Theodore E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",North Dakota State University Fargo; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Bitzan, JD (通讯作者)，N Dakota State Univ, Coll Business, Dept Management Mkt & Finance, POB 6050, Fargo, ND 58108 USA.",John.Bitzan@ndsu.edu,,,,,,,29,9,10,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This study gives an overall image of the allocation of structural funds for the new EU member states, Romania included, describes the absorption of the structural funds in Romania in 2009 and reviews the blockages and the solutions proposed for the absorption of these funds.

One is to improve the measurement of diversity and the other to treat diversity as an endogenous variable. This paper tries to address these two issues: it investigates the effects of ethnic fractionalization on economic growth across countries using unique time-varying measures. We first replicate the finding of a weak effect of exogenous diversity on growth and then we show that accounting for how diversity changes over time and treating it as an endogenous variable makes a difference. Once diversity is instrumented (with lagged diversity and latitude), it shows a significant negative impact on economic growth which is robust to different specifications, polarization measures, econometric estimators, as well as to the use of an index of ethnic-religious-linguistic fractionalization.","[Campos, Nauro F.; Saleh, Ahmad] Brunel Univ, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Campos, Nauro F.] CEPR, London, England; [Kuzeyev, Vitaliy] Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary",Brunel University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Central European University,"Campos, NF (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",nauro.campos@brunel.ac.uk,,"Campos, Nauro/0000-0002-4886-070X",,,,,28,20,23,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

In order to investigate whether this hypothesis is valid, we examine the relationship between religion in Taiwan and economic development across 23 counties by adopting the panel data approach for the period 1998 to 2003. We select six religious activity proxy variables and five economic development variables in a cross-county panel data framework. The evidence indicates that the ratio of females to males has a significantly positive effect and that the literacy rate and population density each have a significantly negative effect on the religious variables. Finally, except for the Christian culture, the unemployment rate has a positive effect on the religious variables. Our findings thus support the view that the religious secularization hypothesis is valid in Taiwan.","[Lee, Chien-Chiang] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; [Chang, Chun-Ping] Shih Chien Univ, Dept Mkt Management, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Weng, Jia-Hsi] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst China & Asia Pacific Studies, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan",National Sun Yat Sen University; Shih Chien University; National Sun Yat Sen University,"Lee, CC (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.",leecc@seed.net.tw,"Lee, Chien-Chiang/AAZ-9983-2020","Lee, Chien-Chiang/0000-0003-0037-4347",,,,,49,4,5,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We estimate a spatial Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model of income dynamics where the distance between countries is defined on relational space based on their similarity in appropriation tendency of human capital in the production processes. These distances are computed using a newly developed human capital data set which fully characterizes the demographic structure of human capital, and thus underlines the joint relevance of demography and human capital in economic growth. Spatial effects on growth interdependence and complementarity are then explored with respect to the proposed distance metrics. Our results imply that significant cross-country growth interdependence based on human capital distances exists among defined country groups suggesting the need for a cooperative policy programme among them. We also find that the relationship between economic growth and human capital is highly nonlinear as a function of the proposed human capital distance.","[Cuaresma, Jesus Crespo] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Cuaresma, Jesus Crespo] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal IIASA, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Cuaresma, Jesus Crespo] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Mishra, Tapas] Swansea Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales",Vienna University of Economics & Business; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Swansea University,"Cuaresma, JC (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Augasse 2-6, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",jcrespo@wu.ac.at,,"Crespo Cuaresma, Jesus/0000-0003-3244-6560",,,,,29,2,4,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this framework, we study the impact of the correlation between the two risks on optimal choices. In the saving problem, we find conditions ensuring that positive correlation between the two risks implies that the optimal amount of savings increases. These conditions involve specific requirements on the direct and cross derivatives of the two-argument utility function. Similarly, we find a different and specific set of conditions ensuring that the same conclusion on optimal investment for health (environmental) improvement is reached.

Although attrition affects unconditional means, the weighted PSID generally maintains its representativeness along key dimensions in comparison to the National Health Interview Survey. Using PSID, sibling correlations in outcomes and father-son correlations in earnings are not significantly affected by attrition. Models of intergenerational links with covariates yield more mixed results with females showing few robust impacts of attrition and males showing potential attrition bias for education and earnings outcomes. For adult health outcomes conditional on child background, neither gender shows significant impacts of attrition for the age ranges and models considered here.

After making these removals, 494 titles remained, and the ideological outlook of each was assessed. The results show that Harvard University Press leans heavily to the left. In fact, over the 10+ years surveyed only eight of the 494 titles, or 2 percent, had an outlook that was conspicuously either classical liberal or conservative.

This means, among other things, that they have to create new ideas and turn them into innovative products and processes. Appropriate innovation management strategies, including creation of various kinds of alliances with other business entities, need to be adopted within the company. Clustering is one of such possibilities. The paper discusses the main features of clusters and the benefits for their members; in addition, it identifies specific features of the construction sector that require specific approaches to establish a cluster. The methodology Innovative Cluster Model with 3x3x3 mail elements (ICM333) is proposed and used to initiate and develop a cluster in the construction sector. In the cluster development three stages are identified: emergence, development and maturity of the cluster. Actions associated with these three stages tackle four areas (in each stage): rationale, organization, resources, and implementation. All areas are thoroughly elaborated and discussed in the paper. In the first step, the emerging cluster, the key element is identification, assessment and dissemination of development opportunities. It can run parallel with the cluster initiation, which is followed by the operation. Within the steps to be taken in the stage of the developing cluster, visions nad the goals have to be defined first, followed by the definition of the cluster organisation. The mature cluster stage has to focus on performance measurement and management, and take appropriate measures to garantee its sustainability and adequate innovative character. Implementation of the proposed cluster development methodology has the potential of greatly facilitating the betterment of a construction sector in a particular country. It can be a valuable tool, when available to policymakers, chambers of commerce and trade, and other stakeholders that wish to foster the development of such clusters.

A lot of enterprises have established branches in China, Vietnam, Malaysia, East Europe, and other countries. New HRM issues therefore have been generated. As globalization has been going too fast in Taiwan, the shortage of international talents has also emerged. With insufficient preparation for expatriation, failure is likely to occur. Insufficient knowledge of local customs and experience in overseas management, labor disputes and maladaptation of expatriates can result in negative effects on catering industry. Expatriates in catering industry may confront the same problem in all countries not only Taiwan and China. Previous research on expatriates in catering industry paid more attention to recruitment standards, educational training, and adaption of expatriates in a host country, but less to the effects of the factors on work performance of expatriates.

The study analyzes the health trajectories of children born between 1950 and 1970 followed through 2005. Data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) spanning four decades are linked with information on neighborhood attributes and school quality resources that prevailed at the time these children were growing up. There are several key findings. First, estimates of sibling and child neighbor correlations in health are used to bound the proportion of inequality in health status in childhood through mid-life that are attributable to childhood family and neighborhood quality. Estimates based on four-level hierarchical random effects models (neighborhoods, families, individuals, over time) consistently show a significant scope for both childhood family and neighborhood background (including school quality). The results imply substantial persistence in health status across generations that are linked in part to low intergenerational economic mobility. Sibling correlations are large throughout at least the first 50 years of life: roughly three-fifths of adult health disparities may be attributable to family and neighborhood background. Childhood neighbor correlations in adult health are also substantial (net of the similarity arising from similar family characteristics), suggesting that disparities in neighborhood background account for more than one-third of the variation in health status in mid life. Second, exposure to concentrated neighborhood poverty during childhood has significant deleterious impacts on adult health. The results reveal that even a large amount of selection on unobservable factors does not eliminate the significant effect of child neighborhood poverty on health status later in life. Thus, racial differences in adult health can be accounted for by childhood family, neighborhood, and school quality factors, while contemporaneous economic factors account for relatively little of this gap.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Johnson, RC (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",ruckerj@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,78,3,4,1,29,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

In this paper I suggest a different criterion for judging models in international trade theory in competitive settings: (i) Does the model conform to common sense in leading to results that even suggest the model is not necessary, and yet (ii) Can the same model be used as a tool to reveal in simple terms why certain outcomes that may appear surprising (often labeled a paradox in trade theory) nonetheless are correct. Many trade theory paradoxes appear as the result of income effects in simple general equilibrium models. Here attention centers instead on two of the familiar production models: the specific factors model and the Heckscher-Ohlin model, either separately or when combined. It is shown that very basic properties of production underlie many of the surprising results in competitive trade theory.

We extend the Mauer and Ott (2000) real-option model of corporate expansion, and show that, when the manager maximizes the value of his compensation package (rather than equity value), the underinvestment problem can be substantially mitigated. Further, by designing an appropriate compensation contract, it is possible to eliminate the underinvestment incentive altogether. This managerial contract, consisting of fixed salary and equity ownership, is explicitly derived in the model. The equity ownership level is found to be an increasing function of the manager's fixed salary and the company's earnings growth rate, and a decreasing function of leverage ratio, earnings volatility, tax rate, bankruptcy costs, and the manager's severance pay at bankruptcy.

This study shows how liquidity influences not only forecasting performances of term structure estimation, but also information transmission and price adjustment across markets. Our analysis helps understanding how extreme market movements affect one another. This study examines, and provides a rationale for incorporating, liquidity in estimating term structure. Forecasting performance can be greatly enhanced when conditioning on trading liquidity. It reduces information asymmetry in the sense of Easley and O'Hara (2004) and Burlacu et al. (2007). We adopt a time series forecasting model following Diebold and Li (2006) to compare behaviour of forecasted price errors. Our findings indicate that forecasted price errors in markets with less depth would influence those with more. Information asymmetry induces volatile trading first and then price adjustment is transmitted to another market due to insufficient market depth. Cross-market price adjustment could be as much as 21 bps on average. Compared with previous studies, our results establish a valid reason to condition on liquidity when forecasting prices.","[Tsai, Shih-Chuan] Ling Tung Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei, Taiwan; [Sun, David S.] Taiwan Acad Banking & Finance, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lin, William T.] Tamkang Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Taipei, Taiwan",Tamkang University,"Tsai, SC (通讯作者)，Ling Tung Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei, Taiwan.",chuant@mail.ltu.edu.tw; davidsun@mail.tabf.org.tw,,,,,,,44,0,0,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

First, the panel-based unit root test that allows for the occurrence of multiple breaks at various break dates across provinces is developed; this test is based on the p-value combination approach suggested by Fisher (1932). Next, the test is applied to China's provincial real per capita outputs to examine the regional convergence in China. To obtain the p-values of unit root tests for each province, which are combined to construct the panel unit root test, this study assumes three Data Generating Processes (DGPs): a driftless random walk process, an Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) process and an Autoregression (AR) process with cross-sectionally dependent errors in Monte Carlo simulation.

Monetary policy (MP) rules play a central role in these models, and alternative rules can be compared in terms of their implications for the economy's dynamic adjustment to shocks. I discuss the advantages of DSGE modelling in low-income countries and show how interest-rate rules can be adapted to reflect the balance-sheet instruments widely used among African countries. I also identify features of the African economic environment that are poorly captured by existing models, including a large and volatile food sector, imperfect capital mobility and a credit channel for monetary policy. To illustrate the DSGE approach, I develop a model in which food supply shocks play a key role in inflation dynamics. I show that private storage can generate serial correlation of food price inflation when food price shocks are serially uncorrelated.","Swarthmore Coll, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA",Swarthmore College,"O'Connell, SA (通讯作者)，Swarthmore Coll, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA.",steve_oconnell@swarthmore.edu,,,,,,,40,2,2,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Pegging the exchange rate to a strong anchor currency was popular in the early 1990s - especially for nations in transition from command to market economies. But the 1990s also saw a spate of capital account crisis in emerging market countries, with sharp reversals of capital inflows leading to collapsing currencies and underscoring the fragility of such fixed exchange rate regimes. Surprisingly few exchange rate regimes failed during new millennium to compare with the last decade, though economic and financial crises were not a rare exception. Currency Board regime deserves more attention and praises for its merits with respect to benefit it provides during the turmoil period in particular, even though the regime embraces common features of highly criticized Gold standard. The article examines the roles of Currency Board during financial crises in past and looks at current developments going in the market from the perspective of Currency Board. The first part of the article outlines the theoretical background of Currency Board, and surveys the key advantages and disadvantages of the regime. The second part of the article looks into three historically prominent events of Currency Board regime: speculative attack against Estonian kroner as well as Hong Kong dollar and the failure of Currency Board in Argentina. Besides that, the main reasons and explanations of the events are disclosed and conclusions are drawn about the role and importance of Currency Board regime. Finally, after revealing the story of Iceland failure and comparing its financial state to the Baltic States from the exchange rate regime perspective, it is looked closer at the financial figures of the Baltic States with the purpose to justify the fact that the Baltic States have already passed the worst.","[Pilinkus, Donatas] Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Svolka, Andrius] Copenhagen Sch Econ & Business Adm, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Bartkus, Edverdas Vaclovas] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vilnius University; Copenhagen Business School; Kaunas University of Technology,"Pilinkus, D (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Muitines Str 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",pilinkus@pilinkus.com; andrius.svolka@gmail.com; edvardas.bartkus@ktu.lt,,,,,,,50,2,2,0,12,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We do not find strong evidence of nonlinearity in import prices' reaction to the exchange rate and reject the hypothesis of an asymmetric response to appreciations and depreciations. On the other hand, we find an asymmetry of consumer price index responses to the output gap, direction and size of exchange rate changes, and magnitude of exchange rate volatility. The asymmetry is mostly visible after exogenous shocks.

J,"Sánchez, M",,,,"Sanchez, Marcelo",,,Robust central banking under wage bargaining: Is monetary policy transparency beneficial?,ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Monetary policy transparency; Robust control; Wage bargaining; Model uncertainty,INFLATION,"We study the role of transparency in an environment of robust monetary policy under wage bargaining. The standard view from the game-theoretical literature is that, with unionised labour markets, monetary policy transparency is unambiguously bad (it induces increases in wage and price inflation, unemployment and may lead to higher inflation uncertainty). The empirical literature is instead ambiguous about the macroeconomic effects of transparency. By recasting the earlier theory into a robust monetary policy environment, and focusing transparency on the uncertainty about the preference for price stability, we show that the macroeconomic effects of transparency are more favourable than normally found. The impact on nominal wages, inflation and real variables (real wages and unemployment) is not parameter-free but depends on the public's informedness about this coefficient. The impact on real variables is found to disappear in case unions do not internalise the effect of wage decisions on the economy (i.e. in the case of atomistic unions). Finally, we find that the effect of transparency on inflation uncertainty is more complex than in the standard approach. We show that transparency may have the beneficial effect of reducing inflation variability not only when monetary uncertainty is low (as previously reported), but also when monetary uncertainty exceeds an upper threshold.

Having in mind this aspect, we recommend with priority to use the Gini index only together with other similar or complementary poverty indicators to evaluate the poverty level of a given population.","Romanian Acad, Res Inst Qual Life, Bucharest, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Stefanescu, SV (通讯作者)，Romanian Acad, Res Inst Qual Life, Bucharest, Romania.",stefanst@fmi.unibuc.ro,,,,,,,15,2,2,0,12,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Conservative critics of the media argue biased news stems from liberal-leaning journalists. Another explanation of alleged bias could be that liberals have a greater demand for news than moderates or conservatives, so the media simply tailors its product to their customers. I test whether liberals in the US have a greater demand for news by investigating the determinants of newspaper circulation across states and metropolitan areas. I find mixed evidence for liberal demand: circulation is higher in more liberal metropolitan areas but is independent of local political preferences across states.","Univ Texas Pan Amer, Dept Econ & Finance, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley,"Sutter, D (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Pan Amer, Dept Econ & Finance, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA.",dssutter@utpa.edu,,,,,,,18,2,2,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A lot of investments are being carried out by territorial self-government units. It should also be emphasized that public investments belong to economic development stimulants.

First, the author points out the specific features of the development of these categories in communist and market regimes. Next, he shows in more detail the changes in the number and position of self-employed in the Czech Republic after 1990.

Fourth, the same data source is used to describe couples and households of self-employed people and their incomes in comparison with employee households. While the shares of self-employed in the countries compared are becoming increasingly similar, there are still significant differences in the living conditions of the self-employed between and within them.

The article presents a set of arguments to question some of the conventional wisdom in the existing literature on what success and failure are in the transition of the ECA region's agriculture. In particular, it challenges the usefulness of counterfactuals that are commonly used in the existing literature to appraise transition progress such as pre-reform output levels, individualised farming structures and WTO-conforming agricultural market regulation. Against this background the widespread view that agricultural reform in the advanced CIS countries has, in general, been less successful than in the new EU member states is questioned.","[Wandel, Juergen; Glauben, Thomas] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Pieniadz, Agata] Commiss European Communities, DG Res, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Wandel, J (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Halle, Saale, Germany.",wandel@iamo.de,", IAMO/G-2328-2012","Glauben, Thomas/0000-0003-0640-9387",,,,,85,14,14,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2011,23.0,2,,,,,139,162,PII 937638632,10.1080/14631377.2011.570037,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,764XM,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290667900001,0

Because of the short period of time since the implementation of the Capital Requirements Directive, Polish banks measure operational risk using simplified methods. This does not simplify or favour the disclosure of detailed information on operational risk incurred, including the disclosure of losses caused by internal fraud.

In this paper, we model the strategic implications of this ability. Our thesis is that through a person's lifetime they (perhaps subconsciously) learn what such signaled, binding behavioral preferences result in the highest value of their actual preferences, given the resultant behavior of other players. We argue that this persona model may explain why many interpersonal preferences have the particular form they do. As an illustration, we use the persona model to explain cooperation in non-repeated versions of the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD). We also provide quantitative predictions to distinguish this explanation of cooperation from simply assuming people have actual preferences biased towards cooperation. In particular, we show that the persona model predicts a crowding out phenomenon in the PD, in which introducing incentives to cooperate causes players to stop cooperating instead. We also use the persona model to predict a tradeoff between the robustness of cooperation in the PD and the benefit of that cooperation.","[Wolpert, David] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Wolpert, David] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Washington, DC USA; [Jamison, Julian] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Harre, Michael] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Los Alamos National Laboratory; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Ames Research Center; Yale University; University of Sydney,"Wolpert, D (通讯作者)，Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.",dhw@santafe.edu; julison@gmail.com; david.newth@csiro.au; mike.harre@gmail.com,"Newth, David J/A-1848-2011","Harre, Michael/0000-0003-2199-2515",,,,,57,11,11,0,1,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

Our main findings are: (1) The reported fall in aggregate labor share is overstated. According to the official statistics released by the NBS (2007a), the labor share fell 5.25 percentage points from 2003 to 2004. However this dramatic decline, 42.16% of the total reported decline of the labor share from 1995 to 2007.15 completely due to the changes in the way NBS break down the operating surplus state-owned and collective-owned farms and the mixed income of the owners of individual economy; (2) For the last three decades, two main forces have been driving shifts in the aggregate labor share: (i) structural transformation between the agriculture and non-agriculture sectors and (ii) shifts in the labor share within the industry sector; (3) From 1995 to 2003, these two effects are both negative and together drive down aggregate labor share by 5.48 percentage points. The structural change explains 61.31% of the decline and the remaining 38.69% of the decline is due to the changes in the labor share within sectors, primarily in the industry sector; (4) Labor share in agriculture is lower than labor share in services. Therefore, when the service sector grows relative to the agriculture sector in the economy, the aggregate labor share of income declines; and (5) Restructuring of the SOEs and expanded monopoly power are the main reasons for the decline of labor share within industry after 1998. Relative price shifts, the factor input ratio, and biased technological progress are all insignificant forces for this decline because the substitution between factors in the industry sector is nearly unit elastic.

But this allows risk-averse subjects to hedge with their stated beliefs against adverse outcomes of the other decisions. So can we trust the existing belief-elicitation results? And can we avoid potential hedging confounds? We propose an experimental design that theoretically eliminates hedging opportunities. Using this design, we test for the empirical relevance of hedging effects in the lab. Our results suggest that hedging confounds are not a major problem unless hedging opportunities are very prominent. If hedging opportunities are transparent, and incentives to hedge are strong, many subjects do spot hedging opportunities and respond to them. The bias can go beyond players actually hedging themselves, because some expect others to hedge and best respond to this.","[Engelmann, Dirk] Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; [Blanco, Mariana] Univ Rosario, Dept Econ, Bogota, Colombia; [Engelmann, Dirk] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Expt Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Engelmann, Dirk] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Econ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Koch, Alexander K.] Aarhus Univ, Sch Econ & Management, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Normann, Hans-Theo] Univ Dusseldorf, DICE, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Normann, Hans-Theo] Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Bonn, Germany",University of Mannheim; Universidad del Rosario; University of Copenhagen; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Aarhus University; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; Max Planck Society,"Engelmann, D (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, L7 3-5, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",mariana.blanco@urosario.edu.co; dirk.engelmann@uni-mannheim.de; akoch@econ.au.dk; normann@dice.uni-duesseldorf.de,"Engelmann, Dirk/H-2943-2014; Blanco, Mariana/E-3178-2016","Koch, Alexander K./0000-0001-9471-1636; Blanco, Mariana/0000-0002-2458-1327",,,,,56,146,152,2,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

The main advantage of a lump sum payment is that the proceedings can be concluded with a 'clean break' between the parties. The lump sum is a result of discounting the future pecuniary values into a single present-day amount, considering the time value of money and the claimant's mortality. Conventionally, lump sum awards are determined by making reference to a spread of amounts in comparable cases. However, a fairer method would be one that involves input from not only lawyers but also other experts including economists and actuaries. This study, which is carried out by an inter-professional working group, provides a set of actuarially computed tables for use in personal injury settlements in Singapore. The calculations involve a consideration of recent advancements in stochastic mortality modeling and an empirical study on the econometrics of real returns on risk-free assets in Singapore.

S. economy in the late 1970s and in the 1980s, as well as the simultaneous increase in inequality and in education attainments. Since the late 1970s U. S. policymakers began targeting commercial innovations more directly and explicitly. We focus on the shift in the composition of public demand toward high-tech goods, which, by increasing the market-size of innovative firms, functions as a de facto innovation policy tool. We build a quality-ladders non-scale growth model with heterogeneous industries and endogenous supply of skills, and show that an increase in the technological content of public spending stimulates R&D, raises the wage of skilled workers, and, at the same time, stimulates human capital accumulation. A calibrated version of the model suggests that government policy explains between 12% and 15% of the observed increase in wage inequality in the period 1976-1991.

We also find that the specialization of construction industry and wholesale and retail trade industry can significantly decrease unemployment rate, but specializing in finance industry increases unemployment rate. Urban growth, market maturity measured by the proportion of private sector employment, and human capital can decrease unemployment rate.

New evidence of crowd out in the secondary mortgage market,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,GSEs; Crowd Out; Liquidity,AFFORDABLE HOUSING GOALS; LOAN SALES,"The dramatic government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in September, 2008 was motivated in part by a desire to ensure a continued flow of credit to the mortgage market. This study examines a closely related issue: the extent to which GSE activity crowds out mortgage purchases by private secondary market intermediaries. Evidence of substantial crowd out suggests that government support for the GSEs may be less warranted, whereas the absence of crowd out implies that GSE loan purchases enhance liquidity. Using 1994-2008 HMDA data for conventional, conforming sized loans, three distinct periods with regard to GSE crowd out are apparent. From 1994 to 2003, the share of loans sold to the secondary market increased from 60 to over 90%, private sector and GSE market shares of loan purchases were roughly similar for most market segments, and IV estimates indicate relatively little GSE crowd out of private secondary market purchases. From 2004 to 2006, private loan purchases boomed and dominated those of the GSEs, while IV estimates indicate crowd out jumped to 50% at the peak of the boom. This is especially true in the market for home purchase as opposed to refinance loans. With the crash in housing and mortgage markets in 2007, private sector intermediaries pulled back, the GSEs regained market share, and evidence of GSE crowd out disappeared in both the home purchase loan and refinance markets. These patterns suggest that the degree of GSE crowd out varies with market conditions and that the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac likely served to enhance liquidity to the mortgage market during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

Yet the literature synthesized in Matthew O.

The iTunes Music Store has grown quickly since its appearance in 2003, and digital music now accounts for a third of US recorded music sales. Using two new surveys of University of Pennsylvania undergraduates in 2009 and 2010, we ask how music file sharing and sales displacement operate in the iTunes era, when the alternative to file sharing is purchasing individual songs, rather than entire albums. We find large amounts of file sharing in this population. Respondents have more stolen than paid music, but the music obtained via file sharing is, for the most part, low-valuation music which the respondents would likely not have purchased. The rate of sales displacement implied by the relationship between stolen and purchased music across respondents in both samples is between -0.15 and -0.3. That is, an additional song stolen reduces paid consumption by between a third and a sixth of song. Perhaps surprisingly, this is about the same as the CD sales displacement rate found for the pre-iTunes era using a similar empirical approach on a similar study population. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Motivated by the observation that the literature on business groups is ever-expanding yet providing ambiguous or conflicting results based on empirical investigations, this paper intends to first develop a theoretical model to explain behavior and performance of business groups and then conduct complementary empirical analysis. Drawing on Penrose's (1959) resource-based theory of firm growth, this paper models the firms of which some key resources are lumpy or indivisible and thus they must be purchased or installed only in certain sizes. This premise in the basic model leads to an advantage for business-group firms relative to stand-alone firms without respect to the existence of market failure. The model also predicts that business-group firms will be more profitable in terms of profit-to-sales and will have higher sales and asset, leading to faster growth, other things being equal. Implications of such advantage on firms' performance and behavior are investigated first using numerical experiments based on a dynamic optimization model and then regression analyses based on the Korean firm data. It turns out that a set of testable predictions derived from the basic theoretical model is generally consistent with the conclusions from numerical experiments and empirical tests.

If the products are sufficiently close substitutes then the higher profits in the home market are large enough to compensate for the loss of profits on exports.","[Collie, David R.; Vo Phuong Mai Le] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,"Collie, DR (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Aberconway Bldg,Colum Dr, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales.",Collie@Cardiff.ac.uk; LeVP@Cardiff.ac.uk,"Collie, David R/E-4876-2010","Collie, David R/0000-0002-3132-648X",,,,,16,4,4,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We examine cooperative and noncooperative environmental policies under governments that are either welfare maximizers (good dictators) or tax revenue maximizers (Leviathans). We show that Leviathans can perform better in terms of welfare and that good dictators can set higher taxes. We then analyze international environmental agreements and show that the breakdown of environmental cooperation can indeed lead to a welfare gain for all signatory countries. Considering a delegation game between governments, we find that a Pareto-superior Leviathan outcome can be the unique Nash equilibrium.","Univ Basel, Dept Econ, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland",University of Basel,"Csordás, S (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, Dept Econ, Peter Merian Weg 6, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",Stefan.Csordas@unibas.ch,,"Csordas, Stefan/0000-0002-1276-699X",,,,,14,2,2,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

However, the emerging evidence indicates that voters often have other-regarding preferences (ORP), that is, in deciding among alternative policies voters care about their payoffs relative to others. We extend a widely used general equilibrium framework in political economy to allow for voters with ORP, as in Fehr and Schmidt (1999). In line with the evidence, these preferences allow voters to exhibit envy and altruism, in addition to the standard concern for own utility. We give sufficient conditions for the existence of a Condorcet winner when voters have ORP. This could open the way for an incorporation of ORP in a variety of political economy models.

We show that when the political and market sectors are not mutually exclusive, a trade-off arises between the quality of elected officials and the time they devote to political life. If high-ability citizens can keep earning money outside of parliament, they will be more likely to run for election; for the same reason, they will also be more likely to shirk once elected. These predictions are confronted with a dataset about members of the Italian Parliament from 1996 to 2006. The empirical evidence shows that bad but dedicated politicians come along with good but not fully committed politicians. There is in fact a non-negligible fraction of citizens with remarkably high pre-election income who are appointed in parliament.

This model is often solved using the discrete state space technique with evenly spaced grid points. We show that this method necessitates a large number of grid points to avoid generating spurious interest rate movements. This makes the discrete state technique significantly more inefficient than using Chebyshev polynomials or cubic spline interpolation to approximate the value functions. We show that the inefficiency of the discrete state space technique is more severe for parameterizations that feature a high sensitivity of the bond price to the borrowing level for the borrowing levels that are observed more frequently in the simulations. In addition, we find that the efficiency of the discrete state space technique can be greatly improved by (i) finding the equilibrium as the limit of the equilibrium of the finite-horizon version of the model, instead of iterating separately on the value and bond price functions and (ii) concentrating grid points in asset levels at which the bond price is more sensitive to the borrowing level and in levels that are observed more often in the model simulations. Our analysis is also relevant for the study of other credit markets. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Our theoretical model predicts that inward FDI, outward FDI, imports, and exports have positive influences on firm innovative activities, which would evaluate the effects of the relative magnitude of different sources on innovation. The empirical results based on the 2003 First Taiwan Technological Innovation Survey confirm three of the proposed hypotheses for the entire sample. However, when focusing on the manufacturing sector, outward FDI, inward FDI, imports, and exports all exhibit strongly positive effects on the determination of conducting product innovation (i.e., the four hypotheses are verified). A consistent trend is that outward FDI has the largest effect on innovation, regardless of the measurement of product innovation and the division of the entire sample, which may imply that in Taiwan a positive effect of deindustrialization is to innovate more.","[Lin, Eric S.] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan; [Lin, Hui-lin] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 100, Taiwan",National Tsing Hua University; National Taiwan University,"Lin, ES (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan.",huilin@ntu.edu.tw; slin@mx.nthu.edu.tw,,,,,,,32,33,39,3,44,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

The study also draws on data for household borrowing and lending, direct and indirect benefits and taxes to calibrate a family'' life cycle model at the core of which is the hypothesis that households face a borrowing interest rate that rises with the amount of non-collateral based borrowing. The household members jointly choose time paths of time use, consumption and saving over their life cycle in the face of this capital market imperfection. Importantly, households are shown to differ significantly in their saving behavior in a way that depends on secondary earner labor supply, with a strong positive association between saving and the income of the second earner.

In particular, I examine the WTO Agreement on Safeguards that has amended the GATT escape clause (Article XIX), and the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) that resembles a court of law under the WTO. Using this framework, I interpret the weakening of the reciprocity principle under the Agreement on Safeguards as an attempt to reduce efficiency-reducing trade skirmishes. The DSB is interpreted as an impartial arbitrator that announces its opinion about the state of the world when a dispute arises among member countries. I demonstrate that the reforms in the GATT escape clause should be bundled with the introduction of the DSB, in order to maintain the incentive compatibility of trade agreements. The model implies that trade agreements under the WTO lead to fewer trade skirmishes but this effect does not necessarily result in higher payoffs to the governments. The model also implies that the introduction of the WTO court, which has no enforcement power, can improve the self-enforceability of trade agreements. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

First, we design a framework in which fluctuations in households financial wealth are allowed but not necessarily required to exert an impact on current consumption. This is due to the interaction, in the financial markets, of long-time traders holding wealth accumulated over time with newcomers holding no wealth at all. Importantly, we introduce nominal wage stickiness to induce pro-cyclicality in real dividends. Additional nominal and real frictions are modeled to capture the pervasive macroeconomic persistence of the observables employed to estimate our model. We fit our model to post-WWII U.S. data, and report three main results. First, the data strongly support a significant role of stock prices in affecting real activity and the business cycle. Second, our estimates also identify a significant and counteractive response of the Fed to stock-price fluctuations. Third, we derive from our model a microfounded measure of financial slack, the stock-price gap, which we then contrast to alternative ones, currently used in empirical studies, to assess the properties of the latter to capture the dynamic and cyclical implications of our DSGE model. The behavior of our stock-price gap is consistent with the episodes of stock-market booms and busts occurred in the post-WWII, as reported by independent analyses, and closely correlates with the current financial meltdown. Typically employed proxies of financial slack such as detrended log-indexes or growth rates show limited capabilities of capturing the implications of our model-consistent index of financial stress. Cyclical properties of the model as well as counterfactuals regarding shocks to our measure of financial slackness and monetary policy shocks are also proposed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

As the largest shareholder the state has not asked SOEs to pay dividends in the past. Therefore, some have suggested that the state should ask SOEs to pay dividends. Indeed, the Chinese government has adopted this policy advice and started to demand back dividend payments starting from 2008. Although we do not question the soundness of the dividend policy, the point we raise is whether those profits are real if all costs owed by SOEs are properly accounted for Among others, we are interested in investigating whether the profits of SOEs are still as large as they claim if they were to pay a market interest rate. Using a representative sample of corporate China, we find that the costs of financing for SOEs are significantly lower than for other companies after controlling for some fundamental factors for profitability and individual firm characteristics. In addition, our estimates show that if SOEs were to pay a market interest rate, their existing profits would be entirely wiped out Our findings suggest that SOEs are still benefiting from credit subsidies, and they are not yet subject to the market interest rates. In an environment where credit rights are not fully respected, dividend policy, though important, should come second and not first.","[Ferri, Giovanni] Univ Bari, I-70124 Bari, Italy; [Liu, Li-Gang] ANZ Banking Grp Ltd, Central, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Ferri, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bari, Via C Rosalba 53, I-70124 Bari, Italy.",g.ferri@dse.uniba.it; ligang.liu@anz.com,"Ferri, Giovanni/H-5598-2016","Ferri, Giovanni/0000-0002-7825-7098",,,,,11,32,34,1,15,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"238 MAIN ST, STE 500, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1046 USA",1535-3516,,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

The main finding is that within-industry variation accounts for at least two-thirds of the cross-country and the time-series variation in educational attainment. The within-industry education gaps are broadly consistent with a model of industry neutral cross-country differences in skilled labor productivity.

A preference relation over acts is represented by the integral over the subset of the product of the state space and the consequence space which corresponds to the act, where this integral is calculated with respect to a state-dependent utility measure on this space. The result applies at the stage prior to the separation of probabilities and utilities, and requires neither Savages P3 (monotonicity) nor his P4 (likelihood ordering). It may thus prove useful for the development of state-dependent utility representation theorems in the Savage framework. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

As long as the share of the outsourced workforce is not too large, this wage-moderation effect on domestic employment outweighs the direct substitution effect so that domestic employment increases in unionized firms as outsourcing costs fall. With respect to the impact of labor tax reform changes in the wage tax rate, the tax exemption and the unemployment benefit payments affect domestic wage setting in the same way as in the absence of outsourcing. Furthermore, increasing the degree of tax progression by keeping the relative tax burden per worker constant continues to be good for employment. However, except for low outsourcing activities, the impact of these policy measures will become smaller as outsourcing costs fall.","[Koskela, Erkki] Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Schoeb, Ronnie] Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",University of Helsinki; Free University of Berlin,"Koskela, E (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ, POB 17,Arkadiankatu 7, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",erkki.koskela@helsinki.fi; ronnie.schoeb@fu-berlin.de,,,,,,,22,3,3,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

It does so by focusing on the structure of output growth itself. The paper presents a two-sector theoretical model that clarifies the mechanism through which the sectoral composition of growth and associated labor intensity can affect workers' wages and, thus, poverty alleviation. Then, it presents cross-country empirical evidence that analyzes, first, the differential poverty-reducing impact of sectoral growth at various levels of disaggregation, and, second, the role of unskilled labor intensity in such differential impact. The paper finds evidence that not only the size of economic growth but also its composition matters for poverty alleviation, with the largest contributions from unskilled labor-intensive sectors (agriculture, construction, and manufacturing). The results are robust to the influence of outliers, endogeneity concerns, alternative explanations, and various poverty measures. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Sizing decisions concern optimal service capacity and maximum physical waiting room (with a given probability). Customers are sensitive to money price and expected waiting time. The firm, modeled as an M/M/1 queue, is assumed to be a full price taker as a result of the stochastic version of the perfect competition assumption. Firm costs function includes fixed and variable costs. We initially fix the service rate and obtain a closed-form expression for the waiting time, price, output and waiting room which lead to maximize the net revenue. Subsequently, we obtain first-order conditions for the profit maximizing service capacity. We find that an optimal capacity may exist when service capacity costs are strictly convex. When capacity costs are linear or concave, an optimal capacity does not exist, and it is possible to obtain higher expected profits by increasing service capacity, as the time competition principle states. However, in the linear case we find a failure of that principle, which is, there is a limit in speeding up processes.","Univ Murcia, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Quantitat Methods Econ & Business, Murcia, Spain",University of Murcia,"Parra-Frutos, I (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Quantitat Methods Econ & Business, Murcia, Spain.",ipf@um.es,"Parra-Frutos, Isabel/AAF-6485-2020","Parra-Frutos, Isabel/0000-0001-9044-0605",,,,,19,0,0,0,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4195,,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

Specifically, technological regimes and the role of knowledge spillovers for innovation are examined. An agent-based simulation model is formulated which captures the relevant aspect of competition between firms in an innovative industry. Results of the simulation runs indicate that at first, the technological development in terms of process and product innovations is better in an industry that is characterized by Schumpeter Mark II conditions. But the improved technological development is connected with higher prices and profits, which could be interpreted as a trade-off between static and dynamic efficiency. Second, in both scenarios market and industry concentration rises over time, showing a strong separation between successful firms and those lagging behind in technological terms. And third, surprisingly firms in a Schumpeter Mark I regime seem to be more technologically specialized. Furthermore, this article proves that a replication of simulation models is possible and useful. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

(J Comput Graph Stat 5(4):315-336, 1996). The framework is implemented using data on the cross-sector export and import specialization of the four initial EU Cohesion countries over the last 40 years. We discuss the importance of studying both the distribution's external shape and the intra-distribution dynamics and why it is interesting to include imports in the analysis. We find a reduction of the overall degree of export specialization in Portugal, Greece and Spain. Conversely, Ireland has the strongest export specialization and there is evidence of an increase over time. The export intra-distribution dynamics reveal persistence of the specialization status in the four countries, especially for high values of the index. In all countries, the degree of specialization is higher for exports than for imports and intra-distribution dynamics reveal more mobility of import specialization than that of exports.","[Amador, Joao; Cabral, Sonia; Maria, Jose R.] Banco Portugal, Econ & Res Dept, Lisbon, Portugal; [Amador, Joao] Univ Nova Lisboa, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal",Banco de Portugal; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Cabral, S (通讯作者)，Banco Portugal, Econ & Res Dept, Lisbon, Portugal.",scabral@bportugal.pt,,"Cabral, Sonia/0000-0002-6315-6745; Amador, Joao/0000-0002-8966-8036",,,,,29,1,1,0,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1617-982X,1617-9838,,PORT ECON J,Port.

Conservation advocates have promoted policies that decouple distribution revenues or profits from the amount of electricity delivered, claiming that usage-based pricing leads utilities to encourage use and discourage conservation. Because decoupling separates profits from conduct, it runs against the dominant finding in regulatory economics in the last 20 years-that incentive-based regulation outperforms rate-of-return profit guarantees. Even if distribution costs are independent of use, some usage charges can be efficient. Price-cap regulation may distort incentives to inform consumers about energy efficiency-getting more performance from less electricity. Utilities will subsidize efficiency investments, but only when prices are too low. If consumers fail to adopt energy efficiency measures that would be individually beneficial, decoupling can increase welfare, but only if all energy revenues are separated from use, not just those associated with distribution.","[Brennan, Timothy J.] Univ Maryland, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA; [Brennan, Timothy J.] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore; Resources for the Future,"Brennan, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA.",brennan@umbc.edu,,,,,,,40,25,29,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Call voters with fair preferences, as in Fehr and Schmidt (1999), fair-voters. By contrast, traditional political economy models are based on selfish-voters who derive utility solely from own payoff. In a general equilibrium model with endogenous labor supply, a mixture of fair and selfish voters choose optimal policy through majority voting. First, we show that majority voting produces a unique winner in pairwise contests over feasible policies (the Condorcet winner). Second, we show that a preference for greater fairness leads to greater redistribution. An increase in the number of fair voters can also lead to greater redistribution. Third, we show that in economies where the majority are selfish-voters, the decisive policy could be chosen by fair-voters, and vice versa. Fourth, while choosing labor supply, even fair voters behave exactly like selfish voters.

The question addressed by this paper is whether such deviations are due to price discovery errors which will eventually vanish or due to inherent inefficiencies in the auction structure. We show that even with perfect foresight of average congestion rents the clearing prices for the FTRs depend on the bid quantity and therefore may not be priced correctly in the financial transmission right (FTR) auction. In particular, we prove that quantity limits on the FTR bids may cause the auction clearing prices to differ from the bid prices. This phenomenon which is inherent in the theoretical properties of the optimization algorithm used to clear the auction, is further illustrated through numerical simulations with test systems. We conclude that price discovery alone would not remedy the discrepancy between the auction prices and the realized values of the FTRs. Secondary markets or frequent reconfiguration auctions are necessary in order to achieve such convergence. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

While some regions re-introduced the co-payment, others did not. Using a difference-in-difference approach on regional monthly data for years 2001 and 2003, we find that an increase in the co-payment by one Euro reduces the per capita number of prescriptions by 4% and per capita public pharmaceutical expenditure by 3.4%. We also find evidence that when in 2006 some regions reduced (but not removed) the co-payment, a reduction in the co-payment by one Euro increased the per capita number of prescriptions by 3.4%, and per capita public pharmaceutical expenditure by 4.9%.

How have Chinese commodity imports and exports interacted in recent years? Did the downturns in China's export growth come earlier and were they deeper than those in Chinese import growth? All answers appear to suggest a conclusion contrary to the abovementioned view: sharp downturns in China's trade and economy during the recent global financial crisis were, to a large extent, caused by certain domestic factors, or by factors that should not be regarded as entirely external. Insomuch as globalization has advanced, a large economy like China's today faces new potential sources of macroeconomic disturbances, from inside and outside.","[He, Liping] Beijing Normal Univ, Dept Finance, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Fan, Gang] China Reform Fdn, Natl Econ Res Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"He, LP (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Dept Finance, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",lphe@bnu.edu.cn; fangang@neri.org.cn; panpan.yang@mail.bnu.edu.cn,,,,,,,14,2,2,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2010,18.0,4,,,SI,,52,69,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2010.01204.x,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,625MQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279899800004,0

The paper introduces a model of tax evasion. The equilibrium shadow production is determined by consumers' and entrepreneurs' tax morale, affected by the inherited culture or religion. The model suggests that in the conditions of the prisoners' dilemma, shadow economies tend to be large once a moral code is violated. The implications of the model are tested in the OECD data on groups of countries with different religious denominations in two regimes, 1979-1992 and 1992-2003.

In this paper, we take advantage of a unique geo-referenced household survey to carry out a hedonic analysis of housing values that explicitly accounts for spatial spillovers. We use this to derive an estimate of the value of improved access to water in the Indian city of Bangalore. The findings suggest that by limiting the focus to individual or private benefits only, we may underestimate the overall social welfare from investing in service supply.

Second, capital control is not an effective tool to mitigate flight of capital. Capital flees less to the extent that a country is financially more open and more developed. Third, capital flight increases with the standard of living up to a certain level of income, but thereafter decreases as income rises.

The main objective is the development of a system that decodes the knowledge-acquisition strategy and the decision-making process of technical analysts called chartists. It advances the literature on heterogeneous learning in speculative markets by introducing a trading system wherein market environment and agent beliefs are represented by fuzzy inference rules. The resulting functionality leads to the derivation of the parameters of the fuzzy rules by means of adaptive training. In technical terms, it expands the literature that has utilized Actor-Critic reinforcement learning and fuzzy systems in agent-based applications, by presenting an adaptive fuzzy reinforcement learning approach that provides with accurate and prompt identification of market turning points and thus higher predictability. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate this concretely through a comparative investigation against other well-established models. The results indicate that with the inclusion of transaction costs, the profitability of the novel system in case of NASDAQ Composite, FTSE100 and NIKKEI255 indices is consistently superior to that of a Recurrent Neural Network, a Markov-switching model and a Buy and Hold strategy. Overall, the proposed system via the reinforcement learning mechanism, the fuzzy rule-based state space modeling and the adaptive action selection policy, leads to superior predictions upon the direction-of-change of the market.

Public capital plays an important role in long-run growth through enhancing productivity and complementing the accumulation of private inputs. Under certain conditions, it could also have important implications for income inequality dynamics. Inequality is bad for growth, when the credit market is imperfect and there is a diminishing marginal rate of return on private investment. Certain public services and investment may benefit the poor more than proportionally and thus improve the distribution of income, and hence, improve economic growth through an indirect channel. The key mechanism linking the distribution of income to public capital is its disproportional effect on the economy that affects factor shares of capital. The paper also studies the determination of optimal tax. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Prior to this surge in interest, discussions of convention in economics had been tied to the analysis of John Maynard Keynes's writings. These literatures are distinct and have very little overlap. Yet this confluence of interests raises interesting methodological questions. Does the use of a common term, convention, denote a set of shared concerns? Can we identify what differentiates the game theoretic models from the Keynesian ones?

Overall, we find that teachers overwhelmingly support the principles underlying the No Child Left Behind legislation, including that schools should be held accountable for educating all children well.

It analyzes parametric configurations under which incumbent firms may have followed non-cooperative entry deterrence strategies or else may have colluded for that purpose. A two-stage competition model is developed. In the first stage there occurs sequential auctioning of multiple fishing rights; in the second stage, production rights are used to compete in a homogeneous-good Cournot market. The analysis focuses on the relationship between the number of incumbents, sources of competitive advantage for them (relative to potential entrants) and the number and productive size of the multiple production rights in sale. The core of the analysis lies in answering how does the divisibility of the object(s) in sale affect the possibilities of incumbent firms for deterring the entry of new rivals.","[Pena-Torres, Julio] Univ Alberto Hurtado ILADES, Fac Econ & Negocios, Santiago, Chile",Universidad Alberto Hurtado,"Peña-Torres, J (通讯作者)，Univ Alberto Hurtado ILADES, Fac Econ & Negocios, Erasmo Escala 1835, Santiago, Chile.",jpena@uahurtado.cl; gfernandez@fne.gob.cl,,,,,,,35,1,1,0,10,UNIV CHILE DEPT ECONOMICS,SANTIAGO,"DIAGONAL PARAGUAY 257, REGISTRO PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL 112.761, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0718-5286,,,ESTUD ECONOMIA,Estud.

It is possible, however, that prenatal care is too little too late to improve pregnancy outcomes in the aggregate, but that it increases the use of pediatric health care or improves maternal health-related parenting practices and, ultimately, child health. We use data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing birth cohort study that have been augmented with hospital medical record data to estimate effects of prenatal care timing on pediatric health care utilization and health-related parenting behaviors during the first year of the child's life. We focus on maternal postpartum smoking, preventive health care visits for the child, and breastfeeding. We use a multi-pronged approach to address the potential endogeneity of the timing of prenatal care. We find that first trimester prenatal care appears to decrease maternal postpartum smoking by about 5 percentage points and increase the likelihood of 4 or more well-baby visits by about 1 percentage point, and that it may also have a positive effect on breastfeeding. These findings suggest that there are benefits to standard prenatal care that are generally not considered in evaluations of prenatal care programs and interventions.","[Corman, Hope; Noonan, Kelly] Rider Univ, Dept Econ, Lawrenceville, NJ 08648 USA; [Reichman, Nancy E.] Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, Dept Pediat, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA; [Corman, Hope; Noonan, Kelly] Natl Bur Econ Res, Lawrenceville, NJ 08648 USA; [Schwartz-Soicher, Ofira] Columbia Univ, Sch Social Work, New York, NY 10027 USA",Rider University; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Rutgers University Biomedical & Health Sciences; National Bureau of Economic Research; Columbia University,"Noonan, K (通讯作者)，Rider Univ, Dept Econ, 2083 Lawrenceville Rd, Lawrenceville, NJ 08648 USA.",reichmne@umdnj.edu; corman@rider.edu; knoonan@rider.edu; os2172@columbia.edu,,,,,,,37,33,41,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Second, it allows studying the monotonicity of functions or subsets of variables. Third, GMA naturally provides bounds on the sensitivity of variables to parameter changes. Fourth, GMA may be used to derive conditions under which monotonicity obtains with respect to functions of parameters, corresponding to imposed parameter moves. Fifth, GMA contributes insights into the theory of comparative statics, for example, with respect to dealing with constraints or exploiting additional information about the model structure. Several applications of GMA are presented, including constrained optimization, nonsupermodular games, aggregation, robust inference, and monotone comparative dynamics.","[Strulovici, Bruno H.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Weber, Thomas A.] Stanford Univ, Dept Management Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Northwestern University; Stanford University,"Strulovici, BH (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",b-strulovici@northwestern.edu; webert@stanford.edu,"Weber, Thomas A./C-3892-2018","Weber, Thomas A./0000-0003-2857-4754",,,,,34,3,3,1,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

The paper discusses the grounds on which the ambiguity surrounding the decision-maker in Ellsberg's urn experiments can be deemed analogous to the uncertainty faced by Shackle's entrepreneur taking 'crucial decisions'. The two authors' insights are assessed, and special attention is paid to the criteria for decision under uncertainty they put forward. The paper establishes a link between Ellsberg's and Shackle's perspectives and the non-additive probability approach of Gilboa and Schmeidler, an approach that offers an alternative to standard probability calculus, which can be of use to analyse both ambiguity and uncertainty. The comparison between Ellsberg and Shackle draws on an interpretation of Keynes's Treatise on Probability emphasising Keynes's rejection of both well-defined probability functions and maximisation as a guide to human conduct. It is shown that Keynes's viewpoint implies a reconsideration of the boundaries of probability theory that is in the same vein of Ellsberg's and Shackle's concern in the years of the consolidation of Savage's new probabilistic mainstream.","[Basili, Marcello; Zappia, Carlo] Dept Econ Policy Finance & Dev, I-53100 Siena, Italy",,"Zappia, C (通讯作者)，Dept Econ Policy Finance & Dev, Piazza San Francesco 7, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",zappia@unisi.it,,"ZAPPIA, CARLO/0000-0003-2471-5839",,,,,97,26,29,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We also estimate deviations from uncovered interest rate parity conditional on these shocks. The analysis is based on a structural vector autoregression in which monetary policy shocks are identified through the conditional heteroscedasticity of the structural disturbances. Unlike earlier work in this area, our empirical methodology avoids making arbitrary assumptions about the relevant policy indicator or transmission mechanism in order to achieve identification. At the same time, it allows us to assess the implications of imposing invalid identifying restrictions. Our results indicate that the nominal exchange rate exhibits delayed overshooting in response to a monetary expansion, depreciating for roughly ten months before starting to appreciate. The shock also leads to large and persistent departures from uncovered interest rate parity. Variance-decomposition results indicate that monetary policy shocks account for a non-trivial proportion of exchange rate fluctuations. (C) 2009 Elsevier By.

Inbound tourism converts local nontraded goods into tradable goods, creating a tourism terms-of-trade effect for the tourist-receiving economy. Through this effect, quotas result in a spillover to the nontraded sector. Hence, in the presence of tourism, the traditional free-trade prescription for the small open economy is no longer valid. This lends support to the setting of import quotas. Using the optimal quota as a benchmark, we further examine the welfare effect of tied aid. If tied aid brings about an excessive supply of importable goods, then the transfer paradox of the immiserization of the tourist-receiving economy may occur.","[Chao, Chi-Chur] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chao, Chi-Chur] Oregon State Univ, Dept Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Hazari, Bharat R.; Yu, Eden S.

A real options model is developed to illustrate how an investor country (or oil company) can evaluate and compare the critical value of oil-resource investment in different countries under oil-price, exchange-rate, and investment-environment uncertainties. The aim is to establish a broad model that can be used by every oil investor country to value overseas oil resources. The model developed here can match three key elements: 1) deal with overseas investment (the effects of investment environment and exchange rates); 2) deal with oil investment (oil price, production decline rate and development cost etc.); 3) the comparability of the results from different countries (different countries' oil-investment situation can be compared by using the option value index (OVI)). China's overseas oil investment is taken as an example to explain the model by calculating each oil-investee country's critical value per unit of oil reserves and examining the effect of different factors on the critical value. The results show that the model developed here can provide useful advice for China's overseas oil investment program. The research would probably also be helpful to other investor countries looking to invest in overseas oil resources. (C) 2009 Elsevier BM.

But in the process, structural imbalances, resource inefficiency, and income inequality worsened rapidly. It is argued that the coexistence of China's extraordinary growth and serious structural risks are two sides of the same coin: asymmetric liberalisation of product and factor markets. Distortions in markets for labour, capital, land, energy, and the environment lower production costs, increase corporate profits, raise investment returns, improve the international competitiveness of Chinese goods, and therefore lift China's growth. But they also depress consumption. China needs to accelerate factor market liberalisation in order to complete the transition to a market economy and to lock the economy onto a more sustainable path.","Peking Univ, China Ctr Econ Res, Beijing, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Huang, YP (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, China Ctr Econ Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,"Yang, Jie/JDM-6213-2023","Yang, Jie/0000-0002-3941-0053",,,,,50,27,27,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0818-9935,,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

J,"Reimer, JJ; Hertel, TW",,,,"Reimer, Jeffrey J.; Hertel, Thomas W.",,,Nonhomothetic Preferences and International Trade,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FACTOR ABUNDANCE THEORY; ADDITIVE DEMAND SYSTEM,"This study examines whether nonhomothetic preferences underlie the missing trade problem associated with factor content of trade models. We first find that per capita income goes a long way in explaining differences in goods consumption across countries. We then find a striking correlation between the factor content of consumption and per capita income, and show that accounting for this is a key part of resolving the case of the missing trade. However, nonhomothetic preferences over broad categories of expenditure play only a small role in this phenomenon. Rather, we find that as income grows, spending is directed towards the relatively capital-intensive version of a given good. Since recent research shows that capital intensity is correlated with quality (Schott, 2004), our results suggest that within-product quality differences are likely important for explaining the factor content of trade, whereas nonhomothetic preferences over broad categories of expenditure are much less so.","[Reimer, Jeffrey J.] Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Hertel, Thomas W.] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Oregon State University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Reimer, JJ (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",jeff.reimer@oregonstate.edu; hertel@purdue.edu,"Reimer, Jeffrey/G-7015-2016","Reimer, Jeffrey/0000-0003-4434-174X",,,,,31,17,17,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Each worker overestimates his productivity but is aware of the bias in his opponent's self-assessment. The manager of the firm, on the other hand, correctly assesses workers' productivities and self-beliefs when setting tournament prizes. The article shows that, under a variety of circumstances, firms can benefit from worker positive self-image. The article also shows that worker positive self-image can improve welfare in tournaments.

In particular, under such a rule it is possible for a steady state to be locally indeterminate, and therefore sunspot equilibria are possible. In this paper, I extend their analysis to investigate the possibility of chaotic equilibria under a balanced-budget rule. A global analysis reveals Euler equation branching which means that the dynamics going forward are generated by a differential inclusion of the form (x) over dot is an element of {f, g(x)}. Each branch alone will not imply interesting dynamics. However, by switching between the branches, I show that the existence of Euler equation branching in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of a steady state implies topological chaos in the sense of Devaney on a compact invariant set with non-empty interior (the chaos is thick). Moreover, the chaos is robust to small C(1) perturbations. This branching under a balanced-budget rule occurs independently of the local uniqueness of the equilibrium around the steady state(s).

A conditional difference-in-differences technique is employed for an estimation of the impact and block bootstrapping is used for computing consistent standard errors. The results indicate a positive and statistically as well as economically significant effect of a large investment project on the local unemployment outflow rate, which is driven mainly by increases in the aggregate unemployment exit hazard rates for unemployment durations smaller than nine months. Subsequent to the investment, the unemployment rate decreased by 1.7 percentage points and the employment rate increased by 3.7 percentage points in the host district. However, the impact on long-term unemployed was negligible as the exit hazard rates for durations longer than nine months remain unchanged. Moreover, a simple cost-benefit analysis suggests that investment incentives paid from a state budget would pay off only in a horizon of twelve years. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

After investigating the possibility that unobservable employee characteristics lie behind conditional wage differentials, a hypothesis which cannot be accepted, the paper investigates the role of institutional, industry structure, and industry performance characteristics in explaining industry wage differentials.

The extended model is applied to the analysis of environmental tax reforms. A reduction in the level of energy use yields a double dividend by lowering pollution and unemployment, while temporarily inducing energy-saving technical change. It moves the economy to a new balanced growth path where unemployment is permanently lower, but long-run growth is not affected.

As public programs have distributional consequences, a compelling question is what impact, if any, do social preferences have on voting behavior. This paper explores this issue using laboratory experiments wherein voting outcomes lead to a known distribution of net benefits across participants. Preferences are elicited using a novel Random Price Voting Mechanism (RPVM), which is more efficient in eliciting preferences than a dichotomous choice referendum but gives consistent results. Results suggest that social preferences, in particular a social efficiency motive, lead to economically meaningful deviations from selfish voting choices and increase the likelihood that welfare-enhancing programs are implemented.

To defend Pigovian taxation in the presence of judgement-proof agents, its proponents point at the many institutions extending liability to third parties. Yet little is known about the validity of Pigou's analysis in this context. The paper analyses the costs and benefits of extended liability and investigates whether full internalization is called for in the presence of agency costs between potential tortfeasers and providers of guarantees. Its contribution is two-fold. It first shows that the better the firms' corporate governance and the stronger their balance sheet, the more closely taxes should track the corresponding externality. It then develops the first analysis of extended liability when guarantors themselves may be judgement-proof, and the extension of liability may give rise to further externalities. Relatedly, it derives the curvature of the optimal taxation of externalities in a multi-plant firm.","Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Tirole, J (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.",,,,,,,,27,7,7,0,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

That is, findings show asymmetric hedging performance between upward and downward price trends consistently from the most popular hedging models in literature.

This method exploits the fact that the equations defining equilibrium can be viewed as a set of algebraic equations in the neighborhood of the steady-state. In a non-stochastic setting, the algorithm, in essence, continually extends a local solution to a globally accurate solution. When stochastic elements are introduced, it then uses a recursive scheme in order to determine the global solution. This method is compared to projection, perturbation, and linearization approaches and is shown to be fast and globally accurate. We also demonstrate that linearization methods perform poorly in an environment of heteroskedasticity even though the unconditional variance of technology shocks is relatively small and similar to that typically used in RBC analysis.

These new methods have diffused widely: into merger reviews and antitrust litigation, regulatory decision making, price setting by retailers, the design of auctions and marketplaces, and into neighboring fields in economics, marketing, and engineering. Increasing access to firm-level data and in some cases the ability to cooperate with firms or governments in experimental research designs is offering new settings and opportunities to apply these ideas in empirical work. This essay begins with a sketch of how the field has evolved to its current state, in particular how the field's emphasis has shifted over time from attempts to relate aggregate measures across industries toward more focused studies of individual industries. The second and primary part of the essay describes several active areas of inquiry. We also discuss some of the impacts of this research and specify topics where research efforts have been more or less successful. The last section steps back to offer a broader perspective.

Many aspects in this memory have a part in the social and political organization of the Hungarian-speakers who inhabit this border area, now part of Ukraine, and are reconstructing their collective identity. Light is shed on: the tensions and actors involved; the role of obliteration and silence in expressing and ritualizing this memory; and the space-time continuum that articulates memorial observances. Questions are raised about the relation between these figures of a formal and informal collective memory, on the one hand, and, on the other, the political ethnicization with isolationist tendencies that is at work. In this regional, traditionally multiethnic society, interethnic and crossborder transactions related to smuggling, informal trade and a patriotic tourism ensure the population's economic survival.","EHESS, EPHE, Paris, France",Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE),"Losonczy, AM (通讯作者)，EHESS, EPHE, Paris, France.",losonczymenget1956@gmail.com,,,,,,,41,1,1,0,5,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

As workers become more likely to find their preferred job, they specialize more. Specialization raises expected income. It also exposes workers to a greater downside loss when the more desired employment opportunities are unavailable. More specialization thereby raises the earnings divide between those who match well and those who do not, which under some conditions leads to greater inequality.","[Smith, Eric] Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Atlanta, GA USA; [Smith, Eric] Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Atlanta; University of Essex,"Smith, E (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Atlanta, GA USA.",,,,,,,,25,2,11,1,8,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1932-8575,1932-8664,,J HUM CAPITAL,J.

To this end, we build up a three-period overlapping generations model where altruistic parents choose optimal health expenditures for their children and themselves. The survival probability of adults and children depends on such investments. Agents can be skilled or unskilled. In this paper, epidemics are modeled as one-period exogenous shocks to the adults' survival rates. We first show that such epidemics have permanent effects on the size of population and on the level of output. However, the income distribution is shown to be unaltered in the long-run. Second, we show that this distribution may be significantly altered in the medium-term: in particular, the proportion of the unskilled will necessarily increase at that term if orphans are too penalized in the access to education.

Annual earnings inequality is U-shaped, decreasing sharply up to 1953 and increasing steadily afterward. Short-term earnings mobility measures are stable over the full period except for a temporary surge during World War II. Virtually all of the increase in the variance in annual (log) earnings since 1970 is due to increase in the variance of permanent earnings (as opposed to transitory earnings). Mobility at the top of the earnings distribution is stable and has not mitigated the dramatic increase in annual earnings concentration since the 1970s. Long-term mobility among all workers has increased since the 1950s but has slightly declined among men. The decrease in the gender earnings gap and the resulting substantial increase in upward mobility over a lifetime for women are the driving force behind the increase in long-term mobility among all workers.","[Kopczuk, Wojciech] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Kopczuk, W (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,"Kopczuk, Wojciech/0000-0001-8678-275X",,,,,36,224,268,3,74,M I T PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"238 MAIN STREET, STE 500, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1046 USA",0033-5533,,,Q J ECON,Q.

For that purpose, we develop a three-period OLG model where the population, who ignores the negative impact of excessive work on longevity, is partitioned in two groups with different tastes for leisure, and follows an adaptation/imitation process a la Bisin and Verdier ( 2001). The optimal short- and long-run Pigouvian taxes on wages are shown to differ, because the latter correct agents' myopia, but also internalize intergenerational externalities due to the socialization process. The internalization of composition effects raises the Pigouvian tax on the wage of one type of agents, but reduces it on the other type, in such a way as to induce the optimal long-run partition of the population.","Ecole Normale Super, Dept Social Sci, Paris Sch Econ, F-75014 Paris, France",Paris School of Economics; Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS),"Ponthiere, G (通讯作者)，Ecole Normale Super, Dept Social Sci, Paris Sch Econ, 48 Bd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",gregory.ponthiere@ens.fr,,,,,,,23,9,9,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

In particular, we find that reward mechanisms can negatively moderate the effect of size on a firm's willingness to patent.

This study focuses on the determinants of overweight in mothers and children, using a unique dataset collected in urban Accra, in Ghana. The findings show that mothers' education, employment status and ethnicity significantly exert influence on the generation of body weight. In particular, those who attained secondary and tertiary education had lower body mass indices and were much less likely to be overweight or obese, lending support to the notion that more educated women normally have better health knowledge and are more likely to consume healthy foods and also engage in physical exercises that help to control weight gain. Mother's education was also found to exert a negative and significant impact on the weight status of children. Furthermore, household expenditure was found to exert a positive and significant impact on the probability of a mother being overweight or obese, but no significant impact on the probability of a child being overweight.","Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, D-24118 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Abdulai, A (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, Olshaussenstr 40, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",aabdula@food-econ.uni-kiel.de,"Abdulai, Awudu/AAI-3517-2021",", Awudu/0000-0003-4618-2789",,,,,33,18,23,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This class of shocks may be interpreted as shifts in consumer tastes. When shifts in preferences occur, consumers associate a new and different level of satisfaction to the same basket of consumption goods according to their modified preferences. This paper shows that if the initial composition of the consumption basket is sufficiently asymmetric, then a shift in relative preferences produces a perception effect strong enough to induce both intersectoral and intrasectoral positive co-movement of the main macroeconomic variables (i.e., output, consumption, investment, and employment). Furthermore, by extending the theoretical framework to a multisector model and introducing a more flexible structure for the relative-preference shock, we show that the parameter restrictions needed to observe sectoral co-movement after a relative-preference shock are much less severe. In particular, co-movement among most of the sectors emerges under general conditions, without requiring high levels of asymmetry in the consumption basket's composition and/or high aversion to risk. It is a welcome result that these findings are reached without introducing aggregate technology shocks, input-output linkages, or shocks perturbing the relative preference between aggregate consumption and leisure.","[Addessi, William] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy; [Busato, Francesco] Univ Napoli Parthenope, Naples, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; Parthenope University Naples,"Addessi, W (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.",w.addessi@gmail.com; busato@uniparthenope.it,,"ADDESSI, William/0000-0002-0303-122X",,,,,19,4,4,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

We construct an advertising equilibrium in which informed consumers use an advertising search rule whereby they buy from the highest-advertising firm. Consumers are rational in using the advertising search rule since the lowest-cost firm advertises the most and also selects the lowest price. Even though the advertising equilibrium facilitates productive efficiency, we establish conditions under which firms enjoy higher expected profit when advertising is banned. Consumer welfare falls in this case, however. Under free entry, social surplus is higher when advertising is allowed. In addition, we consider a benchmark model of price competition; we provide comparative-statics results with respect to the number of informed consumers, the number of firms and the distribution of costs; and we consider the possibility of sequential search.","[Bagwell, Kyle] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lee, Gea M.] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, Singapore, Singapore; [Bagwell, Kyle] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; Singapore Management University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Bagwell, K (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,"LEE, Gea Myoung/D-1437-2009",,,,,,27,2,2,1,16,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The basic idea, adding fiscal variables into the macroeconomic VAR model, follows Blanchard and Perotti (2002). For estimation of our model, we utilize the dataset with quarterly data on a sample from the first quarter of 1998 to the second quarter of 2009. Our main results are as follows. Firstly, government expenditures have a positive and significant impact on the GDP. By contrast, a response of GDP on a shock to government revenues is slightly negative and in most specifications not significant. Secondly, these results are robust to various sensitivity checks. Consequently, the restoration of sustainable fiscal policy should focus rather on the revenues side than in the government expenditures, since a significant cut in government spending would probably have slowed down economic growth. Finally, we should note, that uncertainty connected with our results is large, namely in comparison with existing studies on the effects of monetary policy.","[Baxa, Jaromir] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Dept Econometr, CR-18208 Prague 8, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences,,jaromir.baxa@gmail.com,"baxa, Jaromir/K-3195-2019","baxa, Jaromir/0000-0002-9768-209X",,,,,14,7,7,0,1,"UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,CESKE BUDEJOVICE, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZ-370 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-218-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,24,29,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS47,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287979900005,0

This paper tests this hypothesis on a sample of 21 OECD countries over the period 1985-2003, controlling for other economic and political factors that may affect re-election. It is found that the chances of re-election for incumbent governments are not significantly affected by their record of pro-market reforms. However, the electoral impact of reform is found to differ strongly depending on which types of policies are considered. In particular, reform measures that are more likely to hurt large groups of 'insiders' seem electorally more damaging. A series of framework conditions appears to affect the impact of reforms on re-elections. Reformist governments in countries with rigid product and labour markets tend to be voted out of office, suggesting the existence of a 'rigidity trap'. While fiscal stimulus is not an effective instrument to 'sweeten the pill' and raise the odds of re-election, the presence of liberal financial markets appears to soften electoral resistance to structural reform. The latter finding is of particular relevance in the current financial crisis: forward-looking governments should not rush to over-regulate financial markets in order not to compromise the feasibility of product and labour market reforms. -Marco Buti, Alessandro Turrini, Paul Van den Noord and Pietro Biroli.","Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,,,"Biroli, Pietro/AAL-3404-2020","Biroli, Pietro/0000-0002-5033-4688; van den Noord, Paul/0000-0001-5725-5811",,,,,54,13,14,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

The cointegration results show that market size of both Malaysia and China have major, and a statistically significant impact, on FDI inflow to Malaysia. The results seem to support the argument that foreign investors tend to be more attracted to the country with a higher growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) because it indicates a larger potential demand for their products. In addition, the results also demonstrate that openness level of the country has a positive and statistically significant effect on FDI inflow, which supports the hypothesis that FDI can be attracted to a country with more liberalized economic reforms. Finally, the results show that literacy rate (human capital development) has significant positive effect on FDI inflow. The finding suggests the need for labor force expansion and education policy to raise the stock of human capital in the country. Using Granger causality test, we also find that there exist unidirectional causality from real GDP of both Malaysia and China, degree of openness and literacy rate to FDI inflow.","[Choong, Chee-Keong] Jalan Univ, Fac Business & Finance, Ctr Econ Studies, Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Kampar 31900, Perak Darul Rid, Malaysia; [Lam, Siew-Yong] Jalan Univ, Ctr Business & Management, Fac Business & Finance, Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Kampar 31900, Perak Darul Rid, Malaysia",Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR); Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR),"Choong, CK (通讯作者)，Jalan Univ, Fac Business & Finance, Ctr Econ Studies, Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Perak Campus, Kampar 31900, Perak Darul Rid, Malaysia.",choongck@utar.edu.my,"CHOONG, CHEE KEONG/D-7110-2011","CHOONG, CHEE KEONG/0000-0002-5241-4884; Lam, Siew Yong/0000-0002-9238-7753",,,,,41,21,29,1,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

It first examines the evolution pattern of overall risk sharing across China as a whole and in its coastal, central and western areas in different periods. The level of risk sharing exhibits a declining pattern over time, most of which is attributable to the coastal areas. This is in striking contrast to the rapid development of financial markets and financial intermediaries over the decades. By analyzing whether the development of the credit and capital markets affects consumption risk sharing, we conclude that financial development has not promoted risk sharing for the nation as a whole. While the expansion of the capital market has promoted risk sharing in the coastal areas in spite of the overall declining trend in that region, there is no evidence to show that this is true for the western areas.","[Du, Julan] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [He, Qing] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [He, Qing] Hong Kong Inst Monetary Res, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Rui, Oliver M.] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Accountancy, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong; Renmin University of China; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Du, JL (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",julandu@cuhk.edu.hk,"He, Qing/AFO-6994-2022","He, Qing/0000-0002-6782-099X",,,,,25,4,4,2,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Consistent with previous studies, we find that industrial diversification, either alone or combined with global diversification, results in a reduction of firm excess value. Global diversification alone, however, does not exert a significant impact on excess value. In an analysis of the decision to diversify, we find that firms in civil law countries or less developed nations are more likely to diversify, suggesting the greater utility of internal capital markets in economies where it is difficult to raise external capital. We observe that high leverage, larger size, lower levels of growth, R&D, free cash flow, profitability and Tobin's q encourage firms to diversify industrially. Higher values of q, firm size, R&D expenditures, free cash flow and liquidity, but reduced growth rates and profitability are associated with global diversification.","[Ferris, Stephen P.] Univ Missouri, Dept Finance, Trulaske Coll Business, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Sen, Nilanjan; Thu, Nguyen Thi Anh] Nanyang Technol Univ, Nanyang Business Sch, Singapore, Singapore",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; Nanyang Technological University,"Ferris, SP (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Dept Finance, Trulaske Coll Business, Cornell Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",ferriss@missouri.edu,,,,,,,19,9,12,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The prices of emission coupons will impact the costs of electricity energy production. Due to the relatively higher reference costs of alternative energy sources, we can no expect that the share of coal as an energy source will lower significantly as a source of electricity production in the future. From the point of view of regional economic aspects and the reference costs of electricity production, we could state that using coal in the near future is also tied to the socio-economic aspects of mining domestic coal. Using it in thermo plants is also enabled by the conditions of priority dispatching (since 2000) in the EU economies. We assessed the influence of prices and the use of other energy sources, environmental measures, energy efficiency and the influence of electricity market liberalisation on coal price movements. Our estimation shows that, if the prices cm other energy sources and electricity increase, the price of coal increases. If the use of other energy sources increases, and if the gross uses of industrial waste and renewable resources increase, the price of coal decreases. Environmental protection measures contribute to an increase in coal prices. A higher quotient of energy efficiency decelerates the price of coal. And the euro (to dollar) appreciation decelerates coal prices.","[Festic, Mejra] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Maribor, Slovenia; [Festic, Mejra; Repina, Sebastijan; Volcjak, Robert] EIPF Econ Inst, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Festic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Maribor, Slovenia.",mejra.festic@uni-mb.si; sebastijan.repina@eipf.si; robert.volcjak@eipf.si,,,,,,,38,3,4,0,10,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

It also looks at the impact on the industry of the 1998-99 Isatabu uprising, and the 2004 deal struck between local landowners and GPPOL, at the out-grower scheme, at land tenure arrangements, and at the trust funds established upon recommencement of operations. We analyse the oil-palm operations in the broader context of the socioeconomic setting on the northern plains, with particular reference to the way local villagers balance their time between participation in palm oil production and the supply of food to the Honiara market.","[Fraenkel, Jon] Australian Natl Univ, State Soc & Governance Melanesia Program, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Allen, Matthew] Australian Natl Univ, ANU Coll Asia & Pacific, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Resource Management Asia Pacific Program, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University; Australian National University,"Fraenkel, J (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, State Soc & Governance Melanesia Program, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",,"Allen, Matthew/AAB-8417-2020","Allen, Matthew/0000-0003-3490-9960; Fraenkel, Jon/0000-0002-5543-2543",,,,,16,13,14,0,3,ASIA PACIFIC PRESS,CANBERRA,"AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIV, CRAWFORD SCH ECONOMICS & GOVERNMENT, CANBERRA, ACT 0200, AUSTRALIA",0817-8038,,,PAC ECON BULL,Pac.

For this purpose we focus on a particular case study: the connection between the Spanish wine exports to Germany and the German travellers to Spain. Unlike previous studies we use a methodology based on fractional Vector AutoRegressive (VAR) models, which permits us to compute the impulse responses in a similar way as in the standard VAR case. The results show that the orders of integration of the two series are constrained between 0 and 1, being higher for the arrivals series than for the exports. The impulse response analysis reveals that an increase in travelling produces a positive initial impact on trade though it tends to disappear in the long run.","[Gil-Alana, Luis A.] Univ Navarra, Dept Econ, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain; [Fischer, Christian] Univ Bonn, Dept Agr Econ, D-5300 Bonn, Germany",University of Navarra; University of Bonn,"Gil-Alana, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Navarra, Dept Econ, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain.",alana@unav.es,"Fischer, Christian/A-9435-2015","Fischer, Christian/0000-0002-5016-3962",,,,,59,12,13,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It does so in several steps. First, the paper presents an account of the mainstream neoclassical approach to finance and development and traces through its historical evolution since the early 1970s. Second, the paper demonstrates that the failure of the neoclassical approach to finance and development stems from a variety of immutable theoretical and empirical problems with this approach. Third, the paper considers a range of Keynesian contributions to the debate over finance and development that have emerged in the wake of the repeated and consequential failures of the financial liberalization prescription and the related early warning models of financial crisis in developing countries that have been so important to neoclassical theorists. Fourth, the paper considers the kinds of commitments and broad approaches to financial policy in the developing world that are consonant with Keynesianism. Finally, the paper concludes with some speculations on the possibilities that the current global financial turmoil will create intellectual and policy space for Keynesianism to be taken more seriously as part of a sustained intellectual revival of the paradigm.","[Grabel, Ilene] Univ Denver, Josef Korbel Sch Int Studies, Denver, CO 80208 USA",University of Denver,,,,,,,,,81,1,2,0,5,PALGRAVE,BASINGSTOKE,"HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, ENGLAND",,,978-0-230-28541-5,INT PAP POLIT ECON,,,2010,,,,,,,1,38,,,,,,38,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BVJ31,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291643100001,0

This paper shows how the length of contracts affects the possibility of collusion in a repeated price-setting game. Contracts can both help and hinder collusion, because they reduce the size of the spot market, cutting both the immediate gain from defection and the punishment for deviation. Firms can always sustain some collusive price above marginal cost if they sell the right number of contracts, of any duration, whatever their discount factor. As the duration of contracts increases, however, collusion becomes harder to sustain. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis is based on the use of the Mundell-Fleming model within the framework of the theory of Optimum Currency Areas. The main conclusion is that (under the assumption that changes of nominal market interest rate are the only factor influencing the scale ant magnitude of capital flows) members of a currency union should offset negative results of the asymmetric shock with the use of instruments of fiscal policy. This appears to be more effective than monetary policy instruments. Hence, in analyzing the group of countries that want to establish a currency union or already have become members of such union, costs of the loss of monetary policy autonomy need not be related to benefits from preserving the autonomy. What should be taken into account is the quality of fiscal policy of these countries,. Resignation from the autonomy of monetary policy would be a rash step only if the countries concerned are not prepared to conduct coordinated, disciplined and transparent fiscal policy.","Uniwersytetu Ekonomicznego Poznaniu, Katedrze Bankowosci, Poznan, Poland",,"Jurek, M (通讯作者)，Uniwersytetu Ekonomicznego Poznaniu, Katedrze Bankowosci, Poznan, Poland.",michal.jurek@ue.poznan.pl,,,,,,,34,1,1,1,6,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,2299-6184,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2010,,3,,,,,319,343,,,,,,25,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,632AS,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280392900002,0

The Pitchford thesis contended that after the floating of the exchange rate the current account deficit was the residual outcome of rational optimizing decisions of private agents and if there was fiscal balance then the policy of targeting the reduction of the current account deficit based on the KMF paradigm was misconceived. Empirical tests based on the application of the net present value criterion using vector autoregressions, unit root and cointegration econometrics reveals that Australia's current account deficit revealed that the current account deficits were unsustainable during the fixed exchange period and over the whole study period 1960q3-2007q4, but not during the floating exchange rate period post-1983q4. Therefore the empirical results gave credibility to the Pitchford thesis but Australian policymakers continued to target the reduction of the current account deficit because their failure to make the paradigm shift from KMF to ITO to be consistent with the regime shift from a fixed to a floating exchange rate. However, in 2004 after more than two decades feuding Australian policymakers accepted the Pitchford thesis and abandon the policy of targeting the reduction of the current account deficit. But the global financial crisis and global recession has delivered a death blow to the Pitchford thesis by undermining the key assumptions of fiscal balance and rationality that underpins it. The fiscal stimulus package that has been implemented to combat the fall in aggregate demand and restore consumer confidence due to the global recession has resulted in massive fiscal imbalance and the credit crunch has undermined rational behavior and consumer confidence. Therefore, the Pitchford thesis no longer rules the policy roost after the global financial crisis. In this study we draw on the conflicting policy perspectives on the unsustainability of high US current account deficits that tender a malign prognosis based on Salvatore's twin deficit hypothesis and a benign prognosis based on Bernanke's global savings glut hypothesis to identify some key policy challenges that confront Australian policymakers to navigate the Australian economy out of the global financial crisis and recession into a robust recovery phase in the near future.

I construct a model in which a low quality diet raises the risk of disease, and disease in turn causes a loss of labor productivity. Low quality diets are less expensive than high quality diets, so dietary choices are worse for lower income households. The effect of disease can be partly offset by medical treatment. I show that dietary choices under TFUHC are distorted by a moral hazard problem which leads to diets that are lower in quality than is first-best. I then examine three different policy interventions to address the dietary distortion: a reduced level of treatment; risk-based premiums for health care; and a quality-based tax on food. I calibrate the model with Canadian data on type 2 diabetes and derive the net benefit and distributional impact for each policy.","Univ Victoria, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada",University of Victoria,"Kennedy, PW (通讯作者)，Univ Victoria, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada.",pkennedy@uvic.ca,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

This difference is present in spite of the fact that the latter group tends to have a somewhat higher turnover of the executive. The conditions under which parliamentary democracies will deliver lower probabilities of default than presidential countries are derived in a model with opportunistic politicians.

The importance of work, family, religion and interpersonal trust play a particularly prominent role.

How prudent are consumers? journal of Political Economy 1993; 101; 1104-1113.], this study deviates from the framework by explicitly considering liquidity constraints, as in Zeldes [Zeldes, S.P. Consumption and liquidity constraints: an empirical investigation. journal of Political Economy 1989; 97; 305-346.]. By doing so, this paper attempts to differentiate the standard precautionary saving caused by uncertainty from that caused by liquidity constraints. Furthermore, endogenous liquidity constraints are used in order to resolve issues of selection biases. We find substantial evidence of the presence of precautionary saving in Pakistan.

Other specific circumstances as the entry of the Czech Republic into EU, access of trading partners into the European monetary union and start of global financial crises in September 2008 were used to define the export functions by the help of dummy variables. Different combinations of mentioned variables, different lags and time periods were analyzed by the help of ordinary least squares method. Quarterly data were modeled and we had to deal with problem of stacionarity, heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation in some models. In the most models, GDPs and exchange rates were the significant factors of the export function.

I show that simultaneous communication achieves the highest efficiency, followed by sequential and hierarchical communication. However, hierarchical communication, in which a second expert chooses whether to block the first expert's message, achieves a moderate level of efficiency, even though the decision maker receives only one message.

We search for incentive-constrained efficient allocation rules that display fairness properties. Population monotonicity, says that an increase in population should not be detrimental to anyone. Demand monotonicity states that an increase in the demand for the public good (in the sense of a first-order stochastic dominance shift in the distribution of preferences) should not be detrimental to any agent whose preferences remain unchanged. Under suitable domain restrictions, we give all explicit characterization of all incentive-constrained efficient allocation rules. We then show that there exists a unique incentive-constrained efficient and demand-monotonic allocation rule: the so-called serial rule. In the binary public good case, the serial rule is also the only incentive-constrained efficient and population-monotonic rule. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Workers can direct their search but, in the absence of wage commitment from the firms, they have no basis to do so. The default means of wage formation in one-on-one matches is Nash bargaining. When there are multiple applicants competition drives the workers down to their continuation value. By attracting more applicants, a binding wage floor provides a means for firms to increase matching rates and improve match quality.

The processes of the creating of knowledge based society and knowledge economy and modernization are analyzed in the general context of the processes of sustainable development. The main principles of creating the knowledge based society and knowledge economy and modernization are described. Creating and modernization of the knowledge based society and knowledge economy are very complicated processes, oriented to the formation of the new quality of society and qualitatively new lifestyle, these processes may be described as twice as complicated, because they win distinction by orientations to the pursuit of new quality in two aspects: the knowledge based society and knowledge economy, compared to traditional society and economy, are in all cases described as qualitatively new, creating and development of the knowledge based society and knowledge economy takes place under the conditions of the global changes, which means that qualitative changes take place in all global space, the essence of those changes is the creation and spread of the knowledge-based society and knowledge economy. A special attention is given to the conclusion that in the environment of the knowledge based society creation and generating knowledge economy and development, the provisions for sustainable development should be attained. The processes of creating knowledge based society and knowledge economy and further development should be analyzed and assessed in the context of processes of globalization and internationalization, as well as processes of global transformations.

This change in the industrial composition of FDI and the non-tradable nature of services may have altered the importance of location factors for investment decisions. To capture potential changes in FDI determinants, a contrasting sectoral analysis is performed. Based on FDI stock data from eight new EU member states for the period 1998-2004, we implement a dynamic panel approach allowing the speed of adjustment to the equilibrium investment level to vary across sectors. Results support our assumption that investment into the service sector, which is characterized by low installation costs, adjusts much faster to its desired level than manufacturing FDI. Thus, government interventions to attract FDI are likely to boost the service sector immediately while having a slower impact on manufacturing FDI. Furthermore, as services are mostly non-tradable, FDI into this sector is largely based on market-seeking motives while FDI in the manufacturing sector is also driven by international price competitiveness measured by real unit labour costs.","[Riedl, Aleksandra] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Riedl, Aleksandra] CESifo, D-81679 Munich, Germany",Vienna University of Economics & Business; Ifo Institut,"Riedl, A (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Nordbergstr 15, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",aleksandra.riedl@wu.ac.at,,,,,,,45,30,35,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

Lithuanian Road Administration under the Ministry of Transport and Communications allocates the funding received from European Regional Development Fund as follows: improvement of pavement of regional roads, implementation of traffic safety and environmental measures, and implementation of Gravel Roads Paving Programme. Since 2004 road projects in Lithuania have been financed from European Union funds. Unfortunately these financial resources are not sufficient for the implementation of all road investment projects in Lithuania. The problem of selecting the most effective road investment projects is becoming more and more acute. Road investment project alternatives have to be appraised in an integrated manner using mathematical models in addition to economic, social and environmental criteria. Scientific problem - road investment projects are often appraised from economic, social and environmental viewpoints separately by applying different mathematical models and without using the principle of sustainable development and multi-criteria appraisal methods for integrated analysis of road investments. The authors propose to select criteria from sustainable environment components, which best reflect economic, social and environmental aspects. It should be noted that these economic, social and environmental aspects are interrelated and complementary, and therefore influence the appraisal of road investment projects. The article analyses and evaluates the effectiveness of road investment project alternatives by combining economic, social and environmental aspects and processing the data using expert and multi-criteria appraisal methods. Scientific novelty - an integrated evaluation of economic, social and environmental aspects by using multi-criteria appraisal methods is proposed. The aim of the research - to present the road investment project appraisal methodology based on the principle of sustainable development and perform the appraisal of the alternative projects by making computations according to expert and TOPSIS (Technique for the Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) appraisal methods. The object of the research - road investment projects. The methods of the research - expert and multi-criteria appraisal method TOPSIS is applied.","[Rudzianskaite-Kvaraciejiene, Ruta; Apanaviciene, Rasa; Butauskas, Algirdas] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-51367 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Rudzianskaite-Kvaraciejiene, R (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Studentu St 48, LT-51367 Kaunas, Lithuania.",ruta.rudzianskaite@gmail.com; rasa.apanaviciene@ktu.lt; algirdas.butauskas@gmail.com,"Apanavičienė, Rasa/AGS-8885-2022","Apanavičienė, Rasa/0000-0003-2826-5062",,,,,49,12,13,1,28,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

That relationship points out that the non-subadditivity of the cost function at the output level corresponding to the oligopoly break-even price, denoted by D(p(L)(n)), is sufficient to guarantee that the market sustains a (not necessarily symmetric) Bertrand equilibrium in pure strategies with two or more firms supplying at least D(p(L)(n)).

Pioneers of knowledge management are Sveiby, Drucker, Quinn, Nonaka, Takeutchi and others. Fast changing and hardly predictable, turbulent environment conditions force organizations to focus their attention to competitive ability, which organization's success, place in the market, and survival depend on. It is probable that economic recession will stimulate Lithuanian organizations to faster re-orient management philosophy as well. Organization's success, attraction and the place in the market depend very much on its chosen strategy and implementation, which are inseparable from the processes of information data system and knowledge expansion. In the 21(st) century, which is named as the globalisation century, knowledge economics, knowledge management or knowledge society is the most frequently used term in scientific literature. One common feature the aspect of knowledge - joins these concepts. Modern theories of organizations' management admit that knowledge resources are the necessary condition for organizations' competitiveness and innovativeness. Knowledge is the means, which are necessary to possess in order to improve, develop and maintain business processes, to fast and adequately react to changing environment conditions. Knowledge being intellectual workforce, without doubt, does not belong to such traditional resources as usual workforce, raw materials, etc. Undoubtedly knowledge does not belong to such traditional resources as workforce, raw materials or land. Knowledge is named as abilities, competence, experience, intellectual capital, which has special meaning both in managerial and economic environment - the organizations that produce, adapt and use knowledge improve their activity, make it more effective by creating more useful, more perfect and larger-profit bringing products, as well as support and encouragement of cogitation activity that creates knowledge creates premises for organizations to develop in acquiring strategic advantage. Knowledge contributes to more effective problem resolution, decision-making as well as determination of purposive strategy in attaining organization's aims. This obligates them to continuously and systemically assess, to re-assess, to disseminate and to use deliberately. Spender (2000) points out that without doubt most publications on the topic of knowledge management reflect high objectives to understand this phenomenon; but, in its turn, it brings some disorganization in its approach. This should not surprise if we estimate many methods and ideas, which begin to penetrate into this field. According to Davenport and Prusak (1998), recently more and more attention is paid to how systems of knowledge management can conduct and support assimilation and diffusion of hidden knowledge, which is the basis of organization's memory. Transmission of such knowledge will require certain conditions in order to be able to identify, to formalise, to abstract and to improve knowledge.","[Sedziuviene, Natalija; Vveinhardt, Jolita] Siauliai State Coll, LT-76241 Shiauliai, Lithuania",Siauliai State College,"Sedziuviene, N (通讯作者)，Siauliai State Coll, Ausros Av 40, LT-76241 Shiauliai, Lithuania.",direktore@siauliukolegija.lt; jolitaw@gmail.com,"Vveinhardt, Jolita/AAB-6754-2020","Vveinhardt, Jolita/0000-0001-6231-9402",,,,,48,28,32,1,28,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The determinants of hotel efficiency were also investigated employing the Tobit regression model approach. The SDEA results show that the SDEA efficiency measures are higher than the deterministic ones and the greater the stochastic variability of outputs, the closer the envelope moves successively to any given observation and the efficiency score approaches one. The optimal solution to SDEA involves the presence of some buffer (slack) of all outputs. In applications involving practice production situation, such buffer (slack) can be interpreted as the firms' need to hold inventory, excess capacity and organizational slack against stochastic uncertainty of market environment.

Secondary and primary data are used to assess legal institutions and the level of development in the banking sector in Fiji (and, where possible, in other South Pacific island economies) in comparison with up to 53 other countries, both developed and developing. The paper also re-examines the question of a possible law-banking development connection internationally, in light of newly available data and a newly proposed composite index of banking development. While the results are broadly consistent with previous findings of a direct relationship between law enforcement quality and banking development, they also suggest that the legal rules codifying creditor rights may not be as influential as had been thought previously. The latter result accords with the experience of Fiji, where very weak legal rules combined with average law enforcement quality (and high accounting standards) yield a reasonable performance in terms of banking development over the 1970-2006 period. The paper also points out some possible policy implications of these results.","[Sharma, Parmendra; Nguyen, Duc-Tho] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University,"Nguyen, DT (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",t.nguyen@griffith.edu.au,,,,,,,24,2,2,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

The first two papers describe regional simulation model systems aiming at the same objective of delivering a regional/metropolitan model system that can be used to perform policy analysis at the most disaggregate level possible. The policies appear to be similar across geographical areas and include, but are not limited to, land use restrictions on urban sprawl and tolling and pricing of transportation services to decrease air pollutant emissions. The first paper titled SACSIM: An applied activity-based model system with fine-level spatial and temporal resolution by Mark Bradley, John Bowman, and Bruce Griesenbeck is a detailed description of the latest model system in the evolution of US applications using discrete choice models and microsimulated populations developed for the metropolitan area of the capital of California, Sacramento, and is a foundational reference for many other model systems currently under development.

This study uses cointegration, error correction and common long-memory components analyses to demonstrate that four basic crime factors explaining both the increases in US violent and property crime between 1970 and 1991 and the dramatic declines in crime after 1991. The four factors include arrest rates, income per capita, the proportion of criminal-justice resources devoted to drug crime and alcohol consumption. Error correction models and common long-memory factors show an especially close link between crime rates and the percentage of prison resources devoted to drug offenders. Similar factors result in cointegrated models for murder, rape, robbery, assault and larceny. Additional modelling shows that effective abortion rates computed along the lines of Donohue and Levitt (2001) do not help in explaining the rise and fall of US crime.","Wake Forest Univ, Babcock Grad Sch Management, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA",Wake Forest University,"Shoesmith, GL (通讯作者)，Wake Forest Univ, Babcock Grad Sch Management, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA.",gary.shoesmith@mba.wfu.edu,,,,,,,50,9,11,2,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This study shows that accounting for cannibalization effects on the demand side is equally important for the adequate measurement of learning. Since multi-vintage firms anticipate the demand-side cannibalization effects in their production optimization, a previously omitted incentive to decrease production is captured having an impact on the measurement of learning by doing. We derive an empirical model from a dynamic oligopoly game of learning-by-doing and allow cannibalization effects to enter from the demand side. Using quarterly firm-level data for the dynamic random access memory semiconductor industry, we find support for cannibalization effects entering firms' pricing relations resulting in higher estimated learning effects.","Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Siebert, RB (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",rsiebert@purdue.edu,,,,,,,65,6,7,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The effect on the host country welfare depends on the structure of license fee and it is shown that strategic licensing might lead to welfare loss for the host country.

Using gross domestic product and gross domestic product per capita in purchasing power standard data respectively paper examines trends in regional disparities at the level NUTS 2 during the period 1996-2007. From the analysis we can see a significant convergence process and a perceptible increase in regional disparities in the case of New Member States regions, which were growing dynamically.
