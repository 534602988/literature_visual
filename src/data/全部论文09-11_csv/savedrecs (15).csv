A possible explanation is that the incentives to comply are shaped not only by legal, but also by social sanctions. This paper employs a novel experimental approach to study the link between legal and social norm enforcement. We analyze whether the two institutions are complements or substitutes. Our results show that legal sanctions partially crowd out social norm enforcement. Mild laws nevertheless give scope for a potentially large, positive welfare effect, as a higher level of compliance is achieved at lower social enforcement costs.","[Kube, Sebastian; Traxler, Christian] Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Bonn, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Kube, S (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Bonn, Germany.",kube@coll.mpg.de,,,,,,,39,34,37,0,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

This finding suggests that varying factor intensity can potentially generate different degrees of price stickiness across sectors and remove the need to exogenously impose the latter. Of course, labor intensity is just one more feature-in addition to others like the durability of goods produced and the degree of competition-that can explain some of the heterogeneity in price durations across sectors.

The focus of the workshop was to test theoretical models using experimental methods to increase our understanding of the efficiency of mechanisms supporting the provision of public goods, social cooperation, and voting systems. This special issue aims at showing how lively and diversified the ongoing experimental research in public economics has come to be. We highlight three topics in particular: the power of voting and legal enforcement systems, the efficiency of various institutions to support cooperation in social dilemma games, and auctions.","[Plott, Charles R.] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Rulliere, Jean-Louis] Univ Lyon 2, F-69365 Lyon 07, France; [Villeval, Marie Claire] CNRS GATE Lyon St Etienne, Paris, France",California Institute of Technology; Universite Lyon 2; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2,"Plott, CR (通讯作者)，CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",cplott@hss.caltech.edu; rulliere@gate.cnrs.fr; villeval@gate.cnrs.fr,"Villeval, Marie Claire/H-7773-2017","Villeval, Marie Claire/0000-0001-8578-5449",,,,,2,1,1,2,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

In practice, antitrust authorities define economic markets in a deterministic manner with little concern about the risk involved in defining markets incorrectly. In contrast, this article proposes a probabilistic market definition method by which antitrust authorities can establish a statistical confidence level for their intended market-definition judgments. As an application, we examine the likelihood that the fixed-line and mobile telephony services in Korea can compete in the same economic market. Combining critical loss analysis with a hierarchical Bayes model for stated preference data, we find some evidence for the separation of the fixed-line and mobile telephony markets in present-day Korea.

This study examines the link between services sector reforms and the productivity of manufacturing industries relying on services inputs. Several aspects of services liberalization are considered, namely, the presence of foreign providers, privatization and the level of competition. The results, based on firm-level data from the Czech Republic, show a positive relationship between services sector reform and the performance of domestic firms in downstream manufacturing sectors. Allowing foreign entry into services industries appears to be the key channel through which services liberalization contributes to improved performance of manufacturing sectors. This finding is supported by evidence that foreign acquisitions of Czech services providers result in profound changes in the labor productivity and sales of acquired firms. As most barriers to foreign investment today are not in goods but in services sectors, the findings of this study may strengthen the argument for reform in this area. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Key parameters are often not econometrically estimated, and the performance of the model as a whole is rarely checked against historical outcomes. As a consequence, questions frequently arise as to how much faith one can put in CGE results. In this paper, we employ a novel approach to the validation of a widely utilized global CGE model - GTAP-E. By comparing the variance of model-generated petroleum price distributions - driven by historical demand and supply shocks to the model - with observed five-year moving average price distributions, we conclude that energy demand in GTAP-E is far too price-elastic over this medium run time frame. After incorporating the latest econometric estimates of energy demand and supply elasticities, we revisit the validation question and find the model to perform more satisfactorily. As a further check, we compare a deterministic global general equilibrium simulation, based on historical realizations over the five year period: 2001-2006, during which petroleum prices rose sharply, along with growing global energy demands. As anticipated by the stochastic simulations, the revised model parameters perform much better than the original GTAP-E parameters in this global, general equilibrium context.

On the one hand, wages are lowered and unemployment decreases, on the other hand, the individual labour supply decision is distorted at the hours-of-work margin. The optimal level of tax progressivity within this trade-off is determined using a numerical general equilibrium model with imperfect competition on the goods market, collective wage bargaining and a labour-supply module calibrated to empirically plausible elasticity values. The model is calibrated to macroeconomic and institutional parameters of both the OECD average and a number of individual OECD countries. In most cases the optimal degree of tax progressivity is below the actual level. A decomposition approach shows that the optimal level is increased by high unemployment and by the general tax level.

We answer this question using a computable general equilibrium model, WorldScan, which has been extended with a bottom-up module of the electricity sector. The model set-up makes it possible to base the calibration directly on available estimates of costs and capacity potentials for renewable energy sources. In our base case simulation, the costs of EU climate policy with the renewables target are 6% higher than those of a policy without this target. The uncertainty in this estimate is considerable, however, and depends on our assumptions about the availability of low-cost renewable energy: the initial cost level, the steepness of the supply curves and share of renewable energy in the baseline. Within the range we explore, the excess costs vary from zero (when the target is not a binding constraint) to 32% (when the cost progression and the initial cost disadvantage for renewable energy are high and its initial share is low).

Productive incoherence refers to the proliferation of inconsistent and even contradictory strategies and statements by the IMF that to date have not congealed into any sort of new, organised regime. Those who see continuity at the IMF emphasise the reassertion of the IMF's authority, the reiteration of pro-cyclical policy adjustment and the maintenance of existing governance patterns within the institution. In contrast, evidence of discontinuity includes a world now populated by increasingly autonomous states in the South, the normalisation of capital controls and Fund conditionality programmes that are inconsistent in key respects. In the face of this evidence, it is best to understand the current conjuncture as an 'interregnum' that is pregnant with new development possibilities.","Univ Denver, Josef Korbel Sch Int Studies, Denver, CO 80207 USA",University of Denver,"Grabel, I (通讯作者)，Univ Denver, Josef Korbel Sch Int Studies, 2201 S Gaylord St, Denver, CO 80207 USA.",igrabel@du.edu,,,,,,,111,102,106,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We use an extended learning curve specification, named multiple factors learning curve (MFLC). In a first stage, we estimate a single MFLC In a second stage, we estimate the MFLC under the framework of simultaneous system of equations which takes into account the uranium supply and demand. This permits not only to enhance the reliability of the estimation by incorporating the uranium price formation mechanisms in the MFLC via the price variable, but also to give preliminary insights about uranium supply and demand behaviors and the associated effects on the nuclear expansion. Results point out that the nuclear cost has important prospects for decrease via capacity expansion, i.e. learning-by-doing effects. In contrast, they show that the learning-by-searching as well as the scale effects have a limited effect on the cost decrease prospects. Conversely, results also show that uranium price exerts a positive and significant effect on nuclear cost, implying that when the uranium price increases, the nuclear power generation cost decreases. Since uranium is characterized by important physical availability, and since it represents only a minor part in the total nuclear cost, we consider that in a context of increasing demand for nuclear energy the latter result can be explained by the fact that the positive learning effects on the cost of nuclear act in a way to dissipate the negative ones that an increase in uranium price may exert. Further, results give evidence of important inertia in the supply and demand sides as well as evidence of slow correlation between the uranium market and oil market which may limit the inter-fuels substituability effects, that is, nuclear capacity expansion and associated learning-by-doing benefits.

This contrasts with the perspective of poverty indices, which give zero weight to those above the poverty line, which we call poverty radicalism, and with standard inequality aversion where the weights decline smoothly as we move up the income scale. The object of this paper is, first, to clarify the interrelationships between charitable conservatism, poverty radicalism and inequality aversion. We do this by showing how the patterns of welfare weights to which each of these gives rise are related to each other. Secondly, we are concerned to demonstrate the implications of these different views for optimal income taxation. In terms of levels and patterns of marginal tax rates, we show that charitable conservatism and poverty radicalism are on a continuum, and by choice of low or high inequality aversion one can approximate either outcome fairly well.","[Tuomala, Matti] Univ Tampere, FIN-33101 Tampere, Finland; [Kanbur, Ravi] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY USA",Cornell University,"Tuomala, M (通讯作者)，Univ Tampere, FIN-33101 Tampere, Finland.",Matti.Tuomala@Kolumbus.fi,,,,,,,14,5,5,0,8,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

In this paper we ask whether the EU ETS provides the appropriate economic incentives to produce an efficient system in line with the Kyoto commitments. If so, electricity producers in the countries concerned should include the price of carbon in their cost functions. After identifying different sub-periods of the EU ETS during its pilot phase (2005-2007), we model the prices of various electricity contracts in France and Germany and look at the volatility of electricity prices around their fundamentals while evaluating the correlation between electricity prices in the two countries. We find that electricity producers in both countries were constrained to include the carbon price in their cost functions during the first two years of the EU ETS. Over this period, German electricity producers were more constrained than their French counterparts, and the inclusion of the carbon price in the electricity-generation cost function was much more stable in Germany than in France. We also find evidence of fuel switching in electricity generation in Germany after the collapse of the carbon market. Furthermore, the European market for emission allowances has greatly contributed to the partial alignment of the wholesale price of electricity in France to that in Germany. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Using an event-study methodology, we reach two main conclusions. First, it is inappropriate to focus only on Treasury rates as a policy target, because quantitative easing works through several channels that affect particular assets differently. We find evidence for a signaling channel, a unique demand for long-term safe assets, and an inflation channel for both QE1 and QE2, and a mortgage-backed securities (MBS) prepayment channel and a corporate bond default risk channel for QE1 only. Second, effects on particular assets depend critically on which assets are purchased. The event study suggests that MBS purchases in QE1 were crucial for lowering MBS yields as well as corporate credit risk and thus corporate yields for QE1, and Treasuries-only purchases in QE2 had a disproportionate effect on Treasuries and agency bonds relative to MBSs and corporate bonds, with yields on the latter falling primarily through the market's anticipation of lower future federal funds rates.","[Krishnamurthy, Arvind; Vissing-Jorgensen, Annette] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Krishnamurthy, A (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,,,,,,,29,429,506,3,113,BROOKINGS INST,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

In such an environment a multinational enterprise (MNE) has an advantage because it can exchange workers between plants in different countries. Recruiting from the home and foreign plant leads to a larger labor market pool for an MNE, reducing the mismatch of its workforce. This paper analyzes the consequences of this advantage for production, employment, prices and wages. In line with recent empirical results, we find that the additional ability to recruit workers from the home and foreign labor market leads to lower mismatch, higher average productivity of workers, lower prices, higher output, and higher employment of a plant of an MNE as compared with a national firm, while the wage-effects depend on firm productivity.","[Larch, Mario] Univ Munich, Univ Bayreuth, Ifo Inst Econ Res, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany; [Larch, Mario] CESifo, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany; [Lechthaler, Wolfgang] Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",University of Munich; University of Bayreuth; Ifo Institut; Ifo Institut; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Larch, M (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Univ Bayreuth, Ifo Inst Econ Res, Univ Str 30, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany.",mario.larch@uni-bayreuth.de; wolfgang.lechthaler@ifw-kiel.de,"Lechthaler, Wolfgang/AAN-6248-2020","Lechthaler, Wolfgang/0000-0001-9845-2555",,,,,54,2,2,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

It demonstrates that adoption dates differ, not only among symmetric firms, but also among markets with different market features. More specifically, technology adoption can occur earlier in a market with Cournot competition than in a market with Bertrand competition. It can also occur earlier in a market in which goods are not too close substitutes. Therefore, this paper shows that competition toughness does not always reinforce adoption incentives. When goods are sufficiently differentiated, adoption occurs later than is socially optimal. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we propose a Schumpeterian growth model that accounts for this evidence. We analyze an economy with firms that engage in cost-reducing innovation resulting from the accumulation of both codified and tacit knowledge: the former occurs through the purchase of patents, while the latter is the result of R&D conducted in-house by firms. We study the relation between knowledge appropriability and market structure, and we show that a shift from patents to in-house research occurs as firm size gets larger. Since innovation statistics concentrate mainly on patents, this process of research reallocation results into an under-estimation of innovative activity and is responsible for the declining ratio of patents to R&D expenditure. Survey data on UK-based firms provide support to our results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

First we show the superiority of sharecropping over fixed rental contracts in a benchmark landlord-tenant model with seasonal variation of price, where the tenant receives a low price for his output while the landlord can sell his output at a higher price. Then we consider more general interlinked contracts to show that there are multiple optimal contracts. Finally we incorporate imperfect competition in the product market by assuming that a third agent (called the epsilon-agent) may emerge to compete with the landlord as a buyer of the tenant's output. It is shown that (i) the presence of this competing agent generates a Pareto-improving subset of share contracts out of the multiple contracts and (ii) the unique contract that is robust to the emergence of the epsilon-agent results in sharecropping.

The consistent-planning approach introduced by Strotz (1955-1956) provides one way to deal with dynamic inconsistencies; however, consistent planning is typically interpreted as a solution concept for a game played by multiple selves of the same individual. The main result of this paper shows that consistent planning under uncertainty is fully characterized by suitable behavioral assumptions on the individual's preferences over decision trees. In particular, knowledge of ex ante preferences over trees is sufficient to characterize the behavior of a consistent planner. The results thus enable a fully decision-theoretic analysis of dynamic choice with dynamically inconsistent preferences. The analysis accommodates arbitrary decision models and updating rules; in particular, no restriction needs to be imposed on risk attitudes and sensitivity to ambiguity.","Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Siniscalchi, M (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",marciano@northwestern.edu,,,,,,,47,88,95,0,15,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

This paper considers a plausibly exogenous source of variation in insurance coverage for childbirth in California. We find that additional health insurance coverage induces substantial extensions in length of hospital stay for mother and newborn. However, remaining in the hospital longer has no effect on readmissions or mortality, and the estimates are precise. Our results suggest that for uncomplicated births, minimum insurance mandates incur substantial costs without detectable health benefits.

We use the estimated structural parameters to generalize beyond the experiment, simulating how workers would react to different gifts on the part of the firm, within different labor market settings. We find that gifts have a role to play within this firm, increasing in importance when the workers' outside alternatives deteriorate.

Workers may work longer hours in order to increase their expected income through performance pay or promotion, resulting in a positive correlation between inequality and work hours. Contrary to other work, it is found that the relationship between wage inequality and the occupation and firm level and work hours cannot be attributed to the effect of financial incentives. Demand constraints faced by workers explains the positive correlation between occupation inequality and work hours attributed to financial incentives by others. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We use a panel-data regression analysis and find that, indeed, some determinants of public expenditures on culture are political. In particular, we identify an electoral cycle in which the incumbent spends less on culture in an election year.

We argue that market conditions in previous studies were unfavorable for collusion which may have been responsible for not finding such a focal-point effect. Our design aims at maximizing the likelihood of a focal-point effect. Nevertheless, our results again fail to support the focal-point hypothesis. Collusion is as unlikely in markets with a price ceiling as in markets with unconstrained pricing. Overall, static Nash equilibrium predicts the data fairly accurately.

Our model directs attention away from the particular faith, belief or risk attitudes of religious individuals, and emphasizes instead how organized religion opens the door to standard group-based distributive politics. We argue that organized religion makes it possible for the rich and the religious poor to form electoral coalitions in favor of low taxes and limited redistribution. The losers are the secular poor. However, the material reward to the religious poor from supporting such electoral coalitions depends on the institutional context. As state financial support for religion increases, the ideological preferences of the religious poor become aligned with those of the secular poor in favor of parties that support high taxes. The analysis therefore shows that the redistributive preferences of religious individuals should vary with the institutional context, and that we can understand these preferences without assuming that religious individuals have specific core traits that differ from those of secular individuals.

It shows that the most productive firms may prefer international outsourcing to foreign direct investment (FDI) in industries with a high innovation share. The high innovation share motivates the firms to economize on organizational cost in order to save resources for R&D investment, making outsourcing preferable to FDI because the former incurs a smaller organizational cost.

Auctions in both markets are conducted by an independent system operator that collects generator bids and determines which generators will operate and how much electricity each will produce. In centrally committed markets, generators submit two-part bids consisting of a startup cost and a variable energy cost. Self-committed markets force generators to incorporate their startup costs into a one-part energy bid. The system operator in a centrally committed system ensures that each generator recovers the startup and energy costs stated in its two-part bid, while no such guarantees are made in self-committed markets. The energy cost ranking and incentive properties of these market designs remains an open question. While the system operator can determine the most efficient dispatch with a centralized market, the auction mechanism used to solicit generator data compels generators to overstate costs. Self commitment might involve less efficient dispatch but have better incentive properties. We derive Nash equilibria for both market designs in a symmetric duopoly setting. We also derive simple conditions under which the two market designs will be expected cost-equivalent.","[Sioshansi, Ramteen] Ohio State Univ, Dept Integrated Syst Engn, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Nicholson, Emma] Exeter Associates Inc, Columbia, MD 21044 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Sioshansi, R (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Integrated Syst Engn, Baker Syst Engn Bldg,1971 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",sioshansi.1@osu.edu; enicholson@exeterassociates.com,,,,,,,12,11,15,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Although structural models have been utilized scarcely in politics, the close relationship between theory and empirics required by structural models would help solving many of the current pitfalls of RCTs in political science.

I explore the conditions under which such multiplicity occurs and characterize the dynamic properties in the neighborhood of each steady state. Models with standard incomplete markets, portfolio costs, a debt-elastic interest rate, or an overlapping generations framework allow for multiple steady states, if the model features multiple steady states under financial autarchy. If the excess demand for the foreign traded good is increasing in the good's own price in a given steady state, the equilibrium dynamics around this steady state are unbounded. Otherwise, the dynamics are bounded and unique. By contrast, with Uzawa-type preferences, the steady state is always unique and the associated equilibrium dynamics are always bounded and unique.

This paper provides novel evidence for the importance of in-person business meetings in international trade. Interactions among trade partners entail a fixed cost of trade, but at the same time they generate relationship capital, which adds bilateral specific value to the traded products. Differences in the face-to-face communication intensity of traded goods, bilateral travel costs and foreign market size determine the optimal amount of interaction between trade partners. Using U.S. state level data on international business-class air travel as a measure of in-person business meetings, I find robust evidence that the demand for business-class air travel is directly related to volume and composition of exports in differentiated products. I also find that trade flows in R&D intensive manufactures and goods facing contractual frictions are most dependent on face-to-face meetings. The econometric identification exploits the cross-state variation in bilateral exports and business-class air travelers by foreign country and time period, circumventing any spurious correlation induced by cross-country differences driving aggregate travel and trade patterns.

It is well known that their contributions have been highly criticised, from both the economic and social point of view and the political or ethical one. Recent commentators, mostly historians and philosophers, have, however, underlined the realistic ambition and the reformist spirit of those approaches. This paper aims to develop this perspective. Indeed, it is my intention to defend the idea that the realism of utopia can be even better characterised by economists: the analyses of Leroux, Enfantin, Chevalier, Buchez or Considerant can be interpreted in terms of development. We study more specifically the initial flowering between 1830 and 1835 of the writings of the Saint-Simonians (Enfantin, Chevalier, Pereire), the works of the dissidents (Buchez, Leroux) and those of the main supporters of Fourier (Considerant, Transon, Lechevalier). We will conduct our survey proceeding from the notion of 'vision' proposed recently by Robert Heilbroner. We then examine whether these socialist pioneers really worked in order to elaborate a 'vision' in terms of 'development'.","ENS LSH Lyon, Directeur Rech, Ctr Natl Rech Sci, F-69342 Lyon 07, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON),"Frobert, L (通讯作者)，ENS LSH Lyon, Directeur Rech, Ctr Natl Rech Sci, 15 Parvis Descartes, F-69342 Lyon 07, France.",ludovic.frobert@ens-lsh.fr,,,,,,,73,5,5,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Instead, investors selected places where they could either learn advanced technologies or secure stable commodity supplies.

In this context, I also deal with the issue of progressivity. Even though this kind of tax policy change has recently gained popularity, its positive effects are debatable while the offsetting effect of a consumption tax on labor supply makes the net output change rather ambiguous. I examine these effects using a dynamic general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents. The model is calibrated to fit certain characteristics of the Finnish economy. In addition to output and employment effects, I study the tax reform's effect on income and wealth distribution. First. I find that eliminating progressivity in labor taxation increases output via increase in capital accumulation that comes, however, in expense of slightly more inequality. Then, tax reform that replaces progressive labor taxes with a Flat-rate consumption tax leads to a significant rise in capital accumulation, a negligible change in labor supply and gross labor income distribution, but a relatively considerable increase in wealth concentration.

However, our experiments reveal that member-financed enforcement of compliance reduces the provision of the public good. The decrease is attributed to an increase in the participation threshold for a stable coalition to form and to significant levels of noncompliance. Provision of the public good increases significantly when we abandon the strict stability conditions and require all subjects to join a coalition for it to form.","[McEvoy, David M.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Murphy, James J.] Univ Alaska, Dept Econ, Anchorage, AK USA; [Spraggon, John M.; Stranlund, John K.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Resource Econ, Amherst, MA USA",University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Anchorage; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"McEvoy, DM (通讯作者)，Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, 3108 Raley Hall,416 Howard St, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",mcevoydm@appstate.edu,,,,,,,30,16,17,1,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

This paper proposes an informal institutional mechanism-the community-based network-through which families belonging to the same neighbourhood or kinship group can bootstrap their way out of such low-skill occupational traps. The insight from the dynamic model that is developed is that once they form, new networks providing mutual support to their members and substituting for inherited parental human capital and wealth will strengthen most rapidly in historically disadvantaged communities, generating a correspondingly high level of intergenerational mobility. These predictions are successfully tested using unique data from India. The analysis in this paper, coupled with an emerging empirical literature on networks and migration, provides a new perspective on mobility in developing countries, with restrictive traditional networks decaying even as new networks supporting collective mobility form and strengthen over time.","[Munshi, Kaivan] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Munshi, Kaivan] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Brown University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Munshi, K (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",,,,,,,,39,56,70,1,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

It is shown that the gap between ex ante and ex post measures is statistically significant, and that attempts to reduce it are likely to be unsuccessful, because standards of living tend to exhibit, over temporal horizons as long as a human life, structural breaks, which make the ex ante measurement of lifetime welfare highly speculative.","Ecole Normale Super, Paris Sch Econ, F-75014 Paris, France",Paris School of Economics; Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS),"Ponthiere, G (通讯作者)，Ecole Normale Super, Paris Sch Econ, Blvd Jourdan 48,Bldg B, F-75014 Paris, France.",gregory.ponthiere@ens.fr,,,,,,,39,4,4,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

The model shows that low levels of exchange rate pass-through to firm-and aggregate-level import prices coexist with large movements in trade flows. After an exchange rate shock, aggregate import prices are subject to a composition bias due to changes in the extensive margin of trade (the number of goods traded between countries). At the firm level, each producer adjusts its markups depending on its own productivity and the change in the competitive environment generated by the exchange rate movement. Firm-level price responses are asymmetric-different for appreciations and depreciations-and adjustments in the intensive margin of trade (firm-level exports) are substantial. In general equilibrium, the model shows that firm reallocations increase the persistence of exogenous shocks.","Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92717 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Rodríguez-López, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.",,,,,,,,57,40,48,2,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The challenge is to develop frameworks capable of capturing both stability and change. We follow a descaling approach to show how founding assumptions about economics-namely, alternative assumptions about individual rationality and the role of social efficiency-influence our understanding of the drivers of institutional evolution. We then contrast two families of institutional theory. In the first, institutions are viewed as rules imposed on individuals and the focus is on the strategic games among coalitions that aim to promote or block new rules. In the second, institutions are viewed as shared beliefs: here the idea is to analyze how equilibria that are self-enforcing (in terms of mutual expectations about others' behaviors) can collapse and so induce switching to another equilibrium. Finally, we discuss the political economy literature that examines institutional transitions to a market economy, and we identify long-term drivers as well as short-term political barriers to institutional reforms.

It explains the causes, process, and outcome of institutional evolution. We first describe the institutional framework as a multilevel system at the bottom of which several local and flexible institutions apply to subsets of the society while, at the top, a single generic and rigid institution applies to all. Dissatisfied with generic order, promoters of local orders try to design collective governance solutions that are better suited to their needs. If agents are heterogeneous (as we assume), then coordination needs differ and a competitive process begins among sponsors of alternative orders. To benefit from efficiency gains, promoters of local orders encourage adherence to their preferred system of rules. The resulting competition for adherents explains why local and voluntary institutions might progressively turn into generic and mandatory ones. We thus establish a logical continuum between contractual governance mechanisms and institutions. We then analyze the strategic interplay among sponsors of alternative institutional orders by considering not only the horizontal competition among institutions emerging in the same time but also the vertical competition between promoters of new rules and sponsors of the established, more generic rules.

The results also suggest that, in the post-war economy of the mid-1990s, those with vocational training fared best among all education groups. Being a war veteran also had a strong negative association with the poverty-reflecting successful attempts to support that group.

This paper presents a strategic framework for developing an appropriate strategic response of firms by relocating their production facilities and framing their operational procedures in such a way that they may, as eligible beneficiaries, exploit institutional incentive mechanisms available in a specific region or a host country. More specifically, in the paper we explore a strategic option for lowering firms' operational costs through international operations by using the mechanism of diagonal cumulation of origin introduced by the European Union (EU) in its Common Commercial Policy towards selected non-member countries. Despite extensive discussions in theoretical literature on the conception of the rules of origin, only a few studies have explored the implications of this mechanism from the perspective of a firm's transaction costs in international business. This paper shows that the 'SAP+ diagonal cumulation of origin,' when properly conceived and implemented by a firm, can positively affect its financial performance. By analysing the cost-effect simulation of a selected household appliance producer in the presented case study, we then discuss the key strategic and operational implications for firms wishing to take advantage of offered supranational institutional incentive mechanisms.","[Jurse, M.; Logozar, K.; Korez-Vide, R.] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Int Trade Goods & Serv, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Jurse, M (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Int Trade Goods & Serv, Razlagova 14-20, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia.",milan.jurse@uni-mb.si; klavdij.logozar@uni-mb.si; matjaz.kljucevsek@gorenje.si; romana.korez-vide@uni-mb.si,"Logožar, Klavdij/C-6760-2012","Logožar, Klavdij/0000-0001-8496-3397; Korez Vide, Romana/0000-0003-3345-5215",,,,,51,0,0,0,9,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Therefore, structural shortage of technical labour emerged in the labour market as a result of excess of demand for high-skilled workers. Previous literature mostly focused on the relationship between rural human-capital level and labour movement, income change and economic growth, but in this article, the authors focus on the study of the relative disparity of urban and rural human capital and labour movement, as well as the effect of the change of urban-rural human capital gap on industrial output, profit and social welfare. This article shows that bridging the urban-rural gap in respect of human capital level could not only improve the situation of the structural shortage of technical labour, but also have a positive effect on the general social welfare.","[Li, Xiaochun] Nanjing Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Qian, Xiaoying] Nanjing Univ, Dept Econ, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University; Nanjing University,"Li, XC (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Sch Business, 22 Hankou Rd, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",xiaochun@nju.edu.cn,,,,,,,10,7,7,1,29,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0038-2280,,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

For this purpose, we have improved and extended the analysis of Asako and Uchino (1987) by taking into account notable changes in the Japanese economy. We conclude that situation of the Japanese loan market has basically been same as in the old days of Asako and Uchino (1987), although the prevailing state of disequilibrium has shifted from excess demand to excess supply. The market loan rate lacks a mechanism for rapid adjustment towards the market equilibrium rate and it is instead guided by some policy-related interest rate that does not clear the market.","[Liu Zhentao] Xiamen Univ, Sch Management, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Liu Zhentao] Xiamen Univ, Inst Financial & Accounting Studies, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Asako, Kazumi] Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Tokyo 1868603, Japan",Xiamen University; Xiamen University; Hitotsubashi University,"Liu, ZT (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Sch Management, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",lzt@xmu.edu.cn,,,,,,,14,0,0,1,12,HITOTSUBASHI UNIV,TOKYO,"HITOTSUBASHI ACADEMY KUNITACHI, TOKYO, JAPAN",0018-280X,,,HITOTSUB J ECON,Hitotsubashi J.

A number of consequences have been predicted, for example, impacts on fares, passenger volumes, choice and consumer welfare. Airline costs are also predicted to fall as a result of increased competitiveness and increased cooperation among airlines. For the short period since the implementation of the Agreement, it is relatively easy to assess the supply-side changes that have been made, but more difficult to make wider judgements. This paper indicates the data that will be required to make these judgements and notes some methodological difficulties. Early estimates of the impact on passenger numbers are given using time series analysis focusing on London airports, in particular London Heathrow and airports served by British Airway's Open Skies Airline from Paris Orly and Amsterdam Schipol. Impact de l'accord Ciel Ouvert entre l'UE et les Etats-Unis et de l'initiative Open Skies resultante de British Airways: nombre de passagers a Londres, Amsterdam et Paris Resume L'avenement de l'accord Ciel ouvert entre l'UE et les Etats-Unis avait ete tres largement prevu, et on a predit un certain nombre de consequences, notamment l'impact sur le prix des billets, sur les volumes de passagers, sur le choix pour les consommateurs et sur leur bien-etre, entre autres. On prevoit egalement que les couts des compagnies d'aviation devraient baisser, en consequence de l'augmentation non seulement de la competitivite, mais aussi de la concurrence entre les compagnies. A l'issue de la courte periode qui s'est ecoulee depuis l'implementation de l'Accord, il est relativement aise d'evaluer les variations qui se sont produites du cote de l'offre, mais beaucoup plus difficile de formuler des opinions plus generales. La presente communication indique les donnees qui seront requises pour formuler ces jugements, et souligne certaines difficultes sur le plan de la methodologie. Des premieres evaluations de l'impact sur le nombre de voyageurs ont ete avancees, sur la base d'analyses a serie temporelle concentrees sur les aeroports de Londres, notamment l'aeroport Heathrow de Londres et les aeroports desservis par la compagnie Open Skies de British Airway entre Paris Orly et l'aeroport Schipol d'Amsterdam. El efecto del Acuerdo de Cielos abiertos entre la UE y EE.UU. y el resultado de la Iniciativa de Cielos abiertos de British Airways: numero de pasajeros en Londres, Amsterdam y Paris Resumen El advenimiento del Acuerdo de Cielos abiertos entre la EU y EE.UU. era algo ampliamente esperado. Se han pronosticado muchas consecuencias, por ejemplo, los efectos sobre las tarifas, los volumenes de pasajeros, las opciones y el bienestar de los consumidores. Tambien se ha pronosticado la caida de los costes de las aerolineas debido a una mayor competitividad y el incremento de la cooperacion entre las aerolineas. En el corto periodo de implantacion del Acuerdo, es relativamente facil evaluar los cambios que se han dado en el lado de la oferta, sin embargo, es mas dificil realizar estimaciones mayores. Este trabajo indica que se necesitan datos para realizar estas estimaciones y hace referencia a algunas dificultades metodologicas. Los primeros estimativos del efecto sobre los numeros de pasajeros se han obtenido mediante analisis de series de tiempo centrados en los aeropuertos de Londres, en particular, el de Heathrow, y en los aeropuertos atendidos por la Aerolinea de Cielos abiertos de British Airways de Orly, en Paris, y Schipol, en Amsterdam.

It is shown that this model can reproduce the observed cyclical patterns of wages and the skill-premium. The feature of capital-skill complementarity coupled with variable capital utilization rates does not come at odds with the acyclical behavior of the skill-premium. The paper argues that the skill-complementarity of capital is not a quantitatively significant factor at high frequencies. The key aspects are the contracts and the capital utilization margin.

If the government cannot distinguish between the return from capital and the return from entrepreneurial labor, then there will be positive capital income taxation, even in the long run. This happens because the only way to tax entrepreneurial labor is by also taxing capital. Furthermore, under fairly general conditions, the optimal tax on observable labor income is higher than the capital tax, although both are strictly positive. Thus, even though both income taxes are positive, imposing uniform income taxation would lead to additional distortions in the economy.","Univ Catolica Portuguesa, FCEE Palma de Cima, P-1649023 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Catolica Portuguesa,"Reis, C (通讯作者)，Univ Catolica Portuguesa, FCEE Palma de Cima, P-1649023 Lisbon, Portugal.",creis@fcee.ucp.pt,,"Reis, Catarina/0000-0002-6138-6790",,,,,7,12,12,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

The basic framework is a dynamic Roy model in which a worker possesses two distinct skills that can be augmented by learning by doing. There are different implicit prices, in different countries and different rates of skill accumulation. Our analysis contributes to the literature on the selection of immigrants and return migrants by offering a richer framework that may help to accommodate selection of emigrants and return migrants that are not immediately compatible with the one-dimensional skill model. Our analysis also has implications for the debate on brain drain and brain gain. In the two skills model presented here, return migration can lead to a mitigation of the brain drain, or even the creation of a brain gain, where those who return bring the home country augmented local skills.

The paper exploits the very long German socio-economic panel of around 15000 people. Using the prospective study methodology, it finds that happier people contribute more to social capital. Both parametric and nonparametric results suggest that there exists an inverted-U shape relationship between happiness to social capital. Moreover, optimism appears to be an important channel through which happiness is linked to social capital. The paper also presents residual happiness as a measure of optimism which might be a valuable tool for empirical researchers.

In the present field study we carried out a telephone survey with 1,003 respondents all over Austria. Instead of measuring selfishness indirectly by using more or less 'objective indicators' for self-interest, we requested that respondents directly assess whether they expect to be affected by policy measures. Our results indicate that subjectively measured self-interest explains attitudes toward economic policies at least as well as ideological conviction. In some cases ideology appears to determine whether people feel affected by a proposed policy measure.

Ignorance of this vital issue over a sustained period has led to negative impacts on economies and on central banking and monetary policy effectiveness. Data from developing countries and economies in transition show that central bank losses have reached significant magnitudes. Engaging in quasi-fiscal activities is responsible for most such losses because it increases central banks' expenditures. The main features of these fiscal activities are their large size and riskiness, and they are difficult to control. Central bank revenues can also be negatively affected because of declines in inflation rates and in the demand for money.","Univ Sharjah, Dept Econ, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates",University of Sharjah,"Sweidan, OD (通讯作者)，Univ Sharjah, Dept Econ, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.",,,"Sweidan, Osama/0000-0003-4503-5883",,,,,30,4,5,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

The reason proves to be a stochastic trend common to the European interest and the euro/dollar rate, which is explained by central bank reactions and unfinished learning processes on the role of the euro.

We formulate and study a microeconomic model of knowledge creation, through the interactions among a group of heterogeneous research and development (R&D) workers, embedded in a growth model to address this question. The composition of the research work force in terms of knowledge heterogeneity, in addition to its size, matters in determining the production of new knowledge. Moreover, the heterogeneity of the work force is endogenous. Income to these workers accrues as patent income, whereas transmission of newly created knowledge to all such workers occurs due to public transmission of patent information.

In the model, overconfident individuals overreact to their information about future inflation, which causes greater overshooting in the forward rate than in the spot rate. Thus, when agents observe a signal of higher future inflation, the consequent rise in the forward premium predicts a subsequent downward correction of the spot rate. The model can explain the magnitude of the forward premium bias and several other stylized facts related to the joint behaviour of forward and spot exchange rates. Our approach is also consistent with the availability of profitable carry trade strategies.","[Burnside, Craig] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Han, Bing] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Hirshleifer, David] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA USA; [Wang, Tracy Yue] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",Duke University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Burnside, C (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",,"Hirshleifer, David/E-4342-2012","Hirshleifer, David/0000-0003-0280-8882; Burnside, Craig/0000-0001-9843-6053",,,,,74,49,62,0,53,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The bank collects deposits from households and makes loans to entrepreneurs, in both countries. It has to finance a fraction of loans using equity. We investigate how such a bank capital requirement affects the international transmission of productivity and loan default shocks. Three findings emerge. First, the bank's capital requirement has little effect on the international transmission of productivity shocks. Second, the contribution of loan default shocks to business cycle fluctuations is negligible under normal economic conditions. Third, an exceptionally large loan loss originating in one country induces a sizeable and simultaneous decline in economic activity in both countries. This is particularly noteworthy, as the 2007-09 global financial crisis was characterized by large credit losses in the US and a simultaneous sharp output reduction in the US and the Euro Area. Our results thus suggest that global banks may have played an important role in the international transmission of the crisis. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The combination of these effects produces that aggregate welfare in equilibrium (or ex ante welfare) displays an inverted U-shape as a function of the borrowing limit.

It is suggested that important aspects of the current situation appear 'unsustainable'-increasing uncertainty and raising methodological difficulties for any assessment of likely future developments. It is argued that the dynamics of oil prices during the 2002-9 cycle reflected great uncertainty about future 'fundamentals' as well as the absence of previously anticipated stabilizing feedbacks from supply, from demand, or from policy. It is suggested that damaging oil-price swings could be moderated by better policy, though probably not by financial regulation. In the longer term, the uncertainties remain very great, especially since the tensions between a realist view of likely energy-market developments and the imperatives of the climate change agenda remain unresolved.

We find local companies to be more leveraged than MNCs, mainly explained by use of intra group equity financing, lower investment intensity and higher profit retention of the latter. However, MNCs appear to have had better access to external finance, resulting in their competitive advantage over local companies, especially in periods characterised by significant credit constraints. In contrast, local companies appear to have started to increase their leverage under relaxed credit constraints during the years of economic boom, demonstrating local companies' greater vulnerability to adverse cyclical effects.","[Avarmaa, Mari; Hazak, Aaro; Maennasoo, Kadri] Tallinn Univ Technol, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,"Avarmaa, M (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, Akad Tee 3, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia.",mari.avarmaa@nordea.com; aaro.hazak@tseba.ttu.ee; kadri.mannasoo@tseba.ttu.ee,"Hazak, Aaro/AAA-9502-2020; Avarmaa, Mari/J-1128-2018","Hazak, Aaro/0000-0003-2897-0554; Mannasoo, Kadri/0000-0002-3011-168X; Avarmaa, Mari/0000-0002-1846-1185",,,,,49,13,14,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1406-099X,2334-4385,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

We find that even though the motive for using RPM is thus anti-competitive, market forces may limit the overall adverse impact on consumers. Indeed, we find that when there are a large number of firms in the market, consumer welfare under a laissez-faire policy might be as high or almost as high as it would be under an alternative policy in which RPM is banned. Government interventions that put an upper limit on the extent of industry-wide adoption of RPM can have adverse welfare effects in the model.

The objective of this paper is to assess the effects of CAP trends on the montado/dehesa traditional ecosystem of Mediterranean regions in terms of farm income, land, labour and capital. A positive mathematical supply model disaggregated by the montado agro-forestry production systems of the Alentejo region in southern Portugal is developed. The results show that decoupling payments of CAP have negative economic effects on agricultural activities and resource use. Agricultural income increases with single farm payments but the foreseen increases in prices do not compensate the loss of the Agenda 2000 area payments in terms of competitiveness. These results reinforce the need to promote alternative agricultural and non-agricultural activities and policies in Mediterranean rural European areas and regions.

In doing so, it tests the effect of several dimensions of governance on the growth of 84 low and middle-income economies using regression specifications common in the growth literature. The empirical results show that political stability and government effectiveness is significantly positively correlated with growth. Voice and accountability and corruption are statistically significantly negatively correlated with growth. The regulatory quality and rule of law dimensions of governance are negatively but statistically insignificantly correlated with growth. The findings of this study imply that the dynamics of the current modern economy makes it necessary for developing countries to act now and within their own country, improve the dimensions of governance and establish good governance practices that are domestically relevant and internationally comparable and consistent.","Univ Bahrain, Dept Econ & Finance, Isa Town, Bahrain",University of Bahrain,"Gani, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bahrain, Dept Econ & Finance, Isa Town, Bahrain.",,"Gani, Azmat/AAY-3411-2020",,,,,,59,51,61,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The first best capacity is a non-monotonic function of water inflows, which provides a rationale for the observed differences in reservoirs sizes across hydropower systems around the world. The monopoly solution is qualitatively similar to the first best outcome, and the privatization of hydroelectric power generation systems does not always imply a social welfare loss.

I then turn to the way that the theory of the firm is treated in Daniel Spulber's book The Theory of the Firm: Microeconomics with Endogenous Entrepreneurs, Firms, Markets, and Organizations. Spulber's goal is to explain why firms exist, how they are established, and what they contribute to the economy. To accomplish this, Spulber defines a firm to be a transaction institution whose objectives differ from those of its owners. For Spulber, this separation is the key difference between the firm and direct exchange between consumers. I raise questions about whether this is a useful basis for a theory of the firm.

A novel feature with this paper is the use of g-prior in the BVAR models to alleviate poor estimation of drift parameters of Traditional BVAR models. Some results are as follows: (1) In the Quasi-Bayesian framework, BVAR models with Normal-Wishart prior provide the most accurate forecasts of Australian inflation; (2) Generally in the parsimonious models, the BVAR with g-prior performs better than BVAR with Litterman's prior; (3) In simulated data, the BVAR model with g-prior produces more accurate forecasts of driftless variable in the long-run horizons (first and second year forecast horizons).","Urmia Univ, Dept Econ, Orumiyeh, Iran",Urmia University,"Heidari, H (通讯作者)，Urmia Univ, Dept Econ, POB 165, Orumiyeh, Iran.",h.heidari@urmia.ac.ir,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,11,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Using a new database on both pre-colonial and colonial contexts, this paper gives evidence that Europeans tended to settle in more prosperous pre-colonial areas and that the European settlement had a strong positive impact on current outcomes, even in an extractive colonial context, resulting in a positive relationship between pre- and post-colonial performances. I argue that the African hostility towards colonial power to colonisation provides a random variation in European settlement since it damaged the profitability of colonial activities and dissuaded Europeans from settling, but does not have a direct effect on current outcomes. Rich and hostile areas received less European settlers than they would have received had they not been so hostile, resulting in lower current performances partly due to lower colonial investments. Despite the absence of a 'reversal of fortune' within former French West Africa, some of the most prosperous pre-colonial areas lost their advantage because of their hostility: other areas caught up and became the new leaders in the region.","Sci Po, Dept Econ, F-75007 Paris, France",Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po),"Huillery, E (通讯作者)，Sci Po, Dept Econ, 28 Rue St Peres, F-75007 Paris, France.",elise.huillery@sciences-po.fr,,,,,,,29,39,50,1,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The traditional theory on demand for international reserves assigns a pivotal role to imports. However, in a currency union part of imports are settled in the common currency, leaving no incentive for keeping foreign reserves. Moreover, the pooling of the demand for reserves in the currency union and an increasing role of a currency as an international reserve currency may also influence, among other things, the union demand for reserves. Based on estimated demand functions for reserves it is shown that the Economic and Monetary Union has reduced the demand for reserves substantially. It is argued that an enlargement with new member countries of the European Union will result in further savings of reserves. A simple calculation at the end of the paper illustrates the welfare gain associated with the reduced need of reserves in the Economic and Monetary Union.","[Kvedaras, Virmantas] Vilnius State Univ, Fac Math & Informat, Dept Econometr Anal, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Hansen, Jorgen Drud] Aalborg Univ, Aalborg, Denmark; [Hansen, Jorgen Drud] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus Sch Business, Aarhus, Denmark; [King, Roswitha M.] Ostfold Univ Coll, Halden, Norway; [Kvedaras, Virmantas] Vilnius Management Sch, Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University; Aalborg University; Aarhus University; Ostfold University College,"Kvedaras, V (通讯作者)，Vilnius State Univ, Fac Math & Informat, Dept Econometr Anal, Vilnius, Lithuania.",jorgendrud.hansen@gmail.com; roswitha.king@hiof.no; virmantas.kvedaras@mif.vu.lt,,,,,,,23,1,3,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

As the US and other economies have grown, the carrying capacity of the planet-in regard to natural resources and environmental-quality-has become a greater concern, particularly for common-property and open-access resources. The focus of this article is on some important, unsettled problems of the commons. Within the realm of natural resources, there are special challenges associated with renewable resources, which are frequently characterized by open-access. An important example is the degradation of open-access fisheries. Critical commons problems are also associated with environmental quality. A key contribution of economics has been the development of market-based approaches to environmental protection. These instruments are key to addressing the ultimate commons problem of the twenty-first century-global climate change.

As a result, it has become one of the centrally explored issues in macroeconomics, and several theories have been proposed to explain the existence of high unemployment rates. Traditional theories describe movements of unemployment as fluctuations around a natural rate. However, theories that rely on a natural rate of unemployment have been challenged by hysteresis theories. According to hysteresis theories, all shocks have permanent effects on the level of unemployment. This paper tests hysteresis effects in unemployment using panel data for 23 OECD countries covering the period 1963 - 2007. The paper applies both a univariate time series and a panel data unit root test with and without a structural break to test for unemployment hysteresis in OECD countries against the alternative of a natural rate. The results point to the rejection of the hysteresis hypothesis for the OECD and are compatible with structuralist theories as described by the structuralist view.","[Akay, Hulya Kanalici; Nargelecekenler, Mehmet; Yilmaz, Feridun] Uludag Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Econ, TR-16059 Gorukle, Turkey",Uludag University,"Akay, HK (通讯作者)，Uludag Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Econ, TR-16059 Gorukle, Turkey.",hulyakanalici@uludag.edu.tr; mnargele@uludag.edu.tr; fyilmaz@uludag.edu.tr,"Akay, Hulya Kanalici/AAG-8552-2021; Yılmaz, Feridun/AAG-6238-2021","Akay, Hulya Kanalici/0000-0001-5979-3277; Yilmaz, Feridun/0000-0003-2134-5705",,,,,73,6,6,0,18,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

Empirical results from the bounds test indicate that there exists no long-run relationship between government expenditure and output in Nigeria. In addition, Toda and Yamamoto's (1995) causality test results show that Wagner's law does not hold for more than the period being tested.

Using a four-step procedure: unit root test, co-integration test, Granger causality and innovation accounting techniques, we find that (i) interest rates, credits and the nominal exchange rate do not Granger-cause inflation individually; however, they do with nominal M1 money supply jointly at lag two; (ii) the nominal effective exchange rate is the most important pass-through to inflation statistically, accounting for approximately 11% of forecast error variance after four years; (iii) credits and nominal M1 have very small portions in explaining variations in the total variance of inflation; and (iv) the nominal interest rate is the weakest but statistically significant channel to inflation in the long run.

The pioneering works of Newman and Kenworthy suggest that many of these emissions could be avoidable, since they result from city densities and the share of road traffic in urban transport. However, implementing a change raises difficult questions. The respective roles of transport and land use policies are controversial. There is an intense debate about priorities between proponents of vehicle efficiency improvements, advocates of abrupt changes in mobility behaviours, and heralds of public transport. In Europe, the sustainable city is generally seen as the inversion of the urban sprawl process, coupled with the densification of inner suburbs thanks to new public transport infrastructure. Our analysis provides an argument in favour of this scenario, by noting that cost-benefit assessments of these projects should take into account the benefits of induced changes in urban densities, even for marginal extensions. But all factors impacting urban sprawl must also be properly valued. A stylised example of the model shows that the view a single pre-determined type of post-carbon city is thus far too simplistic.","Minist Ecol, Econ Council Sustainable Dev, Paris, France",,"Bureau, D (通讯作者)，Minist Ecol, Econ Council Sustainable Dev, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,15,1,1,1,36,DE BOECK UNIVERSITE,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

The results suggest that the contribution of the noneconomic factors is generally higher for 'housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels', 'health', 'communication' and 'education'; hence, they have an important role to play in these sectors.

Moreover, PIGS, in spite of their economic frailties, have tied to emulate the fiscal behavior of their more prosperous Eurozone partners instead of executing more rigorous policies.","[Costa Fernandes, Abel L.; Mota, Paulo R.] Univ Porto, Fac Econ Porto, Oporto, Portugal; [Costa Fernandes, Abel L.; Mota, Paulo R.] Univ Porto, NIFIP, Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto,"Fernandes, ALC (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Fac Econ Porto, Oporto, Portugal.",abelf@fep.up.pt; mpaulo@fep.up.pt,"Mota, Paulo/AAG-2886-2019","Mota, Paulo/0000-0001-7028-4545",,,,,28,13,14,0,24,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2011,58.0,5,,,SI,,631,649,,10.2298/PAN1105631F,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,877OY,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299193000005,0

Albert Saiz (2010) concentrates on identifying the impact of natural geographic constraints. Saiz creates measures of developable land using an invariant 50-kilometer radius about an urban focal point. I criticize Saiz's geographical constraint on the basis that its invariant radius renders comparisons between urban areas of differing sizes of questionable value. Moreover, the inter-relation between the two kinds of constraints-the natural and the regulatory-is highly particular to the locale; for example, the effect of a natural geographical constraint would be neutralized by an interior regulatory constraint such as an urban growth boundary. Haifang Huang and Yao Tang (2010) concentrate on the impact of regulatory constraints on booms and busts in local housing markets, but they also make use of the natural-constraint data furnished by Saiz. Both studies also use the Wharton Land Use Regulatory Index, about which I raise a number of questions. I believe that the procedures employed by the two papers have the tendency to understate, at the aggregate level, the pernicious impact of regulatory restrictions.","[Cox, Wendell] Demographia, Belleville, IL 62222 USA",,"Cox, W (通讯作者)，Conservatoire Natl Arts & Metiers, Paris, France.",demographia2@earthlink.net,,,,,,,11,10,10,0,8,INST SPONTANEOUS ORDER ECONOMICS,FAIRFAX,"9745 KINGS CROWN COURT #102, FAIRFAX, VA 22031 USA",1933-527X,,,ECON J WATCH,Econ.

This claim is inconsistent with national representative data from Lesotho, Zimbabwe, and Swaziland which reveals that a significant proportion of HIV infections occurred in adolescents who claim to be virgins. Two explanations for this observation have been proposed: adolescents misreport sexual status or non-sexual risks are more prevalent than previously asserted. This paper empirically uncovers the implicit assumptions underlying this discussion, by estimating the proportion of sexually transmitted HIV infections assuming that misreporting is irrelevant, and the proportion of misreporting necessary to conclude that HIV is predominantly sexually transmitted. It shows that under the no-misreporting assumption, 70% of HIV cases in the respective sample of unmarried adolescent women is not due to sexual transmission. The assumption that HIV is predominantly sexually transmitted is valid only if more than 55% of unmarried adolescent women who are sexually active have misreported sexual activity status. This research is designed to gain better understanding on the importance of different transmission modes. This is important to design combination prevention to achieve maximum impact on HIV prevention.","Swiss Inst Empir Econ Res, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland",,"Deuchert, E (通讯作者)，Swiss Inst Empir Econ Res, Varnbuelstr 14, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",eva.deuchert@unisg.ch,"Deuchert, Eva/IXD-1412-2023",,,,,,58,3,3,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The tourists who are participating can travel to domestic destinations only, abroad destinations only or to both of them. Such a substitution pattern is modelled using a bivariate probit model. The analysis is carried out to the regional level using a survey conducted in 15 European (EU-15) countries. In addition to the traditional socioeconomic variables, the analysis adds new variables to the outbound tourism demand modelling, such as the attributes of the place of residence. The results show that tourism demand is income elastic. However, there are marked differences in the income elasticities of the probabilities of travelling domestically or abroad. Above certain income threshold, the substitution pattern between destinations takes part. The probability of travelling domestically only remains constant, whereas the probability of travelling abroad keeps growing. Additionally, the article proves that income elasticities vary significantly and nonlinearly with income.","[Eugenio-Martin, Juan L.] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Dept Anal Econ Aplicado, Tafira Baja 35017, Las Palmas, Spain; [Eugenio-Martin, Juan L.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England; [Campos-Soria, Juan A.] Univ Malaga, Dept Econ Aplicada Estruct Econ, Malaga 29013, Spain",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; University of Cambridge; Universidad de Malaga,"Eugenio-Martin, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Dept Anal Econ Aplicado, C Saulo Toron S-N, Tafira Baja 35017, Las Palmas, Spain.",jleugenio@daea.ulpgc.es,"Eugenio-Martin, Juan Luis/L-3005-2014; SORIA, JUAN ANTONIO CAMPOS/L-1574-2018","Eugenio-Martin, Juan Luis/0000-0002-2444-3338;",,,,,22,58,62,2,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It is found that the analysed population of companies is dominated by euro-enthusiasts, who are aware of the opportunities and risks related to the euro area accession. Neutralisation of the risks associated with entering to the euro zone and enterprise ability to take full advantage of it should be supported by deliberate economic policy actions taken by the government.

A regional competition is a dynamic process, where the inflow of FDI could be considered as the key indicator of the transformation process of the Czech regions and their regional competitiveness. The second goal of the paper is an analyse of the regional development processes, which are partly under influence of foreign direct investments, transnational companies and trends of global economic development. From a geographical view, we can specify two different processes in the inflow of foreign direct investments into Czech regions. In the first half of the nineties was more important the horizontal position of regions (except Prague), more investors came to border regions, especially on the Czech-German border. Secondly, in the period after the Year 2000, importance of hierarchical position of cities and regional socioeconomic factors for the investments location is growing. Especially qualitative oriented foreign direct investments more prefer regions with greater cities, where high innovative potential is going up. We can say, that regional differentiations in inflow of foreign direct investments are able to increase polarisation tendencies within the Czech Republic. Globalization tendencies have made the new economic space where foreign investors are seeking new markets or specific localization factors. Theory of learning regions or industrial districts emphasise the importance of regional intercompany networks and spatial proximity of innovative and flexible firms. It is obvious that strategic development of the Czech regions should be based on firm networks that will integrate regional economy into a complex interregional and global production chains.","[Hlavacek, Petr; Koutsky, Jaroslav] Univ JE Purkyne Usti Nad Labem, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Dept Reg & Local Dev, Usti Nad Labem 40096, Czech Republic",University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,,petr.hlavacek@ujep.cz; jaroslav.koutsky@ujep.cz,"Hlavacek, Petr/A-4971-2018; Koutsky, Jaroslav/S-8495-2017","Hlavacek, Petr/0000-0002-3922-5739;",,,,,19,9,9,0,7,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-755-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,186,194,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT98,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300261200021,0

By assuming that the R&D sector is more skilled labor intensive than the consumption goods sector, we extend the model of Doi and Mino (J Econ Dyn Control 32:3055-3083, 2008) so that both the skilled and unskilled labor supplies are endogenously determined through the skill acquisition process. We show that some results of Doi and Mino are influenced by our modification. For example, in contrast to Doi and Mino who show that the R&D subsidy can have a negative growth effect in the presence of consumption externalities, we show that the R&D subsidy has unambiguously positive growth effects, regardless of the presence of consumption externalities. Further, it is shown that the presence of consumption externalities influences various aspects of the economy including the wage inequality and the incentive of skill acquisition.","Hitotsubashi Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Tokyo 1868601, Japan",Hitotsubashi University,"Hori, T (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 2-1 Naka, Tokyo 1868601, Japan.",t-hori@econ.hit-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,19,2,3,0,9,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,,,J ECON,J.

We conclude that property crimes, violence crimes and sex crimes are countercyclical. The reverse is true for both alcohol/drug-related crimes and economic crimes, because there is a highly significant increase of these types of crime during economic expansions.","Karlstad Univ, Dept Econ, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden",Karlstad University,"Krüger, NA (通讯作者)，Karlstad Univ, Dept Econ, Univ Gatan 2, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden.",niclas.kruger@kau.se,,,,,,,10,6,7,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The analysis is redone with quarterly data from 1947 to 2008. To account for the influence of omitted variables, BD-RTPLS produces a separate dGPP/dG estimate for every observation in the data set.

This system contains a number of factors (some random) determining the set of bilateral combinations of teams that play each other on an extra occasion during the course of the season, not least of all maximising attendances. While the status quo may be unavoidable to some extent (it is also a bone of contention to many fans), its implications for within-season measures of competitive balance are nonetheless obvious. This is because of the potential for biases being created in the end-of-season league table as a result of the unbalanced schedule. This paper uses a modified model to correct for this inherent bias over the seasons 1997-2008, and the results are discussed in detail. The model is also generalisable to many unbalanced schedule designs observed in professional sports leagues worldwide. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

While currently Russia and the former Soviet Union outperform China as the key economic partners for Central Asia, there is a clear trend towards an increase in economic links to China. Finally, we find that Central Asian states are pro-active in creating new economic links in Eurasia: the role of Kazakhstan, in particular, should be noted from this perspective.","[Libman, Alexander] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Frankfurt, Germany; [Libman, Alexander] Russian Acad Sci, Moscow, Russia; [Vinokurov, Evgeny] Eurasian Dev Bank, Ctr Integrat Studies, St Petersburg, Russia",Frankfurt School Finance & Management; Russian Academy of Sciences,"Libman, A (通讯作者)，Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Frankfurt, Germany.",a.libman@fs.de,"Vinokurov, Evgeny/F-1668-2014","Vinokurov, Evgeny/0000-0002-9584-3494; Libman, Alexander/0000-0001-8504-3007",,,,,33,9,9,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2011,23.0,4,,,,,469,492,,10.1080/14631377.2011.623392,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,883HL,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299624800004,0

The paper explains the relation of a degree of risk expressed by the classical information measure, bit, by the concept of confidence intervals, or possibly by the standard deviation. When making decisions, the manager is interested not only in the quantitatively expressed value of risk scene with the use of forecasting models, but mainly in the impact of decrease/increase of decision-making risk expressed by the effect, i.e. profit/loss caused by such a decision to achieve targets. A method of decision effect calculation is proposed which is derived from the information entropy change and the change in risk scene in managerial decision-making. Forecasting models are applied which are based on an expert estimate and a statistical theory; and the risk scenes are assessed in forecasting models based on neural networks.","[Marcek, Dusan] Univ Zilina, Dept Macro & Micro Econ, Zilina 01026, Slovakia; [Marcek, Dusan; Marcek, Milan] Silesian Univ, Fac Philosophy & Sci, Opava 74601, Czech Republic; [Frano, Michal] CEF Inc, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",University of Zilina; Silesian University Opava,"Marcek, D (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Dept Macro & Micro Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",dusan.marcek@fri.uniza.sk; michal_frano@yahoo.com; marcek.milan@zoznam.sk,,"Marcek, Dusan/0000-0001-9432-8063",,,,,40,0,0,0,8,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

Results indicate: (i) the US beef supply chain experienced a significant structural change in late 1996 and early 1997 that may be attributed to a weather induced production shock and an apparent turnaround of the cattle cycle; (ii) contemporaneous causalities appear to be stronger and dynamic causalities appear to be weaker after the structural change, suggesting faster and more effective information transmission along the supply chain after the structural change; (iii) contemporaneous information appears to flow from upstream to downstream tiers in the supply chain before the structural break, which reverses after the structural break, suggesting a shift in control from upstream to downstream firms; and (iv) co-use of spot market and contracts to procure strategic inputs by processors appears to allow processors some control of spot price through contract purchases in the post-break period.

A representative sample of 1435 respondents from the Danish population answered the discrete choice experiment in a web-based questionnaire with a random split including/excluding the cost attribute. The two groups were asked to make both forced and unforced choices in each choice set. Our results show that in the unforced choice utility and scale parameters were not affected and the rank order remained the same when a cost attribute was included. In the forced choice the test of equal utility parameters was rejected, and rank order, marginal rates of substitution, and variance was shown to differ between the two groups. We observed that the inclusion of a cost attribute tended to change underlying choice behaviour.

In doing so, the paper calls attention to the developmental interplay between the propensities of human nature in Smith's thought. First, it argues that at the start of Wealth of Nations Smith signals that human nature is not fixed. Second, it connects this evidence with an infamous passage on infanticide in The Theory of Moral Sentiments in order to argue that Smith is committed to a thin group selection of institutions. Third, it argues that in Considerations Concerning the First Formation of Languages one can find building blocks for the claim that mind and language co-develop over time. It claims that in TMS there is a distinction between natural sentiments and moral sentiments.

The results suggest using the method of partial concurrent adjustment, which is based on the identification of the ARIMA model and of the deterministic components once a year, whereas the updating of the corresponding coefficients is undertaken every month.","Monetary & Financial Stat Div, I-00184 Rome, Italy",,"Silvestrini, A (通讯作者)，Monetary & Financial Stat Div, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",andrea.silvestrini@bancaditalia.it,"Silvestrini, Andrea/B-3410-2009",,,,,,7,0,0,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Starting from the premise that FDI plays a crucial role for technological catching up in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) via technology and knowledge transfer, this article assesses the role played by IPR regimes as a factor for corporate governance and control of foreign-invested subsidiaries, for their own technological activity, their trade relationships, and networking for technological activity. As a specific novelty to the literature, the influence of the strength of IPR regimes on corporate control of subsidiaries is analysed. The results suggest that IPR-sensitive foreign investment tends to have lower functional autonomy, tends to cooperate more intensively within its transnational network and is still technologically more active than less IPR-sensitive subsidiaries.","[Stephan, Johannes] Halle Inst Econ Res IWH, Freiberg, Germany; [Stephan, Johannes] Tech Univ Freiberg, Freiberg, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH); Technical University Freiberg,"Stephan, J (通讯作者)，Halle Inst Econ Res IWH, Freiberg, Germany.",Johannes.Stephan@vwl.tu-freiberg.de,"Stephan, Johannes Florian/ABN-2430-2022","Stephan, Johannes Florian/0000-0003-3619-2537",,,,,45,3,3,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2011,23.0,1,,,,,35,53,PII 933578712,10.1080/14631377.2011.546973,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,723GF,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287493900003,0

It also examines whether contagion occurred in Saudi Arabia (large country) after the 1987 US stock market crash and the 1997 Thai exchange rate devaluation and whether these contagion shocks spillover to smaller countries of the region. Spillovers are likely to occur among interdependent countries within the same geographical region. Tests based on correlation coefficients, ARCH/GARCH estimates and direct change (generalized least squares regression) propagation effects indicate that contagion from the US stock market crash and the Thai devaluation occurred in Saudi Arabia, and these external shocks were propagated to smaller GCC countries. This suggests that GCC countries are likely to mitigate such propagations through economic integration. Thus, the idea of GCC formation may help insulate Gulf economies against crisis propagation.","Univ Sharjah, Coll Business, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates",University of Sharjah,"Suliman, O (通讯作者)，Univ Sharjah, Coll Business, M5, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.",osman.suliman@millersville.edu,,,,,,,30,4,7,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

In our model, the government can provide funds to the young faced with liquidity constraints. Our theoretical findings are as follows: (1) with exogenous technical progress, liquidity constraints on households raise the saving rate; (2) with endogenous technical progress, liquidity constraints and economic growth rate show an inverted U-shaped relationship; (3) with both exogenous and endogenous technical progress, the steady state per capita income first increases and then declines with the increase of liquidity constraints. Our empirical analysis with cross-country data supported this conclusion; (4) given certain values of the model parameters, social welfare in steady state may decrease with the reduction of liquidity constraints.","[Sun, Wenkai; Wang, Xianghong] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Sun, WK (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Room 837,Mingde Main Bldg, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",sunwk_r@126.com; shwang06g@gmail.com,,,,,,,20,0,0,1,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1226-508X,,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

In applying the revised Lotka-Volterra equations, this study analyses the dynamic competitive relationship among producers of 26-, 32- and 37-inch LCD TVs. Equilibrium analysis is used to evaluate whether future shipment orbit could converge to equilibrium status. The prediction abilities of Bass growth model and Lotka-Volterra model are further compared to examine whether the Lotka-Volterra model, which incorporates the mutualism among multi-generation LCD TVs, performs better. The result shows that the relationships between 26- and 32-inch LCD TVs, and 37- and 32-inch LCD TVs are commensal. Sales of 32-inch LCD TVs are promoted by increased sales of 26- or 37-inch LCD TVs. Results of the equilibrium analysis indicate that competition among various sizes of LCD TVs will not be stable. The interactions among multiple generations of LCD TVs will influence each other, leading to great fluctuations in sales. Since this study incorporates the interactive relationships among various sizes of LCD TVs in the proposed Lotka-Volterra equations, the ability of the Lotka-Volterra model to predict the market evolution of LCD TVs is superior to that of the Bass model.","[Tsai, Bi-Huei] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Management Sci, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan; [Li, Yiming] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan",National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,"Tsai, BH (通讯作者)，Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Management Sci, 1001 Ta Hsueh Rd, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.",bhtsai@faculty.nctu.edu.tw,"Li, Yiming/I-3442-2013",,,,,,22,7,7,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, many taxpayers who are eligible for more than one tax-based aid program, and who are limited to one program per student each year, fail to select the single program that offers the largest reduction in taxes. Analyzing a panel dataset of individual income tax returns, I find that in roughly one out of four returns taxpayers and paid preparers fail to select the tax-minimizing tax-based aid program. I find evidence that greater salience of federal tax effects, and inertia in program selection, leads some taxpayers and paid preparers to make non-tax-minimizing selections. Streamlining the set of tax-based aid programs into a single tax incentive is likely to be a more effective way of lowering the costs of postsecondary attendance for students and their families.",,,,Nicholas.Turner@do.treas.gov,,,,,,,29,6,7,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Credit card usage has an increasing effect on inflation rates through time, requiring more policy emphasis on the credit channel through credit cards.

Simultaneously, while the onset of comorbidities has been deferred to older age groups, health-care expenditure has grown dramatically, primarily owing to the advancement of medical technology and the expansion of individual income levels, along with population ageing in the wake of increased longevity. However, the contribution of population ageing to health expenditure growth is subject to some theoretical and empirical scrutiny. This paper takes the question of ageing and health and health care to the data to evaluate the net impact of ageing. We focus on two main questions, namely the welfare valuation of longevity improvements for various OECD countries, along with the 'red herring' hypothesis which suggests that population ageing has a small and almost negligible impact on health-care expenditure. Our estimates lead us to suggest an average gain in longevity of 4.5 years since 1980, corresponding to about 13.5 per cent of lifetime income of a 20-year-old in 2000. Furthermore, we confirm a weak red-herring claim, that is, that population ageing accounts for only a 0.5 per cent annual growth rate of health-care expenditure. Finally, we find that the rise in longevity leads to a further demand for life-prolonging medical care.","[Felder, Stefan] Duisburg Essen Univ, Duisburg, Germany; [Breyer, Friedrich] Univ Konstanz, D-7750 Constance, Germany; [Breyer, Friedrich] DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Costa-Font, Joan] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England",University of Duisburg Essen; University of Konstanz; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Felder, S (通讯作者)，Duisburg Essen Univ, Duisburg, Germany.",friedrich.breyer@uni-konstanz.de; j.costa-font@lse.ac.uk; stefan.felder@uni-due.de,"Costa-i-Font, Joan/C-9609-2013","Costa-i-Font, Joan/0000-0001-7174-7919",,,,,53,71,83,3,56,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Pay adjustments are decomposed into three components: adjustments derived from external labor market comparisons, adjustments based on changes in firm and manager characteristics, and transitory adjustments. Panel regression models are used to test how pay adjustments affect subsequent firm performance. Evidence shows that the relation between pay adjustments and performance is related to performance measures, as different measures capture the incentive effect and managerial entrenchment effect in different ways. The relative strength of these two effects also explains the diverse impacts of the three adjustment components on firm performance.","Natl Cent Univ, Taipei, Taiwan",National Central University,"Chen, MY (通讯作者)，Natl Cent Univ, Taipei, Taiwan.",,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

The first objective is to review the historical evolution of the Gulf Corporation Council (GCC) sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) and to demonstrate how their conception and evolution was in fact an integral part of an overall prescription for the cyclical economic and fiscal imbalances of the oil-based GCC economies. The second objective is to review economic and political claims and arguments that have been developed to trim the tide and influence of the GCC SWFs in Western economies. Applying institutional and factual analyses, the paper provides counterarguments that rebut these claims and arguments. For a long time, advocates of globalization have argued its benefits to all parties. The experience of SWFs puts such claims to the test. In the meantime, however, GCC SWFs should open up a bit more and reveal their investments profiles showing both gains and losses. This should quell fears and convince skeptics that the GCC SWFs confidentiality practices are not hiding any threatening secrets. Finally; recent financial and global turmoil generated acceptance of SWFs in Western economies with policymakers touring the GCC to welcome more SWF flows into advanced economies. However, only time will tell if such Western policy gestures are sustainable in the end, or were merely temporary policy switches rendered under severe pressures from global and financial crises.","[El-Kharouf, Farouk] Global Strategy & Governance SA Switzerland, CH-1204 Geneva, Switzerland; [Al-Qudsi, Sulayman; Obeid, Shifa] Arab Bank Jordan, Amman 11196, Jordan",,"El-Kharouf, F (通讯作者)，Global Strategy & Governance SA Switzerland, Rue Neuve du Molard 5, CH-1204 Geneva, Switzerland.",felkharouf@gmail.com; Dr.Sulayman.AlQudsi@arabbank.com.jo; Shifa.Obeid@arabbank.com.jo,,,,,,,31,13,16,0,15,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

The paper begins by criticizing the most frequently used database for municipal population and offers an alternative source of the data, one that is homogenous for all the census years of the 20th century and the year 2001. It then examines the concept of city before finally opting for the Urban Area as proposed by the Ministry of Public Works in its Atlas de Areas Urbanas, which (in some cases) exceeds municipal boundaries. Starting from a generalization of the Pareto distribution, we carry out a formal statistical test of the Zipf's law.

We show that far-ahead forward inflation compensation in the U. S. exhibits substantial volatility, especially at low frequencies, and displays a highly significant degree of sensitivity to economic news. Similar patterns are evident in the UK prior to 1997, when the Bank of England was not independent, but have been strikingly absent since the Bank of England gained independence in 1997. Our findings are further supported by comparisons of dispersion in longer-run inflation expectations of professional forecasters and by evidence from Sweden, another inflation-targeting country with a relatively long history of inflation-indexed bonds. Our results support the view that an explicit and credible inflation target helps to anchor the private sector's views regarding the distribution of long-run inflation outcomes.

We answer this question by studying the effect on labour market participation of a Norwegian family policy programme that clearly has affected the incentives to participate in the labour market of mothers with small children. From January 1999, all parents with one-and two-year-old children who did not use publicly subsidised day-care became entitled to a benefit, 'Cash-for-Care' ('CFC'). The CFC reform has increased the price of publicly subsidised day-care relative to the price of own care. Economic theory of labour market participation postulates that the CFC reform would have a negative effect on labour market participation for the person most involved in childcare. The results show that the CFC reform has affected mothers' labour market participation negatively. The effects are much stronger for non-western immigrant mothers' than for native mothers. The results support the hypothesis that non-western immigrant mothers do react to changes in the relative prices of childcare and suggests that non-western female immigrants are quite responsive to changes in economic incentives.

It is found that an increase in memory length not only can destabilize the market price, resulting in oscillatory market price characterized by a Hopf bifurcation, but also can stabilize an otherwise unstable market price, leading to stability switching as the memory length increases. Numerical simulations show that the stochastic model is able to characterize long deviations of the market price from its fundamental price and excess volatility and generate most of the stylized facts observed in financial markets.

In the model, a firm's marginal cost is decreasing in managerial effort and is subject to an additive shock. Both managerial effort and the realization of the shock are a manager's private information. A firm first offers a menu of contract to its manager, and then competes in the product market. As in the model of single principal and single agent, the incentive contracts implement efforts that are distorted downward relative to full information. In this model, with multiple agency relationships, an additional source for upward distortion of effort emerges as a result of the interaction in the product market. The results are robust to whether firms compete in price or quantity.","Keio Univ, Tokyo 108, Japan",Keio University,"Ishibashi, K (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Tokyo 108, Japan.",,,,,,,,26,2,2,0,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1352-4739,1468-5876,,JPN ECON REV,Jpn.

However, any attempt to construct a satisfactory mapping of institutions to competitiveness is fraught with difficulties, including data consistencies, omission of causal factors and the lack of theoretical foundations. Some of these difficulties stem from differences in the overall objectives of the research literature and the development of competitiveness indices.

The game has multiple, Pareto-ranked equilibria: we find that whether first-round total investment reaches critical mass predicts convergence towards the Pareto optimal full-investment equilibrium. Moreover, first-round investments and equilibrium convergence vary with critical mass and group size in a complex way that is explicable by subtle effects of strategic uncertainty on decision making.

The second-best world is characterized by the comparative statics of green preferences. The main results obtained are as follows. First, the marginal cost of public funds may be reduced by the externalities, regardless of the choice of taxes. Second, optimal environmental and non-environmental tax rules are additively and directly affected by the dynamic efficiency of capital accumulation per unit labour (DECAL), and indirectly by it, through the efficiency of the public sector. Environmental taxes going beyond Pigovian ones may be welfare-improving if the DECAL is improved by the environmental tax. Even Optimal non-environmental tax rules should additively and directly counter the dynamics of pollution to consider the income effects of the optimal tax system for the future. Third, the additivity property, or the principle of targeting, does not hold even in the absence of incentive compatibility constraints. The essential reasons for this are clarified as follows: distortions that should be countered by taxes: that is, the income effects of the optimal tax system and the DECAL in this model, break the equality between optimal environmental taxes and the externalities measured by governments. Finally, growing environmental concerns may, in fact, increase pollution. The inverse relationship between environmental and labour income taxes may not hold. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Such regulation imposes regulatory incentives for particular choice quantities. Their strength varies between zero (laissez faire) and infinite (command economy). In the latter case, regulation effectively eliminates any intensive behavioral responses to taxes; a previously distortionary tax becomes a lump sum. For intermediate regulation (where some deviation is feasible), intensive behavioral responses are still weaker than under zero regulation, and so quantity regulation reduces elasticities, thereby facilitating subsequent taxation. I apply this mechanism to labor supply and present correlational evidence for this complementarity: hours worked in high-regulation countries are compressed, and these countries tax labor at higher rates.

Specifically, it shows how the pretrial efforts incurred by one party may alter its adversary's incentives to settle. We build a sequential game with one-sided asymmetric information where the informed party first decides to invest in case preparation, and the uninformed party then makes a settlement offer. Overinvestment, or bluff, always prevails in equilibrium: with positive probability, plaintiffs with weak cases take a chance on investing, and regret it in case of trial. Furthermore, due to the endogenous investment decision, the probability of trial may (locally) decrease with case strength.

The hypothesis is found to be fragile in the modified framework. Small variations in the elasticity of substitution between home and foreign traded goods (within the range of estimates suggested in the literature), for example, can make the effect of a traded-goods productivity improvement on the real exchange rate negative or positive, as well as small or large. This result provides a potential explanation of the mixed empirical results that have been obtained on the relationship between productivity and the real exchange rate.","[Choudhri, Ehsan U.] Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Schembri, Lawrence L.] Bank Canada, Int Dept, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada",Carleton University; Bank of Canada,"Choudhri, EU (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, 1125 Colonel Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",ehsan_choudhri@carleton.ca; LSchembri@bank-banque-canada.ca,,,,,,,23,17,20,1,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

The conditions in the paper are shown to be computationally straightforward and to yield set identification for certain features of the model. The ideas outlined are applied to a microeconomic panel dataset. The addition of habit formation to the discounted utility model is shown to improve the rationalizability of the microdata considerably. Even if habit formation is rejected, it is shown that modest and plausible allowance for heterogeneity in prices and interest rates is sufficient to bring consumption behaviour into line with the theory.","[Crawford, Ian] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford,"Crawford, I (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",,,,"ESRC [ES/H021221/1, ES/F015879/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1, RES-544-28-5001, ES/F015879/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,47,37,44,1,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

As documented in the literature, our results suggest that introducing real rigidities to the model increases risk premia. Nevertheless we that find that, in a world dominated by productivity shocks, increasing nominal rigidities reduces risk premia. Such rigidities only enhance risk premia when economic dynamics are mainly driven by monetary policy shocks.

A dual income tax with a positive marginal tax rate on not only labor income but also capital income is optimal. The positive tax on capital income serves to alleviate the distortions of the labor tax on human capital accumulation. The optimal marginal tax rate on capital income is lower than that on labor income if savings are elastic compared to investment in human capital, substitution between verifiable and non-verifiable inputs in human capital formation is difficult, and most investments in human capital are verifiable so that education subsidies can directly reduce the tax wedge on learning.

Consumers are subject to idiosyncratic employment shocks against which they cannot insure directly. The labour market has a Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides structure: firms enter by posting vacancies and match with workers bilaterally, with match probabilities given by an aggregate matching function. Wages are determined through Nash bargaining. We also consider aggregate productivity shocks and a complete set of contingent claims conditional on this risk. We use the model to evaluate a tax-financed unemployment insurance scheme. Higher insurance is beneficial for consumption smoothing, but because it raises workers' outside option value, it discourages firm entry. We find that the latter effect is more potent for welfare outcomes; we tabulate the effects quantitatively for different kinds of consumers. We also demonstrate that productivity changes in the model-in steady state as well as stochastic ones-generate rather limited unemployment effects, unless workers are close to indifferent between working and not working; thus, recent findings are corroborated in our more general setting.","[Krusell, Per] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Mukoyama, Toshihiko] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Sahin, Ayseguel] Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY USA",National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Virginia; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York,,,,,,,,,53,78,107,0,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Here, we explore how previous results change when we allow policy changes to be pre-announced and of finite duration and when these facts are anticipated by households and firms. Quantitatively we demonstrate a headstart advantage from pre-announcement that is never caught up by a surprising reform. The welfare gain stemming from a 5-year announcement phase of a corporate tax cut, for example, is estimated to be around 10 percent of the total gain from the reform. We show that impulse responses of important variables like firm value, dividends, and investment differ qualitatively depending on whether the reform comes expected or not. We are also able to demonstrate a genuine welfare gain from temporary tax cuts. Impulse responses generated by our numerical method can be retraced by phase diagram analysis, which facilitates explanation and interpretation of the produced results. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The latter is consistent with a signal effect - an increase in the income of others might make me jealous, but it also provides an information signal about my future prospects. When we use a single item indicator of job satisfaction we find no support for a status or signal effect; however, when we use a psychometrically valid instrument to measure job satisfaction, we find some support for the existence of a status effect. We consider the components of job satisfaction through which the status effect operates.

Since then great strides have been made to redress past social inequalities. However, analysis of these successes have been limited to national or provincial aggregates, when much of the responsibility for meeting the RDP commitment lies at the local government level. The need for closer investigation is nonetheless clear from continuing protests over poor service delivery. This paper aims to shed more light on delivery at a local level by using data from the 2001 Census and 2007 Community Survey. The analysis involves the construction of a service delivery index for each municipality and analysis of variance to explain the changes in service delivery over the period 2001-2007. The results show that improved service provision may require further urbanisation and densification. Also, local economic growth in itself may not be important, but it would contribute to the ability to pay for services and in that way aid delivery.

Real GDI combines changes in production (real GDP) with a trading gain derived from relative price changes. The paper considers two sources of trading gains: the terms of trade, and the real exchange rate. For OECD countries, the terms of trade is the more important price ratio, making a contribution to real income growth that is, on average, an order of magnitude larger than the real exchange rate. Over long time periods, the most important source of real income growth is changes in production. Over shorter time horizons, however, the trading gain can make noteworthy contributions. Changes in aggregates like real private consumption, or the relative economic performance of nations, are shown to be particularly dependent on the trading gain during the large swings in resource prices that occurred post-2002.","STAT Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada",Statistics Canada,"Macdonald, R (通讯作者)，STAT Canada, 18th Floor,RH Coates Bldg, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",Ryan.macdonald@statcan.gc.ca,,,,,,,28,6,6,0,6,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

We draw on the experience of the US in the 1930s to shed light on exit strategies-movements back to institutional conditions associated with steady-state growth, including stable inflation and broadly non-interventionist credit- and capital-market policies. We describe how policy responses to the deflation and banking crises of the 1930s coloured the exit policy debate after the Great Depression. We show that a full exit from the Great Depression, defined as the point at which interventionist credit- and capital-market policies and institutions were wound down did not occur in the 1930s. It took until the 1950s for this to occur and for the Federal Reserve to regain its independence and return unfettered to its longer-run objectives.","[Mitchener, Kris James] Santa Clara Univ, Hoover Inst, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA; [Mitchener, Kris James] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Mason, Joseph] Louisiana State Univ, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Mason, Joseph] Univ Penn Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA USA",Santa Clara University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; University of Pennsylvania,"Mitchener, KJ (通讯作者)，Santa Clara Univ, Hoover Inst, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA.",kmitchener@scu.edu; masonj@lsu.edu,,,,,,,65,10,10,1,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

The Dominican Republic is relatively better off than its neighbor; however, the shortage of basic services, poverty and malnutrition are quite prevalent in the Dominican Republic.

The tie is profitable because it shifts profits from a complementary good rival to the monopolist.

Product innovation projects go through multiple time consuming stages with several continuation/termination decisions. Hence. competitors can react to the threat before the new product is introduced and thereby may prevent or facilitate the product's introduction. We consider a duopoly model where Firm 1 can start a two-stage product innovation project for obtaining a horizontally and vertically differentiated product. In-between the two stages Firm 2 can react by making an investment that improves the competitive position of the current product. We find that under weak vertical differentiation Firm 2 wants Firm 1 to innovate. Horizontal differentiation softens competition and Firm 2 over-invests to induce Firm 1 to launch the new product. Second, under strong vertical differentiation Firm 1 starts the product innovation project - triggering under-investment by Firm 2 - but never finishes it. The under-investment makes Firm 2 a weaker competitor, which induces Firm 1 not to innovate. Third, under very strong vertical differentiation Firm 2 prevents a launch of the new product by over-investing. This results in a strong competitive position of Firm 2. It therefore captures such a big market share that Firm 1 will not introduce the new product. The situation of Firm 1 in the old market has worsened. The option to complete the innovation, created by initiating the first stage of the innovation project, has a negative value for Firm 1.

This paper investigates the possibility that trade partners with no common native language will overcome the language barrier by communicating in a non-native language. In today's world English is the leading candidate to play this role of a lingua franca. By constructing and then employing a new measure of English proficiency covering more than a hundred countries and spanning 30 years. we show that the ability to communicate in English has a strong effect in promoting trade across the globe. The results thus demonstrate that an acquired proficiency in English can mitigate the impact of historically determined language barriers. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We make this point using a dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin model-a combination of a static two-good, two-factor Heckscher-Ohlin trade model and a two-sector growth model-with infinitely lived consumers where international borrowing and lending are not permitted. We obtain two main results: First, countries that differ only in their initial endowments of capital per worker may converge or diverge in income levels over time, depending on the elasticity of substitution between traded goods. Divergence can occur for parameter values that would imply convergence in a world of closed economies and vice versa. Second, factor price equalization in a given period does not imply factor price equalization in future periods. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

A panel data set for 484 Norwegian GPs, with summary information on their patient stocks, renders the opportunity to identify and measure the impact of GP quality on the demand, accounting for patient health heterogeneity. We apply a multi-equation model in the LISREL format, with GP quality and patient health as latent determinants of demand for GP services. Patient excess mortality rate at the GP level is one indicator of quality.

We build a game-theoretic model of currency crises where a continuum of small speculators can decide their market confidence and trading positions. In the model, the convertibility of dollar is assumed to exhibit a long-term downtrend due to Triffin's dilemma. The problem is analyzed on the grounds of both certainty and uncertainty. In the certainty case, we find that if the convertibility of dollar is low enough, a dollar crisis is inevitable, but if the convertibility is in an intermediate range with multiple equilibria, the Bretton Woods system is vulnerable to self-fulfilling speculation. In the uncertainty case, the incidence of the confidence crises will disproportionately increase as the convertibility of dollar falls. Lastly, this paper shows that the Federal Reserve Bank's secrecy may extend the maximum lifespan of the Bretton Woods system.","[Lai, Ching-chong] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Chen, Chih-huan; Lai, Ching-chong] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Econ, Taichung 407, Taiwan; [Lai, Ching-chong] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 116, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; Feng Chia University; National Chengchi University,"Lai, CC (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan.",chench@fcu.edu.tw; cclai@econ.sinica.edu.tw,,,,,,,14,0,0,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

J,"Madden, KK",,,,"Madden, Kirsten K.",,,Engaged Learning with the Inquiry-Based Question Cluster Discussion Technique: Student Outcomes in a History of Economic Thought Course,SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,Twenty-six undergraduate students explored the meaning of the classics (Adam Smith and Karl Marx) and two lesser-known contributions in ethics and economics (Robert Owen and John Ruskin) in a spring 2007 history of economic thought course. This article introduces the inquiry-based discussion technique used in the course and presents five question clusters fulfilling requirements for an inquiry-based discussion. A proposed hypothesis is that the technique increases student understanding of challenging texts. Pre- and postdiscussion assessments for five interpretative questions serve as evidence to evaluate the hypothesis. Assessment results lend empirical support to the hypothesized positive impact of the technique on student learning. End-of-the-semester student survey results captured student opinions concerning their learning from the technique. Survey results suggest the students believe that the technique positively impacts aspects of the learning process; the students recommend the discussion technique for future use.,"Millersville Univ Pennsylvania, Dept Econ, Millersville, PA 17551 USA",Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); Millersville University of Pennsylvania,"Madden, KK (通讯作者)，Millersville Univ Pennsylvania, Dept Econ, POB 1002, Millersville, PA 17551 USA.",kirsten.madden@millersville.edu,,,,,,,11,5,5,0,8,UNIV NORTH CAROLINA,CHAPEL HILL,"SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL, CHAPEL HILL, NC 27514 USA",0038-4038,,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

This study uses panel data from 670 Texas school districts and more than 335,000 teachers to examine the relationship between school competition and teacher pay.

Poor transport infrastructure and border restrictions are major deterrents to trade expansion which would stimulate economic growth and poverty reduction. Using spatial network analysis techniques and gravity trade model estimations, this paper quantifies the economics of upgrading a primary road network that connects the major urban areas in the region. The results indicate that continental network upgrading is worth serious consideration from an economic perspective. Our simulations suggest that overland trade among Sub-Saharan African countries might expand by about $250 billion over 15 years, with major direct and indirect benefits for the rural poor. Financing the programme would require about $20 billion for initial upgrading and $1 billion annually for maintenance.","[Buys, Piet; Deichmann, Uwe] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Wheeler, David] Ctr Global Dev, Washington, DC 20036 USA",The World Bank,"Deichmann, U (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",udeichmann@worldbank.org,,,,,,,41,52,62,0,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

By decomposing profit change into its economic drivers, our results suggest that, in the Dutch political and institutional context, sunshine regulation was effective in improving the productivity of publicly organised services. Nevertheless, while sunshine regulation did bring about a moderate reduction in water prices, sustained and substantial economic profits suggest that it may not have the potential to fully align output prices with economic costs in the long run. In methodological terms, the DEA based profit decomposition is extended to robust and conditional non-parametric efficiency measures, so as to account better for both uncertainty and differences in operating environment between utilities.","[De Witte, Kristof] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Econ Studies, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [De Witte, Kristof] Maastricht Univ, Top Inst Evidence Based Educ Res, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Saal, David S.] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Econ & Strategy Grp, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England",KU Leuven; Maastricht University; Aston University,"De Witte, K (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Econ Studies, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",kristof.dewitte@econ.kuleuven.be; d.s.saal@aston.ac.uk,,"Saal, David/0000-0002-9542-9496; De Witte, Kristof/0000-0003-0505-8642",,,,,31,47,47,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

In this round of the ICP, the world was divided into six regions: OECD, CIS, Africa, South America, Asia Pacific, and West Asia. What is new in this round compared to previous rounds of the ICP is that each region was allowed to develop its own product list and collect prices on this list for countries in the region. The regions were then linked using another separate product list; 18 countries across the six regions collected prices for products on this list and this information was used to link prices and quantities across the regions. An additional complication was that the final linking of prices and volumes across regions had to respect the regional price and volume measures that were (separately) constructed by the regions.

We focus on settings where the range of uncertainty regarding scale economies is large and, depending on cost realizations, the efficient allocations include split-award outcomes as well as sole-source outcomes (one active supplier). We examine the price performance and efficiency properties of split-award auctions under asymmetric information. In equilibrium, both award outcomes can occur: the split-award outcome arises only when it minimizes total costs; sole-source outcomes, however, occur too often from an efficiency viewpoint. Equilibrium bids involve pooling at a common price for the split award, and separation for sole-source awards. We provide conditions under which the buyer and suppliers all benefit from a split-award format relative to a winner-take-all unit auction format.

The proposed model is consistent with experimental evidence documenting context effects in a variety of choice situations. In our model, the reference point for any given category is subjective, and corresponds to the least preferred element in the category under consideration. Every object in a category is evaluated relative to the corresponding reference point; this may distort the objective ranking of options across different categories, and thus possibly give rise to a context-effects bias. The resulting representation is essentially unique. We also provide an economic application of the preferences that we axiomatize to principal-agent models. We show how sellers facing consumers exhibiting the context-effects bias can increase their profits by exploiting their bounded rationality. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We first show how outsourcing modifies a firm's production function, and then demonstrate that outsourcing generally raises the return to capital and lowers the real wage, although the nation's GDP rises in proportion to the value-added in the outsourcing industry. Furthermore, the output of the outsourcing sector may actually fall even though its unit cost goes down; the output of the other sector then rises.

Our main result is the Collective Afriat Theorem, which parallels the well-known Afriat Theorem for the unitary model. First, it provides a characterization of collectively rational consumption behavior in terms of collective Afriat inequalities. Next, it implies the Collective Axiom of Revealed Preference (CARP) as a testable necessary and sufficient condition for data consistency with collective rationality. Finally, the theorem has some interesting testability implications. With only a finite set of observations, the nature of consumption externalities (positive or negative) in the intra-household allocation process is non-testable. The same non-testability conclusion holds for privateness (with or without externalities) or publicness of consumption. By contrast, concavity of individual utility functions (representing convex preferences) turns out to be testable. In addition, monotonicity is testable for the model that assumes all household consumption is public. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Using administrative data for the period 1987-2001 and a labor-market equilibrium model, we find that the substantial immigration of the 1990s had very little adverse effects on native wages and on their employment levels. Instead, it had a sizeable adverse employment effect on previous immigrants as well as a small adverse effect on their wages. These asymmetric results are partly driven by a higher degree of substitution between old and new immigrants in the labor market and in part by the rigidity of wages in less than flexible labor markets. In a simple counter-factual experiment we show that in a world of perfect wage flexibility and no unemployment insurance the wage-bill loss of old immigrants would be much smaller.

Souter demonstrates that Robbins takes a Walrasian-inspired perspective on Marshall's equilibrium concept whereas the 'authentically Marshallian' equilibrium notion generally incorporates potential for endogenous change.

This strategy is used to estimate the dynamic responses of output, hours, consumption and real wages to a government spending shock. We find that positive government spending shocks are associated with increases in output, hours and consumption. Real wages initially decline after a government spending shock and then rise after a year.

The possibility of resale attracts speculators who have no use value for the objects on sale. A high-value bidder may strictly prefer to let a speculator win some of the objects and then buy in the resale market, in order to keep the auction price low. Although resale induces entry by speculators and therefore increases the number of competitors, high-value bidders' incentives to reduce demand are also affected. Allowing resale to attract speculators reduces the seller's revenue when bidders' valuations are dispersed. Speculators increase the seller's revenue only when they are outbid.

Players' types are not directly observed, but may be imperfectly inferred from observed behavior. We focus on a class of equilibria that satisfy zero tolerance and fresh start. We find that the punishment for defecting and the reward for cooperating are driven by the formation and the dissolution of long-term, high-paying relationships: an individual who defects, aborts a long-term relationship that he is in, or that he might have entered into, is thrown into short-term interactions with individuals who are likely to defect and, consequently, receives low payoffs.

Employing individual data from the European Community Household Panel for a number of countries with differences in their institutional environments, the effect of job displacement for non-employed workers is identified separately for the transitions into re-employment and retirement. The findings suggest that in countries with relatively more generous unemployment insurance provisions for the older unemployed, which offer a pathway to early retirement, older displaced workers exhibit lower re-employment and higher retirement rates compared to the non-displaced. These results are robust to dynamic selection due to unobserved heterogeneity and to the endogeneity of displacement. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The growing presence of financial operators in the oil markets has led to the diffusion of trading techniques based on extrapolative expectations. Strategies of this kind foster feedback trading that may cause considerable departures of prices from their fundamental values. We investigate this hypothesis using a modified CAPM following Shiller (1984) and Sentana and Wadhwani (1992). First, a univariate GARCH(1,1)-M is estimated assuming the risk premium to be a function of the conditional oil price volatility. The single factor model, however, is outperformed by the multifactor ICAPM (Merton, 1973), which takes into account a larger investment opportunity set. Analysis is then carried out using a trivariate CCC GARCH-M model with complex nonlinear conditional mean equations where oil price dynamics are associated with both stock market and exchange rate behavior. We find strong evidence that oil price shifts are negatively related to stock price and exchange rate changes and that a complex web of time-varying first and second order conditional moment interactions affects both the CAPM and feedback trading components of the model. Despite the difficulties, we identify a significant role played by speculation in the oil market, which is consistent with the observed large daily upward and downward shifts in prices - a clear evidence that it is not a fundamental-driven market. Thus, from a policy point of view - given the impact of volatile oil prices on global inflation and growth - actions that monitor speculative activities on commodity markets more effectively are to be welcomed.

First, it is argued that there are critical differences between Latin America, the developed economies and the Asian economies as regards the evolution of the income elasticity of the demand for imports (pi), the rate of growth of exports and the balance-of-payments-constrained rate of growth. The income elasticity of the demand for imports in Latin America showed an upward trend, particularly after the mid-1970s, which was not matched by a similar increase in exports-a pattern in sharp contrast with that of the East Asian countries. The evolution of pi and exports are used to set forth a typology of Latin American economic growth since 1960. In addition, the paper relates elasticities and the less favourable Latin American performance to the intensity and direction of structural change. Using a broad sample of developed and developing economies, it is shown that the developing countries that succeed in reducing the income gap are those that transformed their economic structures in favour of sectors with higher Schumpeterian and Keynesian efficiency.","[Cimoli, Mario] Univ Venice, I-30123 Venice, Italy; [Porcile, Gabriel] Univ Fed Parana, BR-80060000 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Porcile, Gabriel] CNPq, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Rovira, Sebastian] Univ Siena, I-53100 Siena, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Universidade Federal do Parana; University of Siena,"Porcile, G (通讯作者)，Rua Prof Duilio Calderari 240,Casa 2, BR-80040250 Curitiba, PR, Brazil.",porcile@ufpr.br,,,,,,,60,70,89,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Does the impact of outward investment differ by the level of development of the destination country of the FDI? Using a difference-in-difference approach, we assess the impact of starting to invest in less-advanced countries compared with investing in more-advanced countries. To obtain suitable control groups in each case, we use the propensity score method to select national firms that ex post did not take the investment decisions that we study even though ex ante they would have been equally likely to. We find that moving to less-advanced Countries decreases a company's employment growth rate especially in the short run. On the other hand, moving to more-advanced countries does not consistently affect employment growth in any significant way. Including investment decisions of established multinationals in the estimation somewhat weakens but does not overturn this conclusion. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Our focus is on the nature of prices. We find that two types of price wars may exist. In one, collusion can involve periods of mixed-strategy price wars. in the other, consistent with the Rotemberg and Saloner (1986) definition of price wars, we show that collusive prices can also become counter-cyclical. We also establish pricing patterns with respect to the relative prices in booms and recessions. If the marginal cost of capacity is high enough, holding current demand constant, prices in the boom are generally lower than the prices in the recession: this reverses the results of Haltiwanger and Harrington (1991). In contrast, if the marginal cost of capacity is low enough, then prices in the boom are generally higher than the prices in the recession. For costs in an intermediate range, numerical examples are calculated to show specific pricing patterns. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The framework yields tests for the number of component distributions that are likely to be more informative than bump hunting tests and includes a method of assessing the cross-component immobility necessary to imply a correspondence between components and convergence clubs. Applying this approach to Penn World Data for the period 1960 to 2000 we find evidence of three component densities. We find little cross-component mobility and so interpret the multiple mixture components as representing convergence clubs. We document a pronounced tendency for the strength of the bonds between countries and clubs to increase and show that the well-known hollowing out of the middle of the distribution is largely attributable to the increased concentration of the rich countries around their component means.,"[Pittau, Maria Grazia] Univ Roma La Sapienza, DSPSA, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Johnson, Paul A.] Vassar Coll, Dept Econ, Poughkeepsie, NY 12601 USA",Sapienza University Rome; Vassar College,"Pittau, MG (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, DSPSA, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",grazia.pittau@uniroma1.it,,"ZELLI, Roberto/0000-0002-1967-3470; Johnson, Paul/0000-0003-2227-4910",,,,,37,49,54,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

In this paper we investigate the latter relationship with respect to the South African trade reform experience using micro-level labour data for the period from 1995 to 2004. Our study extends on the existing literature in two respects: first, we are the first controlling for the potential effect of labour market institutions, such as collective bargaining power, in assessing the relationship between tariffs and industry wages. Second, we account for general equilibrium effects by controlling for the impact of changes in effective tariff rates. On the one hand, we find that only wages in industries with levels of unionisation beyond a certain threshold were adversely affected by tariff cuts. This negative effect is exacerbated by the extent of sectoral union power. The reported large magnitudes of the tariff impact on wages is in line with the considerably high mark-ups documented for South Africa. On the other hand we find some evidence suggesting that wages in industries with union power below the threshold were positively affected by the tariff cuts. This evidence suggests the omitted variable bias resulting from not controlling for industry heterogeneities in bargaining power when examining the wage-trade relationship.","World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Shendy, R (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",rshendy@worldbank.org,"Shendy, Riham/ABE-1942-2021",,,,,,40,3,3,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

This greater interdependence, however, did not come at the expense of a weaker economic tie with the rest of the world (as clearly demonstrated in the recent global economic crisis).

We integrate both responses in a microeconomic model of hiring and pay decisions by an employer. Increasing competition in the product market makes the employer feel more uncertain about his profits, but also raises the opportunity cost of screening expenditures.

S. movie trade, by applying a home market economic model, i.e. the bigger the film-related revenue, the higher investment, the larger shares in domestic and foreign markets. Another purpose is to propose policy implications based on empirical results for the development of the Korean movie industry. Our results confirm that home market effects explain the fluctuating market share of Korean films in the domestic market. The existence of home market effects in determining film trade flow and the effects of domestic media policies on the growth of the national film infrastructure should be considered in the formulation of a domestic film policy. In particular, the importance of the domestic movie support base suggests deregulation of movie support media to increase the size of the Korean market and simultaneously increase Korean movies' shares of both foreign and domestic markets. American movies have kept a dominant position in the Korean movie industry mainly because the slow diffusion of movie support media in Korea is misdirected by protectionism and other similar policies. The recent increase in the share of the Korean market taken by locally-produced Korean movies may be explained by the deregulation of the domestic film industry and movie support media. As movie exporters, Korean film distributors who wish to exploit foreign markets should target those countries with low cultural discounts and poor movie infrastructure. More investment in the Korean movie industry would facilitate higher penetration of Korean movies into culturally homogeneous but lesser investing foreign markets.","[Kim, Weonseek] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Econ, Daedeok Myeon, Anseong Si, South Korea; [Lee, Sang-Woo] Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Informat, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Chung Ang University; Yonsei University,"Kim, W (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Dept Econ, Daedeok Myeon, Anseong Si, South Korea.",leesw726@yonsei.ac.kr; wnsk65@cau.ac.kr,,,,,,,64,2,2,0,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Both sets of policies reduce national and global economic welfare, add to global inequality and poverty, and are mostly the result of trade restrictions. Yet until recently they have not been disciplined by the GATT or WTO. New evidence illustrates where the GATT and WTO have failed to prevent rises in agricultural protectionism, including in developing countries. Global economy wide modeling results reveal that substantial trade policy reform has been achieved since the mid-1980s in ways that have helped developing country farmers, but that there remains very considerable scope for further farm policy reform. In the decades ahead, the effects of policies on farmers and others in developing countries depend on whether an ambitious Doha Round agreement is signed and countries continue the recent trends towards free trade. Should Doha fail, agricultural protectionism may well grow in emerging economies, suggesting that the stakes in the Doha Round are much higher than is traditionally believed.","Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Anderson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",kym.anderson@adelaide.edu.au,"Anderson, Kym/G-7292-2012","Anderson, Kym/0000-0002-1472-3352",,,,,38,2,2,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The increase in wage premiums has been driven mostly by younger age groups while older age groups have not experienced any significant increase. Using a demand and supply model with imperfect substitution across age groups (developed in Card and Lemieux, 2001), this paper demonstrates that workers are not perfect substitutes across age groups. The paper finds that the increase in the wage premium has come mostly from demand shifts in favor of workers with a tertiary education. More importantly, the growth rate of demand for tertiary educated workers relative to secondary educated workers was fairly stable in the 1980s and the 1990s. However, the relative supply played an important role not only in determining the extent of increase in wage premium, but also its timing. The increase in relative supply of tertiary workers during 1983-1993 negated the demand shift; as a result, the wage premium did not increase much. But during 1993-1999, the growth rate of the relative supply of tertiary workers decelerated, while relative supply became virtually stagnant during 1999-2004. Both these periods saw an increase in the wage premium as the countervailing supply shift was weak.","[Azam, Mehtabul] World Bank, Washington, DC USA",The World Bank,"Azam, M (通讯作者)，World Bank, Washington, DC USA.",mehtab_azam@yahoo.com,,,,,,,32,8,11,0,3,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The changes within the activity of companies are expressed through the increase of competition within the dynamic market and the change of needs and expectations held by consumers and other stakeholders. It has been noticed that consumers more and more often prefer eco-friendly, safe and clean products that do not pollute the environment. The changing attitudes of consumers regarding environmental protection, ecology, social responsibility and the change of consumption habits force enterprises to look for new alternatives of activities, where the main principles of corporate social responsibility would be integrated. Recent theoretical as well as practical scientific studies confirm the importance of the development of the corporate social responsibility conception and of its integration into different areas of company activity. In terms of marketing, such changes determine the need to know the new, so called green, consumer and to adapt marketing decisions to the focus on ascertaining the expectations and satisfying the needs of such a consumer. The article assents to the attitude that it is possible to implement corporate social responsibility in the aspect of satisfaction of consumer needs by applying different marketing theories and conceptions. As an increasing amount of attention is given to the questions of green marketing in scientific literature, this area of marketing theory is chosen as the main research object of the article. Based on this it is stated that seeking to fully satisfy the needs of one of the main stakeholders of an enterprise consumers, it is purposeful to analyse green marketing priorities, which would resound the essential ideas of corporate social responsibility. The main green marketing priorities of an enterprise, analysed in the article, encompass the recognition of expectations and satisfaction of the needs of green consumers, envisagement of the reaction to green marketing decisions, identification of trust in eco-friendly products and prediction of effectiveness of promotion means. The interpretation of quantitative research results, presented in the article, reveals the expression of marketing priorities based on the example of Lithuanian female consumers of eco-friendly food products. It should be noted that although female consumers of eco-friendly food products are resolved to pay more for an eco-friendly product, they are sensitive to price, believe in the high quality of an eco-friendly product and give priority to the needs of environmental protection. It becomes clear that the reliability of an eco-friendly product is associated with the familiarity of a product brand, with safety and environmental consideration; the safety of an eco-friendly product and positive word-of-mouth recommendations are especially significant for the reliability. Summarizing the priorities of the application of promotion means, it was determined that public relations should be treated as the most effective means of promotion. The performed theoretical and empirical research testifies the necessity of green marketing studies and the need for the identification of its priorities and their inclusion in the development of the corporate social responsibility conception.","[Banyte, Jurate; Brazioniene, Lina; Gadeikiene, Agne] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Banyte, J (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",jurate.banyte@ktu.lt; l_bartnikaite@yahoo.com; agne.gadeikiene@ktu.lt,"Gadeikienė, Agnė/AAV-1568-2020","Gadeikienė, Agnė/0000-0001-7719-4980",,,,,44,29,30,3,43,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

This paper examines a different aspect of developing country participation in the WTO: use of the WTO dispute settlement system to enforce foreign market access rights already negotiated in earlier rounds of multilateral negotiations. We examine data on developing country use from 1995 through 2008 of the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) to enforce foreign market access. The data reveal three notable trends: developing countries' sustained rate of self-enforcement actions despite declining use of the DSU by developed countries, developing countries' increased use of the DSU to self-enforce their access to the markets of developing as well as developed countries, and the prevalence of disputes targeting highly observable causes of lost foreign market access, such as antidumping, countervailing duties, and safeguards. The paper also examines how introduction of the Advisory Centre on WTO Law (ACWL) into the WTO system in 2001 has affected developing countries' use of the DSU to self-enforce their foreign market access rights. A first pass at the data indicates that developing country use of the ACWL mirrors their use of the DSU more broadly; the ACWL has had little effect in terms of introducing new countries to DSU self-enforcement. A closer look at the data reveals evidence on at least three channels through which the ACWL may be enhancing developing countries' ability to self-enforce foreign market access: increased initiation of sole-complainant cases, more extensive pursuit of the DSU legal process for any given case, and initiation of disputes over smaller values of lost trade.","[Bown, Chad P.; McCulloch, Rachel] Brandeis Univ, Dept Econ, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Bown, Chad P.; McCulloch, Rachel] Brandeis Univ, Int Business Sch, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Bown, Chad P.] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Bown, Chad P.] World Bank, Washington, DC USA",Brandeis University; Brandeis University; Brookings Institution; The World Bank,"Bown, CP (通讯作者)，Brandeis Univ, Dept Econ, MS021, Waltham, MA 02454 USA.",cbown@worldbank.org,,"Bown, Chad/0000-0002-6963-7857",,,,,26,12,15,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Pure-strategy epsilon-Nash equilibrium in two-person non-zero-sum games. Games Econ.

Ziad [Ziad, A., 1997. Pure-strategy epsilon-Nash equilibrium in n-person nonzero-sum discontinuous games. Games Econ.

Both Radzik's and Ziad's proofs rely crucially on the lower hemi-continuity of the epsilon-best reply correspondence. We show that: (1) in contrast to what is stated by Ziad, his conditions fail to be sufficient for the lower hemi-continuity of the approximate best-reply correspondence, (2) the approximate best-reply correspondence is indeed lower hemi-continuous if players' action spaces are polytopes, and (3) with action spaces as polytopes, Ziad's theorem can be stated so that it properly generalizes Radzik's theorem.

We illustrate its general structure and model properties, especially with regard to the economy's response to changes in policy and in other dimensions of the economic environment. One of the key features of the model is the joint representation of the economy on both the demand and the supply sides. Since it is designed for the needs of a Treasury Department, its public finance section is developed in great detail, both on the expenditure and revenue sides. It also features a complete modeling of financial assets and liabilities of each institutional sector. After documenting the model structure and the estimation results, we turn to the outcomes of model simulation and ascertain the model properties. In ITEM the shocks that generate permanent effects on output are associated with: a) variables that affect the tax wedge in the labor market and the user cost of capital; b) labor supply change; and c) variation in the trend component of TFP (technical progress). By contrast, demand shocks have only temporary effects on output (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In suffering from the fatal conceit, these interventions are characterized by: (1) the realization that intentions do not equal results, (2) a reliance on top-down planning, (3) the view of development as a technological issue, (4) a reliance on bureaucracy over markets, and (5) the primacy of collectivism over individualism.

Can't they, like men, have both? At work, women are still under-represented in high-powered professions in most societies. At home, women tend to devote more time to their families than their spouses do. What explains these imbalances? Our model builds upon the fact that women's fertility, unlike men's, declines sharply past age 35. As a result, women may prefer marrying early in order to secure a match rather than investing in their careers while delaying and potentially missing out on marriage. Women's failure to coordinate towards delaying marriage may explain the imbalances within the family and in the labor market.","[Dessy, Sylvain; Djebbari, Habiba] Univ Laval, IZA, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada",Laval University,"Dessy, S (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, IZA, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",sdes@ecn.ulaval.ca; hdjebbari@ecn.ulaval.ca,,,,,,,29,5,8,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Based on the Almost Ideal Demand System, five demand systems are estimated, four representing the major source markets of tourists to Ireland, namely from Britain, North America, Mainland Europe and Rest of the World; and one aggregate model based on a pooled sample. Each system included six commodity aggregates representing the major consumables of tourists. Estimated models were statistically significant and the derived elasticities are theoretically consistent and empirically plausible. While there are some variations in the consumption patterns of tourists from different source markets, reflecting differences in consumer preferences and consumption habits, in general, tourist demand for the various Irish tourism goods and services is found to be price inelastic. This finding is consistent with a priori expectations, as tourists are obliged to consume whatever is available at the destination they visit. The lack of substitutes and perfect information on product markets offer limited consumption opportunities for the tourists. Nonetheless, the cross-price elasticity values for all commodities across the source markets indicate gross complementarity, which suggests that latent price sensitivity exists in the background. This is an area that needs further investigation and this finding may have significant, yet unknown, consequences for repeat visitation.","[Divisekera, Sarath] Victoria Univ, Sch Appl Econ, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia; [Divisekera, Sarath] Victoria Univ, Ctr Tourism & Hospitality Res, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia; [Deegan, Jim] Univ Limerick, Natl Ctr Tourism Policy Studies, Limerick, Ireland",Victoria University; Victoria University; University of Limerick,"Divisekera, S (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ, Sch Appl Econ, POB 14428 MC, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia.",Sarath.Divisekera@vu.edu.au,,"Deegan, Jim/0000-0003-1333-2795",,,,,18,19,20,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The study in its initial parts monitors changes in the EU. It is notable that an old conflict was mastered between the sectoral and horizontal approaches. A combination of horizontal measures and their implementation according to particular industries and their attributes results in a sort of matrix type of industrial policy. The industrial policy turns increasingly into that of a complex and systemic character. Key importance of knowledge and innovation for economic growth calls for actions facing specific problems connected with its creation, distribution and use in economic activities. Therefore, the second part of the study pays special attention to a model of knowledge-oriented industrial policy. It deals with its theoretical background, the changes in the role of the state and with policy instruments.","Ekon Ustav SAV, Bratislava 81105 1, Slovakia",Slovak Academy of Sciences,"Gabrielová, H (通讯作者)，Ekon Ustav SAV, Sancova 56, Bratislava 81105 1, Slovakia.",herta.gabrielova@savba.sk,,,,,,,28,1,1,0,6,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

We test for stationarity in relative income levels through five panel (no)stationarity tests. In addition, we investigate cross-sectional independence using Pesaran's CD test. We also investigate beta-convergence to check the existence of stochastic convergence of GDP among our regions. We observe some evidence of no a-convergence for NUTS2 regions of Visegrad countries. Hadri's panel stationarity tests provide evidence of a lack of stochastic convergence in income levels for our sample of 35 regions. The evidence of the presence of cross-sectional dependence in regional income is plausible. The tests for time-series conditional beta-convergence find evidence for this for 13 regions (at the 5% significance level). There is evidence of deterministic convergence of long run steady-state equilibrium in the per capita real GDP differentials for only three regions.","[Hanclova, Jana] Tech Univ Ostrava, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,,jana.hanclova@vsb.cz,"Hanclova, Jana/D-7723-2013; Hanclova, Jana/AAJ-8363-2020","Hanclova, Jana/0000-0002-0939-6852",,,,,21,2,2,0,2,"UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,CESKE BUDEJOVICE, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZ-370 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-218-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,201,207,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS47,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287979900035,0

They may also be motivated by entirely different price events. This analysis shows that new price peaks have both short-run and long-run consumption responses, a result that is starkly different than price changes that track previous price paths. It also establishes significant trend effects where gasoline and residual fuel oil consumption decline over time. The analysis explores these adjustments by establishing long-run cointegrating relationships for different petroleum product groupings. An important implication is that price increases above historical levels may be providing substantially greater incentives for significant long-run demand adjustments than would be the case otherwise.

Insurers cannot precisely appreciate the weight of natural hazards because of risk dependences. Insurability under uncertainty first requires an accurate assessment of entire damages. Insured and insurers both win when premiums calculate risk properly. In such cases, coverage will be available and affordable. Using the artificial neural network - a technique rooted in artificial intelligence - insurers can predict annual natural disaster losses. There are many types of artificial neural network models. In this paper we use the multilayer perceptron neural network, the most accommodated to the prediction task. In fact, if we provide the natural disaster explanatory variables to the developed neural network, it calculates perfectly the potential annual losses for the studied country.","[Jemli, Rim; Chtourou, Nouri] Univ Sfax, Fac Econ Sci & Management, Res Unit Dev Econ, Sfax, Tunisia; [Feki, Rochdi] Univ Sfax, Higher Sch Commerce, Sfax, Tunisia",Universite de Sfax; Universite de Monastir; Universite de Sfax,"Jemli, R (通讯作者)，Univ Sfax, Fac Econ Sci & Management, Res Unit Dev Econ, Sfax, Tunisia.",rim_jemli@yahoo.fr; nouri.chtourou@fseg.rnu.tn; Rochdi.Feki@escs.rnu.tn,,,,,,,22,3,3,0,20,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2010,57.0,1,,,,,43,60,,10.2298/PAN1001043J,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,583ZG,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000276719100003,0

The evidence across a sample of 19 industrial countries differentiates the effects of expansionary and contractionary aggregate demand shocks on real output growth and nominal wage and price inflation. The difference appears consistent with a kinked supply curve that is dependent on the asymmetric flexibility of wages and/or prices across countries. Furthermore, the evidence does not support the endogeneity of asymmetric nominal flexibility with respect to demand variability or trend price inflation across countries. On average, across countries, demand variability increases nominal wage and price inflation relative to deflation, while exacerbating output contraction relative to expansion. The apparent trade-off between changes in real and nominal trends provides further support to the supply side explanation of asymmetry.","Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Kandil, M (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",mkandil@imf.org,,,,,,,38,3,3,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

While low-wage imports have almost no effect on unemployment duration for workers displaced from an industry with the average length of the quality ladder, I find that a ten percentage point increase in low-wage imports leads to a 5.6 week longer jobless spell duration for workers displaced from an industry with a short quality ladder. Similarly, a ten percentage point increase in low-wage imports leads to a 7.2 percent decline in re-employment wages for workers displaced from an average ladder industry, but it leads to an 11.3 percent decline in re-employment wages for workers displaced from a short ladder industry. I show evidence that greater low-wage imports raise the likelihood of sectoral relocation upon re-employment, leading to loss of sector specific human capital.","N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",North Carolina State University,"Kandilov, IT (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",ivan_kandilov@ncsu.edu,,"Kandilov, Ivan/0000-0002-0761-8095",,,,,31,1,1,0,4,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Schooling and household size, which are respectively much lower and higher among the rural Arab population, also explain significant fractions of income inequality. Location and gender of the household head explain much smaller fractions. Education-enhancing policies directed at the lower end of the schooling distribution, and at Arab municipalities in particular, are recommended to reduce per capita income inequality in rural Israel and narrow the Jewish-Arab gap.

We employ a state-of-the-art panel data stationarity test which incorporates multiple structural breaks. Evidence indicates that when accommodating general forms of cross-sectional dependence as well as controlling for finite-sample bias, the real stock price series appear to be stationary in 32 developed and 26 developing countries, respectively, which is in sharp contrast to the findings in the existing literature. Thus, real stock price indices are stationary processes that are inconsistent with the efficient market hypothesis. This shows the presence of profitable arbitrage opportunities among stock markets. According to these estimated structural breakpoints, we are also able to discover the reason for why there has been a huge impact from past stock prices. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It must be emphasized that clusters, depending on the phase of their growth and development, exercise increasing influence over business organizations, as well as their competitive abilities. The more clusterized a particular business sector is, the more likely it is going to develop a competitive advantage. Therefore, it is important to identify and evaluate the influence of clusterization level on the competitiveness of a tourism sector, for it is one of the key sectors in modern service-based economies. The aim of the study is to identify the relation between the level of clusterization and tourism sector competitiveness; and the objectives of the study are: 1) to identify the main fields of cluster impact on the competitiveness of business sectors, and individual business firms; 2) to relate different cluster formation (growth, development) stages to the dynamics of competitiveness; 3) to develop a measurement tool for the evaluation of clusterization level (Clusterization Index, CI); 4) to develop a theoretical model that indicates the relation between the Clusterization Index (CI) and tourism sector competitiveness. The following methods have been applied in the study: logical and comparative analysis of literature; holistic and systematic approach; synthesis and deduction; graphical methods. The influence of clusters on the competitiveness of business sectors and business firms possesses at least three dimensions: entrepreneurship (new businesses), productivity, and innovation. Clusters tend to make good incubators of innovative ideas, new companies, and new businesses. Fresh business ventures and clusters may start-up in the collision of several different clusters. The degree of competitiveness is dependant on the life cycle dynamics of a cluster competitiveness grows when a cluster develops, and decreases as it reaches the phase of decline. At the maturity stage of a cluster, the degree of competitiveness tends to be the highest. The authors of this research have introduced the Clusterization Index, which includes various attributes of clusterization that are to be evaluated by independent experts. The average estimates of all the attributes are to be multiplied by the coefficients of significance and summed together to provide a unified estimate of CI. The index requires further improvement in order to return the most objective and accurate estimation results. The competitiveness level has 2 dimensions the determinants (factors) and indicators. In order to evaluate the link between the clusterization level, represented by CI, and competitiveness level (CL), the relations between CI and various indicators of the business (in this case the tourism sector) sector competitiveness are to be found It can be concluded that the analysis of clusterization level, cluster life cycle and their influence on the competitiveness of business firms, is a complex (and multi-stage) process of increasing importance. The field of research related to the level of clusterization is particularly new, thus it demands the growth of scientific and practical attention.","[Malakauskaite, Asta; Navickas, Valentinas] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Malakauskaite, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Laisves Av 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",asta.malakauskaite@stud.ktu.lt; valentinas.navickas@ktu.lt,"Navickas, Valentinas/I-9119-2018; Navickas, Valentinas/AAC-9651-2019; Navickas, Valentinas/GPX-0310-2022","Navickas, Valentinas/0000-0002-7210-4410; Navickas, Valentinas/0000-0002-7210-4410",,,,,31,21,24,1,21,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

This article develops a model of public education with imperfect exit to predict how private school enrollment influences performance of public schools. Empirical evidence from data on all private and public schools in California provides substantial support for the hypothesis that public school test scores are inversely related to private school enrollments and charter school enrollments when private and charter schooling reflects exiting by parents unhappy with local public schools.

For construction of the regional series for the public capital stock over the period 1996 to 2003, the study benefits from the use of the rich dataset on public expenditure, recently published by the Italian Ministry of Economy. We have estimated panel production functions with the inclusion of traditional factors and also intangible inputs like research and development (RD) expenditure, human capital (HK) and social capital (SK). The results point out that public capital has a positive and significant effect on production. Moreover, the effects of all production factors vary considerably between the two macro-areas of the country, namely Centre-North and Mezzogiorno. More specifically, while private capital is more effective in the South, labour exhibits an elasticity much higher in the Centre-North with respect to the Mezzogiorno. The disaggregation of the public capital stock into functional categories indicates a significant different impact in the two macro-areas. In addition, when the analysis is carried out by distinguishing among government levels it turns out that the decentralized administrative bodies are much less efficient in the South in delivering public expenditure.","[Paci, Raffaele] Univ Cagliari, Ctr NS Econ Res, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy; CRENoS, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy",University of Cagliari,"Paci, R (通讯作者)，Univ Cagliari, Ctr NS Econ Res, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy.",paci@unica.it,"Marrocu, Emanuela/E-2903-2017","Marrocu, Emanuela/0000-0002-7436-0055; PACI, RAFFAELE/0000-0003-0301-438X",,,,,34,20,21,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Further, the profit functions are also statistically different, leading to the conclusion that, ceteris paribus, African American films perform better at the box office.","Univ Sydney, Discipline Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"McKenzie, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Discipline Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",j.mckenzie@econ.usyd.edu.au,"Mckenzie, Jordi/AFN-3907-2022","Mckenzie, Jordi/0000-0003-4081-6189",,,,,25,2,2,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Following the lines of the classical business cycle approach, a battery of statistics and autoregressive models is applied. Our main results can be summarised as follows: 1) there is evidence of asymmetries both in mean and variance in the cases of investment and imports, 2) industrial production, employment, unemployment rate and nominal interest rate exhibit asymmetries in mean only, and 3) exports, inflation rate and real exchange rate show asymmetries in variance only. One implication of these results is that linear models may be inappropriate to model these variables while nonlinear models may be useful to deal with their characteristics and dynamics.","[Mejia-Reyes, Pablo; Angel Diaz-Carreno, Miguel] Univ Autonoma Estado Mexico, Fac Econ, Toluca, Mexico",,"Mejía-Reyes, P (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Estado Mexico, Fac Econ, Toluca, Mexico.",pmejr@uaemex.mx; madiaz@colpos.mx,"Mejía-Reyes, Pablo/AAC-8575-2020","Mejia-Reyes, Pablo/0000-0002-9222-1526; Diaz Carreno, Miguel Angel/0000-0002-0239-9014",,,,,56,1,3,0,5,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC ECONOMIA",MEXICO,"CIRCUITO INTERIOR S-N EDIFICIO B, PRIMER PISO, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO, DISTRITO FEDERAL 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

The importance level of each critical factor was defined making it possible to rank critical factors and set priorities in encouraging SMEs to implement KMS.

The family factors examined were choosing and preparing successors, family employee compensation, family conflicts, financial expectations of non-active family members and consensus on family values and mission. There are statistically significant differences of opinion on the impact of business and family factors in the past five years and for the next five years that point to substantially increased concern about economic stability in Fiji.

The production jobs are processed by machines, and each job is assigned to a certain machine for technological reasons. Before processing a job, the machine has to be adjusted; there is only one adjuster who adjusts all of the machines. This problem is treated as a hybrid two-stage flow-shop: the first stage of the job processing is represented by the machine adjustment for the respective job, and the second stage by the processing of the job itself on the adjusted machine. In other words, the job-processing consists of two tasks, where the first task is the machine adjustment for the job, and the second task is the job processing itself. A mathematical model is proposed, a heuristic method is formulated, and the NP hardness of the problem, called a hybrid flow-shop with adjustment, is proved.","[Pelikan, Jan] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Econometr, Prague 3, Czech Republic",,,pelikan@vse.cz,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,"UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,CESKE BUDEJOVICE, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZ-370 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-218-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,511,516,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS47,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287979900087,0

Exploiting this 'quasi-natural' experiment, we find that the lower income transfer has a positive effect on the job-finding rate after two years in Denmark. We also find that the exit rate from the labour force is positively affected by start-help during the early phases of the integration process.

The former program must be conveyed by a theory of equilibrium; the latter program requires a process-based theory of emergent phenomena. Roy Weintraub articulated a neo-Walrasian research program in his General Equilibrium Analysis, and here I sketch a complementary neo-Mengerian program. In presenting this sketch, I also explain that needless analytical confusion and antagonism can result from a failure to recognize that economic analysis requires two distinct research programs.

The equilibrium outcomes are significantly different from the equivalent Cournot model. Firms choose to underutilize their capacity at times of low demand, and hold more capacity than predicted by Cournot.

First, information from various sources are combined and a global map of smuggling routes for cigarettes is described. By examining the international cigarette trade records, the hub/transit countries in six regions of the world are identified. Second, a variable that measures smuggling incentives for cigarettes is defined and computed for 110 countries. Third, a static global demand model for cigarettes (that includes the smuggling incentives variable) is specified and robustly estimated. Using the estimation results, global price and income elasticities of cigarette demand are obtained as -0.41 and 0.37, respectively. It is estimated that in 1999, 3.4% of global cigarette consumption was smuggled and 7.4% of tax revenue was lost to smuggling. Fourth, the best policy options are identified to achieve the objectives of both public health agencies (less consumption, less smuggling) and governments (less smuggling, more revenue). A tax-induced increase in real retail cigarette prices and an improvement in anti-smuggling law enforcement (as proxied by the corruption indicator) are found to significantly increase government revenues while decreasing global consumption and smuggling. Furthermore, when the tax increase is not accompanied by an improvement in law enforcement, then global smuggling of cigarettes would increase, but governments would still enjoy increased tax revenues.","[Sayginsoy, Oe.] HSBC Finance Corp, Consumer & Mortgage Lending, Elmhurst, IL USA; [Yuerekli, A.] WHO, Tobacco Free Initiat, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland",HSBC Holdings; World Health Organization,"Sayginsoy, Ö (通讯作者)，HSBC Finance Corp, Consumer & Mortgage Lending, Elmhurst, IL USA.",osayginsoy@albany.edu,,,,,,,41,21,22,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The results show that the Length Of Stay (LOS) of all inpatients suffering from the target diseases during the two test periods responded quickly to the experiment (even though only insured inpatients living in Shanghai were eligible for the DRG-based experiments), thus implying that the DRG-based prospective payment system does not induce physicians to significantly reduce inpatient expenditures but does induce them to reduce the LOS of those suffering from the target diseases. Moreover, costs were shifted to uninsured inpatients suffering from the target diseases: their overall inpatient expenditures increased by 33.6 percentage points more than that of uninsured inpatients during the nontest period in 2005. Thus, the experiments were of limited effectiveness, and cost-shifting to uninsured inpatients was observed during at least the latter test period.","[Zhang, Jiale] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Toyonaka, Osaka, Japan; Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan",Osaka University; Osaka University,"Zhang, JL (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-31 Machikaneyama Cho, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",choukaraku@hotmail.com,,,,,,,14,27,29,5,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

When most eligible producers in the South can obtain the label, its impact is considerably reduced by a displacement effect whereby adult workers replace children in the export sector while children replace adults in the domestic sector. The label is then unable to create a price differential in the South between goods produced under the label and those produced without it. When only a small fraction of eligible producers have access to the label, the South exports both labeled and unlabeled goods to the North. In this case, labeled producers generally gain while those without a label generally loose from the introduction of the label. Ex ante welfare may fall in the South if the probability of getting a label when one qualifies is small. The impact on child labor is in general ambiguous. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, the credibility of inflation targeting is a very important driver of consumer expectations.

Polarization is considered as the presence of groups which are internally homogeneous, externally heterogeneous, and of similar size. We propose a class of polarization indices which is built from measures of relative groups size and from decomposable indices of socio-economic inequality. For the latter, we employ the special inequality indices of Maasoumi (Econometrica 54:991-997, 1986), Tsui (J Econ Theory 67:251-265, 1995; Soc Choice Welf 16:145-157, 1999) and Koshevoy and Mosler (J Multivar Anal 60:252-276, 1997).

Using a model of the bank-firm relationship, we study the trade-off a bank faces when having defaulting firms declared bankrupt. First, the bank receives a payoff if a firm is liquidated. Second, it provides information about a firm's type to its competitors. Therefore, asymmetric information between banks is reduced, and bank competition intensifies. We find that the better the institutions and the more competitive the banking sector, the greater the bank's incentive to bankrupt defaulting firms. This makes information between banks less asymmetric and thus leads to lower interest rates and increases the probability that all banks offer loans.

The evidence suggests that the mean retirement age of the affected cohorts has increased by about half as much as the increase in the NRA.

The limitations of the Kaldor-Hicks criterion are highlighted and these issues lead to the development of the discounted present value (DPV) method and the compounded terminal value (CTV) method. However, the latter methods were not without problems. It is demonstrated that using DPV or CTV to evaluate certain public projects produces exorbitantly small DPVs or exorbitantly large CTVs, which would lead to a manifestly perverse ranking if adopted. A new method of evaluating these public projects, known loosely as the corrected equivalent present value method, is proposed to alleviate the problems of DPV and CTV.","[Mishan, E.

Offerman (2002) finds that negative intentions are more likely to induce payoff decreases than positive intentions are to induce payoff increases. Using the Falk and Fischbacher (2006) model, we approach the same question as Offerman, but from a structural angle. This requires measuring what a subject predicts that other subjects predict that he will do (known as a subject's second-order expectations). This permits us to interpret any asymmetry in the propensities to increase and decrease payoffs in terms of the determinants of payoff increases and decreases. Our results are largely consonant with Offerman (2002). We also find that in situations with exogenously created inequity (rather than inequity that is the result of an intentional action by an actor). payoff increase is more likely to be used to diminish the inequity than is payoff decrease. Our results exhibit some sensitivity to whether we obtain second-order expectations by eliciting them directly from the subject making the payoff increase/decrease decision or by inducing them by reporting to the decider the expectations of the target of the payoff increase/decrease.

The mechanism through which these subsidies are distributed may contain several inefficiencies that diminish the net-value obtained by the recipients. In this paper, we build and estimate a behavioral dynamic model that allows us to evaluate the efficiency of current and alternative distribution mechanisms. The proposed model is simple and resembles the individual's decision to collect the transfer. To estimate it, we use data from a cash transfer program in Ecuador where recipients incur high transaction costs each time they collect their benefits. Despite its simplicity, our model is able to replicate the observed data remarkably well.

We develop a flexible jump-to-default model that uses observables: the stock price and stock volatility in conjunction with credit spreads to identify implied, endogenous, dynamic functions of the recovery rate and default probability. The model in this paper is parsimonious and requires the calibration of only three parameters, enabling the identification of the risk-neutral term structures of forward default probabilities and recovery rates. Empirical application of the model shows that it is consistent with stylized features of recovery rates in the literature. The model is flexible, i.e. it may be used with different state variables, alternate recovery functional forms, and calibrated to multiple debt tranches of the same issuer. The model is robust, i.e. evidences parameter stability over time, is stable to changes in inputs, and provides similar recovery term structures for different functional specifications. Given that the model is easy to understand and calibrate, it may be used to further the development of credit derivatives indexed to recovery rates, Such as recovery swaps and digital default swaps, as well as provide recovery rate inputs for the implementation of Basel II.

However, the consequences of such an innovation provide evidence that the belief that motivated them was wrong. In contrast, play may never escape an undesirable self-confirming equilibrium, as the action implied by the mistaken belief does not generate data that contradicts it; escape from the self-confirming equilibrium requires that players do a sufficient amount of experimentation with off-path actions.

Mobile telephone networks increasingly provide the communications infrastructure that has largely been lacking throughout the region. Yet, governments have generally made only modest allocations of bandwidth available to Latin American wireless operators, either absolutely (in terms of spectrum each country could allocate at modest opportunity cost) or relative to countries in North America, Asia and the European Union. Using an empirical model estimated on mobile phone data for international markets, we show that very large social benefits are available to countries that make more spectrum available for mobile phone markets. We conduct simulations using our calibrated model to provide lower bounds for country-by-country gains from larger allocations.

It is an RBC model in which each unit of investment requires a new idea, an 'option.' When options are scarce, new capital is harder to put in place and the value of old capital rises. Thus the stock market and Tobin's Q are negative indexes of intangibles. During a boom, Q rises gradually, as options are used up. Because investment represents an exercise of options, it has an intertemporal substitution tradeoff that is absent from the adjustment-cost model.

We study a simple stochastic framework of a collective process of opinion formation by a group of agents who face a binary decision problem. The aggregate dynamics of the individuals' decisions can be analyzed via the stochastic process governing the ensemble average of choices. Numerical approximations to the transient density for this ensemble average allow the evaluation of the likelihood function on the base of discrete observations of the social dynamics. This approach can be used to estimate the parameters of the opinion formation process from aggregate data on its average realization. Our application to a well-known business climate index provides strong indication of social interaction as an important element in respondents' assessment of the business climate.

It also investigates whether the USA and euro area curves help to predict. It finds that the yield curve in emerging economies contains information for future inflation and growth, with differences across countries being seemingly linked to market liquidity. The US and euro area yield curves are also found to contain information for future inflation and growth in emerging economies. In particular, for those economies with exchange rates pegged to the US dollar, the US yield curve is often a better predictor than the domestic curves and causes their movements. This suggests that monetary policy changes in the USA are drivers of international financial linkages through base interest pass-through and the low end of the yield curve.","European Cent Bank, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Mehl, A (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Kaiserstr 29, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany.",arnaud.mehl@ecb.int,,,,,,,46,19,19,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Consistent with predictions of the corporate debt structure literature, public debt-issuing firms are larger, older, more profitable, and less informational opaque than non-public debt-issuing firms. Moreover, public debt-issuing firms experience significant reductions in both overall and systematic risks, and incur lower cost of capital following issuance than non-public debt issuers.

When policy payoffs are state-dependent, party policies do not converge to the median voter's ideal policy if the media report only party policies. News analysis about the state, though possibly biased, can discipline off-equilibrium deviations and make the parties adopt more centrist policies. Since voters are rational, the party favored by the media need not win with a higher probability. Instead, media bias may reduce the effectiveness of electoral competition and lead to more polarized policies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We use data on about 1000 students enrolled on the first-level degree course in business and economics at a medium-sized Italian university. Thanks to the random assignment of students to different teaching classes during their first year, we are able to analyse the effect that teachers with different characteristics, in terms of experience and research productivity, produce both on students' performance, measured in terms of the grades obtained at subsequent examinations, and on courses chosen. Our results suggest that teacher quality has statistically significant effects on students' grades in subsequent courses. These effects are also robust after controlling for unobserved individual characteristics. On the other hand, we find less clear evidence when relating teacher quality to student involvement with a subject. It emerges that research productivity does not produce a statistically significant effect on the probability of a student undertaking additional courses in a subject, while more experienced teachers have a negative impact. However, also this effect does not become statistically significant when we run separate regressions for different disciplines.","Univ Calabria, Dept Econ & Stat, Calabria, Italy",University of Calabria,"De Paola, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dept Econ & Stat, Calabria, Italy.",m.depaola@unical.it,,"DE PAOLA, Maria/0000-0002-1704-4136",,,,,19,9,14,2,16,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0307-3378,,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Their analysis is based on cycle durations as defined by National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) reference dates. However, much of macroeconomic analysis is based on (i) growth cycles (i.e., periods when the economy's production is above or below trend) rather than absolute increases or decreases in economic activity; and (ii) aggregate time series' volatility as the prime indicator of macroeconomic stability. In light of this, we reevaluate the March 1933 break point. First, using HP-filtered quarterly gross national product (GNP), our analysis of growth cycle durations still implies a break point near 1933. Second, we test for structural breaks in the volatility of GNP growth rates and deviations from trends. These tests suggest a structural break considerably later than 1933, perhaps as late as the 1950s.","[Young, Andrew T.; Du, Shaoyin] Univ Mississippi, Dept Econ, University, MS 38677 USA",University of Mississippi,"Young, AT (通讯作者)，Univ Mississippi, Dept Econ, 371 Holman Hall, University, MS 38677 USA.",atyoung@olemiss.edu; sdu1@olemiss.edu,,,,,,,35,1,1,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

The results of our estimation show that real gross domestic product (rGDP) and electricity consumption (ele) are cointegrated and there is only unidirectional Granger causality running from electricity consumption (ele) to (rGDP). Then we applied Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter to decompose the trend and the fluctuation components of the rGDP and electricity consumption (ele) series. The estimation results show that there is cointegration between the trend and the cyclical components of the two series, which seems to suggest that the Granger Causality is possibly related with the business cycle. The paper suggests that investing more and reducing inefficiency in the supply and use of electricity can further stimulate economic growth in Nigeria. The results should, however, be interpreted with caution because of the possibility of loss in power associated with the small sample size and the danger of omitted variable bias that could result from the use of bi-variate analysis.

The participatory design process incorporates normative criteria, including an emphasis on self-sufficiency while also guaranteeing a gradual process of diversification to generate surpluses than can be used for further investment and enrichment of productive, social, political, and environmental infrastructures. The projects in which these principles are being applied involve community networks for producing basic staples as well as new products or modifications of traditional goods that can readily find markets at fair trade prices or can contribute to building solidarity economies. The individual projects incorporate traditional and state of the art technologies, minimizing the use of non-renewable resources and contributing to improving the quality of the environment. Organizational concerns assure rotating systems for positions of political and social control and power, without encroaching upon traditional systems of authority that often temper modern paradigms with inherited mechanisms for making decisions and regulating change.

The competing manufacturers play A la Nash and can be both myopic, both farsighted, or one myopic while the other is farsighted.

Switching into permanent contract are associated with the highest probability of upgrading among those workers who remain with the same employer. In contrast, the highest risk of downgrading among stayers appears when changing from permanent to temporary. An analysis on low pay/no low pay transitions reveals that job mobility always increases the probability of moving from low pay to better-paid jobs among females. For males, in contrast, this occurs only when they were initially employed on a temporary basis. Furthermore, for females it is found that either switching into permanent contract while staying with the same employer, or changing employer while being employed on a permanent basis yield a higher chance of upgrading than staying with the same employer with a permanent contract.","Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Econ, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid,"Blázquez, M (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Econ, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",maite.blazquez@uam.es,"Blazquez, Maite/V-8795-2018","Blazquez, Maite/0000-0002-2152-890X",,,,,49,3,3,0,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-5469,1435-5477,,SPAN ECON REV,Span.

But we observe that emerging market governments have continued to acquire US assets even as yields have fallen, and the incentives for continuing to do so remain strong. Moreover, the Bretton Woods II system, which has clearly been the most resilient of the forces driving current markets, continues to generate low real interest rates in industrial countries and growth in emerging markets that will help limit the damage from the liquidity crisis.","[Dooley, Michael P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Econ, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Folkerts-Landau, David] Deutsch Bank AG London, Deutsch Bank, London EC2 2EQ, England; [Garber, Peter M.] Deutsch Bank, New York, NY 10005 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; Deutsche Bank; Deutsche Bank,"Dooley, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Econ, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",mdooley@cabezoncapital.com; david.folkerts-landau@db.com; Peter.garber@db.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,4,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

The results suggest that gross domestic product series are non-stationary and therefore shocks (both from supply and demand) have persistent effects in the economy. The second exercise tests the hypothesis of an endogenous natural rate of growth, and suggests that potential output has been influenced by the actual level of economic activity in Latin American countries.

We show that there are cases in which privatization, even though it fosters investments in infrastructure, also opens the door to more corruption. The public dissatisfaction towards privatization is then crucially affected by the changes in the degree and pattern of corruption. Our model thus helps understand the seemingly paradoxical situation prevailing in Latin America, where most studies find that privatizations have been efficiency-enhancing and have fostered investments and, at the same time, popular dissatisfaction with the process is extremely high, especially among the middle class. We show that this line of explanation is consistent with the evidence from Surveys in the region. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

At the same time, to create more balanced growth at home and rebalance key bilateral trade and capital flow relationships, China's leadership is trying to increase domestic demand. To complement studies that investigate the high rate of savings in China, this study focuses on the variation in consumption as a share of GDP across provinces between 1979 and 2004. Drawing on well-established consumption theories and work done on savings behavior in China, this paper develops an empirical investigation of the variables hypothesized to influence the pattern of consumption across regions. We find that the normal, economic variables have a small explanatory power if significant at all, while the key variables influencing the macro consumption share are structural, and mostly related to government behavior. For example, local government expenditure on health and education is significant and has a relatively large effect on consumption. Consistent with this we also find a positive relationship between consumption shares and the size of the state sector and the share of tax revenue in GDP. We also find some evidence that financial development has a positive effect on consumption shares.

To interpret interest rate policy, it compares the Federal Reserve's actions with the literature on optimal policy in a liquidity trap. This comparison suggests that policy has been in the direction indicated by theory, but it has not gone far enough. To interpret quantitative policy, the paper reviews the determination of inflation under different policy regimes. The main danger for inflation from current actions is that the Federal Reserve may lose its policy independence; a beneficial side effect of the crisis is that the Friedman rule can be implemented by paying interest on reserves. To interpret credit policy, the paper presents a new model of capital market imperfections with different financial institutions and roles for securitization, leveraging, and mark-to-market accounting. The model suggests that providing credit to traders in securities markets is a more effective response than extending credit to the originators of loans.","Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Reis, R (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,"Reis, Ricardo/B-6868-2009","Reis, Ricardo/0000-0003-4844-9483",,,,,42,15,24,0,12,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

The ZLB contributed little to the sharp output declines in many economies in 2008, but it is a significant factor slowing recovery. Model simulations imply that an additional 4 percentage points of rate cuts would have limited the rise in the U.S. unemployment rate and would bring unemployment and inflation more quickly to steady-state values, but the ZLB precludes these actions, at a cost of $1.8 trillion in forgone U.S. output over four years. If recent events presage a shift to a significantly more adverse macroeconomic climate, then 2 percent steady-state inflation may provide an inadequate buffer against the ZLB, assuming a standard Taylor rule. Stronger countercyclical fiscal policy or alternative monetary policy strategies could mitigate the ZLB's effects, but even with such policies an inflation target of 1 percent or lower could entail significant costs.","Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - San Francisco,"Williams, JC (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA USA.",,"Williams, John C/A-8226-2009",,,,,,53,53,57,0,10,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

Having a social network can help the self-employed access supply and credit networks, and assist in navigating an uncertain institutional environment where permissions and licenses often require interpersonal relationships to facilitate and reduce the informational costs of enforcement by dealing with known persons. Thus, holding other productive and observable traits constant including attitude toward risk where possible, social networks are expected to be a significant correlate to self-employment which is borne out by the evidence. Examining three tranches of the self-employed (those who are self-employed, those who are self-employed as a second job, and a sub-sample who have experienced unemployment and then became self-employed), the paper finds that social networks significantly predict self-employment except for those who are working for themselves as a second job.

We study an economy where capital accumulation and innovative activity take place within a two sector model. The first sector produces a consumption good using physical capital and non skilled labor. Technological progress in the consumption sector is driven by the research activity that takes place in the second sector. Research activity which produces new technologies requires technological capital and skilled labor. New technologies induce an endogenous increase of the total factor productivity of the consumption sector. Physical and technological capital are not substitutable while skilled and non skilled labor may be substitutable. We show that under conditions about the adoption process of new technologies, the optimal strategy for a developing country consists in accumulating physical capital first; postponing the importation of technological capital to the second stage of development. This result is due to a threshold effect from which new technologies begin to have an impact on the productivity of the consumption sector. However, we show that once a certain level of wealth is reached, it becomes optimal for the economy to import technological capital to produce new technologies.","[Bruno, Olivier] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GREDEG CNRS, CERAM Business Sch, Nice, France; [Le Van, Cuong] Univ Paris 01, CNRS, PSE, CES, F-75231 Paris 05, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Cote d'Azur; SKEMA Business School; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Bruno, O (通讯作者)，Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GREDEG CNRS, CERAM Business Sch, Nice, France.",bruno@gredeg.cnrs.fr,,,,,,,32,10,11,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Access allows interest groups to share hard information with the politician in support of their preferred policy. Here selling access maximizes policy utility, while selling policy favors maximizes total contributions. Imposing a binding contribution limit makes it more likely that the politician sells access, which can improve expected constituent welfare. However, a contribution limit distorts the signals associated with the contributions, which tends to result in worse policy. Alternatively, a tax on political contributions can ensure that the politician sells access without distorting his information. Therefore, from the viewpoint of a representative Constituent, a tax on contributions is strictly preferred to a contribution limit or no reform. The politician, however, may prefer regulation in the form of a contribution limit, even when a tax is better for the constituent. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper revisits the Coase conjecture and compares four institutional arrangements based on the combination of land tenure options and local governance forms: private/rental, public/rental, private/owner, and public/owner. The two-period model developed in this paper shows that homeownership may result in more land development than leasehold. Numeric examples suggest (1) public/owner is efficient for uniform distribution of consumer; (2) rentals can be desirable for 'poor' communities; (3) private/owner is more efficient for 'rich' communities; (4) restrictive zoning reduces social surplus.

We find that decisions to engage in intra-firm and arm's-length trade are essentially unrelated to tariff and transport cost reductions over this sample period. Thus, we find that the increase in trade occurred almost entirely on the intensive rather than the extensive margin. This is consistent with case study evidence in Keane and Feinberg (2006), where MNC executives consistently indicate that the modest tariff reductions of the 1984-95 period were not sufficient to justify fixed costs of overhauling international supply chains. Our results have important implications for recent influential models of international trade that rely on sensitivity of intra-firm trade to tariffs at the extensive margin to explain how small tariff declines could have led to the explosion of intra-firm trade since the 1980s. We also find that initial conditions (i.e., 1983 tariffs) are uncorrelated with whether firms engaged in intra-firm or arm's-length trade activity at the start of the sample period. This result is surprising as it implies that firms/industries with a greater propensity to engage in trade were not, in general, successful at lobbying for more favourable tariff treatment.","[.Feinberg, Susan E.] Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA; [Keane, Michael P.] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Feinberg, SE (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA.",Michael.Keane@uts.edu.au,"Keane, Michael/R-6329-2019; Keane, Michael/O-2840-2013","Keane, Michael/0000-0002-3918-1377",,,,,32,10,11,1,13,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0008-4085,,,CAN J ECON,Can.

For that purpose, a two-period model is developed, where agents' preferences on lotteries of life can be represented by a mean and variance utility function allowing, unlike the expected utility form, some sensitivity to what Allais (Econometrica 21(4), 503-546, 1953) calls the 'dispersion of psychological values'. It is shown that if agents ignore the impact of health spending on the return of their savings, the decentralization of the first-best utilitarian optimum requires intergroup lump sum transfers and group-specific positive taxes on health spending. Under asymmetric information, a differentiated taxation across agents is still required, but subsidizing health spending may be optimal as a way to solve the incentive problem.","[Leroux, Marie-Louise] Catholic Univ Louvain, FRS FNRS, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Leroux, Marie-Louise] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Ponthiere, Gregory] Ecole Normale Super, Dept Social Sci, Ecole Econ Paris, PSE, F-75014 Paris, France",Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS; Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Paris School of Economics,"Leroux, ML (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, FRS FNRS, Voie du Roman Pays 34, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.",marie-louise.leroux@uclouvain.be; gregory.ponthiere@ens.fr,,,,,,,23,6,6,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

I find that villagers' reported perceptions do contain real information, and that villagers are sophisticated enough to distinguish between corruption in a particular road project and general corruption in the village. The magnitude of the reported information, however, is small, in part because officials hide corruption where it is hardest for villagers to detect. I also find that there are biases in reported perceptions. The findings illustrate the limitations of relying solely on corruption perceptions, whether in designing anti-corruption policies or in conducting empirical research on corruption.

While both economies have grown considerably, we illustrate significant cross-country differences in wage growth since the late 1980s. For this purpose, we make use of comparable datasets, estimate Mincer equations and perform Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions at the mean and at different points of the wage distribution. The initial wage differential in favor of Indian workers, observed in the middle and upper part of the distribution, partly disappears over time. While the 1980s Indian premium is mainly due to higher returns to education and experience, a combination of price and endowment effects explains why Chinese wages have caught up, especially since the mid-1990s. The price effect is only partly explained by the observed convergence in returns to education; the endowment effect is driven by faster increase in education levels in China and significantly accentuates the reversal of the wage gap in favor of this country for the first half of the wage distribution.","[Bargain, Olivier] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Dublin, IZA, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Bargain, Olivier] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Dublin, CHILD, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Bhaumik, Sumon Kumar] Brunel Univ, William Davidson Inst, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England",University College Dublin; University College Dublin; Brunel University,"Bargain, O (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Dublin, IZA, Dublin 4, Ireland.",olivier.bargain@ucd.ie,"Bargain, Olivier/A-5972-2019","Zhao, Zhong/0000-0003-3587-400X",,,,,42,20,20,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Since decision makers may not view risk in the same way as economists or statisticians (that is, risk = variance of distribution), we also examine alternative measures of risk: the support of the distribution and the probability of earning less than the expected (maximum) profits for the employer. Our results indicate that employers made statistically discriminatory wage offers consistent with loss aversion in our full sample (though the result is driven by the male employer subsample). If one can transfer these results outside of the laboratory, they indicate that discrimination estimates based only on first-moment (mean-based) discrimination are biased.

Imperfect observability generates an incentive for candidates to offer excessive transfers even if voters are homogeneous and taxation is distortionary. Government spending is larger than in a world of perfect observability. Transfers are partly financed through government debt, and the size of the debt is higher in less transparent political systems. The model provides an explanation of fiscal churning; it also predicts that groups whose transfers are less visible to others receive higher transfers, and that imperfect transparency of transfers may lead to underprovision of public goods. From the policy perspective, the main novelty of our analysis is a separate evaluation of the transparency of spending and the transparency of revenues. We show that the transparency of the political system does not unambiguously improve efficiency: transparency of spending is beneficial, but transparency of revenues can be counterproductive because it endogenously leads to increased wasteful spending.","[Gavazza, Alessandro; Lizzeri, Alessandro] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",New York University,"Gavazza, A (通讯作者)，NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,"Gavazza, Alessandro/AAC-3188-2022","Gavazza, Alessandro/0000-0001-9236-5813",,,,,37,35,39,1,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

J,"Lin, CYC",,,,"Lin, C-Y Cynthia",,,Estimating strategic interactions in petroleum exploration,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Petroleum exploration; Strategic interactions; Spatial interactions,OIL; INFORMATION; AUCTIONS,"When individual petroleum-producing firms make their exploration decisions, information externalities and extraction externalities may lead them to interact strategically with their neighbors. If they do occur, strategic interactions in exploration would lead to a loss in both firm profit and government royalty revenue. Since these strategic interactions would be inefficient, changes in the government offshore leasing policy would need to be considered. The possibility of strategic interactions thus poses a concern to policy-makers and affects the optimal government policy. This paper examines whether these inefficient strategic interactions take place in U.S. federal lands in the Gulf of Mexico. In particular, it analyzes whether a firm's exploration decisions depend on the decisions of firms owning neighboring tracts of land. A discrete response model of a firm's exploration timing decision that uses variables based on the timing of a neighbor's lease term as instruments for the neighbor's decision is employed. The results suggest that strategic interactions do not actually take place, at least not in exploration, and therefore that the current parameters of the government offshore leasing policy do not lead to inefficient petroleum exploration.

The 'sanders' believe that corruption is an obstacle to development, while the 'greasers' believe that corruption can (in some cases) foster development. This paper takes a critical look at these positions. It concludes that the evidence supporting the 'greasing the wheels hypothesis' is very weak and shows that there is no correlation between a new measure of managers' actual experience with corruption and GDP growth. Instead, the paper uncovers a strong negative correlation between growth in genuine wealth per capita-a direct measure of sustainable development-and corruption. While corruption may have little average effect on the growth rate of GDP per capita, it is a likely source of unsustainable development.","Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge,"Aidt, TS (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",toke.aidt@econ.cam.ac.uk,"Aidt, Toke/AAC-1068-2020","Aidt, Toke/0000-0002-8319-6568",,,,,72,340,389,5,140,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

On one hand, increased contact among Blacks in more segregated areas may mean that Blacks are better able to coordinate political behavior. On the other hand, lesser contact with non-Blacks may mean that Blacks have less political influence over voters of other races. As for non-Blacks, inter-group conflict theory suggests that greater contact yields greater conflict between the groups while inter-group contact theory suggests exactly the reverse. We investigate this question empirically. We find that exogenous increases in segregation lead to decreases in Black civic efficacy, as measured by an ability to elect Representatives who vote liberally and more specifically in favor of legislation that is favored by Blacks. This tendency for Representatives from more segregated MSAs to vote more conservatively arises in spite of the fact that Blacks in more segregated areas hold more liberal political views than do Blacks in less segregated locales. We find evidence that this decrease in efficacy is driven by more conservative attitudes amongst non-Blacks in more segregated areas. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, the log-normal gravity equation suffers from three problems: the bias created by the logarithmic transformation, the failure of the homoskedasticity assumption, and the way zero values are treated. These problems normally result in biased and inefficient estimates. Recently, the Poisson specification of the trade gravity model has received attention as an alternative to the log-normality assumption (Santos Silva & Tenreyro, 2006). However, the standard Poisson model is vulnerable for problems of overdispersion and excess zero flows. To overcome these problems, this paper considers modified Poisson fixed-effects estimations (negative binomial, zero-inflated). Extending the empirical model put forward by Santos Silva & Tenreyro (2006), we show how these techniques may provide viable alternatives to both the log-normal and standard Poisson specification of the gravity model of trade.","[Burger, Martijn] Erasmus Univ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Van Oort, Frank] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Linders, Gert-Jan] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Utrecht University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Burger, M (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",mburger@ese.eur.nl; f.vanoort@geo.uu.nl; glinders@feweb.vu.nl,"Van Oort, Frank/ABA-9504-2020","Van Oort, Frank/0000-0003-0614-768X",,,,,52,283,332,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

The effects of chronic diseases on labour force participation are assessed indirectly using the parameters estimated from the simultaneous equation model. The results show that both health status and chronic diseases have significant effects on labour force participation.

Minority villages in northeast China are found to have a somewhat better economic situation than the average majority village, but minority villages in the southwest are clearly faring worse. Industrialisation, inputs in agricultural production, stock of human capital of the labour force, wage level on the local labour market as well as indicators of path dependency are all found to affect the economic situation of a village. Location is the single most important circumstance working against a favourable economic situation for minority villages in the northwest and particularly the southwest.

The first half of the paper explains the role of mortgage securitization as a mechanism for allocating risks from real estate investments and discusses what has gone wrong and why in the implementation of this mechanism in the United States. The second half of the paper discusses the incidence of systemic risk in the crisis. Two elements of systemic risk are identified. First, there was excessive maturity transformation through conduits and structured-investment vehicles (SIVs); when this broke down in August 2007, the overhang of asset-backed securities that had been held by these vehicles put significant additional downward pressure on securities prices. Second, as the financial system adjusted to the recognition of delinquencies and defaults in US mortgages and to the breakdown of maturity transformation of conduits and SIVs, the interplay of market malfunctioning or even breakdown, fair value accounting and the insufficiency of equity capital at financial institutions, and, finally, systemic effects of prudential regulation created a detrimental downward spiral in the overall financial system. The paper argues that these developments have not only been caused by identifiably faulty decisions, but also by flaws in financial system architecture. In thinking about regulatory reform, one must therefore go beyond considerations of individual incentives and supervision and pay attention to issues of systemic interdependence and transparency.","Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Hellwig, MF (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Kurt Schumacher Str 10, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",hellwig@coll.mpg.de,,,,,,,84,138,156,3,100,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,JUN,2009,157.0,2,,,,,129,207,,10.1007/s10645-009-9110-0,0.0,,,79,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,477BN,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268491900001,0

The free-riding issue is resolved through threatened nonprovision of the good by the provider. Every bidder is asked to announce his or her virtual value as defined in Myerson (1981). The public good is provided if and only if the sum of the bidders' announced virtual values exceeds the provision cost. When a provision decision results, each bidder pays an amount that is determined by the announcement of other consumers. No one pays when a nonprovision decision results. We find that this mechanism is implementable through an all-pay auction. A restricted profit-maximizing mechanism that implements efficient allocation is also characterized. As in Gradstein (1994), when provision is always efficient, that is, the sum of consumers' values always exceeds the provision cost, efficient allocation is achievable through a profit-maximizer. However, this is not the case when provision is not efficient.","[Lu, Jingfeng] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 117570, Singapore; [Quah, Euston] Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Econ, Singapore 639798, Singapore",National University of Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"Lu, JF (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 117570, Singapore.",ecsljf@nus.edu.sg; ecsquahe@ntu.edu.sg,"Lu, Jingfeng/R-2868-2019","Quah, Euston/0000-0001-6589-4533",,,,,16,2,4,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

In the individual treatment, subjects make choices individually: in the group treatment, each subject placed in a group made lottery choice via voting. In the choice treatment, subjects choose whether to be on their own or in a group. The originality of this research lies in the fact that we introduced variability in sociodemographic characteristics by recruiting salaried and self-employed workers. Our main findings indicate that groups are more likely than individuals to choose safe lotteries. Our results also show that individuals risk attitude is correlated with both the type and the sector of employment. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Rysman, M",,,,"Rysman, Marc",,,The Economics of Two-Sided Markets,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,NETWORK EXTERNALITIES; COMPETITION,"Broadly speaking, a two-sided market is one in which 1) two sets of agents interact through an intermediary or platform, and 2) the decisions of each set of agents affects the outcomes of the other set of agents, typically through an externality. In the case of a video game system, for instance PlayStation, the intermediary is the console producer - Sony - while the two sets of agents are consumers and video game developers. Neither consumers nor game developers will be interested in the PlayStation if the other party is not. Similarly, a successful payment card requires both consumer usage and merchant acceptance, where both consumers and merchants value each others' participation. Many more products fit into this paradigm, such as search engines, newspapers, and almost any advertiser-supported media (examples in which consumers typically negatively value, rather than positively value, the participation of the other side), as well as most software or title-based operating systems and consumer electronics. This paper seeks to explain what two-sided markets are and why they interest economists. I discuss the strategies that firms typically consider, and I highlight a number of puzzling outcomes from the perspective of the economics of two-sided markets. Finally, I consider the implications for public policy, particularly antitrust and regulatory policy, where there have been a number of recent issues involving media, computer operating systems, and payment cards.","Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Rysman, M (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",mrysman@bu.edu,,"Rysman, Marc/0000-0002-1544-2704",,,,,39,509,611,19,261,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

At the beginning of World War II, firms dealt with growing uncertainty by convincing procurement agencies either to use cost-plus contracts or to include an additional risk premium in fixed-price contracts. In the later years of the war, procurement agencies initiated renegotiations over contract clauses to reduce the extraordinary profits resulting from information rents and high-risk premiums. This regulatory course undermined the credibility of the regulatory commitment, thereby weakening the incentives of the fixed-price contracts still in use.","Univ Hohenheim, D-7000 Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Streb, J (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, D-7000 Stuttgart, Germany.",j-streb@uni-hohenheim.de,,"Streb, Jochen/0000-0001-7812-7923",,,,,33,7,8,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

Some important questions concerning trade policy are why a disproportionate share of protection goes to declining industries and why trade policy has an anti-trade bias. We show that if individual preferences exhibit sufficient loss aversion, higher protection will be given to sectors in which profitability is declining. We also show that if the coefficient of loss aversion is large enough, there will be an anti-trade bias in trade policy. Using a nonlinear regression procedure, we find support for the model and the estimates of the loss aversion parameters are very close to those obtained by Kahneman and Tversky (Kahneman, D., Tversky, A., 1992. Advances in Prospect Theory: Cumulative Representation of Uncertainty. journal of Risk and Uncertainty 5, 297-323.) with experimental data. Protection is found to be more responsive to losses than to gains, and the estimates of the coefficient of loss aversion are about 2. We also find evidence of loss aversion in lobby formation.

Central banks in developed and emerging market economies have become increasingly interested in their usefulness for policy analysis and forecasting. This paper reviews some issues and challenges surrounding the use of these models at central banks. It recognises that they offer coherent frameworks for structuring policy discussions. Nonetheless, they are not ready to accomplish all that is being asked of them. First, they still need to incorporate relevant transmission mechanisms or sectors of the economy; second, issues remain on how to empirically validate them; and finally, challenges remain on how to effectively communicate their features and implications to policy makers and to the public. Overall, at their current stage DSGE models have important limitations.

In particular, in any pure strategy equilibrium of our model, administrators do not condition their behavior on any of their private information, despite the fact that they are risk neutral and know their administrative ability.

I propose a simple, realistic extension in which buyers can rebalance their money holdings only sporadically (i.e., not every period). I show that, in such a case, higher inflation can induce buyers to spend their money faster by frontloading their consumption and searching more intensively for transactions.

Agents who know ex ante that they will want to withdraw in the short term will tend to disrupt the ability of a bank to serve customers who are uncertain about their timing, of withdrawal. An adverse selection problem arises, where short-term deposits have the incentive to join the financial system and limit, or completely do away with, banks' liquidity provision service. Oil the other hand, potentially beneficial long-term funds will not be deposited in banks. Further, when unpredicted short-term withdrawal needs are sufficiently high, bank reserves are exhausted. and long-term investments need to be disrupted, causing a banking crisis.","Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA",University of New Mexico,"Fontenla, M (通讯作者)，Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, MSC05 3060,1, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",fontenla@unm.edu,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

The choice correspondence governs behavior when the proposer actually plays a game, and the preference ordering governs the proposer's willingness to play a particular game.

It is, therefore, not surprising that a 2006 Gallup survey found that 29 percent of the workforce was required to hold a license from a government agency (Kleiner and Krueger 2008). Licensing affects a much larger percentage of workers than either the minimum wage or unionization. In 2003, less than 3 percent of hourly workers were paid the minimum wage (Kaufman and Hotchkiss, 2006, 283). for unionization, we reproduce Figure 1 from Kleiner and Krueger (2008); licensing affects about two and a half times more workers than unionization. Licensing is one of the most important forms of labor regulation, yet textbooks in labor economics give it scant attention.

Here, we experiment with alternative constructions of star status and with additional control variables in the analysis and find further supporting evidence. Conditioning star status upon prior adoption of stents yields significant effects on the utilization of stents by nonstars. In contrast, the results show no evidence that the number of nonstars present affects the utilization of stars. Moreover, the empirical effect is stronger when the definition of star physicians is restricted to those with more recent residency training.

They causally affect the development of capabilities. Both cognitive and noncognitive capabilities determine success in life but to varying degrees for different outcomes. An empirically determined technology of capability formation reveals that capabilities are self-productive and cross-fertilizing and can be enhanced by investment. Investments in capabilities are relatively more productive at some stages of a child's life cycle than others. Optimal child investment strategies differ depending on target outcomes of interest and on the nature of adversity in a child's early years. For some configurations of early disadvantage and for some desired outcomes, it is efficient to invest relatively more in the later years of childhood than in the early years.

We develop a general equilibrium model with occupation-specific human capital and heterogeneous experience levels within occupations. We find that the model, calibrated to match the level of occupational mobility in the 1970's, accounts quite well for the level of (within-group) wage inequality in that period. Next, we find that the model, calibrated to match the increase in occupational mobility, accounts for over 90% of the increase in wage inequality between the 1970's and the 1990's.

We introduce asymmetric information in the insurance market whereby private insurance companies cannot identify the risk probability of the agents, and we examine its effect on public policy. We consider the separating equilibrium of Rothschild and Stiglitz (Quarterly Journal of Economics, 90, 629-649, 1976) and Riley (Econometrica, 47, 331-359, 1979) where the low risk agent is only partially insured. The presence of the distortion in the insurance market changes the affinity of labor, and in some cases, we show that the scope of redistribution and the resulting social welfare are higher under asymmetric information than under full information. We also show that the increase in social insurance affects the utility and labor incentive of the low risk type by relaxing the self-selection constraint in the insurance market. The policy implications of the redistributive taxation and social insurance are analytically and numerically examined.","[Nishimura, Yukihiro] Yokohama Natl Univ, Yokohama, Kanagawa 240, Japan; [Nishimura, Yukihiro] Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",Yokohama National University; Queens University - Canada,"Nishimura, Y (通讯作者)，Yokohama Natl Univ, Yokohama, Kanagawa 240, Japan.",ynishimu@ynu.ac.jp,,,,,,,21,2,2,1,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Thus, changes in the anticipated threat of inspection should affect firm compliance. Like environmental protection agencies in several other countries, the Norwegian agency typically emphasizes compliance with institutional requirements (e.g. firm-internal routines and auditing systems) rather than emission caps. Using a panel dataset of polluting Norwegian plants, we find that the threat of inspection significantly reduces the probability of serious violation. However, emissions are not significantly affected. We point at various reasons for the regulator to emphasize institutional requirements, but we also argue that the lack of effect on emissions encourages the agency to review the pros and cons of the common emphasis on institutional requirements over emissions.","Stat Norway, Res Dept, N-0033 Oslo, Norway",Statistics Norway,"Telle, K (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, Res Dept, POB 8131, N-0033 Oslo, Norway.",kjetil.telle@ssb.no,,,,,,,36,13,13,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

All of the fundamental macroeconomic variables evolve according to a process combining a Brownian motion with Poisson jumps. Specifically, the Brownian motion reproduces the fluctuations that are observed every day and the Poisson process models atypical movements (booms or falls) that occasionally occur. The proposed model incorporates the exposure of the agents (consumers, firms, and government) to the different financial risks affecting their decision making processes and considers explicitly the effects of uncertainty on fiscal and monetary policy in the equilibrium. In the equilibrium, the inflation rate, the rate of capital accumulation, the tax rate on wealth, and the asset returns are endogenously determined.","Inst Politecn Nacl, Escuela Super Econ, Mexico City 07738, DF, Mexico",Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico,"Venegas-Martínez, F (通讯作者)，Inst Politecn Nacl, Escuela Super Econ, Mexico City 07738, DF, Mexico.",fvenegas@ipn.mx,"Venegas-Martinez, Francisco/F-9635-2010","Venegas-Martinez, Francisco/0000-0003-1157-0298",,,,,10,3,6,0,3,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC ECONOMIA",MEXICO,"CIRCUITO INTERIOR S-N EDIFICIO B, PRIMER PISO, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO, DISTRITO FEDERAL 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

The process of reconciliation that began after 1989 has not progressed as well as one would have hoped, especially after the consensus about signing a Declaration of reconciliation in 1997. Economic relations between the two countries are intense, and the integration of the Czech republic in the EU in 2004 has lessened the asymmetry that long characterized the relationship.

However, it is also true that per capita data does not adequately account for individuals who have fallen into the poverty trap, as in China: a widening gap is developing between the rich and the poor due to a disparity in income and employment opportunities, among other factors, between rural and urban residents, and this gap is not reflected in mean (per capita) parameters.

We argue that the increasing prevalence of non-exclusive software gives rise to indirect network effects that exist between users of competing and incompatible hardware platforms. This is because software non-exclusivity, like hardware compatibility, allows a software firm to sell to a market broader than a single platform's installed base. We look for evidence of market-wide network effects by estimating a model of hardware demand and software supply. Our software supply equation allows the supply of games for a particular platform to depend not only on the installed base of that platform, but also on the installed base of competing platforms. Our results indicate the presence of both a platform-specific network effect and-in recent years-a cross-platform (or generation-wide) network effect, Our finding that the scope of indirect network effects in this industry has widened suggests one reason that this market, which is often cited as a canonical example of one with strong indirect network effects, is no longer dominated by a single platform.

However, at close examination, codecision and the current budgetary process show an identical structure. Both are designed as non-cooperative alternating offers bargaining games between institutions and both, although in different measure, have gone through periods of interinstitutional deadlocks and conflicts, which can be ascribed to the insufficiency of the non-cooperative bargaining setup with respect to the task of providing for joint-decision making by the Parliament and the Council of Ministers: in particular, the opportunistic interpretation of the Treaty provisions by the Parliament in the 1980s was one of the consequences of the strict bargaining design. The article argues that the lacking elements for joint decision making have been gradually inserted in the procedures by means of informal negotiation institutions, which are not only mechanisms for equilibrium selection but also corrective devices to strict non-cooperative procedures. Informal institutions will play a fundamental role also in the change from the current budgetary procedure to the one designed in the 2007 Reform Treaty, where the Parliament does not seem to gain a 'dominant position', the Commission improves its scope for action and the Council consolidates its role.

The resulting Brown-von Neumann-Nash dynamics are a benchmark example for myopic adjustment dynamics that, in contrast to replicator dynamics. allow for innovation, but require less rationality than the best response dynamics. This paper studies the BNN dynamics for games with infinitely many strategies. We establish Nash stationarity for continuous payoff functions. For negative semidefinite games (that include zero sum games), we generalize the results of Brown and von Neumann. In addition, we show that evolutionarily robust Nash equilibria are asymptotically stable. A complete stability analysis for doubly symmetric games is also obtained. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We show that the self-confirming equilibrium under adaptive expectations is the same as the steady state rational expectations equilibrium for all admissible parameter values, but that dynamics around the steady state are substantially different between the two equilibria. The differences are driven mainly by the dampened wealth effect and the strengthened intertemporal substitution effect, not by escapes emphasised by Williams (2003). Consequently, adaptive expectations can be an important source of frictions that amplify and propagate technology shocks and seem promising for generating plausible labour market dynamics.","[Huang, Kevin X.

I look at arguments for its resilience or continued use and how there is an inbuilt mechanism in liberalized capital that tends to reinforce the use of the dollar, and how this is to the advantage of the United States. I then look at the various ways in which the dollar has become increasingly vulnerable as a reserve currency because of the current constitution of the U. S. economy and because of its mutual dependency with China. I also set out how finance and other markets can go into sudden decline because of these vulnerabilities and how the constitution of the markets themselves can exacerbate this. Both of these factors, I argue, are problematic for the system, and provide the basis on which the dollar may ultimately cease to be the unofficial reserve currency.","Univ Helsinki, Ctr Excellence Global Governance, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Morgan, J (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Ctr Excellence Global Governance, POB 4,Yliopistonkatu 5, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",zen34405@zen.co.uk,,,,,,,40,7,8,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

I study the enforcement of property rights in the mining camps of the American West. Miners demanded secure property rights and protection from violence to exploit the region's mineral wealth. In the model, miners must divide their labor between mining and supporting property rights institutions. The main prediction of the model is that cooperation in property rights enforcement emerges only when social norms of cooperation are sufficiently widespread. The model also predicts that social norms are less effective in mining camps with large populations or high labor productivity. I test these predictions against detailed evidence from the letters diaries and,, reminiscences of miners in 25 camps in California, Colorado, and Montana and find that the evidence supports the predictions. The results show that social norms can significantly lower the costs of collective action in large groups. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we analyse whether, in the course of transposition, EU directives pass the respective national parliaments or not. Neglected in the scientific literature so far, this question is highly relevant from a normative political perspective and complements the debate on the EU's democratic deficit by focusing on the national implementation of EU law. Based on information contained in CELEX and EUR-lex, our newly constructed dataset allows us to analyse Member States' transposition performances in a novel fashion, namely across time, Member States as well as policy areas. Our empirical analysis reveals generally low primary transposition ratios. Put differently, most of EU directives are transposed by national executives rather than national legislators. Further, remarkable differences in primary transposition ratios are detected along all three data dimensions. We hypothesize that national political-institutional constellations, economic sector characteristics and EU membership benefits are the main explanatory factors behind these differences.

In particular, we examine whether labour demand in multinationals becomes less elastic with respect to the wage if the plant has backward linkages with the local economy. Our empirical evidence, based on a rich plant level dataset, shows that the extent of local linkages does indeed generally reduce the wage elasticity of labour demand. This result is economically important and holds for a number of different specifications.","[Gorg, Holger] Univ Nottingham, GEP, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Henry, Michael] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England; [Strobl, Eric] Ecole Polytech Paris, Paris, France; [Walsh, Frank] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",University of Nottingham; Aston University; University College Dublin,"Görg, H (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, GEP, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",Frank.Walsh@ucd.ie,"Henry, Michael/AAD-5868-2022","Henry, Michael/0000-0002-2868-9634; Walsh, Frank/0000-0003-1397-2012",,,,,29,14,15,0,4,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0008-4085,,,CAN J ECON,Can.

Detailed regional analyses are thus possible in countries where only limited regional statistics are available. Alhough regional price differentials play important roles in multiregional settings, transport does not receive much attention in existing models. This paper formulates a spatial CGE model that explicitly considers the transport sector and FOB/CIF prices. After describing the model, the performance of our model is evaluated by comparing the benchmark equilibrium for China with a survey-based interregional I-O table for 1987. The structure of Chinese economies is summarized using information obtained from the benchmark equilibrium computation. This includes regional and sectoral production distributions and price differentials. The equilibrium for 1997 facilitates discussion of changes in regional economic structures that China has experienced in the decade.","[Ando, Asao] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Informat Sci, Sendai, Miyagi 980, Japan",Tohoku University,"Ando, A (通讯作者)，Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Informat Sci, Sendai, Miyagi 980, Japan.",ando@m.tains.tohoku.ac.jp,"Meng, Bo/AAP-5042-2020","Meng, Bo/0000-0003-1179-5390",,,,,23,10,11,3,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0953-5314,,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

FMCDM methods are widely used when imprecise data or linguistic variables exist in the problem. Using FMCDM methods may help improve decision-making problems and lead to more accurate models. Although these methods are more involved in terms of computing due to fuzzy calculations in MCDM algorithms, fuzziness offers advantages over classical algorithms. Thus appropriate software is of great importance in applying FMCDM methods. The major aim of this study is to develop software and to test it on two real military problems which are solved by an ideal points algorithm and an outranking method.

An empirical investigation of panel data (125 Countries and covering the period 1980-2002) makes it possible not to reject the hypothesis that corruption has a negative effect on public revenues collection. However, the impact is different on the various components of revenue. This is because different rent opportunities are created by corruption which seems to modify public revenues structure in favour of customs tariffs revenues while reducing direct and indirect taxes such as VAT. It also appears that a major channel of corruption is the weakening of the tax morality which in this study is captured by various public service delivery variables.","[Attila, Gbewopo; Chambas, Gerard; Combes, Jean-Louis] Univ Clermont 1, CERDI, UMR, CNRS, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France",Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Attila, G (通讯作者)，Univ Clermont 1, CERDI, UMR, CNRS, 65 Blvd Francois Mitterrand, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France.",g.attila@u-clermont1.fr,,,,,,,59,8,8,0,5,DE BOECK UNIV,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

Overall, the analysis supports the view that FDI has a stronger positive impact on economic growth in countries with a higher level of education attainment, openness to international trade and stock market development, and a lower rate of population growth and lower level of risk. Thus, countries undertaking reform of cross-border capital restrictions and controls and initiating other policy aimed at encouraging FDI need to ensure that broader social policy objectives-such as education and institutional reform-are also undertaken to leverage the benefits from FDI.","[Batten, Jonathan A.] Macquarie Univ, Grad Sch Management, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Vo, Xuan Vinh] Univ NSW, Dept Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Batten, Jonathan A.] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Macquarie University; University of New South Wales Sydney; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Batten, JA (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Grad Sch Management, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",jabatten@ust.hk,"Batten, Jonathan/J-3838-2013","Batten, Jonathan/0000-0002-3871-7360; Vo, Xuan Vinh/0000-0002-3868-8176",,,,,63,69,79,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The purpose of the present article is to examine the market dynamics and dichotomous nature of Taiwanese manufacturing. A model of dynamic adjustment of industry structure is considered when both the speed of adjustment and the long-run market concentration are allowed to vary across industries. We use 118 four-digit manufacturing industries for empirical analysis of our models spanning between 1981 and 1991. Empirical findings show that both the speed of adjustment and long-run industry concentration are predominantly determined by minimum efficient scale. The speed of adjustment is much faster in a small open economy like Taiwan compared to mature economies like the US and Australia. In addition, the dichotomous nature of the market is supported in our findings for both periods, viz, 1981-1986 and 1986-1991, albeit weaker for the later period.","[Bhattacharya, Mita] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Caulfield 3145, Australia; [Chen, Jong-Rong] Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Ind Econ, Chungli, Taiwan",Monash University; National Central University,"Bhattacharya, M (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Caulfield 3145, Australia.",Mita.Bhattacharya@Buseco.monash.edu.au,,"Bhattacharya, Mita/0000-0002-4483-2189",,,,,28,2,2,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this article, we formulate a univariate test for symmetry, based on the third central moment and extend it to a multivariate test; the test does not require modelling and it is robust against serial correlation, Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (ARCH) and nonnormality. In the empirical application of the test it is found that orthodox theory seem to be supported; consumption expenditure on durable goods is found to be symmetric while consumption expenditure on nondurable goods is asymmetric for the USA and the UK, with peaks being higher than troughs are deep. Also, the empirical importance of the choice between the univariate and the multivariate test for possibly correlated series is underscored; the results from the two approaches clearly differ. Given the widespread practice of using consumption expenditure on nondurable goods as the dependent variable in linear models for the USA and the UK, our results might be noteworthy.","[Holgersson, Thomas] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, S-55111 Jonkoping 11, Sweden; [Bjellerup, Marten] Minist Finance, S-10333 Stockholm, Sweden",Jonkoping University,"Holgersson, T (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Box 1026, S-55111 Jonkoping 11, Sweden.",thomas.holgersson@ihh.hj.se,,,,,,,18,6,6,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A transaction cost economics perspective is employed, taking advantage of a distinct and comprehensive firm-level data set. This is investigated as a whole-set sample of all overseas affiliates and as a sample of only partially owned affiliates using a number of analytical techniques. The paper shows that the choice of equity ownership structure is affected by the characteristics of various host countries. We find that the MNF prefers sharing control rights with a local partner when its affiliate is in a resources-based sector, when it enters a country with a large black market. or when there is large socio-cultural difference between the home and the host country.

The results indicate that within the European flexicurity models Romania falls into the large group of Central and Eastern European Model, with a low level of security and internal and functional flexibility.","[Son, Liana; Sipos, Ciprian] W Univ Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania",West University of Timisoara,,silviaciuca@incsmps.ro; danielapasnicu@yahoo.corn; liana.son@fse.uvt.ro; ciprian.sipos@fse.uvt.ro; miordan@ipe.ro,"Pasnicu, Daniela S/A-2894-2015; Sipos, Ciprian/F-4951-2012","Sipos, Ciprian/0000-0001-9101-9046",,,,,23,2,2,0,10,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

We note that the total number Of actual announcements for the firms in our sample follows the business cycle quite closely. We then examine changes over time in standard summary statistics (means medians,, friction positive) of the distribution Of stock market reactions, measured by the Cumulative excess returns (CER) of firms' stock prices over a 3-day event window centered on the announcement date, as well as changes over time in kernel density estimates of this distribution. We find clear evidence that the distribution of stock market reactions shifted to the right (became less negative) over time. One possible explanation for this change is that, over the last three decades, RIFs designed to improve efficiency have become more common relative to RIFs designed to cope with reductions in product demand. We estimate multivariate regression models of the CER controlling for the stated reason for the announced layoff, industry, and other characteristics of the announced layoff. We find that almost none of the decline in the negative average stock price reaction between the 1970s and 1990s can be explained by these factors. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we identify three innovations-one in each of these areas-that could be made to the American mortgage market that would help obtain the government's objectives while enhancing financial market stability-particularly if all are done together. These three innovations are: (1) buy your own mortgage options, (2) variable maturity mortgages, and (3) creation of a government mortgage bond insurer, with an emphasis on insuring covered bonds as well as GSE debt. The first innovation would allow homebuyers to repurchase their mortgage at the market value of their homes when they move, thereby helping society avoid some of the deadweight losses associated with unnecessary foreclosures. The second innovation would provide a mortgage that could promote affordable housing without unduly raising the default risks of low- and moderate-income families. The third innovation would help create a variety of financing options for mortgages in the United States. Moreover, it could be integrated into the current system of mortgage financing, which would include government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), in a manner that would help the government manage the systemic risks associated with the quasi-government backing of mortgage credit and mortgage insurance. In particular, we propose that the government explicitly insure pre-designated financial instruments used to fund mortgage credit (such as covered bonds and GSE debt) by creating a government-backed insurance fund similar to that currently used for deposits.",,,,diana.hancock@frb.gov; wpassmore@frb.gov,,,,,,,7,8,8,0,7,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Agents are matched assortatively on the basis of costly signals. Asymmetries in signalling activity between the two sides of the market can be explained by asymmetries either in size or in heterogeneity. Our main results identify general conditions under which the potential increase in expected output due to assortative matching (relative to random matching) is offset by the costs of signalling. Finally, we examine the limit model with a continuum of agents and point out differences and similarities to the finite version. Technically, the paper is based on the elegant theory about stochastic order relations among differences of order statistics, pioneered by Barlow and Proschan in 1966 in the framework of reliability theory.","[Hoppe, Heidrun C.] Leibniz Univ Hannover, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Moldovanu, Benny] Univ Bonn, D-5300 Bonn, Germany; [Sela, Aner] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel",Leibniz University Hannover; University of Bonn; Ben Gurion University,"Hoppe, HC (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",,,,,,,,61,76,89,3,41,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Although the controls began in September 1998, the effectiveness of Malaysian capital controls has not been demonstrated. This article analyzes the regressions using dummy variables and by constructing a profit rate differential index over the period of the changes in controls as an independent variable. These variables are composed of the profit rate differentials between Malaysia and the US and the levy on repatriation of profits after the introduction of the controls. This paper estimates the impact of the controls not only on gross capital flows but also on net capital flows in order to determine whether the controls were successful. The regression results suggest that gross and net capital flows were influenced by the introduction of the controls, and that they fluctuated because of changes in the controls. The net capital inflows continued to decrease after the controls were lifted. In addition, investors did not depend on the profit differential after the 12-month holding rule was replaced with the exit levy system. This indicates that the process of liberalizing and abolishing strict capital controls may encourage capital outflows.","Kyoto Sangyo Univ, Fac Business Adm, Kyoto, Japan",Kyoto Sangyo University,"Inoguchi, M (通讯作者)，Kyoto Sangyo Univ, Fac Business Adm, Kyoto, Japan.",inoguchi@cc.kyoto-su.ac.jp,,"Inoguchi, Masahiro/0000-0003-3661-682X",,,,,33,4,4,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Especially, Korean won depreciation improves Korea-US trade balance according to the Marshall-Lerner condition while the J-curve effect between Korea and Japan exists with a little improvement of deterioration of trade balance followed by Korean won depreciation. In addition, domestic economic growth is found to improve persistent trade deficits against Japan and mitigate trade surplus with the US.

Based on a oligopoly model where each representative firm competing in Cournot fashion, we demonstrate that the preferential trade arrangement increases the multinational firms' incentives to shift its entry mode from greenfield investment to cross-border M&A. Moreover, greenfield investment is a welfare dominant FDI entry mode for the host country while cross-border M&A might be preferred by multinational firms when the strategic effects of M&A are considered in addition to the asymmetric technology transfer effects of two entry modes. Finally, it is shown that there exists a unique equilibrium policy intervention to induce the choice of greenfield investment when the multinational firm's marginal cost is lower than the critical value.

Whether or not such low targets can be achieved in the long-term depends on a number of assumptions about, for instance, technological change and the willingness of countries to immediately join a post-Kyoto agreement to limit anthropogenic climate change. As part of the EMF22 international scenarios study, our paper contributes to the ongoing discussion by conducting a scenario analysis in order to examine the influence of these assumptions on the feasibility of a set of radiative forcing targets. We distinguish between first-best scenarios with full participation, and second-best scenarios with delayed participation of Brazil, China, India, and Russia in 2030 and the rest of Non-Annex I countries after 2050. In addition, we explored the robustness of our first-best scenario results by varying the assumptions with regard to availability of key technology clusters. Accounting for the deep uncertainties associated with future global mean temperature change, we conduct a probabilistic assessment and explore the scenario's likelihood for staying below a range of different temperature thresholds. Our results indicate the need for a diverse portfolio of mitigation technologies in order to decarbonize the energy system. Efficiency and enhanced energy conservation play an important role across all scenarios. In addition, carbon Capture and storage (CCS) is found to be important for achieving particularly low forcing targets as well as for avoiding pronounced overshoot of the target in the medium-term. Negative emission technologies such as bioenergy, with CCS have a Strong influence on the timing of mitigation; i.e. without their availability much more early action is needed. According to our analysis, significant delay in the participation of major emitters leads to the unattainability of the most stringent forcing targets. Moreover, delayed participation may lead to excessive additional global mitigation cost that may even exceed the mitigation costs of the most stringent forcing targets in the best case with full participation. We find that for countries that significantly delay their participation, the early gains from postponing mitigation may be offset to a large extent in the long-term, due to the need for more pronounced mitigation later in the century. Linking the radiative forcing targets with temperature change, we find that the chances of staying below certain temperature thresholds may be significantly lower over the course of the century than would be by looking exclusively at 2100. From a policy perspective our results therefore suggest that focusing on early abatement to avoid significant overshoot of concentrations may be as important as the long-term concentration target itself.

The study reveals that structural changes in the financial and real sectors during the examined period have made an impact on the way in which the macroeconomy affects business failures. In particular, business failures are increasingly reacting to monetary policy changes in the post-1980 period. Furthermore, the shocks to business failures can generate large fluctuations in macroeconomic aggregates, suggesting the importance of corporate balance sheets in financial stability and economic growth.

Secondly, for any given set of entry thresholds, a second-price sealed-bid auction with properly set reserve prices and entry subsidy is revenue-maximizing. Thirdly, a variety of auctions are revenue-maximizing within the symmetric threshold-entry class. Two of them involve no entry subsidy (fee). Fourthly, we identify sufficient conditions under which it is in the seller's interest to limit the number of potential bidders even if the revenue-maximizing symmetric threshold-entry auction is adopted. Lastly, the revenue-maximizing auction implements asymmetric entry across symmetric bidders in many cases.","Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 117570, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Lu, JF (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 117570, Singapore.",ecsljf@nus.edu.sg,"Lu, Jingfeng/R-2868-2019",,,,,,11,23,25,1,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Specifically, we address the issue of instability of coefficients over time, and propose two alternative estimation procedures based, firstly, on a moving sample of observations and, secondly, on a moving average of estimated coefficients in single period equations. The statistical tests applied support the proposed methodologies. On empirical grounds two conclusions can be emphasized. Firstly, our study concludes that, taking quality changes into account, car prices in Spain deflated by consumer price index (CPI) declined by 40% between 1981 and 2005. This result is robust to the alternative estimation procedures employed in the study. Secondly, an analysis of sigma-convergence shows that for quality adjusted prices a clear trend in sigma-convergence emerges between 1986 and 1992, whereas such a trend does not exists for observed prices.

Because China evolves in the global fragmentation of production with low value chain manufacturing, wage of unskilled labor has been pressed. At the same time, the technology spill-over and innovation upgrade the value chain of industry, which increases the demand for skilled labor.

An increase in daily smoking frequency corresponded with a decrease in happiness ( = -0.004, 95% confidence interval -0.006 to -0.001). Independent of this relationship, happiness decreased as health deteriorated with a transition to the poorest health group associated with greatest unhappiness ( = -0.190, 95% confidence interval -0.258 to -0.123) followed by those in the next poorest health group ( = 0.114, 95% confidence interval -0.176 to -0.051) and as health improved further, the effect on happiness diminished ( = -0.077, 95% confidence interval -0.127 to -0.027) indicating a dose-repose relationship between health and happiness. Smokers who reduce cigarette consumption can expect greater happiness in a relationship that is not mediated by changes in health. This relationship is interpreted as cigarettes showing reference dependence.","Cardiff Univ, Sch Dent, Wales Coll Med Biol & Life Sci, Cardiff CF14 4XY, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,"Moore, SC (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Sch Dent, Wales Coll Med Biol & Life Sci, Heath Pk, Cardiff CF14 4XY, S Glam, Wales.",mooresc2@cardiff.ac.uk,,"Moore, Simon/0000-0001-5495-4705",,,,,18,11,11,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The key element in observing the effects of consumption externalities on stationary consumption and capital is the endogeneity of the time preference rate, which depends on future-oriented resources rather than on private consumption. We conclude that when individuals experience jealousy, they become more impatient, leading to a lower level of capital stock and a higher level of consumption relative to those of the social optimum, while when they experience admiration, these relationships are reversed. We examine an optimal tax policy that replicates the socially optimal path in the centrally planned economy.

This paper aims to examine the relationship between the US trade balance and related economic variables by constructing a six-dimensional version of the structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model. According to our empirical results, a reduction in the US fiscal deficits cannot reduce the US imbalances. Despite reduction in trade deficits, the US recession can damage the world economy. The expansion of overseas economies is required to reduce global imbalances without global recession. One of our implications is that foreign countries should increase domestic demand.

Moreover, the post-war growth of the mining industry developed not on the basis of the long-term industrial requirements of the country but around the raw material requirements of an emergent Japan. Even the sintering and smelting projects came about on the initiative of Japan based on the latter's narrow development agenda for the host country. The paper, however, argues that present-day globalisation realities dictate that the Philippines and other similarly situated developing countries should focus on activities with the highest potentials for value addition, job creation and sustained development in their industrialisation efforts. For this, strategic industrial visioning and an activist State capable of translating the vision into concrete doables and follow-ups are still in order, which require investment in innovation, and good labour and human resources management practices.","Univ Philippines, Sch Labor & Ind Relat, Quezon City 1101, Philippines",University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman,"Ofreneo, RE (通讯作者)，Univ Philippines, Sch Labor & Ind Relat, Quezon City 1101, Philippines.",reneofreneo@yahoo.com,,,,,,,25,8,8,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

The proposed branch-and-bound algorithm with simplicial partitions for global optimization uses a combination of 2 types of Lipschitz bounds. One is an improved Lipschitz bound with the first norm. The other is a combination of simple bounds with different norms. The efficiency of the proposed global optimization algorithm is evaluated experimentally and compared with the results of other well-known algorithms.

Do firms adjust their capital structure in response to higher idiosyncratic risk? And if so, could that affect the performance of the aggregate economy? Using a dynamic general equilibrium model we show that in the presence of larger firm-specific risk, firms shift the composition of their balance sheets towards more self-financing and away from debt. In the presence of financial accelerator-like frictions, larger idiosyncratic risk translates into greater external financing costs, steering firms to borrow less to counteract larger premia. Model simulations suggest that larger idiosyncratic risk dampens the financial accelerator and can lead to a reduction in output volatility of up to 40 percent; and up to a 16 percent decline in firm leverage.","[Portes, Luis San Vicente; Ozenbas, Deniz] Montclair State Univ, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA",Montclair State University,"Portes, LSV (通讯作者)，Montclair State Univ, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA.",portesl@mail.montclair.edu; ozenbasd@mail.montclair.du,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

This study views women's empowerment from an emancipation perspective. The study uses quasi-experimental approach to compare women's empowerment between microcredit borrowers and non-borrowers. Using control-group method (non-borrowers from non-programme villages), this study identifies factors that influence women's empowerment. It also examines the impact on women's empowerment of borrowers having different levels of income. Results show that non-borrowers are equally empowered as microcredit borrowers. It has also been found that age and education levels of women are significant factors in such an empowerment.","[Rahman, Sayma] Yanbu Univ Coll, Dept Management Informat Syst, Yanbu, Saudi Arabia; [Junankar, P.

The return may be exogenous though fiscal transfers to the young and/or the old or endogenous through dividend payments to a subset of old households that have acquired financial sector equity. Returning financial profits to the old, either exogenously or endogenously, unambiguously reduces growth, but through the two respective mechanisms of consumption-smoothing and of encouraging 'unproductive saving'. As the latter is the more powerful, a public pension paid for by taxing financial profits will raise steady-state growth rate. However, the main results are that if profits are returned to the young, growth will be highest with monopolistic finance, if the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is sufficiently low; and, generally, the number of Nash-Cournot financial firms that maximizes growth is increasing in the value of this parameter.","Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Roberts, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",mark.roberts@nottingham.ac.uk,,,,,,,24,3,3,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

As informational and telecommunication technologies, virtual organizations and networks are quickly developing, the constant change of environment stipulates the need to adjust and change strategy of organization in line with the global changes of science, business, technologies, politics and society. Following the assumptions formulated in the former theoretical researches, the methodology for evaluation of management accounting changes in Lithuanian business organizations was created The research was performed in order to identify condition of management accounting systems in Lithuanian organizations, determine trends of their development. It also had to clarify changes of adoption and application of management accounting instruments, factors that influenced changes and adequacy of management accounting changes. The following steps of research were conducted: the analysis of financial, managerial and activity reports and indicators; the analysis of the main events; the analysis of company type dynamics; the analysis of management accounting tools application changes. It should be mentioned that during the research the main trends of management accounting systems development and changes in Lithuanian business companies were distinguished They indicated relations among financial results of companies, expectations of shareholders and applicable management accounting tools. The research showed that the type of an organization and the application of management accounting tools depend on the stage of company's life cycle. The second important aspect was that the application of management accounting tools and their complexity depend on an organization type. The research also validated the assumption that changes of management accounting are directly stipulated by financial results and expectations/objectives of shareholders and management, but not less important is the fact that such component as shareholders' objectives and hopes should be taken into consideration. Such external factors as situation in the global economy, competition, changes of science, business, technologies, politics, and society are important but are indirect and also influence expectations and financial results of organizations. The last important outcome of research is that rapidity of management accounting changes depends on an organization type. Taking into account the results of theoretical and empirical research, the trend of the future research was targeted to the development of a reliable balanced management accounting model, which would allow selecting the set of management accounting tools for a particular business organization type and avoiding deficiency or surplus of methods used.","[Strumickas, Marius; Valanciene, Loreta] Kaunas Univ Technol, Laisves Av 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Strumickas, M (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Laisves Av 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",mariusstrumickas@yahoo.com; loreta.valanciene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,27,18,18,0,3,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We aim to provide a comprehensive discussion of the significance of the variables in the long-run context as stationary relationships for both. zero and bi-annual frequencies. For this purpose, several restrictions have been used to impose for identification purposes of the relevant vectors. We also touch upon the possibility that most time series data have been subject to the stochastic seasonality as opposed to the general acceptance in empirical papers. Our results employing data from the Turkish economy show that it is not possible to estimate only a single theory-accepted money demand relationship in the long-run variable space for both zero and bi-annual frequences, but we are able to identify different vectors somewhat consistent with theoretical arguments for the annual frequency.","Okan Univ, Banking & Finance Dept, Istanbul, Turkey",Okan University,"Tasseven, O (通讯作者)，Okan Univ, Banking & Finance Dept, Istanbul, Turkey.",ozlem.tasseven@okan.edu.tr,,,,,,,26,1,1,0,1,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2009,56.0,1,,,,,39,53,,10.2298/PAN0901039T,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,434CQ,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000265253200003,0

Nonetheless, there are cross-country and cross-regional differences when it comes to effective use of foreign aid.

In contrast, little is known about such strategies in wartime. This paper studies the use of cattle as a buffer stock by Rwandan households during 1991-2001, a period characterized by civil war and genocide. It is found that the probability of selling cattle increases upon the occurrence of both peacetime and wartime covariant adverse income shocks. The peacetime cattle sales are largely explained by shifts in the household asset portfolio. In contrast, in 1994, the year of the genocide, almost half of the cattle sales were motivated by the need to buy food. However, we argue that the effectiveness of this coping strategy was severely reduced due to the wartime conditions. First, during the year of ethnic violence, cattle prices plummeted to less than half of their pregenocide value. Second. we find that households most targeted in the violence did not sell cattle. We discuss several explanations for this latter finding. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Was this emission reduction just the fortuitous result of the major economic transformation undergone by countries in transition? Or is it rather a result of more stringent environmental policy? The objective of the article is to answer this question through a simultaneous equation model of the demand (emissions) and supply (environmental stringency) of pollution. The supply equation takes into account the institutional quality of the country as well as consumer preferences for environmental quality. The results indicate that, all else equal, output growth would have increased CO2 industrial emissions in the Central and Eastern European countries in our sample by 31% between 1995 and 2003, and the composition effect corresponded to an increase of 8.4% of these emissions. Nevertheless, the technique effect, induced by more stringent environmental policy, reduced industrial CO2 emissions by 58%, and allowed for a final beneficial result for the environment, i.e., -18% of industrial CO2 emissions in 2003 compared to 1995. Finally, our study confirms the importance of institutional factors in the explanation and further prediction of pollution reduction in transition economies.","[Zugravu, Natalia; Millock, Katrin] Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, CNRS, F-75647 Paris 13, France; [Duchene, Gerard] Univ Paris 12, ERUDITE, F-94010 Creteil, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Paris School of Economics; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC),"Zugravu, N (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, CNRS, 106-112 Bd Hop, F-75647 Paris 13, France.",nzugravu@yahoo.com; millock@univ-paris1.fr; duchene@univ-paris12.fr,"Millock, Katrin E/H-6194-2013; Zugravu-Soilita, Natalia/AAF-8434-2020","Millock, Katrin E/0000-0002-4213-9583;",,,,,38,2,2,0,10,DE BOECK UNIV,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

Finally, steady-state factors are computed for the yield curve (slope and curvature), linking them to output and price indicators through a reduced-form macrofinancial model. Significant effects are found between real and financial variables; in particular, the slope of the yield curve affects the output measures with a lag of three to six months. On the other hand, the curvature has medium-term effects on inflation, which seems to be related to the speed of adjustment of the shorter-term interest rate to its steady-state value.","[Becerra C, Sebastian; Sagner T, Andres] Banco Cent Chile, Santiago, Chile",,,ralfaro@bbva.com; jbecerra@bcentral.cl; asagner@bcentral.cl,,,,,,,34,2,4,0,2,BANCO CENTRAL CHILE,SANTIAGO,"MORANDE 115 2ND PISO, AUGUSTINAS 1180, SANTIAGO, 6500-590, CHILE",0717-3830,,,ECON CHIL,Econ.

Our approach provides rankings in terms of residual research output after controlling for the key characteristics of each department's academic staff. More specifically, we estimate residual research output rankings for all of New Zealand's economics departments based on their publication performance over the 2000 to 2006 period. We do so after taking into account the following characteristics of each department's academic staff: gender, experience, seniority, academic credentials and academic rank. The paper demonstrates that the rankings generated by the residual research approach and those generated by traditional approaches to research rankings may be significantly different for some departments. These differences are important in determining the likely efficiency impact of research assessment exercises.","[Tressler, John] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Anderson, David L.] Queens Univ Canada, Kingston, ON, Canada",University of Waikato; Queens University - Canada,"Tressler, J (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton, New Zealand.",tressler@waikato.ac.nz,,"Tressler, John/0000-0002-1954-955X",,,,,26,1,1,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

In two treatments, each subject's second-stage endowment is determined by the return from the public good in the first-stage. We manipulate payoffs across treatments such that, relative to our no-carryover baseline, earnings from either Nash Equilibrium (constant NE) play or Pareto Optimal (constant PO) play are held constant. The remaining two treatments maintain a constant endowment in each stage, but vary the marginal per capita return (MPCR high or MCPR low) to contributions in the second-stage. Our results indicate that carryover increases first-stage contributions. Our implementation of carryover enables us to examine the effects of changing endowments and a wide range of MPCR's. Consistent with the literature, we find that MPCR and endowment effects are important determinants of subject contributions to the group account. While stage 1 contributions tend to increase in the presence of carryover, efficiency levels across both stages fall relative to the baseline. Efficiency levels fall because the maximum earnings possible increase with carryover (due to higher endowments or MPCR levels in stage 2). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

An ordinal treatment effect model is developed to accommodate the discrete feature of the employment decision and the potential endogeneity of these two outcomes. Using a unique sample of the elderly in Taiwan, in contrast to findings for the general population of the previous studies, we find that part-time employment is significant and positively associated with life satisfaction, while elderly with full-time employment have lower life satisfaction.

We use a fad model with Markov switching heteroskedasticity, which was first proposed by Kim and Kim (1996). Using the monthly data from January 1980 to October 2009, we find that the volatility of the transitory component of the stock return, or fads, increased during the currency crisis, but did not rise much during the credit crisis. It implies that the stock price fluctuations were not driven by irrational sentiments during the recent global crisis as much as during the former crisis. However, when we consider the dollar value of the Korean stock index in order to estimate the volatility that foreign investors confront, we find that the volatility of the transitory component was raised during the credit crisis as well as during the currency crisis. That is, foreign investors experienced greater volatility than domestic investors in the recent financial market turmoil. This asymmetric volatility that domestic and foreign investors face is one of the characteristics of the credit crisis. For more detailed analysis, the same model was applied to the weekly data from January 2005 to October 2009 and provided the result that the data measured by won-dollar exchange rates were more increased than the raw data. It holds that foreign investors confronted much greater volatility than domestic investors while the stock volatility was relatively lower in the credit crisis state than in the currency crisis state.

More specifically, social efficiency criteria under quasi-rationality might well diverge from that of full rationality. This arguably has at least two effects. First, public policy evaluation, especially standard cost-benefit analysis, ought to be reinterpreted accommodating such 'behavioural optimality' restrictions. Second, the acceptance of 'behavioural market failures' alongside of 'behavioural political failures' can give rise to new reasons for public sector intervention. The papers of this special issue can be seen as paradigmatic examples of the former and/or the latter, and more generally suggest that 'behavioural optimality' cannot be disregarded.

Public policy often uses financial incentives to encourage contributions. However, individuals often donate their time or money to the environmental cause without such incentives. The purpose of this paper is: (a) to examine the relationship between donating (without monetary incentives) and selling behavior (motivated by monetary incentives) of individuals in the context of environmental protection and (b) to analyze the influence of a leader on individual contributions to the environmental good. The major results are: (1) there is a tradeoff/substitution between donating and selling for a given level of incentives; (2) donating is much less sensitive to changes in monetary incentives and, furthermore, there is no evidence that the increase in financial incentives to sell will crowd out donations; (3) the changes in contributions by leaders have a significant impact on followers' behavior.

Groups of Communist Youth, the only legal organization for students at that time, protested against a decision by central authorities for punishing a few Maoists. Although Communist students at the Faculty had little in common with these Maoists, this protest set off a movement that led to convoking a general assembly on 10 October. This meeting was held under the control of both academic authorities and the Communist Party; Kadar himself attended. The movement was stifled. This special episode at a time when central Europe was shaken by events in Poland (1968 and 1970) and Czechoslovakia (1968), reveals the desire for change within the establishment and the latter's difficulty in coping with it. The evanescent memory of this event also shows how difficult it has been, since 1989, to understand the end of the 1960s in Hungary.","Ecole Super Janos Kodolanyi, Budapest, Hungary",,"Dénes, IZ (通讯作者)，Ecole Super Janos Kodolanyi, Budapest, Hungary.",diz@kodolanyi.hu,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,5,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

We use the exogenous - policy-induced - variation in pension wealth to estimate explicitly the impact of pension wealth on household savings, and obtain evidence of a significant offset effect of pension wealth on household savings. Although the size of the effect depends on the parameter values assumed, the finding that household savings are affected by pension reform is robust. Our estimates show that, under plausible scenarios, pension reform boosted household savings rates in 1999 by about 6-9 percentage points for cohorts aged 25-29 and by about 2-3 percentage points for cohorts aged 50-59. Our results also indicate that declining pension wealth reduces expenditure on education and health more than on other consumption items. Journal of Comparative Economics 39 (4) (2011) 470-485.

We find that serially correlated transitory errors have a significant effect on the participation behaviour of married women, while the first-order lagged dependent variable has no significant effect. The result that serially correlated transitory errors influence married women's inter-temporal labour force participation suggests that exogenous rather than endogenous causes have a significant effect on long-term economic disparity among married women.","[Okamura, Kazuaki] Kochi Univ, Kochi, Japan",Kochi University,"Okamura, K (通讯作者)，Kochi Univ, Kochi, Japan.",,,"Islam, Nizamul/0000-0002-1152-8623",,,,,21,2,2,0,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1352-4739,1468-5876,,JPN ECON REV,Jpn.

As the case of Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR) shows, concentrating on internal social processes helps understand the international dynamics. The state- and nation-building processes in this disputed territory have consolidated an endogenous territorial defense, institutionalized governmental structures and reinvented national symbols. Despite its limits, state-building has set off a social process of adaptation, which enables Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh to continue living without international recognition. In parallel, this social trend is modifying the interdependence between the NKR and Azerbaijan and making the return to the status quo ante ever harder to imagine.","Univ Versailles St Quentin En Yvelines, ATER Sci Polit, Fac Droit & Sci Polit, Versailles, France",Universite Paris Saclay,"Petithomme, M (通讯作者)，Univ Versailles St Quentin En Yvelines, ATER Sci Polit, Fac Droit & Sci Polit, Versailles, France.",Mathieu.Petithomme@eui.eu,,,,,,,54,1,1,0,13,PRESSES UNIV FRANCE,PARIS CEDEX 14,"6 AVENUE REILLE, 75685 PARIS CEDEX 14, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

Does the time-series evidence contradict the results of cross-section studies regarding the relationship between institutions and growth?

This paper highlights the relevance of taking into account whether or not the worker remains in the same firm when accumulating temporary contracts to test for the stepping stone effect of these contracts. My analysis focuses on a sample of Spanish labour market entrants aged between 18 and 28 for the 2000-7 period. The results suggest that firms sometimes use temporary contracts as a screening device, thereby raising the entrance rates into permanent contracts among those in their initial hiring pool. In other cases, however, workers may become 'trapped' in the temporary employment bracket after several months of recurrent temporary contracts between bouts of unemployment under the same employer causing a drop in their chances of obtaining stable work. By contrast, moving from one firm to another as a temporary worker might have a positive influence on exit rates to permanent employment.","Univ Pablo Olavide, Seville, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Sanz, YR (通讯作者)，Univ Pablo Olavide, Seville, Spain.",,"Rebollo-Sanz, Yolanda F./K-6940-2012","Rebollo-Sanz, Yolanda F./0000-0003-1876-7093",,,,,28,11,11,1,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

As a result, China poses a paradox in that it has incomplete property rights and rule of law which are thought to be essential for growth. There are, though, numerous inefficiencies associated with such a gradual transition which may have maintained a stable growth rate in the past, but could hamper future economic development. As a key example, state-owned firms continue to benefit from financial repression in which they received preferable allocations of credit. Thus, China's high savings rate fuels investment which has driven growth, but is increasingly inefficient as credit is funnelled to the less productive SOEs. This inefficiency points to the need for legal and institutional reforms which may conflict with the still broad but opaque borders of the Chinese state.","Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford,"Yueh, L (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",linda.yueh@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,50,5,6,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

The CCT arm also outperformed the UCT arm in tests of English reading comprehension. However, teenage pregnancy and marriage rates were substantially lower in the UCT than the CCT arm, entirely due to the impact of UCTs on these outcomes among girls who dropped out of school.","[Baird, Sarah] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; World Bank, Washington, DC USA",George Washington University; University of California System; University of California San Diego; The World Bank,"Baird, S (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",,,,,,,,54,339,381,3,102,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

We show with an example that some allocation rules are implementable only with mechanisms which will be rejected on the equilibrium path. In our construction, a refusal to participate conveys information about the types of the players. This information causes the default game to be played under different beliefs, and more importantly under different higher order beliefs, than the interim ones. We find a lower bound on all the implementable payoffs.

We show that this model fails to provide realistic policy outcomes when the receiving region's technology is described by a standard Cobb-Douglas or CES function. Then we describe three extensions of this basic model that reconcile theory with evidence. The first introduces a cost of integration of the immigrant community in the destination country; the second takes into account the policy maker's redistributive concern across different social groups; the last extension considers positive spillover effects of (skilled) migrants on the receiving economy.","[Ruta, Michele] World Trade Org, Econ Res Div, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Giordani, Paolo E.] LUISS Guido Carli, Dept Econ & Business, I-00197 Rome, Italy",World Trade Organization; Luiss Guido Carli University,"Ruta, M (通讯作者)，World Trade Org, Econ Res Div, Rue Lausanne 154, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",pgiordani@luiss.it; michele.ruta@wto.org,,"GIORDANI, PAOLO/0000-0002-2192-6350",,,,,21,9,9,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

The debate regarding whether excess money supply is responsible for this inflation has attracted scholars to investigate the effects of money growth on inflation. In this paper, we use correlation analysis to confirm the comovement between growth of monetary aggregates and inflation. We explore the asymmetric effects of monetary policy on inflation using the Markov regime-switching model. The empirical results show that monetary policy can be more effective in curbing inflation in a high inflation state than in boosting the price level in a low inflation state. However, simply tightening the money supply might not be sufficient to suppress the price level. To this end, the Chinese Government should adopt other policies, such as supply stabilization policies, to help suppress the price level. Our study can help policy-makers to determine the actual economic state and provides some policy implications for the current inflation.","[Liu, Jinquan; Pang, Chunyang] Jilin Univ, Ctr Quantitat Econ, Changchun 130023, Peoples R China",Jilin University,"Liu, JQ (通讯作者)，Jilin Univ, Ctr Quantitat Econ, Changchun 130023, Peoples R China.",jqliu1964@yahoo.com.cn; chunyang.pang@gmail.com,,,,,,,29,1,1,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,NOV-DEC,2011,19.0,6,,,,,19,36,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2011.01264.x,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,856IP,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000297633300002,0

After having gained experience with two payoff variations of the trust game, subjects in the final part explicitly choose which of these two variants to play. Theory predicts that subjects will choose the payoff dominated game (representing a bad explicit contract), because this game better sustains (implicit) relational incentives backed by either reputational or reciprocity considerations. Our main findings are that cooperation is indeed more likely in the payoff dominated game. Moreover, indefinite repetition increases both cooperation rates and the likelihood with which the payoff dominated game is chosen. Overall we conclude that available explicit incentives indeed do affect relational contracting and, anticipating this, agents may choose weak explicit incentives to facilitate implicit agreements.

State Dependence versus Heterogeneity in Coordination Games,SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"In games with multiple, Pareto-rankable equilibria and repeated play, does a history of playing an inefficient equilibrium make it harder for players to reach the efficient equilibrium? In other words, can people get stuck in bad equilibria? Previous studies have found support for this, but they have relied on naturally occurring variation in precedent. I implement randomized control to establish that precedent effects are important, but that naturally occurring variation exaggerates the importance of precedent. I present evidence that some of the endogeneity of naturally occurring precedents is due to variation in risk attitudes. This is because in the coordination games used, the inefficient equilibrium is associated with a safe strategy. Understanding the causal effect of precedent is important since many development problems are viewed as coordination games. Moreover, an appreciation of the way in which potential heterogeneity may interact with the policy is essential when trying to lift groups out of bad precedents.","[Al-Ubaydli, Omar] George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Al-Ubaydli, Omar] George Mason Univ, Mercatus Ctr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University; George Mason University,"Al-Ubaydli, O (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, 4400 Univ Dr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",omar@omar.ec,,,,,,,38,2,2,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

The paper analyses theoretically what role fiscal councils could play and surveys empirically the activities of existing councils. Case studies of the Swedish Fiscal Policy Council and the UK Office for Budget Responsibility are done. It is concluded that fiscal councils should be advisory, rather than decision-making, and work as complements, rather than substitutes, to fiscal rules. Although no panacea, fiscal councils could play a useful role by at the same time strengthening fiscal discipline and allowing rules-based fiscal policy to be more flexible. A key issue is their political fragility and how their long-run viability should be secured.

However, international coordination cannot be taken for granted. It is often ineffective and likely to fail for several reasons. Perhaps the more prominent reason to explain failure in coordination is that collective actions against terrorism may suffer from the well-known free riding problem. In this paper we experimentally investigate cooperation dilemma in counterterrorism policies by measuring to what extent international deterrence policy may suffer from free riding. In our game, contributions to the group account do not aim to increase the production of the public good but instead seek to decrease the probability that a stochastic event destroys the good. A country could choose to free ride by investing nothing in the international deterrence policy and instead invest all its resources in its own national protection or even choose to ignore totally terrorism by investing on alternative projects. We also look at the effects of institutions that allow sanctioning and rewarding of other countries to facilitate coordination on deterrence policy. We find that, in absence of institutional incentives and after controlling for risk aversion, most of countries defect by investing very weakly in collective actions against terrorism while largely investing to protect themselves. In contrast, the introduction of punishment/reward incentive systems improves significantly the contribution level to the collective security account.","[Colombier, Nathalie; Masclet, David] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, CREM, F-35065 Rennes, France; [Mirza, Daniel] GERCIE Univ Tours, F-37000 Tours, France; [Mirza, Daniel] CEPII, Paris, France; [Montmarquette, Claude] 2020 Univ, CIRANO, Montreal, PQ H3A 2A5, Canada",Universite de Rennes; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montreal,"Colombier, N (通讯作者)，Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, CREM, 7 Pl Hoche, F-35065 Rennes, France.",nathalie.colombier@univ-rennes1.fr; david.masclet@univ-rennes1.fr; daniel.mirza@univ-tours.fr; montmarc@cirano.qc.ca,"Mirza, Daniel/Q-1795-2018","Mirza, Daniel/0000-0002-0685-2939",,,,,45,4,5,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Our results indicate that money does matter. We find that politically active petitioners are more likely to receive protection and that antidumping duty rates tend to be higher for that group.

Our model is inspired by Bak's sand pile model, and the entry of a new firm or innovation is comparable to dropping a grain of sand in Bak's model. The resulting model involves the insights of both Keynes and Schumpeter. It could be defined as Keynesian because the aggregate output is demand driven. That said, the model can mainly be labeled as Schumpeterian for several reasons: (i) innovations have a key role, (ii) credit is involved in supporting the innovation process, (iii) innovations partially destroy old industries, and finally (iv) without innovations, the system gradually approaches its stationary state. In this simple model, the change in the number of sectors (products) of the economy is the decisive factor with the following results: (1) the aggregate production has an increasing trend; (2) fluctuations are asymmetric; (3) recessions have a creative destruction explanation; (4) classical cycles are gradually replaced by growth cycles.","Univ G dAnnunzio, Dept Quantitat Methods & Econ Theory, I-65127 Pescara, Italy",G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara,"Giulioni, G (通讯作者)，Univ G dAnnunzio, Dept Quantitat Methods & Econ Theory, Viale Pindaro 42, I-65127 Pescara, Italy.",g.giulioni@unich.it,,"Giulioni, Gianfranco/0000-0003-0946-1738",,,,,24,3,4,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Societies once solidly monocultural are becoming increasingly multicultural. It is, however, not clear how social capital would travel across cultural boundaries. A multicultural environment might result on agents preferring to interact with those of their own culture, discriminating against others. We study trust, an aspect of social capital, between domestic Australian students of non-Asian origin and international students of Asian origin. To measure the degree of trust and patterns of discrimination between these groups, the Berg et al. (1995) trust game and a series of control games were used in framework where each participant played each game against several partners knowing their domestic or international status. Controlling for individual heterogeneity, domestic students significantly discriminated against international students in the trust game, and individual discrimination was taste-based rather than based on beliefs towards international students' trustworthiness. Moreover, the average amount that international students sent in the trust game was negatively related with the number of semesters studied at university in Australia, which may partly reflect cultural adjustment but also institutional disadvantages faced specifically by international students. The study furthers understanding of the patterns of discrimination between domestic and international university students and the nature of this discrimination. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Our estimates suggest that paternal job loss has a negative effect on children's school performance. In contrast, maternal job loss is associated with a non-significant increase in school performance. Importantly, the negative effect of paternal job loss appears largely unrelated to its effect on father's income, father's employment status, a shift in maternal time towards employment, marital dissolution, and residential relocation. A disparate effect of job loss across fathers and mothers is, however, consistent with recent empirical studies documenting that the mental distress experienced by displaced workers is generally more severe for men than women.","[Rege, Mari; Telle, Kjetil; Votruba, Mark] Univ Stavanger, Stavanger, Norway; [Votruba, Mark] Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",Universitetet i Stavanger; University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University,"Rege, M (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Stavanger, Norway.",,"Votruba, Mark Edward/KAM-6544-2024","Votruba, Mark Edward/0000-0002-4870-3376; Rege, Mari/0000-0002-9574-5851",,,,,46,116,131,4,62,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

I show analytically how age dependence improves policy on both the intratemporal and intertemporal margins. I use detailed numerical simulations, calibrated with data from the U.S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics, to generate robust policy implications: age dependence (1) lowers marginal taxes on average and especially on high-income young workers and (2) lowers average taxes on all young workers relative to older workers when private saving and borrowing are restricted. Finally, I calculate and characterize the welfare gains from age dependence. Despite its simplicity, age dependence generates a welfare gain equal to between 0 center dot 6% and 1 center dot 5% of aggregate annual consumption, and it captures more than 60% of the gain from reform to the dynamic optimal policy. The gains are due to substantial increases in both efficiency and equity. When age dependence is restricted to be Pareto improving, the welfare gain is nearly as large.","[Weinzierl, Matthew] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Weinzierl, Matthew] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Weinzierl, M (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,48,60,77,0,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

In the model, the firm exerts effort toward cost reduction and self-dealing, and incentives can be input-based (monitoring) and output-based (demanded cost targets). Full coordination between the regulators leads to the second best allocation. A setting in which the regulators do not fully coordinate leads to (i) higher overall monitoring (more aggressive input-based incentives) and (ii) higher demanded cost targets (i.e., more lenience in terms of output-based incentives). As a consequence of (i), in all possible equilibria, the effort toward cost reduction will be smaller when the agent reports to two regulators who do not coordinate. (i) and (ii) imply that the impact on the effort toward self-dealing activities is ambiguous. In our leading example, self-dealing will be larger if the regulators coordinate on monitoring levels but smaller if they choose monitoring levels independently. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

First, moneylenders and other informal lenders coexist with formal lending institutions such as government or commercial banks, and, more recently, micro-lending institutions. Second, potential borrowers presumably face sizable transaction costs in obtaining external credit. We develop and estimate a model based on limited enforcement and transaction costs that provides a unified view of these facts. Based on data from Thailand. the results show that the limited ability of banks to enforce contracts, more than transaction costs, is crucial in understanding the observed diversity of lenders.

While the macroeconomic determinants of FDI have been analysed to a considerable extent in past empirical work, the role of institutional factors such as the protection of property rights and the efficiency of the legal system has been underexplored. Using a multivariate cointegration framework, we use a newly constructed de jure property rights index for Zimbabwe to determine the impact of property rights on FDI. The empirical evidence shows that property rights are consistently an important explanatory variable of FDI in Zimbabwe, even after controlling for periods when there are no significant new foreign capital inflows. Other significant explanatory variables of FDI in Zimbabwe are the real gross domestic product (GDP), capital intensity, the external debt to GDP ratio, political instability as well as the educational levels.

Using quantile regression methods, we find substantial variation in subsidy effects across the BMI distribution. Specifically, child care subsidies have no effect on BMI at the lower end of the distribution, inconsistent effects in the middle of the distribution, and large effects at the top of the distribution.

Using firm level panel data from India, and defining the core firm of a group as the one with the largest asset base, we find that the relatedness of the activity of a group affiliate to the activity of the core firm is correlated with the wedge between control and cash flow rights of insiders as well as with the opacity in insider ownership. Firms with ownership-control wedge lower and ownership opacity higher relative to a group's core firm are more likely to be in activities unrelated to that of the core firm. Our findings are strengthened by evidence of tunneling in the same direction, from affiliates with wedge equal to or higher than that of the core firm to affiliates with wedge lower than that of the core firm. Taken together this suggests an expropriation motive for diversification: affiliate firms are located away from a business group's core firm to serve as destination points for funds tunneled from the group's core.

Unlike previous research, we use data from Asia-Pacific countries and adopt a panel data approach that allows us to decompose the forward premium into common and idiosyncratic components. Our data suggest the presence of one common factor and the stationarity of both components for short maturities, leading to the conclusion of a stationary forward premium. In contrast, the stationarity of the premium is less supported by the longer maturity data. Furthermore, a large portion of the premium fluctuation is shown to be due to a common factor, particularly over the short time horizon, which in turn can be explained by economic developments in the USA.","Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Syst & Informat Engn, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan",University of Tsukuba,"Nagayasu, J (通讯作者)，Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Syst & Informat Engn, 1-1-1 Ten Nodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan.",nagayasu@sk.tsukuba.ac.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [21530206] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,18,1,2,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We focus our attention on the coincidence/non-coincidence between the equilibrium market structure (EMS) and the most socially preferred structure with respect to each country's social welfare and/or total social welfare, as each firm's production efficiency varies. When each firm's production efficiency is relatively low, in all the three cases, the EMS coincides with the most socially preferred structure with respect to each country's social welfare and total social welfare in a large area of the physical trade cost. On the other hand, when each firm's production efficiency is relatively high, in the cases wherein they use the two different types of managerial delegation contracts, there exists an area of each firm's production efficiency such that the EMS does not coincide with the most socially preferred structure with respect to each country's social welfare and total social welfare. Therefore, as each firm's organizational structure proceeds from entrepreneurial to managerial delegation, a more active merger policy is needed with respect to each country's social welfare and total social welfare.","Gunma Univ, Fac Social & Informat Studies, Maebashi, Gunma 3718510, Japan",Gunma University,"Nakamura, Y (通讯作者)，Gunma Univ, Fac Social & Informat Studies, 4-2 Aramaki Machi, Maebashi, Gunma 3718510, Japan.",yasuhiko.r.nakamura@gmail.com,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23730226] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,40,5,5,0,15,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,,,J ECON,J.

This progress is occasionally accelerated by unexpected medical breakthroughs. However, sudden gains against one risk can induce offsetting increases in other risks. I examine this possibility empirically with data from three unexpected changes in mortality risk: the introduction of antibiotics, discovery of new treatments for heart disease, and the AIDS epidemic (an unexpected breakdown of progress). I find that offsetting responses can provide a unifying explanation for important features of data from these three different episodes. These features include increased noninfectious disease mortality in groups most benefited by antibiotics, a connection between heart disease gains and increased obesity, and declining external cause mortality risks in vulnerable groups in places with high AIDS incidence.","Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Peltzman, S (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,,,,,,,18,5,9,0,8,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1932-8575,1932-8664,,J HUM CAPITAL,J.

We also consider the role of housing equity in the portfolios of retirement-age households and explore the extent to which households draw down housing equity and financial assets as they age. Because home equity is often conserved until very late in life, for many households it may provide some insurance against the risk of living longer than expected. Finally, we consider how our findings bear on a number of policy issues, such as the role for annuity defaults in retirement saving plans.","[Poterba, James] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Venti, Steven] Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Wise, David] Harvard Univ, Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Poterba, James; Venti, Steven; Wise, David] Hlth & Retirement Programs, Cambridge, MA USA; [Wise, David] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Dartmouth College; Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Poterba, J (通讯作者)，MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",poterba@mit.edu; Steven.Venti@dartmouth.edu; david_wise@harvard.edu,,,"NIA NIH HHS [P01 AG005842-24, P01 AG005842] Funding Source: Medline",NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,40,74,88,1,18,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

I obtain closed-form solutions for all variables along the balanced growth path in all cases. I then derive closed-form solutions for the transition paths under the assumption of full depreciation and, in the monetary economy, a particular nonstationary interest rate policy.

In reality, however, altruism usually requires interaction between givers and receivers, which clearly must influence choices. Charities, for example, speak of the power of asking. Indeed, evolutionary theories of altruism are built on human sociality. We experimentally examine communication in which one subject allocates $10 between herself and a receiver, and systematically altered who in the pair could speak. We found that any time the recipient spoke, giving increased asking is powerful. But when only allocators could speak, choices were significantly more selfish than any other condition. When empathy was heightened by putting allocators in the receiver's shoes, giving appeared as if recipients had been able to ask, even when they were silent. We conclude that communication dramatically influences altruistic behavior, and appears to largely work by heightening empathy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we assess the contribution of medical costs to household bankruptcy risk by exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in publicly provided health insurance. Using cross-state variation in Medicaid expansions from 1992 to 2004, we find that a 10 percentage point increase in Medicaid eligibility reduces personal bankruptcies by 8%, with no evidence that business bankruptcies are similarly affected. We interpret our findings with a model in which health insurance imperfectly substitutes for other forms of financial protection, and we use the model to present simple calibration results which illustrate how our reduced-form parameter estimate affects the optimal level of health insurance benefits. We conclude with calculations which suggest that out-of-pocket medical costs are pivotal in roughly 26% of personal bankruptcies among low-income households. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

To model the procurer's problem, we extend a standard sequential screening model to endogenous information acquisition with moral hazard. The optimal contract displays systematic distortions in information acquisition. Due to a rent effect, adverse selection induces too much information acquisition to prevent cost overruns and too little information acquisition to prevent false project cancellations. Moral hazard mitigates the distortions related to cost overruns yet exacerbates those related to false negatives. The optimal mechanism is a menu of option contracts that achieves the dual goal of providing incentives for information acquisition and truthful information revelation.","[Kraehmer, Daniel] Univ Bonn, D-5300 Bonn, Germany; [Strausz, Roland] Humboldt Univ, D-1086 Berlin, Germany",University of Bonn; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Krähmer, D (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, D-5300 Bonn, Germany.",,,"Strausz, Roland/0000-0001-7111-1486",,,,,29,33,39,0,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The article focuses on trends in renewable energy markets, the status and prospects of renewable energy technology (RET), and policy frameworks for RETs. It is more reticent on the role of renewable energy for combating global warming. This acknowledges the fact that a full assessment of the potential contribution of RETs requires an integrated systems perspective, including consideration of the climate change mitigation requirement and the status and prospects of alternative mitigation options (Edenhofer et al., 2009, 2010; Clarke et al., 2009). This comment will briefly review the article's perspective on the trends and prospects of renewable energy, and then move on to a short discussion of some system-level considerations for assessing the role of renewable energy for combating global warming.

But, the difficulty lies in evaluating the impact of Microfinance in a world where the Microfinance institutions, their borrowers, and government policies are constantly changing. There is a need for a comprehensive and transparent framework to develop the theoretical grounds for believing in (or against) the efficacy of Microfinance, which can at the same time be used as a testing ground for policymakers. This paper presents a first attempt to develop an agent-based modeling (ABM) framework for pre-policy-implementation testing of the effects of Microfinance. Under the ABM paradigm, a set of behaviors for individual agents in the economy is used to construct a simulation whereby random interaction allows agents to change their state over time. Simulation of the model in different scenarios supported all our intuitions about Microfinance; in particular, there was positive impact of Microfinance on the wealth level of the poor. It was found that increase of available funds, easy access for producers and lower interest rates increase the effectiveness of Microfinance. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It exemplifies complexity at the level of structure, hierarchy and so on. There is also an interesting notion of complexity present in the meaning of mathematical 'alphabets'. These are unique writing strategies of mathematics. Yet another marker of complexity lies in the process of applying mathematics to models. Using mathematics in modelling is a process of deciding what kinds of models to construct and what types of mathematics to use. Modelling can be seen as a decision-making process where the scientists are the agents. However in choosing mathematical structures the scientist is not being optimally rational. In fact, fertile uses of mathematics in the sciences show a complicated use of mathematics that cannot be reduced to a method or to rational principles. This paper argues that the discourse of satisficing and bounded rationality well describes the process of choice and decision inherent in modelling.","Manipal Univ, Manipal Ctr Philosophy & Humanities, Manipal, Karnataka, India",Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE),"Sarukkai, S (通讯作者)，Manipal Univ, Manipal Ctr Philosophy & Humanities, Manipal, Karnataka, India.",,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0950-0804,,,J ECON SURV,J.

The severity of the recession and the strength of macro policy responses varied from country to country. However, even after correcting for these differences, unemployment experiences were various. Unemployment generally rose by less in those countries which had strict employment protection legislation, as it did in those countries with relatively high collective-bargaining coverage. Various forms of work-sharing also helped some countries to dampen the rise in unemployment. So did increasing the generosity of out-of-work benefit arrangements. The latter finding suggests that search theoretic approaches need to be modified. Institutions do matter and not just in the short run.

Results show concave age-wage and age-productivity profiles. On average, we find that wages do not deviate significantly from productivity. For certain sub-groups, our results suggest some discrepancies between wages and productivity.

Using an array of estimation methods, we show that the Balassa-Samuelson effect is not an important driver of inflation rates. By contrast, we find that the initial price level and regulated prices strongly affect inflation outcomes in a nonlinear manner and that the extension of Engel's Law may hold during periods of very fast growth. We interpret these results as a sign that price level convergence comes from goods, market and non-market service prices.

We argue that people save to improve their social status when social status is associated with pecuniary and non-pecuniary benefits. Rising income inequality can strengthen the incentives of status-seeking savings by increasing the benefit of improving status, and by enlarging the wealth level required for status upgrading. We also find that the negative effect of income inequality on consumption is stronger for poorer and younger people and that income inequality stimulates more education investment, which are consistent with the status-seeking hypothesis.

We find only weak evidence that either of the matches work; in fact, for the full sample, the match only increased giving after the match deadline expired. Yet, the aggregation masks important heterogeneities: those donors who are actively supporting the organization tend to be positively influenced whereas lapsed givers are either not affected or adversely affected. Furthermore, some presentations of the match can do harm, e.g., when an example amount given is high ($75) and the match ratio is below $1:$1. Overall, the results help clarify what might cause people to give and provide further evidence that larger match ratios are not necessarily superior to smaller match ratios. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Hence, effective assessment and monitoring of website quality have become prerequisites for profitable e-banking. Determining the overall quality of a banking website is a multidimensional issue that involves evaluation of information system (IS) quality, customer services quality, and product quality. The purpose of this study is to propose an e-banking website quality assessment methodology based on an integrated fuzzy AHP-ELECTRE approach. The fuzzy set theory has been developed for dealing with the problems arising from the vagueness, ambiguity, and subjectivity of human judgment. In the proposed methodology, the weights of the criteria are generated by a fuzzy AHP analysis. Next, fuzzy ELECTRE is used to assess the quality levels of the websites. In the third step, a fuzzy dominance relation approach is used to rank the alternatives. In order to show the potentials of the proposed method, a case study in Turkish banking sector is reported together with a sensitivity analysis.","[Kayal, Tolga] Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Engn Management, TR-34367 Istanbul, Turkey; [Kahraman, Cengiz] Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Ind Engn, TR-34367 Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Technical University; Istanbul Technical University,"Kayal, T (通讯作者)，Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Engn Management, TR-34367 Istanbul, Turkey.",kayatolga@itu.edu.tr; kahramanc@itu.edu.tr,"Kaya, Tolga/ABD-2887-2020; kahraman, cengiz/N-9259-2013","Kaya, Tolga/0000-0003-4841-482X; kahraman, cengiz/0000-0001-6168-8185",,,,,50,56,59,1,28,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

A capital tax influences training investments via two opposing effects. On the one hand, it lowers the stock of physical capital and thereby the productivity of training. On the other hand, the degree of wage compression is increased, improving the incentives to train. In principle either effect can dominate. If the wage-compression effect dominates, it is possible that a tax on capital income increases welfare, since underinvestment in training is more severe than underinvestment in physical capital.","Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Lechthaler, W (通讯作者)，Inst World Econ, Duesternbrooker Weg 120, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",wolfgang.lechthaler@ifw-kiel.de,"Lechthaler, Wolfgang/AAN-6248-2020",,,,,,34,0,0,0,4,J C B MOHR,TUBINGEN,"POSTFACH 2040, W-7400 TUBINGEN, GERMANY",0932-4569,1614-0559,,J INST THEOR ECON,J.

In line with international evidence, top incomes concentration appears to be countercyclical in the short run. For the entire length of this survey, this concentration shows roughly an inverted U-shape, peaking at the end of the 80s. These changes correspond approximately with different economic policy regimes prevailing in Chile. We observe important changes in the composition of top income groups related to greater relative importance of women, employees and college schooling levels. These changes are stronger for the top 10% than the top 1% of incomes. Additionally, using a national level panel of households for the period 1996-2006 we explore correlations between probabilities of permanence and arrival to the top decile with variables such as composition of the household, ownership of physical and human assets, job quality and changes in the numbers of household members working in the labor market.","[Sanhueza, Claudia] Univ Diego Portales, Inst Polit Publ, Santiago, Chile; [Mayer, Ricardo] Univ Diego Portales, Fac Econ & Empresa, Santiago, Chile",University Diego Portales; University Diego Portales,"Sanhueza, C (通讯作者)，Univ Diego Portales, Inst Polit Publ, Ejercito 260, Santiago, Chile.",claudia.sanhueza@udp.cl; ricardo.mayer@udp.cl,"Sanhueza, Claudia/AAB-1959-2020",,,,,,30,9,10,0,10,UNIV CHILE DEPT ECONOMICS,SANTIAGO,"DIAGONAL PARAGUAY 257, REGISTRO PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL 112.761, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0304-2758,,,ESTUD ECONOMIA,Estud.

To do so, we formulate a series of stochastic models for committing and then dispatching electric generators subject to transmission limits. In the unit commitment stage, the models optimise day-ahead generation schedules under either the full set of network constraints or a simplified net transfer capacity (NTC) constraint, where the latter represents the present approach for limiting forward electricity trade in Europe. A subsequent redispatch model then creates feasible real-time schedules. Benefits of LMP arise from decreases in expected start-up and variable generation costs resulting from consistent consideration of the full set of network constraints both day-ahead and in real time. Meanwhile, coordinating adjacent balancing markets provides benefits because intermarket flows can be adjusted in real-time in response to changing conditions. To quantify these benefits, we analyse a stylised four-node network, examining the effects of varying system characteristics on the magnitude of the locational-based unit commitment benefits and the benefits of intermarket balancing. We conclude that both categories of benefits are situation dependent, such that small parameter changes can lead to large changes in expected benefits.

However, as BOT projects usually induce huge capital investments, government sectors must prudently evaluate the project feasibility from both financial and nonfinancial aspects before the implementation. Therefore, how to establish an objective evaluation model which can comprehensively assess the feasibility of each BOT project and determine the priority of its implementation has become an important issue. This study incorporates analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and utility theory to develop a utility-based multicriteria model for supporting the selection of BOT projects. A case study is provided to demonstrate that the implementation of the proposed model can effectively help decision-making teams participate in economical evaluations so that the feasibility of as-planed BOT projects can be determined and project priority can be set efficiently and consistently.","[Yan, Min-Ren] Chinese Culture Univ SCE, Dept Int Business Adm, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Pong, Cheng-Sheng] Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Engn Sci & Technol, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan; [Lo, Wei] Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Construct Engn, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan",National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology; National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology,"Yan, MR (通讯作者)，Chinese Culture Univ SCE, Dept Int Business Adm, 231 Sec 2,Janguo Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",mjyen@sce.pccu.edu.tw; cspong40@gmail.com; roylo@ccms.nkfust.edu.tw,,"Yan, Min-Ren/0000-0002-8270-9763",,,,,17,19,19,2,26,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Findings point to an overwhelming evidence of non-linearity in these five segments based on in-sample evaluation of the linear and non-linear models. We next provide further support for non-linearity by comparing one- to four-quarters-ahead out-of-sample forecasts of the non-linear time series model with those of the classical and Bayesian versions of the linear autoregressive (AR) models for each of these segments, for the out-of-sample horizon 2001:Q1 to 2009:Q3, using the in-sample period 1970:Q2 to 2000:Q4. Our results indicate that barring the one-, two and four-step(s)-ahead forecasts of the small segment, the non-linear model always outperforms the linear models. In addition, given the existence of strong causal relationship amongst the house prices of the five segments, the multivariate versions of the linear (classical and Bayesian) and STAR (MSTAR) models were also estimated. The MSTAR always outperformed the best performing univariate and multivariate linear models. Thus, our results highlight the importance of accounting for non-linearity, as well as the possible interrelationship amongst the variables under consideration, especially for forecasting.

We find that a move from autarky to free trade (a) raises the output of the representative firm and its level of total factor productivity, and (b) reduces (raises) the relative wage of high-skilled workers under the hypothesis of output-skill substitutability (output-skill complementarity).

Insofar as governments wishing to balance their waste collection service budgets can set the marginal benefit of collecting garbage equal to its marginal cost, no externality arises through pick-up frequency. However, when the expected punishment for dumping is zero or independent of its extent, the public provision of refuse collection frequency turns out to be negatively affected by the amount of garbage that individuals dump and, therefore, intervention in the management of household waste is required. The optimal policy is found to consist of taxes on consumption goods and subsidies for curbside (or legal) disposal and recycling that are directly linked to collection costs.","York Univ, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",York University - Canada,"Ferrara, I (通讯作者)，York Univ, Dept Econ, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",iferrara@yorku.ca,,,,,,,12,3,4,1,35,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1361-374X,,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

A reason is that people have limited self-regulatory resources, and self-regulatory failure occurs when these resources become overwhelmed. This paper provides evidence that this same mechanism can lead to reduced economic productivity subsequent to exposure to temptation. Using a design inspired by the classic Marshmallow Test, we report data from a field experiment in which children between the ages of 6 and 13 were exposed (or not) to a consumption temptation. We use these ages to take advantage of the well-established fact that the self-regulatory resources of younger children are more easily depleted than those of older children. We find that, subsequent to exposure to temptation, productivity of younger children is significantly detrimentally impacted, while that of older children remains essentially unchanged. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous demonstration that one need not succumb to temptation in order for it to detrimentally impact one's economic productivity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Anecdotal evidence seems to indicate that financial linkages may propagate shocks during crises. This paper develops a simple two-country model in which financial liberalisation across countries takes place in the presence of credit market distortions within countries. Countries may be subject to macro risk coming from productivity shocks and direct shocks to the credit system ('financial shocks'). Three different degrees of financial linkages between countries are examined. It is shown that the type of financial integration is critical for both macroeconomic outcomes and welfare. In particular, financial integration in bond markets alone may increase aggregate consumption volatility and reduce welfare. Financial integration in both bond and equity markets generates high positive co-movement across countries, but is welfare-improving. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The external value of the local currency is counter-cyclical, so that foreign currency debt requires larger repayments than local currency debt in bad states of nature. The level of foreign currency-denominated debts, therefore, affects the volatility of aggregate demand and by extension of the exchange rate. Exchange rate volatility is in turn an important determinant of the risk premium on local currency debt. Finally, this risk premium is a major factor in the choice of local versus foreign currency for emerging market borrowers. The mutual endogeneity of foreign currency debt, risk premia, and macroeconomic volatility creates important feedback effects in the economy: small increases in international risk aversion may entail large amplification effects on macroeconomic volatility since domestic borrowers substitute towards cheaper but riskier foreign currency debt finance.

Unfortunately, there is no widely accepted general theory of respondent behaviour that explains hypothetical bias.

We find that corruption declines between 2001 and 2004 overall, but much less so in districts with more secular party as opposed to Islamic party representatives in district assemblies. For a larger sample of districts, correspondingly, we find that corruption in 2004 is more in districts which voted more in favor of secular party representatives in the first elections in 1999.

In particular, we explore the case of Spain. Despite showing one of the most important increases in labor quality in the EU according to standard methods, it also presents a negative TFP growth. The paper shows the importance of considering-on top of observed changes in the composition of the labor force by gender, age, education, tenure, and nationality-changes in both average and relative productivities of those abovementioned socio-demographic groups over time. We first use a time varying weight index in order to capture the decrease in relative productivities across characteristics. Once this issue is considered the estimated growth of labor quality decreases notably and the index becomes flat between 2002 and 2006. We relate this slowdown to the increasing over-education of the Spanish workforce in the recent past. We then incorporate a selection model into the labor force. We argue that in the recent past there has been a massive entry of workers with below average unobserved abilities, generating a decrease in quality of labor. Indeed labor quality slightly decreased from 1995 onwards (always increasing without the selection model).","[Lacuesta, Aitor; Puente, Sergio; Cuadrado, Pilar] Bank Spain, Madrid, Spain",Banco de Espana,"Lacuesta, A (通讯作者)，Banco Espana, Alcala 48, Madrid 28014, Spain.",aitor.lacuesta@bde.es,,"Lacuesta, Aitor/0000-0002-7050-8462",,,,,24,6,6,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Two natural forms of job design are compared: (i) individual assignment, where each agent is assigned to a particular job and (ii) team assignment, where a group of agents share responsibility for a job and are jointly accountable for its outcome. Team assignment mitigates the multitasking problem but may weaken the implicit contracts. The optimal job design follows a cutoff rule where only the firms with high reputation concerns opt for team assignment. However, the cutoff rule need not hold if the firm can combine implicit incentives with explicit pay-per-performance contracts.","[Mukherjee, Arijit] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Vasconcelos, Luis] Univ Nova Lisboa, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal",Michigan State University; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Mukherjee, A (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",arijit@msu.edu; l-vasconcelos@fe.unl.pt,,"Vasconcelos, Luis/0000-0002-2952-5674",,,,,33,16,17,1,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

The actual empirical explanatory power of measures for labour market institutions, however, has recently been called into question. The Keynesian view holds periods of high real interest rates and insufficient capital accumulation responsible for unemployment. Empirical work in this tradition has paid little attention to the role of LMIs. This paper contributes to the debate by highlighting the role of autonomous changes in capital accumulation as a macroeconomic shock. In the empirical analysis, medium-term unemployment is explained by capital accumulation, LMIs and a number of macroeconomic shocks in a panel analysis covering 20 OECD countries. The economic effects of changes in LMI, variations in capital accumulation and other macro shocks are compared. Capital accumulation and the real interest rate are found to have statistically significant effects that are robust to the inclusion of control variables and show larger effects than LMI.","[Stockhammer, Engelbert] Kingston Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Kingston Upon Thames KT1 2EE, Surrey, England; [Klaer, Erik] Univ Trier, D-54286 Trier, Germany",Kingston University; Universitat Trier,"Stockhammer, E (通讯作者)，Kingston Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Penrhyn Rd, Kingston Upon Thames KT1 2EE, Surrey, England.",e.stockhammer@kingston.ac.uk,"Stockhammer, Engelbert/M-1744-2019","Stockhammer, Engelbert/0000-0002-5329-3535",,,,,47,32,34,1,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The analysis is based on daily price series for five different contract lengths traded on ICE Futures Europe. The price series and their first differences are tested for stationarity. Linear relationships between the pair-wise Gas oil and Crude oil contracts are then tested for co-integration. A co-integrated relationship is found for the 1 and 2 month contracts covering data from 1994 to 2009, and Error Correction Models are established to estimate the relationships. No co-integrated relationships are found for the 3, 6 and 12 month contracts covering the period 2002-2009, nor for the 1 and 2 month contracts for this period. The futures prices for this period are collected from a volatile market, including hurricane Katrina, the economic boom and the following financial crises which might explain these results. Thus, in such volatile periods the spread between Gas oil and Crude oil is likely to deviate, and it might take several years until it reverts to its equilibrium value. For energy traders and hedgers, this will imply that exposures to the crack spread should be treated with great care in such market environments. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we argue that these facts reflect different ways of regulating labor markets, either through the state or through the civil society, depending on the degree of cooperation in the economy. We rationalize these facts with a model of learning of the quality of labor relations. Distrustful labor relations lead to low unionization and high demand for direct state regulation of wages. In turn, state regulation crowds out the possibility for workers to experiment negotiation and learn about the potential cooperative nature of labor relations. This crowding out effect can give rise to multiple equilibria: a good equilibrium characterized by cooperative labor relations and high union density, leading to low state regulation; and a bad equilibrium, characterized by distrustful labor relations, low union density, and strong state regulation of the minimum wage.","[Aghion, Philippe] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Cahuc, Pierre] Ecole Polytech, F-91128 Palaiseau, France",Harvard University; Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"Aghion, P (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",paghion@fas.harvard.edu; yann.algan@sciences-po.fr; cahuc@ensae.fr,,"AGHION, Philippe/0000-0002-9019-1677",,,,,44,62,68,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

An empirical application to the Nasdaq stock price index in the 1990s provides confirmation of explosiveness and date stamps the origination of financial exuberance to mid-1995, prior to the famous remark in December 1996 by Alan Greenspan about irrational exuberance in the financial market, thereby giving the remark empirical content.","[Yu, Jun] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, Singapore 178903, Singapore; Univ Southampton, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England; Univ Auckland, Auckland 1, New Zealand; Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA; Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Chinese Acad Finance & Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China",Singapore Management University; University of Southampton; University of Auckland; Yale University; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Yu, J (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, Singapore 178903, Singapore.",yujun@smu.edu.sg,"PHILLIPS, Peter Charles Bonest/D-1444-2009; YU, Jun/D-1455-2009","Yu, Jun/0000-0003-2360-5873; Phillips, Peter C B/0000-0003-2341-0451","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0956687] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,60,541,586,1,121,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,1468-2354,,INT ECON REV,Int.

Banks have an advantage in monitoring firms, but the latter can collude with banks and offer side-payments to reduce the intensity of monitoring. Opening up to international capital flows makes domestic banks' capital scarcer relative to uninformed capital, thus increasing the relative cost of monitoring. We show that capital account liberalization has ambiguous effects on the governance of the domestic financial system by sometimes increasing firms' incentives to collude with banks. We characterize the conditions under which governance is more likely to deteriorate after opening up the capital account, and discuss the effects on investment, productivity and output. We also analyze the effects of foreign direct investment in the corporate and banking sectors. Stylized facts are consistent with the predictions of the model.","[Tressel, Thierry] Univ Southampton, Ctr Econ Policy Res CEPR London, PSE, Int Monetary Fund, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England; [Verdier, Thierry] Univ Southampton, Paris Jourdan Sci Econ PSE, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England",University of Southampton; University of Southampton,"Tressel, T (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Ctr Econ Policy Res CEPR London, PSE, Int Monetary Fund, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England.",ttressel@if.org; tv@pse.ens.fr,,,,,,,56,6,6,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

The paper gives a brief review of the literature on the subject, which shows the conceptual chaos around the meaning of this term, and it presents author's own definition of the risk related to the financial leverage. The definition is based on the folded cumulative distribution function and it interprets the risk as an increased probability of obtaining extreme ROE values after incurring debt. The proposed definition is a generalization of partial concepts applied in the literature. Its main merit is a flexibility, which allows for different interpretation of the parameters concerned.

We analyse a dataset of privatization indicators covering small- and large-scale industries in 19 transition countries over the period 1990-2007 and introduce a government ideology index. The results suggest that market-oriented governments promoted the privatization of small-scale industries more than that of large-scale ones. In the rapid transition process in the early 1990s, leftist governments stuck to public ownership more strongly than in the following period from the mid-1990s to 2007. The remarkable differences between leftist and right-wing governments concerning both the role of government in the economy and the basic elements of political order are in line with developments in OECD countries, and may also hold further implications for transition and democratizing countries outside Central and Eastern Europe.","[Bjornskov, Christian] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ, Aarhus Sch Business, DK-8230 Abyhoj, Denmark; [Potrafke, Niklas] Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, D-78457 Constance, Germany",Aarhus University; University of Konstanz,"Bjornskov, C (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ, Aarhus Sch Business, Hermodsvej 22, DK-8230 Abyhoj, Denmark.",chbj@asb.dk; niklas.potrafke@uni-konstanz.de,,,,,,,64,48,49,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

Scientists agree that the reason for the interest in such investigations arises because of increased worldwide concern about the impact of energy and environmental policies on the country's economy. Recently, the investigations of causality interrelationships between energy consumption and economic growth have been performed for many countries, including Indonesia Thailand, Japan, China, other Asian countries, G7 economies, Spain, Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, Central America, OECD and non OECD, Sub-Sahara African countries, for the panel of countries (China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, India, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand), and many other countries. The results of these investigations are different, country-specific and depend on the structure of the economy, energy type selected, period analyzed, methodology applied and a variety of other factors. The main research question of this article is to answer if consumption of renewable energy sources (further in the text RES) might influence Lithuania's real gross domestic product (further in the text real GDP); if so what is real GDP elasticity of RES gross inland consumption in Lithuania. Thus, the causality interrelationship between RES gross inland consumption and real GDP in Lithuania during 1990-2009 is analyzed and elasticity coefficients are calculated. At the beginning of the article scientific literature regarding the issue of interrelationship between RES consumption and economic growth is reviewed. Later, applied methodology is briefly described. Unit root, co-integration and Granger causality tests are the main methods employed to set an interrelationship between the selected variables. The results of the analysis show that there is a unidirectional causality running from RES gross inland consumption to real GDP in Lithuania in a short-run. The conclusion that wider utilization and consumption of RES could contribute to Lithuanian real GDP in a short-run is reached. A long-run effect of RES development on real GDP is not identified. Calculated coefficients of real GDP elasticity of RES gross inland consumption are positive and above 1.0, i.e. real GDP is elastic in respect to RES gross inland consumption. This reflects that RES gross inland consumption increases slightly slower than real GDP. However, during economic recession period that was influenced by external factors, the growth of RES gross inland consumption only a little could improve the reduction of real GDP (real GDP elasticity is negative).","[Bobinaite, Viktorija; Juozapaviciene, Aldona] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Bobinaite, Viktorija; Konstantinaviciute, Inga] Lithuanian Energy Inst, LT-44403 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology; Lithuanian Energy Institute,"Bobinaite, V (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",viktorija_bobinaite@yahoo.com; aldona.juozapaviciene@ktu.lt; inga@mail.lei.lt,,"Konstantinaviciute, Inga/0000-0001-7792-8753",,,,,42,19,19,0,25,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We explicitly model two asymmetries between the incumbent operator and a group of homogenous entrants: (i) while the incumbent has zero marginal costs, the entrant has the wholesale access charge as (positive) marginal costs; (ii) while the incumbent sets a two-part tariff at the retail level (fixed fee and calls price), the entrant can only set a linear price for calls. We model the product of the incumbent as horizontally differentiated from the products of the entrants, who are homogenous and do not have any market power. Competition from other infrastructures such as mobile telephony or cable is modelled as an outside opportunity for consumers. We find that entrants without market power might be subject to a margin squeeze if the wholesale access price is set at average costs and competitive pressure from other infrastructures increases. We argue that wholesale price regulation at average costs is not optimal in such a situation and discuss other forms of cost-based regulation, retail-minus and deregulation as potential alternatives.","[Briglauer, Wolfgang] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria; [Goetz, Georg] Univ Giessen, D-35390 Giessen, Germany; [Schwarz, Anton] Rundfunk & Telekom Regulierungs GmbH, Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business; Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Briglauer, W (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria.",,,"Goetz, Georg/0000-0001-7878-6726",,,,,37,3,3,1,13,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

The structural break analysis and the stationarity analysis point to monetary and fiscal determinants of inflation.","[Caporale, Tony] Univ Dayton, Dept Econ, Dayton, OH 45469 USA; [Paxton, Julia] Ohio Univ, Dept Econ, Athens, OH 45701 USA",University System of Ohio; University of Dayton; University System of Ohio; Ohio University,"Caporale, T (通讯作者)，Univ Dayton, Dept Econ, Dayton, OH 45469 USA.",caporale@udayton.edu,,,,,,,13,5,5,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We conclude that inflation rates had been reduced in Mexico before the introduction of IT and FFIT. In our opinion, the structural reforms, including the Banxico reforms, are the main determinants of the decrease in inflation and its variability.

Defining authority as the right to choose a project and contract with the agent who does not directly contract with the principal, we ask when the principal can benefit from delegating authority to one of the agents. We show that beneficial delegation is possible when complete contracts cannot be written and authority is delegated to the information gatherer. The benefits of delegation stem from either efficiency gains or reduction in rent to the information gatherer. This can be viewed as a reasonable portrayal of a typical corporate hierarchy where top managers are delegated the authority to make strategic decisions and to contract with other employees.","[Choe, Chongwoo] Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Park, In-Uck] Univ Bristol, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England",Monash University; University of Bristol,"Choe, C (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",chongwoo.choe@monash.edu; i.park@bristol.ac.uk,,"Choe, Chongwoo/0000-0001-6145-6907",,,,,49,1,1,0,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

One of the components of this market is a regulated provision for security of supply which consists of rules for the implementation and use of a given reserve stock of gas. We investigate the impact of this policy on the profitability of a storage operator, using data from Denmark and Italy. Keeping storage capacity constant, the costs of the strategic stock are around 20% of the value of the storage market for Denmark, and 16% for Italy. This cost is due to the inability to extract arbitrage profits from the captive stock. Furthermore, the strategic storage restriction induces behavior that would virtually never be replicated by a private storage operator in an unconstrained market, in particular in the first 6 months of the year when unconstrained firms empty their reservoirs much faster, suggesting the strategic restriction is unnecessarily distorting the market.

Such processes as industrial or commercial espionage are known much more. The actions, which are used in order to be protected from the mentioned influence, are as follows: making the lists of commercial secrets, official regulations, protection of corporal and informative data and other currently used tools. The competitive intelligence, which plays an especially important part in the context of globalization, is considered to be more significant with developing technologies (Blenkhorn, 2005). In any institution strategic decisions are made by executives at the highest level. According to the Doctor of Science at Pittsburgh University John E. Prescott, the executives of the highest level with no reaction to rivals actions are not forgiven (Prescott, 2004). So it is possible to characterize the first potential clients who might buy the services provided by competitive intelligence. Large international corporations could become such customers. On one side, such corporations have two alternatives of their choice, they are: buying competitive intelligence service from independent companies providing professional services or establish an internal detachment of competitive intelligence as a separate element or as an element working inside the detachment which has already been acting. Anyway it is clear that a lot of preparations are necessary working with large corporations to prove the advantages of the services provided by competitive intelligence (Fleisher, 2001). The available experience is one of the main arguments which could be presented by specialists of competitive intelligence. There are not many institutions preparing trained specialists in the field of competitive intelligence which would currently work. So mostly such specialists having got university degrees in economics, law, management, administration or other fields also having attended special training courses are experienced at working in special operational or secret services. Miller names the experience which specialists of competitive intelligence had got in military and governmental intelligence also working in detachments of analysis of information as an evidence of their available qualification (Miller. 2004). Later on due to the efforts made by the Association of Competitive Intelligence Professionals (ACIP) and some scientists the new professional direction also such profession as a specialist off competitive intelligence appeared. The experience of national intelligence services proves the importance of collecting and analysis of systemic information provided by intelligence for business (ACIP, 2011). Nevertheless it is necessary to remark that the main aim of business is getting profit so it is necessary to adapt the methods used by intelligence services for business goals. Providing security does not play the main part in this case.

Two regimes are used to optimally sort the firms in a given country based on a switching function using profit rate (net income to book equity) as its variable. The regimes are identified as a Bear security market or a Bull security market depending on the value of the profit rate. Two financial ratios are used in the regime regressions. It was found that the optimum scaled switch point separating the Bulls from the Bears for the countries was a positive profit rate ranging between 6 and 24%. The notion that a zero or negative profit rate identifies a Bear market is not supported. In general, the results across countries and for the long-term debt ratio were quite consistent. The post-Asian financial crisis of 1997 had a depressing effect on firm market equity values, regardless of the market type and the country. The Bulls and the Bears are not cousins when it comes to their different reactions to the long-term debt ratio and their different, relative, adverse responses to the financial crisis.","Univ Utah, Dept Econ, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Gander, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Utah, Dept Econ, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",gander@economics.utah.edu,,,,,,,27,3,3,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Most of the existing studies have focused on valuing equity-linked life insurance contracts by quantile hedging or in a framework of stochastic interest rates. However, a few have taken into account simultaneously the two techniques, which make valuing equity-linked life insurance contracts more difficult. We model the term structure of interest rates by classical HJM model that imbeds stochastic interest rate economy into one containing an arbitrary number of additional risky assets. By means of the change of measure approach, we give explicit formulas for the fair values of the following four products; deterministic payoff contract, pure equity-linked life contract, equity-linked life contract with guarantee, equity-linked life contract with minimum guarantees and capped benefits. We find that the explicit formulas are mainly composed of normal distribution functions and two-dimensional normal distribution functions. We also investigate sensibility of the survival probability using data of interest rates, stock prices and life table from China. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

To investigate the transitional dynamics of the contest in the case of a general cost function, we linearize the model around the steady state. Our analysis shows that optimal asset stocks and their speed of convergence to the steady state crucially depend on the elasticity of marginal effort costs, the discount factor and the depreciation rate. In the case of a cost function with a constant elasticity of marginal costs, a lower discount factor, a higher depreciation rate and a lower elasticity imply a higher speed of convergence to the steady state. We further analyze the effects of second prizes in the contest. A higher prize spread increases individual and aggregate asset stocks, but does not alter the balance of the contest in the long run. During the transition, a higher prize spread increases asset stocks, produces a more balanced contest in each period and increases the speed of convergence to the steady state.","[Grossmann, Martin; Lang, Markus; Dietl, Helmut] Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Grossmann, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",martin.grossmann@business.uzh.ch; markus.lang@business.uzh.ch; helmut.dietl@business.uzh.ch,"Lang, Markus/AAD-2995-2019","Lang, Markus/0000-0002-6837-790X",,,,,45,0,0,0,0,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6124,1935-1704,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

We present evidence that learning took place among heterogeneous agents during a large-scale multi-stage auction that is unique in terms of its size, incentives and variation.

This study sets out a framework in which to identify the degree of preference heterogeneity in WTP of pedestrians to avoid being killed or injured. A stated choice experiment approach is developed. The empirical setting is a choice of walking route for a particular trip that a sample of pedestrians periodically undertakes in Australia. Mixed logit models are estimated to obtain the marginal (dis)utilities associated with each influence on the choice amongst the attribute packages offered in the stated choice scenarios.

We find that the exchange rate volatility both significantly and positively affects the bid-ask spreads, while the number of deals and quotation changes negatively affect the bid-ask spreads. These results are similar to those of past studies. We also find that a U-shaped pattern exists in the Tokyo trading hours and an inverted U-shaped pattern in the London trading hours, in addition to a round clock inverted U-shaped pattern of spread volatility. This inverted U-shaped pattern may be caused by unexpected news arrivals. The spread behaviour of the EBS global electronic broking market is not different from that of other electronic interdealer quotation markets and electronic broking markets.","[Hua, Mingshu] Takming Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Banking & Finance, Taipei 11451, Taiwan; [Li, Chen-Yu] Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Int Business Studies, Puli, Nantou County, Taiwan",Takming University Science & Technology; National Chi Nan University,"Hua, MS (通讯作者)，Takming Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Banking & Finance, 56 Sect 1,Huanshan Rd, Taipei 11451, Taiwan.",mingshu_hua@yahoo.com.tw,,"Li, Chen-Yu/0000-0003-1097-838X",,,,,41,4,4,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Therefore, four groups of qualitative relational exchange' factors have been determined: attractiveness of supplier, attractiveness of total purchasing market for the buyer, competitive position of the buyer on the purchasing market, and the bargaining orientation of the buyer toward its strategic supplier. Drawing on emerging perspectives on service companies with more than 200 employees in Slovenia and their relationship with strategic suppliers, the author proposes that a buyer's perception of qualitative elements of relational exchanges influences employment of particular marketing strategies towards its strategic supplier. Results of empirical study show some correlation between the groups of variables investigated. The influence of measured factors on the implementation of particular group of marketing strategies exists, although the strongest impact is prevailed especially by factors, which are characteristic for short-term relationships. Hence the surveyed companies are oriented much more toward achieving short-term efficiency instead of long-term effectiveness. This research makes a contribution to the strategy literature and to the practitioners, and has important implications for purchasing managers by offering guidelines for mixing the various aspects of partnering according to their objectives and strategies in order to improve the level of their relational approach to their strategic suppliers.","Univ Maribor, Dept Mkt, Fac Econ & Business, Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Irsic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Dept Mkt, Fac Econ & Business, Maribor, Slovenia.",matjaz.irsic@uni-mb.si,,,,,,,50,2,2,0,7,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIVERSITY PULA,PULA,"PRERADOVICEVA 1-1, PULA, 52 100, CROATIA",1331-677X,,,EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

In this article I introduce an original instrument for this problematic FDI variable, capturing the general FDI intensity of manufacturing industries. I use this instrument to estimate FDI externalities in a cross-section of Mexican manufacturing industries. The main findings show that, in contrast to the common criticism that Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation produces an upward bias in the estimated FDI externality effect, for the sample of Mexican manufacturing industries OLS estimation causes a downward bias. Controlling for the tendency among foreign manufacturing firms to gravitate towards low productivity industries, the instrumental variable estimations provide robust evidence of significantly larger positive FDI spillover effects.","Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business Adm, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Jordaan, JA (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business Adm, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",jjordaan@feweb.vu.nl,"Jordaan, Jacob/AFM-9545-2022","Jordaan, Jacob/0000-0002-6981-0584",,,,,58,9,10,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.
