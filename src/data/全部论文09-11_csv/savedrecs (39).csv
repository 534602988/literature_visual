The author further examines the possibilities of measuring globalisation process intensity on both world wide and national economy levels. The article assigns a set of characteristic features or indicators making possible to define main limits of when a given national economy can be hold as being incorporated and in what rate into the globalisation process. This step of identification of globalisation intensity rate is very important, as starting point, when a strategy of adaptation to globalisation trends is needed to be formulated, evidently, closely with the competitiveness growth and catching-up strategy elaboration.","Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Forecasting, Bratislava 81105, Slovakia",Slovak Academy of Sciences,"Outrata, R (通讯作者)，Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Forecasting, Sancova 56, Bratislava 81105, Slovakia.",progasis@savba.sk,,,,,,,50,2,2,0,8,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

One of the most substantial criteria influencing the economic results of a farm is the scope of its economic activity. Correlation of costs towards production and structure of costs are investigated and parameters of efficiency at Latvian agricultural farms of different size are analysed in this paper, with the aim to study the economic efficiency of farms depending on their size. The results of the study show that the structure of Latvian agricultural farms hinders using their potential for drawing income from agro-activity. Very small and very large farms are dominant in the farm structure, yet the analysis shows that the most efficient use of resources is at farms with the economic size between 16 and 250 ESU. The threshold of 16 ESU is substantial for the farm to be able to generate sufficient added value. Hence, in order to enhance competitiveness of Latvian agricultural farms, measures shall be carried out to increase the scopes of economic activity at the small farms. It would be useful to favour consolidation of separate small farms, thus facilitating efficient use of their resources. On the present conditions, the economic grounds for existence of small farms can only be in cases when the workforce used at them lacks alternative application. Some largest farms, on their part, could possibly work more efficiently, if they, just the other way round, were split up.","Univ Latvia, Latvian State Inst Agrarian Econ, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Veveris, A (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Latvian State Inst Agrarian Econ, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,7,2,2,0,4,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-9937-1-3,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2009,,18,,,,,194,201,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BTX02,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288345600027,0

There are theoretical and practical reasons to support the use of this discounting approach in relation to projects with intergenerational impact, where the environmental effects are considerable in relation to market effects.

We develop a new approach to mathematically model PE investment equity risk based on the Black-Cox default model. We find higher equity volatilities during boom periods. Further, deals conducted by more reputed PE sponsors have lower equity volatilities as they are unwilling to imperil their reputation by taking excessive risks. In addition, we find that PE sponsors' risk appetite is negatively related to the ownership stake in the buyout target company. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It is recognized that trade is hampered when buyers have incomplete information about the offered products, a problem accentuated in the international markets by the physical and cultural distances between buyers and sellers. Buyers look for proxies to assess product quality, and exporters that can provide assurance about quality gain a competitive advantage. Our paper focuses on voluntary or private regulatory programs that have emerged as important instruments to correct policy failures. We examine how trade competition motivates firms to signal quality by joining ISO 9000, the most widely adopted voluntary quality certification program in the world. Methodologically, our study is novel because we observe trade competition at the bilateral and the sectoral levels. Structural equivalence, the measure of competition we introduce in this paper, captures competitive threats posed by actors that export similar products to the same overseas markets. We study ISO 9000 adoption levels from 1993 to 2002 for 134 countries, and separately for non-OECD countries and non-EU countries. Across a variety of specifications, we find that trade competition drives ISO adoption: The uptake of ISO 9000 is encouraged by ISO 9000 adoption by firms located in countries that are structurally equivalent trade competitors. Given that information problems about product quality are likely to be more salient for developing country exporters, we find that trade competition offers a stronger motivation for ISO 9000 adoption in non-OECD countries in relation to developed countries.

Access to irrigation increases household consumption by 27-30% relative to water-recession and rain-fed cultivators. The paper also investigates whether irrigation has secondary impacts on risk-mitigating strategies by reducing covariate risk and reinforcing informal food sharing networks that allow households to insure against idiosyncratic risk. We find that households with irrigation save between 4.5 and 6.4 more tropical livestock units and are 20% more likely to engage in informal food sharing with non-irrigators. This finding suggests that impact estimates that rely on consumption, may underestimate welfare gains by ignoring the household's savings behavior and informal insurance network.

The December 2000 redefinition of the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) global equity index was a natural experiment addressing this question. It is argued that this event triggered a portfolio shift (by index funds) large enough to affect the residual asset supplies constituting the global and local market benchmarks of all actively managed capital. Changes in the market benchmarks imply distinct and predictable changes to global and local stock betas. Exploring whether global or local beta changes best explain the cross-section of event returns reveals that stocks in developed markets are priced globally and not locally.,"[Hau, Harald] Univ Geneva, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Hau, Harald] UNIMAIL, Swiss Finance Inst, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland",University of Geneva; University of Geneva,"Hau, H (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, 40 Bd Pont Arve, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.",prof@haraldhau.com,"MISHRA, AJAY/H-3875-2011",,,,,,34,21,22,1,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

While such arrangements have helped provide the necessary insurance capacity in the post-September 11, 2001 era, little is known about the effect of such governmental intervention on terrorism insurance markets. This paper focuses on the United States, where the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA) provides insurers with no cost federal reinsurance up to an industry-wide loss of $100 billion. We present an empirical analysis to compare how insurers' diversification behavior varies between property coverage (no governmental intervention) and terrorism coverage (with government intervention). We find evidence that insurers in the U.S. are much less diversified for terrorism coverage than they are for property lines of coverage. We interpret these findings as tentative evidence for moral hazard caused by the governmental intervention under TRIA. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we provide an overview of these programs and assess their impact on the flow of immigrants to smaller provinces, which have struggled to attract and retain skilled newcomers. We find, after controlling for provincial economic conditions, that the Nominee Programs of Manitoba, Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick were associated with significant increases in immigration flows to these provinces. We also find that one-year retentions rates of immigrants did not decrease for any province after the introduction of the PNPs. In fact, retention rates for immigrants through Nominee Programs were higher in most provinces than for economic class immigrants arriving through the federal programs. We conclude that PNPs were effective as a means of both attracting and retaining immigrants.","[Pandey, Manish; Townsend, James] Univ Winnipeg, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada",University of Winnipeg,"Pandey, M (通讯作者)，Univ Winnipeg, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada.",,,"Pandey, Manish/0000-0001-7874-6644",,,,,23,23,24,0,8,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

Most of this evidence is found in settings where payoffs are riskless. It is plausible that if people care about the payoffs of others, they do so not only in a riskless context, but also in a risky one. This suggests that an individual's decision making under risk depends on the risks others in his or her environment face. This paper is the first to test whether individuals' risk attitudes are affected by the risks others face. The results show that risk attitudes appear to be less affected by others' risks than expected, even though the same subjects do show concerns for inequality in a riskless setting. Interestingly, we find that people prefer risks to be independent across individuals in society rather than correlated.","[Rohde, Kirsten I.

J,"Armstrong, J; Preston, J",,,,"Armstrong, John; Preston, John",,,Alternative railway futures: growth and/or specialisation?,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Rail; Future; Climate change; Oil; Scenario,,"Recent centuries have seen a succession of transport technologies, each offering improvements in speed, carrying capacity and/or operational flexibility. Having overcome many physical barriers to freedom of movement, humanity now faces two major, related challenges: dwindling reserves of fossil fuels, and anthropogenic climate change. In these circumstances, rail transport has significant potential advantages over the more energy-intensive modes of road and air. Railways dominated 19th century land transport, peaking in importance in the early 1900s. Market share then declined in the face of competition from road transport and aviation, although rail retained significant passenger and freight transport roles. Major improvements in railway operating efficiency were introduced later in the 20th century, including: the switch from steam to diesel and electric traction; containerisation and focus on long-haul, unit-train freight operations; and the development of high-speed passenger rail services in Japan and Europe, enabling rail to compete successfully with air travel over distances of up to 800 km. The UK Government's Foresight Programme commissioned a report entitled Intelligent Infrastructure Futures, for which four scenarios were developed of how society might be in 2055. These scenarios are: 'Perpetual Motion', 'Urban Colonies', 'Tribal Trading' and 'Good Intentions', each having its own implications for the future of transport. This paper considers the implications of each scenario, and of the underlying/overriding issues of peak oil and climate change, for the possible role and significance of rail transport in meeting our transport needs in the mid-21st century and beyond.

Theory suggests feedback between MBS holdings and underlying asset markets can be aggravated by mark-to-market accounting. We measure feedback by the relation between asset returns and the changes in bank MBS holdings. Consistent with the existence of feedback effects related to mark-to-market, we find that for banks with high MBS, more nonperforming loans, and lower total capital ratio, changes in bank MBS positions are positively associated with changes in MBS prices and that this relation is reduced after the April 2009 mark-to-market rule clarification. To assess the effect of feedback on shareholder value, we test whether the stock-price response of banks to the announcement of the mark-to-market accounting rule clarification is associated with the intensity of feedback behavior. We find that the stock market reaction to the rule change is more positive for banks with more MBS, higher nonperforming loans and higher pre-rule-change feedback. We also find positive bond-price reactions to the rule change. Overall, our results suggest feedback related to mark-to-market accounting had a measurable effect on shareholder value.

Its aim is to understand how geographic context may influence transport disadvantage which may in turn influence social exclusion and well-being. There were very clear differences in mobility and car reliance between geographic locations. Car reliance peaked in fringe Melbourne with regional areas showing slightly less car reliance. Mobility and kilometres travelled also increased with distance from central Melbourne, which in turn resulted in greater sensitivity to fuel price increases. Again these factors were greatest in fringe Melbourne. Links between transport disadvantage and social exclusion were small and inconsistent in this paper although they have been demonstrated in other research. Links between transport disadvantage and well-being were strongest in the regional sample. The implications of these findings and their connection to the transport literature are discussed.

This paper highlights four properties of price-contingent trading that increase the frequency of such events. Price-contingent trading is common across financial market, since it includes algorithmic trading, technical trading, and dynamic option hedging. The four properties we consider are: (1) high kurtosis in the distribution of order sizes; (2) clustering of trades within the day; (3) clustering of trades at certain prices; and (4) feedback between trading and returns. The paper estimates the relative importance of these factors using data from the foreign exchange market. Calibrated simulations indicate that interactions among these factors are at least as important as any single one. Among individual factors, the orders' size distribution and feedback effects have the strongest influence. Overall, price-contingent trading could account for half of realized excess kurtosis. The paper suggests that extreme returns unaccompanied by news are statistically inevitable in the presence of price-contingent trading. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Thirdly, we focus on the fundamental role of social influence (conformism, leadership), group formation (identity, discrimination) and social ties (family, friends), on individual and collective economic decisions.

Controlling for differences in institutional arrangements among countries, panel data regressions on a sample of observations from 20 high-income OECD nations spanning the years 1972 to 2005 indicate that decentralization is positively related to income. The empirical analysis shows that institutions consistent with economic freedom enhance the positive income effects of decentralization. Thus, the impact of public sector decentralization is dependent upon a nation's institutional environment.","Univ Tampa, Tampa, FL 33606 USA",University of Tampa,"Buser, W (通讯作者)，Univ Tampa, 401 W Kenedy Blvd, Tampa, FL 33606 USA.",wbuser@ut.edu,,,,,,,43,29,30,0,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,OCT,2011,149.0,1-2,,,SI,,31,48,,10.1007/s11127-011-9827-6,0.0,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,817QJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000294688600003,0

Our results reflect the existence of true state dependence both in the decision of R&D investment and in the production of innovations. The omission of this persistence leads to an overestimation of the current impact of innovations on productivity growth.

Using a model that integrates agency costs and bargaining benefits of management-friendly provisions, we identify the economic determinants of the resulting trade-offs for shareholder value. Consistent with the theory, our empirical analysis shows that provisions that allow managers to delay takeovers have significant bargaining effects and a positive relation with shareholder value in concentrated industries. By contrast, non-delay provisions have an unambiguously negative relation with value, particularly in concentrated industries. Our analysis suggests that there are governance trade-offs for shareholders and that industry concentration is an important determinant of their severity.","[Kadyrzhanova, Dalida] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Rhodes-Kropf, Matthew] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Harvard University,"Kadyrzhanova, D (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,,,,,,,67,39,53,1,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

Specifically, this article examines the existence and persistence of first-mover and early-entrant advantages across different technological regimes. We find that these advantages are influenced by characteristics of the firms, as well as, of the technological regimes under which they operate. In general, early entry into a market benefits a firm in terms of the size and growth rate of its market share. Early entrants, including first movers, have higher market shares, except in regimes with high technological opportunity and low R&D appropriability. However, first movers are disadvantaged in terms of market share growth, except in regimes with low technological opportunities and high R&D appropriability. We also find that firm-specific competences in R&D and advertising help to maintain (attenuate) first-mover and early-entrant advantages (disadvantages).","[Kim, Jungho; Lee, Chang-Yang] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol KAIST, KAIST Business Sch, Seoul 130722, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST),"Kim, J (通讯作者)，Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol KAIST, KAIST Business Sch, 85 Hoegiro, Seoul 130722, South Korea.",jhokim@business.kaist.ac.kr; drcylee@business.kaist.ac.kr,"Lee, Chang-Yang/C-1629-2011","Kim, Jungho/0000-0003-2241-4522",,,,,45,17,19,1,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Our empirical framework can empirically distinguish surcharging motivated by this strategic concern from surcharging that simply maximizes ATM profit considered as a stand-alone operation. The results are consistent with such behavior by large banks, but not by small banks.

A correction procedure for thin and nonsynchronous trading was applied but failed to produce significantly different results. Following an ARCH based model building procedure, conditional heteroscedasticity models are applied to the log return series. Significant differences in forecasting performance cannot be detected. The random walk hypothesis is generally rejected for daily but differences appear across markets using weekly and monthly data.

We then examine whether this superior ability persists after controlling for the timing advantage by using relative forecast error, a measure that largely eliminates the timing advantage of recent forecasts. Using a sample of quarterly earnings forecast revisions over the 20-year period from 1990 to 2009, we find that analysts with more firm-specific and general experience and more accurate prior-period forecasts, analysts employed by larger brokerage firms, and analysts who follow fewer industries and companies tend to revise forecasts later in the quarter. We also find that analyst characteristics that are positively correlated with revision timing are negatively related to relative forecast errors. These results are consistent with analyst characteristics being useful proxies for analyst forecasting ability and analysts with greater ability revising forecasts later in the quarter.

The managerial power view of governance suggests that executive pay, the existing process of proxy access, and various governance provisions [e.g., staggered boards and Chief Executive Officer (CEO)-chairman duality] are associated with managerial rent extraction. This perspective predicts that broad government actions that reduce executive pay, increase proxy access, and ban such governance provisions are value-enhancing. In contrast, another view of governance suggests that observed governance choices are the result of value-maximizing contracts between shareholders and management. This perspective predicts that broad government actions that regulate such governance choices are value destroying. Consistent with the latter view, we find that the abnormal returns to recent events relating to corporate governance regulations are, on average, decreasing in CEO pay, decreasing in the number of large blockholders, decreasing in the ease by which small institutional investors can access the proxy process, and decreasing in the presence of a staggered board.

Focusing on a broad sample of country-years in the post-Bretton Woods era defined by international capital mobility, the statistical results show that not only are more democratic regimes negatively associated with de facto fixity using three different operational measures for this dependent variable, but that this negative relationship gets stronger as the median voter is more likely to be a domestically oriented producer and as societal groups are more able to influence public policy.","[Bearce, David H.] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Bearce, DH (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Campus Box 333, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",david.bearce@colorado.edu,,,,,,,60,33,42,0,15,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

Through a nonlinear weight function, the new measure can flexibly reflect the investor's degree of risk aversion, and can control the fat-tail phenomenon of the loss distribution. A realistic portfolio selection model with typical market frictions taken into account is established based on the new measure. Real data from the Chinese stock markets and American stock markets are used for empirical comparison of the new risk measure with the expected shortfall risk measure. The in-sample and out-of-sample empirical results show that the new risk measure and the corresponding portfolio selection model can not only reflect the investor's risk-averse attitude and the impact of different trading constraints, but can find robust optimal portfolios, which are superior to the corresponding optimal portfolios obtained under the expected shortfall risk measure.

We then estimate the determinants of income distribution using a panel Bayesian structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model, for a set of 49 countries over the 1994-2002 period. We uncover a significant causality running from financial sector development to income distribution. In addition, the banking sector seems to exert a stronger impact on inequality.

This exercise is of significance because of the tendency to refer to 'mobility' in a rather general sense. Coping with this question, we will, first, put it within a review of relevant concepts and structures. Then, we will elaborate on the distinct features of each of the three mobility categories through their comparison, highlighting mainly differences among them. This will be followed by a presentation of a somehow opposite perspective through the examination of convergences among the three categories of mobility. These two discussions will lead us to view mobility as one single entity consisting of three categories, since all the three categories are IT-based and IT-dependent, and given that they all share a similar model of mobility cycles for both moving people and mobility systems. Using this approach we will compare terrestrial public and personal mobilities, as well as aerial and virtual mobilities, followed by a discussion on implications of a single general mobility model.

Our results suggest basically no short-run employment effects of the EU enlargement except for firms active in wholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants.

Relating two different dimensions of market power to earnings forecastability, we document that (a) a firm's relative pricing power and (b) its industry concentration are strong positive determinants of analysts' earnings forecast accuracy. We find that forecasting earnings of higher market power firms is less complex due to their ability to withstand cost shocks as well as greater informational-efficiency enjoyed by such firms. Further, forecast optimism increases with weakening product market pricing power and with lower industry concentration. The knowledge derived from this study will hopefully improve the accuracy of equity valuation, and thereby engender better buy-side (stock selections) and sell-side recommendations by analysts. Our analysis also suggests that brokerage firms compensating analysts based on forecast accuracy need to adjust for the differential in the information complexity of different industries.

We formulate and test the forward volatility unbiasedness hypothesis, which may be viewed as the volatility analogue to the extensively researched hypothesis of unbiasedness in forward exchange rates. Using a new dataset of spot implied volatility quoted on over-the-counter currency options, we compute the forward implied volatility that corresponds to the delivery price of a forward contract on future spot implied volatility. This contract is known as a forward volatility agreement. We find strong evidence that forward implied volatility is a systematically biased predictor that overestimates movements in future spot implied volatility. This bias in forward volatility generates high economic value to an investor exploiting predictability in the returns to volatility speculation and indicates the presence of predictable volatility term premiums in foreign exchange.

We assess whether the ALMO stress test was an adequate representation of an extremely weak housing market, given the best available information leading up to the Great Recession. A Monte Carlo simulation model is developed to estimate the severity of low probability events (i.e., severe house price declines). We illustrate the complexity and subjective nature of the process used to generate a plausible house price stress test scenarios. A major finding is that the ALMO stress test scenario severely understated (possibly by 50% or more) what an updated statistical process would have suggested. Part of this stems from idiosyncrasies related to the construction and implementation of ALMO, while other factors include a fundamental shift in the relationship between housing price appreciation and key explanatory variables - especially over the past 10-15 years, which shows a heightened role of momentum in explaining changes in housing prices. We offer several suggestions for a new stress test that include: continual updates and testing; variation across markets; and, like the recent FRB stress test, the scenario should be based on real (rather than nominal) price patterns.

Telephone evidence of gendered communication strategies,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PSYCHOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Gender differences; Communication; Telephones; Discrimination; Social networks,COALITIONS; MODEL,"We investigate whether there are systematic gender differences in communication behavior by telephone. First, we report a study of anonymized billing records 01 3103 subscribers to a large mobile operator in Italy and Greece over 2 years from 2006 to 2008. Faced with identical tariffs, women make fewer calls than men, and their calls last 16% longer controlling for other factors. Secondly, we report a study of some 92,000 person-days of calls to call-center employees of a large consumer services company operator at four sites in Germany. Calls randomly allocated to women last 15% longer than those of men controlling for other factors. There is no evidence, however, that this results in the women being any less effective employees than the men; indeed, in operations involving sales where it is possible to measure productivity by this criterion, female employees make slightly more sales per shift than men. It appears instead to reflect systematic gender differences in communication strategies, though it may reflect also an element of preference by both men and women for speaking to women. The findings of both studies are highly statistically significant and are found across all age groups. The magnitude of gender differences is sensitive to the costs of communication. The results have implications for possible explanations of gender clustering in the labor market. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Although it is too early to draw firm conclusions, initial results so far suggest that a policy mix of lower policy rate, a wider interest rate corridor, combined with higher required reserve ratios may serve as all appropriate strategy in dealing with short term capital inflows, especially in countries with current account deficits.",,,,erdem.basci@tcmb.gov.tr; hakan.kara@tcmb.gov.tr,"Başçı, Erdem/AAZ-8500-2021",,,,,,8,20,20,1,19,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

Incentive pay may be explained and justified by four phenomena, which may have important effects on the net benefits of an organization: moral hazard, adverse selection, the need to induce profitable cooperation in organizations, the need to counteract costly or unproductive institutional and/or regulatory constraints. Incentive pay systems should be distinguished from variable pay designed as a risk sharing agreement as such variable pay systems need not be an incentive pay system. Incentive pay should be understood as compensation schemes which create congruence within an organization: incentive pay can contribute to ensuring that the pursuit of individual objectives or interests is canalized towards the achievement of the organization's goals and objectives. The currently designed compensation formulas may not be the best or optimal ones to achieve the goals set for the organization: hence the need to recall the twelve basic principles.","[Boyer, Marcel] Univ Montreal, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Boyer, Marcel] Ecole Polytech Paris, Dept Econ, Paris, France",Universite de Montreal,"Boyer, M (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.",Marcel.Boyer@cirano.qc.ca,,,,,,,15,6,6,0,17,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

However, lack of market experience may cause respondents in valuation surveys to be more prone to interview effects than they would be with other opinion surveys. Without reference to market price or experience, respondents are less likely to have well-defined preferences, which may cause respondents to be more easily influenced by the interview process and characteristics of the interviewer. In this paper, we investigate interview effects in a random digit dial telephone survey of recycling valuation and behavior. Following previous research in both psychology and survey methodology, we test the direct effects of interviewer gender and race, as well as the interaction effects between interviewer and respondent characteristics. Using data from 130 interviewers and 1,786 interviewees, we apply a hierarchical regression model that accounts for the clustering of interviews and controls for a variety of other confounding variables. We confirm the existence of both direct and conditional interviewer effects. Respondents state higher willingness to pay when interviewed by white or female interviewers than by non-white or male interviewers. There were also significant interaction effects between interviewer and respondent characteristics. The directions of the interviewer effects are consistent with previous survey research and social psychology theories. We also identify some non-traditional interview process factors that have an influence on survey responses.","[Aadland, David] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Gong, Min] Columbia Univ, Ctr Res Environm Decis, New York, NY 10027 USA",University of Wyoming; Columbia University,"Aadland, D (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, 1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",aadland@uwyo.edu,,"Aadland, David/0000-0002-2638-2233","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0951516] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,55,9,9,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We also find that media concentration increases corruption both directly and indirectly through its interaction with media state ownership. In addition, we find that media state ownership and media concentration both accentuate the positive link between official supervisory power and lending corruption and attenuate the negative link between the regulations that empower private monitoring and corruption in lending. Media state ownership or media concentration also accentuates the positive link between banking concentration and corruption in lending. Furthermore, the links between media structure and corruption are more pronounced when the borrowing firm is privately owned. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This question has mainly been addressed indirectly, by asking whether the second-best optimal environmental tax is higher or lower than the first-best Pigouvian rate. Even this indirect question has itself been approached indirectly, comparing the second-best optimal environmental tax to a proxy for its first-best value, marginal social damage (MSD). On closer examination, however, MSD becomes ambiguously defined and variable in a second-best setting making it an unreliable proxy for the Pigouvian rate. Given these observations, the current analysis reevaluates these welfare questions and finds that when compared directly to its first-best value, the second-best optimal environmental tax generally rises with increased revenue requirements. Even in cases where the second-best environmental tax is lower than its first-best value, the welfare gains may be greater than in a first-best setting. These results suggest that the marginal fiscal benefit (revenue recycling effect) exceeds the marginal fiscal cost (tax base effect) over a range of environmental tax rates that, for benchmark models, extends above the first-best Pigouvian rate. These findings reinforce the intuition that environmental policy complements rather than competes with the provision of other public goods.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Oregon State University,"Jaeger, WK (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 213 Ballard Extens Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",wjaeger@oregonstate.edu,,,,,,,32,14,14,4,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Emphasis is placed upon the effects of Greek FDI, which is known to be of a distinctively regional character. We find that Greek FDI produces significantly larger positive spillovers, which appear more suitable for the Bulgarian context of transition and economic restructuring.

Due to the discrete and lumpy nature of these margins, only a fraction of plants adjust output in response to shocks. In a business cycle model calibrated to establishment-level observations, these nonconvexities make aggregate output less volatile than when plants can adjust smoothly. Further, the mass of adjusting plants is larger in downturns than in upturns, leading to counter-cyclical volatility of aggregate output and government policy being slightly more effective in recessions than in expansions.

Although linear methods yield quite accurate solutions for a broad class of DSGE models, some important economic issues (e.g., portfolio choice and welfare) cannot be adequately addressed by first-order methods. This paper provides yet another case when first-order methods may be inadequate for capturing the business cycle properties of a DSGE model. In particular, the authors show that increasing returns to scale (due to production externalities) may induce asymmetric business cycles and nonlinear income effects that are not fully captured by linear approximation methods. For example, hump-shaped output dynamics can emerge even when externalities are below the threshold level required for indeterminacy, and output expansion tends to be smoother and longer, whereas contraction tends to be deeper but shorter-lived, as observed in the U.S. economy.

We study the impact of this informationally privileged position on the borrowing firm using a broad panel of U.S. firms over the 1993-2004 period. We measure the strength of the bank-firm relationship by bank-firm proximity, size of the loan, and the lender's insider potential. We show that a stronger relationship, by inducing better monitoring, improves the borrower's corporate governance. Simultaneously, it makes the bank a potentially more informed agent in the equity market. This information asymmetry increases adverse selection for the other market participants and lowers the firm's stock liquidity. This trade-off between improved corporate governance and greater information asymmetry affects the firm's value.

There is also a great deal of public angst about the level and timing of commitments made in these plans. The literature on retirement plans suggests that they are important elements of compensation that plan sponsors use in meeting their human resource goals. But public retirement plans are created and operated in a public policy environment and forces other than local labor market considerations may be brought to bear in the organization and operation of these plans. This paper explores some of the possible explanations for the variation in state retirement plans. Public disclosure data is used to develop a model that explains relative generosity of benefits based on the characteristics of participants and the marketplaces in which the plans are offered. The final section of the paper places the issues explored in a forward looking context. The public disclosure environment recently put in place for public retirement plans is likely to have a more profound effect on state pension operations than any other development in recent history.,,,,Syl.Schieber@gmail.com,,,,,,,34,10,13,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

The incidence of organized crime is measured by the number of complaints regarding criminal offences of different kinds traditionally related to the mafia organizations. The results show how the correlation between organized crime and FDI is both negative and significant, even when an indicator of financial incentives for investment is included in the regressions. Our analysis shows that crime represents a deterrent for foreign investors, suggesting that high levels of (certain) crimes may be perceived as a signal of a local socio-institutional environment unfavourable for FDI.

Two theoretical positions oppose : on the one hand, the random urban growth theories consider that city-growth is independent from city-size, which follows Gibrat's law; on the other hand, determinist growth theories admit that urban growth depends upon city-size.

The method is based on a robust estimation of parametric GARCH models and a robustified resampling scheme for GARCH residuals that controls bootstrap instability due to outlying observations. A Monte Carlo simulation shows that our robust method provides more accurate Value at Risk (VaR) forecasts than classical methods, often by a large extent, especially for several days ahead horizons and/or in presence of outlying observations. An empirical application confirms the simulation results. The robust procedure outperforms in backtesting several other VaR prediction methods, such as RiskMetrics, CAViaR, historical simulation, and classical filtered historical simulation methods. We show empirically that robust estimation reduces tail estimation risk, providing more accurate and more stable VaR prediction intervals over time.","[Trojani, Fabio] Univ Lugano, Lugano, Switzerland",Universita della Svizzera Italiana,"Mancini, L (通讯作者)，Swiss Finance Inst EPFL, Quartier UNIL Dorigny, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",loriano.mancini@epfl.ch,,,,,,,51,26,28,1,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

This paper advances two principal arguments: firstly, that the planning system and maximum parking standards as part of it are the main factors leading to travel plan development in England today; and, secondly, that the difficulties of using the planning system in this way means that there is a risk that many of these travel plans are unlikely to have a great deal of influence on travel patterns, making it more unlikely that they will achieve the predicted impact on travel behaviour change, as contained in the important study and report Smarter Choices (Department for Transport, 2004). This paper presents results from a survey of planning and transport authorities in England, which obtained a 62% response rate from the 139 authorities contacted. It also uses the results of 18 interviews with local authority and Highways Agency staff involved in securing travel plans through the planning process. The survey found that the planning process (as opposed to voluntary efforts) is indeed the main means by which travel plans are now secured. In addition, maximum parking standards were shown to have a major influence on travel plan formation for organisations going through the planning process. There are however reasons to doubt that all of the travel plans secured through the planning process are effective. This is because: Many local authorities use only planning conditions and not the more flexible (but complex) obligations which would allow more complex travel plans to be secured. There is a lack of monitoring of travel plans in many authorities. There is evidence that in many authority areas there are travel plans in breach of legal agreements, but these breaches are not enforced, reportedly due to a lack of monitoring, resources, and other organisational issues. The paper discusses the reasons for these findings and also makes a number of suggestions as to how the planning system could be improved as a means of securing travel plans. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The stochastic frontier approach is employed to measure the productivity growth of Chinese provinces. Human capital is measured both qualitatively and quantitatively. In particular, enrolment rates at various levels of schooling are used to represent human capital composition. After controlling for endogeneity, we find that human capital has significant and positive effects on the TFP growth of Chinese provinces. However, when education quality is incorporated, productivity growth appears to be significantly enhanced by quality improvements in primary education only. Regional impacts of human capital are found to differ at various levels of schooling. In the eastern region of China, productivity growth is significantly associated with secondary education. TFP growth in the central region is mainly promoted by primary and university education. Yet in the western region, primary education plays the most prominent role.","[Wei, Zheng] Univ Nottingham Ningbo China, Nottingham Univ Business Sch, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Hao, Rui] Shenzhen Univ, IAS, Shenzhen, Peoples R China",University of Nottingham Ningbo China; Shenzhen University,"Wei, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham Ningbo China, Nottingham Univ Business Sch, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,63,31,37,6,57,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

We interpret this deviation as a liquidity effect and develop a new liquidity measure quantifying the price dispersion in the context of the US corporate bond market. This market offers a unique opportunity to study liquidity effects since, from October 2004 onwards, all OTC transactions in this market have to be reported to a common database known as the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE). Furthermore, market-wide average price quotes are available from Markit Group Limited, a financial information provider. Thus, it is possible, for the first time, to directly observe deviations between transaction prices and the expected market valuation of securities. We quantify and analyze our new liquidity measure for this market and find significant price dispersion effects that cannot be simply captured by bid-ask spreads. We show that our new measure is indeed related to liquidity by regressing it on commonly-used liquidity proxies and find a strong relation between our proposed liquidity measure and bond characteristics, as well as trading activity variables. Furthermore, we evaluate the reliability of end-of-day marks that traders use to value their positions. Our evidence suggests that the price deviations from expected market valuations are significantly larger and more volatile than previously assumed. Overall, the results presented here improve our understanding of the drivers of liquidity and are important for many applications in OTC markets, in general. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The idea of the clash of civilizations put forward by Samuel Huntington and applied to Islam by Bernard Lewis and others points to unique aspects of the Islamic religion and culture that make the advent of democracy especially difficult. In this paper, I show that there is a systematic misconception about the true nature of the relationship between Islam and politics: far from being fused into the religious realm, politics tends to dominate religion. Because of some characteristics, namely the lack of a centralized religious authority structure and the great variability of interpretations of the Islamic law, there is a risk of an obscurantist deadlock in the form of a vicious process whereby both the ruler and his political opponents try to outbid each other by using the religious idiom. This risk looms particularly large in crisis situations accentuated by international factors such as witnessed during the second half of the 20th century. From a short comparative analysis, it is however hard to conclude that unique aspects of the Islamic faith are ultimately responsible for the persistent autocratic feature of Muslim polities.

Whether we talk about non-profit organizations engaged in health or environmental programs or private companies willing to act responsibly, their goal is a common one: to help improve people's lives by promoting responsible behaviour in society. This paper aims to extend the area of research for cause-related marketing by highlighting the importance of partnerships between non-profit organizations and companies based on social responsibility. As a result, the article proposes and analyzes four features of social partnership: motivation, promotion, efficiency and law effect. The study examines the Romanian consumers' opinions regarding the need of collaboration between corporations and non-profit organizations for achieving common social goals. Using the structural equation model, the paper describes the relations between each of the variables considered and social partnership and measures the extent to which these variables can influence the collaboration between organizations. The article tests and then proposes a model of the considered variables. The results obtained describe the characteristics of social partnership marketing programs and their importance for the consumer.","Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Serban, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",serban.corina@gmail.com,,,,,,,20,11,11,2,42,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2011,13.0,29,,,,,104,116,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,710QA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000286525100008,0

A large fraction of revenues were transferred to the subnational governments in the mining areas. Additionally, the government encouraged mining companies to assume a more active role locally. The results have been disappointing. Statistical and fieldwork evidence shows that these policies have exacerbated local political conflicts.

The final results of the research are recommendations for public administration to organize agro-climatic zoning and to achieve better investment of national and EU funds in agriculture development.","[Kazandjiev, Valentin; Georgieva, Veska] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Natl Inst Meteorol & Hydrol, Tsarigradsko Shausse 66, BU-1784 Sofia, Bulgaria; [Dimitrov, Peter; Moteva, Milena] Inst Land Reclamat & Agr Mech, Sofia 1331, Bulgaria; [Vegh, Krisztina] Hungarian Acad Sci, Res Inst Soil Sci & Agr Chem, H-1022 Budapest, Hungary",Bulgarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Agricultural Research,"Kazandjiev, V (通讯作者)，Bulgarian Acad Sci, Natl Inst Meteorol & Hydrol, Tsarigradsko Shausse 66, BU-1784 Sofia, Bulgaria.",valentin.kazandjiev@meteo.bg; dimitrov_pn@yahoo.com; krvegh@rissac.hu,"Kazandjiev, Valentin S./ABA-7001-2020","Kazandjiev, Valentin S./0000-0002-8133-6782",Bulgarian National Science Fund,Bulgarian National Science Fund(National Science Fund of Bulgaria),"The authors express their high appreciation to the Bulgarian National Science Fund for its financial support of the Project: Present and Future State of the Climate Change, Mitigation of their Effect and Development of Sustainable Agriculture.",,12,1,1,1,13,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-2196-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,299,307,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000338036100032,0

This multi-level ANN is designed properly. This paper indeed proposed a multi-level network by which the inputs to the ending level are obtained as outputs of the starting levels. Actual data of Iran from 1967-2007 is used to train the multi-level ANN and illustrate capability of the approach in this regard.

Our unique data set covers virtually all Indonesian villages and urban neighbourhoods; it allows us to distinguish between demand and supply side determinants of child labour. We show by correcting for sample selection that a number of counterintuitive results - child labour being unaffected by credit access and school proximity - are the result of an interplay between supply and demand side determinants. Credit access and school proximity reduce child labour supply, but simultaneously constitute positive location factors for firms thereby increasing the demand for child labourers. To effectively reduce child labour, growth oriented policies, such as enhancing school and credit facilities, should be complemented by policies specifically geared towards increasing school attendance.","[Kis-Katos, Krisztina; Schulze, Guenther G.] Univ Freiburg, Dept Int Econ, Inst Econ Res, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Kis-Katos, K (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Dept Int Econ, Inst Econ Res, Pl Alten Synagoge, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany.",krisztina.kis-katos@vwl.uni-freiburg.de,"Kis-Katos, Krisztina/ABC-3624-2021","Kis-Katos, Krisztina/0000-0003-2459-1274",,,,,47,4,7,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

More often, however, they are presented negatively, as an exception, which complicates the tax system and causes distortions. This article aims to identify and quantify the tax reliefs (tax expenditures) of the three major taxes in the Czech Republic in 2008: personal income tax, corporation tax and value added tax. Unlike in many other OECD member countries, in the Czech Republic, tax expenditures have not been quantified and published yet; this contributions is therefore a first attempt to quantify them.

Using primary data from a detailed household survey of nearly 3,000 borrower and non-borrower households, a difference in difference approach is used to test for the impact of access to loans. Once the results are disaggregated between rural and urban areas there is a positive impact in rural areas on food expenditure and on some social indicators such as the health of children and female empowerment. These impacts are observed even in very poor households.

They decide on big investment plans for the coming year as well as on many less important items like purchase price of pork and corn or service workshops and transport. The decision-making process nevertheless remains the same: they use statistical voting system to accept (or refuse) individual items. In standard situation of limited financial resources they have to create preference lists of individual items. This paper deals with mathematical properties of such preference lists and their comparison to statistical voting. If a board is to decide between two alternatives a and b, usually the majority rule procedure is applied and the alternative with the most votes is declared a winner. From mathematical point of view the majority rule properties were formulated by May (1952), who showed that if the number of board members is odd and each election procedure produces a unique winning item then the majority rule is the only so called social choice procedure for two alternatives that satisfies the following three conditions: it treats all the board members the same, it treats both alternatives the same and it is monotone. Nevertheless, if there are more than two possible choices, the situation is completely different. The inner structure of the problem is very rich and needs more detailed research. The situation is demonstrated on voting for investment items of the agricultural marketing cooperative Mrakov in South Bohemia.","[Nesetrilova, Helena; Rimovska, Pavla] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Nesetrilová, H (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",nesetrilova@pef.czu.cz; rimovska@pef.czu.cz,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-2196-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,397,402,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000338036100042,0

The partial objective of the paper was to examine the possibilities of data preparation such as restructuralization, logarithmic transformation, and dimensionality reduction. The main goal of the paper was to find meaningful patterns in the analyzed data and identify clusters of customers with similar behavior and needs. The segmentation was realized by various data mining techniques as follows: K-means clustering, Two Step clustering, and unsupervized algorithm based on neural networks called Self-Organizing Maps.

Traditionally, paddy farmers have been mired in poverty and their livelihood largely relied on on-farm and off-farm incomes. However the industrialization revolution has encouraged the manufacturing sector to set up factories in the rural paddy granary areas especially on the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Thus these farmers have the opportunity to become employed as part-time factory workers. Since most of the development has been concentrated on the West Coast, the East Coast has been left behind from industrial development. Hence the opportunity for East Coast farmers to seek part-time jobs to earn an off-farm income as a factory worker is not readily available. Therefore it is imperative to investigate the impact of off-farm income disparity between paddy farmers on the West Coast and East Coast with regards to their household livelihood and the situation of the rural economy. The study focuses on the actual income distribution, structure and differences between on farm and off-farm incomes at the household level. A structured questionnaire was designed to capture the information needed and surveys were conducted among five rice granary areas on the West and East Coasts. The results show that the average farm household income was RM1,824 in Kelantan, followed by RM2,947 in Kedah, RM2,969 in Terengganu, RM4,792 in Penang and RM4,895 in Selangor. Income inequality in Kelantan was the highest at 0.49 as measured by the Gini Coefficient. Out of the five granary areas, Kelantan's farmers have suffered from having the least amount of opportunities for generating on-farm and off-farm income which has led to a widening of income inequality amongst these fanners.","[Terano, Rika; Mohamed, Zainalabidin] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Agr, Dept Agribusiness & Informat Syst, Upm Serdang Selangor 43400, Malaysia",Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Terano, R (通讯作者)，Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Agr, Dept Agribusiness & Informat Syst, Upm Serdang Selangor 43400, Malaysia.",,,,"Asian Public Intellectual Program, the Nippon Foundation","Asian Public Intellectual Program, the Nippon Foundation","This study was financially supported by the Asian Public Intellectual Program, the Nippon Foundation (July, 2010-July, 2011).

Within the frame of ensuring communication channel integrity and confidentiality, existing technical means offer a high level of quality for the basic protection of these two critical information characteristics. It appears, however, that in connection with business processes, technical means (application software) are not always able to sufficiently cover more complex communication flows and workflows. The article focuses on the matters of ensuring integrity and confidentiality of e-mail communication within business processes requiring non-trivial communication models of the user-group type and substitutability within the group. The implementation of these communication models is a means of enhancing the quality of processes in organizations while maintaining the current level of security. The article is a case study dealing with a solution targeted at the support of group and public folder communication in the Microsoft Exchange, Outlook and Active Directory environment with the application of the public key infrastructure that is naturally supported by this environment in the basic user-user mode. The first part of the article deals with theoretical approaches to information integrity and confidentiality in the area of e-mail communication and the enhancement of security of business processes while the second part concentrates on discussing the outcomes of the case study and the proposed solution. The article has been prepared on the basis of the analysis of secondary sources and standards, synthesis of knowledge and evaluation of findings. One of the conclusions of the article is that for current processes of e mail communication the solution may be implemented on the basis of the existing technical standards and transparently while preserving openness to common e-mail systems.

This simple metric delivers powerful economic results. Incumbents that have a high overlap with entrants subsequently engage in price competition by reducing management fees. Distribution fees, however, rise so that investors do not benefit as much from price competition. Funds with high overlap also experience quantity competition through lower investor flows, have lower alphas, and higher attrition rates. These effects only appear after the late 1990s, at which point there appears to be an endogenous structural shift in the competitive environment.

Findings show that there is a critical point where the value of historic properties is affected by actual age and the depreciation schedule turns upward. Effective age is used to develop a variant of Tobin's Q, which provides evidence that inter-district price differentials often attributed to historic designation are at least partially a function of investment differentials between districts.","[Winson-Geideman, Kimberly] Univ N Texas, Denton, TX 76203 USA; [Jourdan, Dawn] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Gao, Shan] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77845 USA",University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Winson-Geideman, K (通讯作者)，Univ N Texas, Denton, TX 76203 USA.",geideman@unt.edu; dawnjourdan@ufl.edu; gaoshan@neo.tamu.edu,,"Jourdan, Dawn/0000-0003-1738-6301",,,,,36,7,10,0,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0896-5803,2691-1175,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

This shows that more and more women have gone through higher education and a significant number of them are now holding high posts both in the private and the public sectors. Consequently, the previously 'denied' right of women to higher education because of gender is now a history in this country. This paper attempts to analyze an involvement of women in higher education in Malaysia with particular reference to graduate study in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. The study shows an increasing interest and access to programs related to sciences and technical field by women as opposed to the art and education which was previously associated with women. This trend signals positive development of women involvement in higher education in preparing knowledgeable human resources to the nation and thus provides a strong support to the women empowering strategy in Malaysia.","[Yusof, Aminah Md; Alias, Rose Alinda] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Sch Grad Studies, Utm Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Habil, Hadina] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Language Acad, Skudai, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Yusof, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol Malaysia, Sch Grad Studies, Utm Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia.",aminahyusof@utm.my; rosealinda@utm.my; hadina@utm.my,"HABIL, HADINA/A-6710-2018",,,,,,12,0,0,1,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-6-9,,,,2011,,,,,,,724,+,,,,,,2,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEO28,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000317550000067,0

In this paper an algorithm is developed which improves the performance of the ERP system. Lot sizing decisions based on capacity availability are used as an instrument to integrate more effectively capacity requirements planning (CRP) and Material Requirements Planning (MRP). MRP is a planning tool for a sub-set of manufacturing system specially in hierarchal multi-product, multi-period and multi-stage production planning and inventory control system. The Vehicle used for this integration is planned order release (POR) quantity. The algorithm requires minimal deviation from the MRP logic. In this sequential process MRP first issues the action notices and then the algorithm analyses the capacity situation in the work centers.The algorithm scans all planned order release quantities of lower level items in the action bucket before orders are released to the shop. For each item a delta value is computed identifying the degree orders are contributing to capacity problems. This delta is specific to each POR. The POR causing the highest overload and the one passing through the lowest utilized work centers are selected for a lot size decrease, respectively, an increase. After identifying the candidates, a series of checks analyses the suitability of the candidates for that change. The planned order release quantities of more items can be performed. After each iteration the projected capacity profile is updated and capacity requirements over a short duration are smoothed.The experiments are performed with MAP/3000 as a simulation model for this study. The developed algorithm is added to MAP/3000 as additional subroutines. The design of the experiments consists of a base test identifying the significance of different environmental parameters of MRP systems and a main test which performs a detailed evaluation. The results are evaluated using analysis of variance techniques.Most ERP systems built on the historical development of MRP and CRP systems, and the assumption of infinite capacity is affecting the performance of those systems badly. This paper is presenting an algorithm to smooth capacity problems by using the existed capacity.","Univ Jordan, Amman, Jordan",University of Jordan,,mzamzeer@ju.edujo,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-6-9,,,,2011,,,,,,,24,37,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEO28,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000317550000004,0

Using a measure of firm value in the stock market and panel regression methods, this article finds the initially superior and eventually worsening performance of group-affiliated firms compared with stand-alone firms. To explain the downward performance, this article considers several alternative hypotheses, namely, institutional development, increasing competition, diversification discount, agency costs from state-ownership, and agents asset diversion behavior. This article has found certain differences in the explanatory power of each hypothesis. While the institutional development hypothesis is somewhat weak, the increasing discount for unrelated diversification as well as serious agency costs revealed in asset diversion in the business groups can better explain the longitudinal decrease in the performance of business groups. We find that while diversification still creates values, its marginal contribution has decreased over time, and that while the state-ownership variable negatively affects the values of firms in general, it is not the cause of the worsening valuation of business groups.","[Seo, Bong-Kyo] Dongduk Womens Univ, Dept Chinese Studies, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Keun] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Wang, Xiaozu] Fudan Univ, Sch Management, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Dongduk Women's University; Seoul National University (SNU); Fudan University,"Seo, BK (通讯作者)，Dongduk Womens Univ, Dept Chinese Studies, Wolgok Dong 23-1, Seoul, South Korea.",sbongk@hanmail.net; Kenneth@snu.ac.kr; wangxz@fudan.edu.cn,"dirlik, serkan/B-8172-2012; Lee, Keun/AAU-8046-2020","Lee, Keun/0000-0002-0403-6348",,,,,55,13,14,0,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Controlling for inertia, unobserved heterogeneity and the endogeneity of some performance determinants, we find that the (negative) impact of bank debt on firms' performance is weaker for firms running in more competitive banking markets. We interpret this result as evidence that a more intense banking competition may lead to better credit conditions for small and medium-sized firms.","[Agostino, Mariarosaria; Trivieri, Francesco] Univ Calabria, I-87036 Cosenza, Italy",University of Calabria,"Trivieri, F (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, I-87036 Cosenza, Italy.",francesco.trivieri@unical.it,"Trivieri, Francesco/H-3818-2019",,,,,,81,16,17,1,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Our results support evidence of linear and non-linear (ESTR) stationary behaviour around a time-varying equilibrium, particularly when using a trade based price index. The latter results are largely robust across a break due to the Plaza Accord. Forecasts of both the equilibrium deviations and exchange rates themselves are largely supportive of the ESTR model over several alternatives. This is notably so across most measures with respect to the equilibrium deviations and over the sign based measures for the exchange rate forecasts. Overall, our results suggest that shortrun changes in exchange rates are forecastable when allowing for a time-varying equilibrium rate and using an appropriate price index. Such a result has important implications for researchers, policy-makers and goods and financial market participants. For example, policy-makers need to be cognisant of a changing equilibrium level and not necessarily conduct policy in such a manner as to restore a previous equilibrium. Similarly, those engaged in hedging need to be aware that equilibrium rates are time varying but, beneficially, movements around equilibrium appear predictable. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we show that these anomalous patterns are the result of model misspecification as opposed to market misreaction. We provide evidence that these patterns are consistent with, in both direction and magnitude, inherent biases in the misspecified models.

In contrast to the previous literature without politician policy preferences, more restrictive binding caps always reduce expected aggregate contributions. However the initial imposition of a cap increases contributions if the politician mildly favors the low-valuation lobbyist's policy. The introduction of policy preferences permits analysis of monied interests' policy influence. A more restrictive cap makes it more likely that the politician enacts the policy he would have enacted in the absence of lobbying, even in cases where expected aggregate contributions increase.","[Pastine, Tuvana] Natl Univ Ireland Maynooth, Dept Econ Finance & Accounting, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland; [Pastine, Ivan] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Econ, Dublin 4, Ireland",Maynooth University; University College Dublin,"Pastine, T (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland Maynooth, Dept Econ Finance & Accounting, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland.",Tuvana.Pastine@nuim.ie,"Yoon, DongJoon/E-9146-2014",,,,,,52,8,10,1,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,OCT,2010,145.0,1-2,,,,,81,101,,10.1007/s11127-009-9555-3,0.0,,,21,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,639YS,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000281013700005,0

The subsidy program is expensive for this reason. Lump-sum payments correct the moral hazard problem and are better at transferring income to sellers.

The concept of game forms is used to model procedures as a structure of individuals' interactions. Sets of outcomes for an individual are represented by the individual's own perceptions of the social states that are generated by the interaction of all individuals. I condense the information given by a game form and by the perceptions of outcomes to two sets for each individual, first the set of perceived outcomes the individual can actively determine and secondly the set of perceived outcomes the individual can actively exclude from happening. Techniques that are known from the literature on ranking opportunity sets in terms of freedom of choice are applied to the pairs of determination and exclusion sets. I propose different rankings of game forms in terms of procedural freedom, some of which I characterize axiomatically. The model and the rankings are illustrated by classical examples from Game Theory and Social Choice Theory. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Using the proposed model, we conduct an empirical study on a dataset comprising of default events during the period from 1996 to 2006. In this study, those firms experienced bankruptcy/liquidation events as defined by the Compustat database are classified as defaulted firms, whereas all other firms listed in the Fortune 500 with over a B-rating during the same time period are identified as survived firms. The empirical findings of this study are consistent with the following notions. The distance-to-default (DD) variable derived from the market-based model is statistically significant in explaining the observed default events, particularly of those firms with relatively poor credit quality (i.e., high credit risk). Conversely, the z-score obtained with the accounting-ratio-based approach is statistically significant in predicting bankruptcies of firms of relatively good credit quality (i.e., low credit risk). In-sample and out-of-sample bankruptcy prediction tests demonstrated the superior performance of utilizing dynamic loadings rather than constant loadings derived by the conventional logit model.

We first extend Dixit-Pindyck's real options model to show that while an increase in exchange rate volatility tends to delay FDI of a market-seeking firm, it might accelerate FDI of an export-substituting firm if the firm's degree of risk aversion is high enough. The rationale behind this finding is that a market-seeking FDI might increase the exposure of the firm's profits to exchange rate risk, while an export-substituting FDI might reduce it. Empirical evidence from a survival analysis based on firm-level data on the entry by Taiwanese firms into China over the period between 1987 and 2002 is consistent with the theory. These results reveal that the relationship between exchange rate uncertainty and FDI is crucially dependent on the motives of the investing firms.","[Chen, Kun-Ming; Rau, Hsiu-Hua] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Int Business, Taipei 116, Taiwan; [Lin, Chia-Ching] Nanhua Univ, Dept Managerial Econ, Chiayi 622, Taiwan",National Chengchi University; Nanhua University,"Rau, HH (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Int Business, Taipei 116, Taiwan.",cclin77@mail.nhu.edu.tw; kchen@nccu.edu.tw; shrau@nccu.edu.tw,"N, A/JUF-6197-2023",,,,,,27,13,15,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The decision dimensions are in the number of candidates standing for election, the experiential base of the candidates standing for election as measured by the length of prior experience held by the candidates, and the proportion of candidates with such prior experience. We find that while there are benefits that accrue to having a larger choice, the optimal number of candidates is strictly finite. Second, to justify an increase in the optimal length of prior experience requires strong increases in the ratio of benefits that accrue from additional experience to the cost of abuse of privilege. The conditions under which an increase in the length of prior experience can be justified are where the cost associated with abuse of privilege is negligible. This would require the development of appropriate formal (legal and constitutional) and informal (civil society) institutions that ensure that abuse of office remains negligible. Finally, we allow the number of electoral candidates, the length of their prior experience, as well as the proportion of candidates with experience to vary. Under this choice problem optimal pairings of length of experience and the proportion of candidates with prior experience may not exist. Hence, societies may be condemned to suboptimality even should the political system prove to be amenable to change, rendering disaffection endemic to the political system.","[Fedderke, Johannes] ERSA, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Fedderke, Johannes] Univ Cape Town, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Fedderke, J (通讯作者)，ERSA, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",johannes.fedderke@uct.ac.za,"Fedderke, Johannes/N-1411-2019","Fedderke, Johannes/0000-0003-4482-5939",,,,,45,1,1,0,8,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN STREET, MALDEN, MA 02148-529 USA",0954-1985,,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

This paper investigates the effect of the loss of a spouse on housing and location choices. A partner's death induces a decrease in income which may lead to downsizing. Widowhood may also reveal new preferences, such as the need to be close to care givers and health services. We estimate the effect of a transition to widowhood on housing consumption and location choices using the French Housing Surveys. Widowhood significantly increases residential mobility, especially at older ages and for those who have children. Mobile widows tend to live closer to their relatives but do not move to co-reside with a child. Housing and location adjustments are consistent with new widows moving to dwellings that are smaller, more often apartments and in the rental sector, and on average located in larger municipalities where services are more accessible. The housing demand of widows will be significant in the next 20 years, especially the demand for small dwellings. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The authors extend the field of application to the case of a tire distribution company that orders multiple similar items, the amount of the total order representing a full truckload, from a single distribution point. The results of the model allows establishing the moment of order launching and the volume of the order for each item on the basis of balancing the real service level with the service objective, offering thus to the company a favourable competitive position.","[Firica, Oana] Inst Business Adm Bucharest ASEBUSS, Bucharest, Romania; [Deaconu, Alecxandrina; Lefter, Viorel] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Firica, O (通讯作者)，Inst Business Adm Bucharest ASEBUSS, Bucharest, Romania.",oanaf@asebuss.ro,"Deaconu, Alecxandrina/IQS-0068-2023",,,,,,8,0,0,0,10,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2010,12.0,28,,,,,675,686,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,617XA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279314000029,0

This approach attempts to eliminate the potential correlation present in previous analyses between unobserved individual characteristics leading to homeownership and traits leading to provision of social capital or local amenities. Consistent with previous work, we show that homeownership positively affects political engagement in simple probits. Instrumental variable probits, however, show no impact of homeownership on political involvement. IV results for other social outcomes are less conclusive. The analysis suggests that with the use of an exogenous instrument, it is possible to generate results that are different from the previous literature. Our results also suggest that being eligible to open an IDA did not spur households to provide more social capital or local amenities. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Under the risk-neutral measure, the distribution of the state vector X(t) resides within a family of discrete-time affine processes that nests the exact discrete-time counterparts of the entire class of continuous-time models in Duffie and Kan (1996) and Dai and Singleton (2000). Under the historical distribution, our approach accommodates nonlinear (nonaffine) processes while leading to closed-form expressions for the conditional likelihood functions for zero-coupon bond yields. As motivation for our framework, we show that it encompasses many of the equilibrium models with habit-based preferences or recursive preferences and long-run risks. We illustrate our methods by constructing maximum likelihood estimates of a nonlinear discrete-time DTSM with habit-based preferences in which bond prices are known in closed form. We conclude that habit-based models, as typically parameterized in the literature, do not match key features of the conditional distribution of bond yields.","[Le, Anh] Univ N Carolina, Dept Finance, Kenan Flagler Business Sch, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Singleton, Kenneth J.] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Stanford University,"Le, A (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Finance, Kenan Flagler Business Sch, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA.",,,,,,,,61,53,62,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

In this paper, we evaluate the effect on harvesting decisions of the spatial attributes of communal forests in Galicia. We first model the forest landscape management problem within a bioeconomic framework, which allows the identification of optimal clear-cutting strategies. This framework makes it possible to model a Faustmann-type rotation at the landscape level. The empirical analysis uses data from communal forests in Galicia, Spain. Under communal ownership, members of a rural community have rights to forest resources, but not rights to the forest itself. The management of communal forests integrates multiple forest uses within the decision making process. Given the communal nature of forest rights, and given these multiple uses, we show that landscape patterns-fragmentation, diversity and clumpiness-determine rotation periods.","[Touza, Julia] Univ Vigo, Dept Appl Econ, Vigo 36310, Spain; [Perrings, Charles] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, EcoSERV Grp, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Chas Amil, Maria Luisa] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Quantitat Econ, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain",Universidade de Vigo; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Universidade de Santiago de Compostela,"Touza, J (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Dept Appl Econ, Campus Lagoas Marcosende, Vigo 36310, Spain.",julia.touza@uvigo.es,"Chas-Amil, María-Luisa/T-6565-2019; Chas-Amil, Maria-Luisa/N-9316-2018","Chas-Amil, Maria-Luisa/0000-0001-7605-0424; Touza Montero, Julia/0000-0001-8170-1789",,,,,60,4,4,1,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Using several multivariate techniques, we detect different patterns of digitalization. The patterns are explained to differing degrees by the type of country, by differences in economic development, and by socio-demographic and institutional variables. Factors such as quality of regulation and infrastructure explain ICT adoption in high-income countries. The ICT combination associated with specific income groups as well as the explanatory variables detected for each of them might be useful to implement the most appropriate policy actions to reduce the digital divide.","[Lera-Lopez, Fernando] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Pamplona 31006, Spain; [Billon, Margarita] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Dept Econ Dev, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Marco, Rocio] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Dept Appl Econ, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",Universidad Publica de Navarra; Autonomous University of Madrid; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Lera-Lopez, F (通讯作者)，Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Campus Arrosadia S-N, Pamplona 31006, Spain.",lera@unavarra.es,"MARCO CRESPO, ROCIO/CAG-4979-2022; MARCO CRESPO, ROCIO/CAH-0724-2022; MARCO CRESPO, ROCIO/L-3511-2013; Lera-Lopez, Fernando/J-4450-2016; Billon, Margarita/L-2498-2013","MARCO CRESPO, ROCIO/0000-0002-2854-9121; MARCO CRESPO, ROCIO/0000-0002-2854-9121; MARCO CRESPO, ROCIO/0000-0002-2854-9121; Lera-Lopez, Fernando/0000-0002-9230-9405; Billon, Margarita/0000-0003-4860-9133",,,,,41,57,62,7,86,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

We also assess whether households are able to smooth consumption, and we analyze the strategies they are compelled to adopt in order to cope. Our results indicate that victims of civil conflict face difficulties in generating income, are unable to rely on usual risk-sharing mechanisms, and are forced to draw upon costly coping strategies in order to smooth consumption. The vulnerability of displaced households, and the possibility of falling into poverty traps, highlight the need to design and implement specific policies for victims of internal conflict in order to cope with the displacement shock.

Our paired-site sampling survey reveals that credit uptake decreased school attendance by young girl children. This finding raises concerns that young girl children are exploited as child labor, either at home or in the field, when working adults become more involved in income-generating activities financed by credit. The data, however, do not show clear evidence for young girls staying at home to do household chores or working in the fields in households that obtained credit, but instead find simultaneous occurrence between attending school and taking responsibilities for domestic chores by young children. It would appear, therefore, that credit uptake delays the realization of this concurrence among young girl children and leads to delayed school enrollment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a panel of state-level banking information over 1993-2002, this paper shows that the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 reduced the number of small banks, but not the amount of small business lending. We also show that small banks are participating less in small business lending. These results imply that the bank-lending channel of the monetary transmission mechanism became less important in the US in the late 1990s as a result of more firms borrowing from large banks that are less sensitive to monetary shocks.","[Vera, David] Kent State Univ, Dept Econ, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Onji, Kazuki] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Salem; Kent State University Kent; Australian National University,"Vera, D (通讯作者)，Kent State Univ, Dept Econ, POB 5190, Kent, OH 44242 USA.",dvera@kent.edu,"Onji, Kazuki/CAF-5594-2022","Onji, Kazuki/0000-0002-0717-2951",,,,,30,20,27,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This is demonstrated formally in the context of a simple neoclassical model, which delivers fiscal multipliers consistent with the wartime evidence.

This paper studies a simple nonlinear model of monetary policy where agents have incomplete information about the economic environment. It shows that agents' learning and the dynamics of the economy are heavily affected by central bank's transparency about its policy rule. A monetary authority that does not communicate its rule can induce learning equilibria where the economy experiences prolonged periods of deflation and slow growth. More generally, small expectational errors can result in complex economic dynamics, inducing welfare-reducing fluctuations. On the contrary, central bank communication helps stabilizing expectations around the inflation target equilibrium.","Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York,"Eusepi, S (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY USA.",stefano.eusepi@ny.frb.org,,,,,,,24,15,15,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

The article then discusses (1) the potential effects of the mandate that individuals have health insurance in conjunction with proposed premium subsidies and health insurance underwriting and rating restrictions, (2) the proposed creation of a public health insurance plan and/or nonprofit cooperatives, and (3) provisions that would modify permissible grounds for health policy rescission and repeal the limited antitrust exemption for health and medical liability insurance.

Both sets of policies reduce national and global economic welfare and inhibit agricultural trade and economic growth. They almost certainly add to inequality and poverty in developing countries, since three-quarters of the world's billion poorest people depend on farming for their livelihood. During the past two decades, however, numerous developing country governments have reduced their sectoral and trade policy distortions, while some high-income countries also have begun reducing market-distorting aspects of their farm policies. The author surveys the changing extent of policy distortions to prices faced by developing-country farmers over the past half century, and provides a summary of new empirical estimates from a global economy-wide model that yield estimates of how much could be gained by removing the interventions remaining as of 2004.

We employ the de facto classification of Reinhart and Rogoff (2004) that allows us to estimate the impact of relatively long-lived exchange rate regimes on currency crises with much greater precision. We find no evidence that, as the bipolar view argues, intermediate regimes have a significantly higher probability of currency crises than both hard pegs and free floats. Using the combined data of exchange rate regimes and the existence of capital controls, we also find that hard pegs with capital account liberalization have a significantly lower probability of currency crises than intermediate regimes with capital controls and free floats with capital controls. Hence, the bipolar view does not strictly hold in the sense that intermediate regimes are significantly more prone to currency crises than the two extreme regimes. However, the fact that hard pegs with capital account liberalization are substantially less prone to currency crises is worthy of note. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Due to its labor-intensive Green Revolution and strong farm-nonfarm linkages, Asia's development path is mostly characterized by fast growth with relatively slow agricultural exits. In contrast to Asia, urban biased policies, low rural population density, and high rates of population growth have led a number of African countries down a path of slow economic growth with surprisingly rapid agricultural exits. Despite this divergence both continents now face daunting employment problems. Asia appears to be increasingly vulnerable to rising inequality, slower job creation, and shrinking farm sizes, suggesting that Asian governments need to refocus on integrating smallholders and lagging regions into increasingly commercialized rural and urban economies. Africa, in contrast, has yet to achieve its own Green Revolution, which would still be a highly effective tool for job creation and poverty reduction. However, the diversity of its endowments and its tighter budget constraints mean that agricultural development strategies in Africa need to be highly context specific, financially sustainable, and more evidence-based.","[Bezemer, Dirk] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,,d.Headey@cgiar.org,,,,,,,120,18,21,1,42,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

The model imposes no-arbitrage restrictions across nominal and real yields, which enables interest rates to be decomposed into expected real policy rates, expected inflation, real term premia and inflation risk premia. The model is used to shed light on major developments over the period, including the impact of Bank of England independence and the low real bond yield 'conundrum'. (C) 2009 The Bank of England.

The great majority of the listed firms of China's capital markets operate in diversified industries. This paper investigates the relation between corporate diversification strategy and cash flow sensitivity of cash. Using a sample of Chinese listed firms from the period 2004 to 2008, the empirical results of OLS regressions show that the sensitivity of cash holdings to cash flows is lower for diversified firms.

In aid-dependent SDCs, aid absorption more or less equals spending, although only half of the aid flow is absorbed and spent.

We find evidence of a significant overnight price change that diminishes the returns available to speculators although there are still profits available from the first day after announcement until a few days after the actual event. More importantly, observing the tick-by-tick stock price performance and volume effects on the key days during the event window for the first time, we find evidence of consistent trading patterns during trading hours. A separate analysis of NASDAQ and NYSE listed stocks allows for a detailed examination of the price and volume effect at an intra-day level. We find that index funds appear to cluster their rebalancing activities near to and after the close on the event date, suggesting that they are more concerned with tracking error than profit.

First, more than half of the rise in net borrowing of the U.S. non-financial sectors since the mid-1980s has been financed by foreign lending. Second, the collapse of the U.S. housing and mortgage-backed-securities markets had worldwide effects on financial institutions and asset markets. Using an open-economy model where financial intermediaries play a central role, we show that financial integration leads to a sharp rise in net credit in the most financially developed country and to large asset price spillovers of country-specific shocks to bank capital. The impacts of these shocks on asset prices are amplified by bank capital requirements based on mark-to-market. (C) 2009 Elsevier B,V.

They do it in particular in order to justify public support. However, the definition and validity conditions of the economic-impact rationale are little-known among these players. This article offers a reminder of these definition and conditions by using tools from economic analysis and findings from theoretical and empirical research. Breaking down the economic impact of a cultural activity for a given area into its five constituents enables to show that several constituents potentially may provide three distinct economic arguments which can be put forward to justify public support. Each being based on different assumptions, the first argument pursues a stabilization objective, the second and third ones an allocation objective. The principles of estimating the constituents in question are then reminded, in order to provide the information elements allowing to have an idea of the more or less sound nature of impact results used for justification purposes.","Univ Paris 07, Univ Paris Est Creteil Val de Marne & Charge Cour, UFR Sci Econ & Gest, Lab ERUDITE, F-75221 Paris 05, France",Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Universite Paris Cite,"Nicolas, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 07, Univ Paris Est Creteil Val de Marne & Charge Cour, UFR Sci Econ & Gest, Lab ERUDITE, F-75221 Paris 05, France.",nicolas@univ-paris12.fr,,,,,,,60,2,2,0,12,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Seven different regional indicators are analyzed including wages, household expenditures, retail sales, investments, productivity, GDP, and GDP adjusted for international purchasing power differences. Several aspects of regional dynamics are studied such as convergence, polarization, role of international component, overall mobility, and individual mobility of Czech regions. Different methods are employed including some traditional techniques such as Gini coefficient, Theil decomposition, or kernel density estimates but also more innovative measures based on the pair-wise comparisons of regions. The results suggest strong regional convergence in relative ratios hand in hand with increasing absolute gaps among European regions. The analysis also indicates a significant bipolarity in the investigated distributions and a major role of international component in the process of European regional development. From the Czech regions, only Praha and Stredni Cechy recorded some upward mobility in the European regional rank distributions, while the relative positions of all other units deteriorated.","Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Social Geog & Reg Dev, CZ-12843 Prague 2, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Novotny, J (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Social Geog & Reg Dev, Albertov 6, CZ-12843 Prague 2, Czech Republic.",pepino@natur.cuni.cz,"Novotny, Josef/B-2691-2013; Novotny, Josef/D-8499-2013","Novotny, Josef/0000-0001-9556-7162;",,,,,40,5,5,0,12,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,2336-8225,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

In addition, the effectiveness of interventions is examined using an event-study approach. Our results indicate that the Japanese authorities tended to adopt progressively stronger measures as the exchange rate was found to behave in an increasingly unfavorable way. This suggests that words and deeds were only coordinated (i.e. used in a complementary way) in extreme cases. Overall, interventions are found to be moderately successful in correcting unwanted exchange-rate developments, especially volatility. J. Japanese Int. Economies xxx (xx) (2009) xxx-xxx.

If so, do they use this private information to trade in a direction opposite to this information (a manipulative trading role) or in the same direction (an information production role)? We use a large sample of transaction-level institutional trading data to distinguish between these two roles of institutional investors. We explicitly identify institutional SEO allocations for the first time in the literature. We analyze the consequences of the private information possessed by institutional investors for SEO share allocation, institutional trading before and after the SEO and realized trading profitability, and the SEO discount. We find that institutions are able to identify and obtain more allocations in SEOs with better long-run stock returns, they trade in the same direction as their private information, and their post-SEO trading significantly outperforms a naive buy-and-hold trading strategy. Further, more pre-offer institutional net buying and larger institutional SEO allocations are associated with a smaller SEO discount. Overall, our results are consistent with institutions possessing private information about SEOs and with an information production instead of a manipulative trading role for institutional investors in SEOs.

Forests that allow user group harvesting, perhaps counterintuitively, are also shown to be associated with positive forest conditions. However; conditions in community-managed forests are not statistically different from government- or privately managed forests. This implies that local communities call play all important role in achieving positive forest conditions but that full management responsibilities need not be given to achieve these results.

Even so, tax and transfer programs were more redistributive in 2000 than in the 1980s.

We also show that as the level of competition increases, firms provide a higher level of financing for externally organized projects in the form of corporate venture capital (CVC).

Compared with a regime with two local currencies, a regime with one international Currency allows the issuer of the international Currency to reduce the inflation tax while collecting more seigniorage, and forces the other issuer to raise the rate to compensate for a diminished tax base. However, the Country with a local currency is sometimes constrained by an inflation discipline: the more open a country is, the stronger is the discipline. Strategic selection of equilibrium gives rise to a further inflation discipline: the larger country tries to have its currency circulate abroad, while the smaller country tries to prevent the circulation of Foreign Currency.

Under indirect rule, indigenous people are divided into two groups: a privileged ruling group and an unprivileged ruled group. Our model assumes that the ruled group cannot observe how the resources appropriated from them are divided between the colonial ruler and the ruling group. In this economy, excessive exploitation by the colonial ruler creates distrust among indigenous groups and a negative effect on postcolonial economic and political development.","[Mizuno, Nobuhiro; Okazawa, Ryosuke] Kyoto Univ Yoshida Honmachi, Grad Sch Econ, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan",Kyoto University,"Mizuno, N (通讯作者)，Kyoto Univ Yoshida Honmachi, Grad Sch Econ, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",n.mizuno@e01.mbox.media.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,"Mizuno, Nobuhiro/0000-0002-0547-5801; Okazawa, Ryosuke/0000-0002-2456-2812",,,,,34,12,20,1,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2009,141.0,3-4,,,,,405,419,,10.1007/s11127-009-9461-8,0.0,,,15,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,510KX,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271088500010,0

But empirical evidence is largely lacking. We contribute to closing this gap by drawing on an exceptionally detailed Swiss database that covers different forms of NGO aid and several official aid benchmarks. The Tobit estimations account for both altruistic and selfish aid motivations. Whether or not NGOs provide better targeted aid depends on the source of NGO funding as well as the choice of the official benchmark. In contrast to widespread belief, however, the allocation of self-financed NGO aid reveals striking similarities to the allocation of official Swiss development aid. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Accounting for the Past 50 Years,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ST LOUIS REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY REVOLUTION,"The extreme volatility of stock market values has been the subject of a large body of literature. Previous research focused on the short run because of a widespread belief that in the long run the market reverts to well-established fundamentals. The authors' research suggests this belief should be questioned. First, they show actual dividends cannot account for the secular trends of stock market values. They then consider a more comprehensive measure of capital income, which displays large secular fluctuations that roughly coincide with changes in stock market trends. Under perfect foresight, however, this measure fails to properly account for stock market movements. The authors thus abandon the perfect foresight assumption and instead assume that forecasts of future capital income are performed using a distributed lag equation and information available up to the forecasting period only. They find that standard asset-pricing theory can be reconciled with the secular trends in the stock market. This study, nevertheless, leaves open an important puzzle for asset-pricing theory: The market value of U.S. corporations was much lower than the replacement cost of corporate tangible assets from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s.","[Boldrin, Michele] Washington Univ, Dept Econ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Peralta-Alva, Adrian] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA",Washington University (WUSTL); Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Boldrin, M (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Dept Econ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",,,,,,,,11,1,3,0,9,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

One criticism of these conclusions is that these benchmarks are ill suited to handle the extreme statistical nature of option returns generated by nonlinear payoffs. We propose an alternative way to evaluate the statistical significance of option returns by comparing historical statistics to those generated by option pricing models. The most puzzling finding in the existing literature, the large returns to writing out-of-the-money puts, is not inconsistent (i.e., is statistically insignificant) relative to the Black-Scholes model or the Heston stochastic volatility model due to the extreme sampling uncertainty associated with put returns. This sampling problem can largely be alleviated by analyzing market-neutral portfolios such as straddles or delta-hedged returns. The returns on these portfolios can be explained by jump risk premiums and estimation risk.

In this paper we conduct a series of numerical simulation experiments to investigate the quantitative significance of climate response uncertainty for economic assessments of climate change. First we characterize climate uncertainty by constructing two probability density functions-a Bayesian model-averaged and a Bayesian updated version-based on a combination of uncertainty ranges for climate sensitivity reported in the scientific literature. Next we estimate the willingness to pay of a representative agent for a range of emissions reduction policies using two simplified economic models. Our results illustrate the potential for large risk premiums in benefits estimates as suggested by the recent theoretical work on climate response uncertainty, and they show that the size and even the sign of the risk premium may depend crucially on how the posterior distribution describing the overall climate sensitivity uncertainty is constructed and on the specific shape of the damage function.","[Newbold, Stephen C.] US EPA, Natl Ctr Environm Econ, Washington, DC 20460 USA; [Daigneault, Adam] US EPA, Climate Change Div, Washington, DC 20460 USA; [Daigneault, Adam] Climate Change Div, US EPA, Washington, DC USA",United States Environmental Protection Agency; United States Environmental Protection Agency; United States Environmental Protection Agency,"Newbold, SC (通讯作者)，US EPA, Natl Ctr Environm Econ, EPA W Bldg,Suite 4316T,1301 Constitut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20460 USA.",newbold.steve@epa.gov; daigneault.adam@epa.gov,,"Daigneault, Adam/0000-0002-8287-8727",,,,,57,35,40,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

In particular, when comparing complete and incomplete markets, the ranking of policy rules is entirely reversed, and so are the policy prescriptions regarding the optimal level of exchange rate volatility.","[De Paoli, Bianca] Bank England, London, England",Bank of England,"De Paoli, B (通讯作者)，Bank England, London, England.",bianca.depaoli@bankofengland.co.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [RES-107-28-1001] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,41,42,48,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

The paper compares the payments between the two alternative participating arrangements for multi-employer pension schemes to the PPF, namely last-man-standing and segmented levies. Using an Ohlson (1980) logit model to predict the financial distress risk for HE institutions, we find that financially distressed institutions are smaller, with higher leverage and lower earnings. By comparing the implied financial distress probabilities from the PPF risk-based levy using USS accounts with the simulated probabilities using our logit model, we estimate whether USS levies are fairly priced. Our estimates suggest that in 2006/07 USS member institutions appeared to be paying less than the fair risk-based levy. However, this is because during the initial phase of the PPF the risk-based levies were much lower as a proportion of the total levy than the intended steady-state values. The implication is that if USS had paid the same total levy but where the risk-based component was four fifths of the total, then USS would have been paying substantially more than its fair risk-based levy. In addition, by looking at the distributions of individual university risk-based levies under a segmented PPF arrangement, we find evidence of significant cross-subsidies under the current last-man-standing levy between participating USS institutions.","[Liu, Weixi; Tonks, Ian] Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Xfi Ctr Finance & Investment, Exeter, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Liu, WX (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Xfi Ctr Finance & Investment, Exeter, Devon, England.",W.Liu@ex.ac.uk; I.Tonks@ex.ac.uk,,"Liu, Weixi/0000-0002-9971-5748; Tonks, Ian/0000-0002-4503-5149",,,,,41,1,1,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

This paper proposes a new interpretation of this apparent puzzle based on the demand for insurance against real shocks: the fact that devaluations occur more frequently in adverse states of the world provides a motive for holding dollar assets. This approach implies a complementarity between the optimal monetary policy and the currency denomination of contracts. When a large proportion of liabilities is denominated in a foreign currency, the optimal exchange rate volatility is low, which reinforces the demand for dollar assets. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Traditional reinsurance operates efficiently in managing relatively small, uncorrelated risks and in facilitating efficient information sharing between cedants and reinsurers. However, when the magnitude of potential losses and the correlation of risks increase, the efficiency of the reinsurance model breaks down, and the cost of capital may become uneconomical. At this juncture, securitization has a role to play by passing the risks along to broader capital markets. Securitization also serves as a complement for reinsurance in other ways such as facilitating regulatory arbitrage and collateralizing low-frequency risks.","[Cummins, J.

We report how we addressed some of these anomalies in subsequent waves of CAMS. Other anomalies required conducting some randomised experiments to find what explains the observed patterns. The results highlight the tension between asking about spending using a long time frame, which exacerbates recall bias, versus using a short time frame, which risks relying on an unrepresentative snapshot of a household's spending to proxy the total for the last 12 months. An important complicating factor in deciding which goods should be put into which time frames is that there is substantial heterogeneity in the frequency of spending across households even for the same category of spending.","[Hurd, Michael] RAND Corp, NBER, NETSPAR, MEA Mannheim Res Inst Econ Aging, Santa Monica, CA 90406 USA",RAND Corporation; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Hurd, M (通讯作者)，RAND Corp, NBER, NETSPAR, MEA Mannheim Res Inst Econ Aging, Santa Monica, CA 90406 USA.",mhurd@rand.org; susannr@rand.org,,,"NIA NIH HHS [P01 AG008291, P01 AG008291-17, U01 AG009740] Funding Source: Medline",NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,11,24,25,0,7,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0143-5671,,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

This paper reports on the extent of purchases of agricultural land for diverse reasons within an intensive and extensive agricultural farming area in the Western Cape, gathered through a survey of land buyers between January 2005 and October 2007. Descriptive statistics provide demographical information of buyers, their reasons for purchasing farms and the importance of specific characteristics of agricultural properties considered in such purchases. Analyses of variance convey more information regarding the different characteristics of agricultural properties considered by agricultural and lifestyle buyers. Survey results indicated that farm purchases for alternative purposes were substantial: more than half of all transactions in both the intensive and extensive area were for lifestyle reasons. Lifestyle buyers mostly rely on income from outside the agricultural sector for their livelihoods and financing of purchased properties, therefore they could focus on characteristics of farms unrelated to commercial agricultural production in their decision to buy agricultural properties. Characteristics such as the recreational opportunities provided by the property and its aesthetic beauty, including natural scenery, beautiful views and locations within a valley and set against a mountain, appealed to these buyers.","[Reed, L.

We find no evidence that R&D discontinuing firms experience an event-induced change in their systematic risk. We find evidence of a one-year-long price reversal; however, it is not robust to controlling for possible risk dimensions for firms with R&D capital that the three-factor model does not capture.

However, existing studies have mostly ignored an important characteristic of East Asia, i.e., most of its international trade is invoiced in the U.S. dollars. This paper investigates how the preponderance of dollar invoicing affects optimal currency basket regimes for East Asian economies. I develop a three-country center-periphery sticky-price dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model for the analysis. The model is solved numerically by taking second-order approximations to the policy functions with the expected lifetime utility of households chosen as the welfare criterion. Contrary to the conjecture of existing literature, I show that predominance of dollar invoicing implies that the dollar should receive a smaller weight than suggested by bilateral trade shares between emerging markets in East Asia and the United States. The results hinge on the interaction of different degrees of pass-through implied by the choice of invoice currency and endogenous responses of monetary policies in the center countries. J.

Contrary to this conclusion, I argue that the important margin of distinction for factors preventing deregulation is not whether rents are economic or political, but rather what alternative profit opportunities are available and how innovation has changed the entrepreneurial opportunity set. Using the example of medieval Cologne, I show that the transitional gains trap framework, as developed by Tullock (in The Bell Journal of Economics 6(2):671-678, 1975), applies in a static environment and can successfully prevent reform over long periods of time, but that neither political nor economic entrepreneurs will ignore an opportunity for increased profitability in the long run.

From an economic point of view, lay participation in judicial decision-making can be interpreted as a renunciation of an additional division of labor. which is expected to cause foregone benefits in terms of the costs as well as the quality of judicial decision-making. In order to be justified, these foregone benefits need to be overcompensated by other - actually realized - benefits of at least the same magnitude. This paper discusses pros and cons of lay participation, presents a new database and tests some of the theoretically derived hypotheses empirically. The effects of lay participation on the judicial system, a number of governance variables but also on economic performance indicators are rather modest.

In contrast with historical bank runs, recent banking crises were driven by deteriorating bank assets. Hence, in contrast with bank run models, this paper focuses on the interaction of falling asset prices, bank losses, credit contraction and bankruptcies. This interaction can explain credit crunches, financial instability, and banking crises, either as fundamental or as self-fulfilling outcomes. The model distinguishes between macroeconomic and financial stability. Its simplicity helps understand balance sheet effects and delivers closed-form solutions without resorting to linearization. For instance, the critical threshold beyond which an asset price decline triggers financial instability can be related explicitly to the structural parameters of the economy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Second, how long will it take for indebtedness to rise sufficiently to prompt some pullback by global investors? We project that external debt, net investment income, and the share of U.

Finally, if and when levels of sustainable debt burden are breached, how readily would asset prices respond and the current account start to narrow?

The new calibrations of these variables are used in a life-cycle model where a worker chooses between a defined benefit and a defined contribution plan.

The author argues that conventional explanations of peasant rebellions are inappropriate for the analysis of current land struggles in Latin America in the midst of the process of neoliberal globalization. Neither struggle can be characterized as 'quasi-feudal', nor as conservative reactions, but instead should be interpreted as attempts to create a basis for self-subsistence and autonomy. Consequently, the author proposes Marx's concept of alienated labour as an alternative explanatory concept, because it highlights one of the main objectives of the members of the MST and the EZLN, which is the control over their livelihood through a struggle for their re-peasantization.","Univ Groningen, Ctr Dev Studies, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Vergara-Camus, L (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Ctr Dev Studies, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",l.a.vergara@rug.nl,"Vergara-Camus, Leandro/ITU-9103-2023","Vergara-Camus, Leandro/0000-0002-6959-9942",,,,,77,31,39,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

This measure is motivated by a study of the investor's preferences to higher moments of distribution within Expected Utility Theory and an approximation analysis of the optimal capital allocation problem. We show that this performance measure justifies the notion of the Generalized Sharpe Ratio (GSR) introduced by Hodges (1998). We present two methods of practical estimation of the GSR: nonparametric and parametric. For the implementation of the parametric method we derive a closed-form solution for the GSR where the higher moments are calibrated to the normal inverse Gaussian distribution. We illustrate how the GSR can mitigate the shortcomings of the Sharpe ratio in resolution of Sharpe ratio paradoxes and reveal the real performance of portfolios with manipulated Sharpe ratios. We also demonstrate the use of this measure in the performance evaluation of hedge funds. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We find that these uninformed traders behave largely as irrational contrarian noise traders, trading against recent price movements to their own detriment. The uninformed traders provide some benefits to the market: increasing market volume and depth, while reducing bid-ask spreads and the temporary price impact of trades. However, their noise trading also diminishes the ability of market prices to adjust to new information. A securities transaction tax reduces uninformed trader activity, but it reduces informed trader activity by approximately the same amount; as a result, the tax does not alter the impact of noise trading on the informational efficiency of the market.","[Bloomfield, Robert; O'Hara, Maureen; Saar, Gideon] Cornell Univ, Johnson Grad Sch Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"O'Hara, M (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Johnson Grad Sch Management, Sage Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",rjb9@cornell.edu,"Saar, Gideon/JUF-4915-2023",,,,,,39,147,158,1,50,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Conditional on actual events, changes in reported conflict intensity could influence tourists because alternative sources of information are costly; this explanation is consistent with a rational choice model. However, television news could influence tourist behavior because of its emotional impact, or because it causes the conflict to be brought to mind more readily, increasing the subjective probability of conflict events. We find that tourists respond to variations in actual Israeli casualties and reported Palestinian casualties; both effects are large. Reports of Israeli casualties and unreported Palestinian casualties have no significant impact on tourist flows. These asymmetries are consistent with asymmetric information costs within a rational choice framework, but are more difficult to square with the alternative explanations for media influence.","[Fielding, David] Univ Otago, Dept Econ, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Shortland, Anja] Brunel Univ, Dept Econ, London, England",University of Otago; Brunel University,"Fielding, D (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dept Econ, Dunedin, New Zealand.",dfielding@business.otago.ac.nz,,"Shortland, Anja/0000-0002-9663-546X; Fielding, David/0000-0003-0506-4233",,,,,27,11,11,1,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

We use the Berg, Dickhaut and McCabe [Berg, J., Dickhaut, I., & McCabe, K. (1995). Trust, reciprocity, and social history. Games and Economic Behavior, 10, 122-142] investment game to generate indices of trust and reciprocity. Prior to their participation in the investment game, all subjects participated in two other games. One is used to measure their social value orientation (a measure of other regarding behavior) and the second to measure risk attitudes. These variables are introduced as treatments in the analysis of the trust and reciprocity data. In addition to these preference related variables, gender is introduced to capture any differences between men and women which may not be encompassed by value orientation and risk attitudes. The statistical analysis indicates that the social value orientation measure significantly accounts for variation in trust and reciprocity. As well, the level of trust exhibited by an investor significantly affects the reciprocity of the responders and this measure of trust interacts with social value orientation. individuals who are highly pro-social reciprocate more as the sender's trust increases, while those who are highly pro-self reciprocate less as the sender's trust increases. For this sample of participants, the gender variable does not capture any differences in the behavior of men and women that is not already reflected by the differences captured by their value orientations. Risk attitudes do not significantly account for variation in trusting behavior, except for the case where individuals have neither strongly pro-social nor pro-self social value orientations. In this case, more risk-seeking individuals are more trusting. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

To achieve sustainability the service organization should focus on its results as well as on its processes. The paper summarizes the preliminary results of an ongoing research on organization maturity assessment and process performance management, conducted in Romanian organizations in 2008. Multiple managers, responsible for quality and other executives in over 1100 organizations completed the Maturity Assessment Survey (MAS), which collected information on the strategic and operational maturity level of their organizations. The MAS was designed to identify the degree to which Romanian organizations are sustainable and offer continued satisfaction to their stakeholders, and to help organizations identify areas in which they can improve their performances. The paper analyzes the cause and effect relationships that exist among the critical components of a service organization's management system at the strategic level so that key drivers or outcomes will become the heart of an effective solution. In particular, the paper focuses on how the organizational system influences process maturity of Romanian companies, and the degree to which process maturity level plays a role in sustainability improvement. A correlation analysis was employed, in order to show the degree to which organizational system and strategies shape process maturity in various companies. The research results show that strong positive correlations between the components of an organizational system account for a higher level of maturity and performance of organization's processes.","Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Paunescu, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",carmen.paunescu@com.ase.ro,"Paunescu, Carmen/ABD-1883-2020",,,,,,9,10,10,0,18,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2009,11.0,26,,,,,323,329,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,462KQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267351800010,0

The global satisfaction evaluation was based on three analyzed variables, namely the perceived competence of physicians, the perceived competence of nurses, and the empathy of the hospital personnel. In a quality-oriented perspective and, at the same time, in a relationship-oriented perspective, these elements were regarded as essential for the way in which the patient, without being fully informed as far as the characteristics of the processes taking place in hospitals are regarded, evaluates, while being in a state of physical and psychical distress, the quality of the healthcare experience they live. Our purpose, while choosing these variables for analysis, was to approach this experience by keeping it as undivided as possible, because it is a latent concept, difficult to measure, and we have to account for the reductionism of the statistical model. The main data processing method is PROXSCAL (multidimensional scaling), in SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences), by which we created proximities from data expressing patient satisfaction, grouping, then, the clinics based on their similarities, as far as patient perceptions on the service quality are concerned. The conclusions of our study serve as an orientation tool on the healthcare services market, by quantifying each clinic's proximity other, and by outlining the factors which make the patients perceive groups of clinics in similar ways. These factors explain the favourable, or unfavourable perceptions on a certain type of clinics and the general influences on the healthcare sector, in its entirety.","[Prejmerean, Cornelia; Vasilache, Simona] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Prejmerean, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",mihaela.prejmerean@gmail.com; simona.vasilache@gmail.com,"Dan, Mihaela Cornelia/AAP-5047-2021; Vasilache, Simona N/B-2909-2010",,,,,,17,3,3,0,16,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2009,11.0,26,,,,,298,304,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,462KQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267351800007,0

The generalizability of this research is ultimately limited, however. if the subjects participating in such studies are not representative of the general population with respect to the behavior or traits of interest to the researcher. In this study, university student recruits answer surveys that assess risk attitudes prior to being told that the study involves a one-hour functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) session and a blood sample obtained via phlebotomy. We find recruits with more conservative risk attitudes in two of four measured dimensions are less likely to agree to participate in the study due to these biomedical requirements, suggesting that recruitment among student volunteer populations for fMRI studies and for genetics studies requiring blood as genetic source material may induce a sample selection bias in the domain of risk attitudes. We find that limiting recruitment to individuals who have previously undergone certain types of medical interventions (MRI, computed tomography or surgery) eliminates the sample selection bias in the case of fMRI research and attenuates the bias in the case of genetics research. Furthermore, relying upon buccal cells rather than blood for genetic source material may attenuate sample selection bias. Buccal cell samples can be collected via less invasive oral techniques and have been shown to provide genotyping results that are comparable to blood samples. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Until then, Federal Reserve actions taken to improve the functioning financial markets did not affect the monetary base. The unusual lending and purchase of private debt was offset by the sale of Treasury securities so that the total size of the balance sheet of the Fed remained relatively unchanged. In September, however, the Fed stopped selling securities as it made massive purchases of private debt and issued hundreds of billions of dollars in short-term loans. The result was a doubling of the size of the monetary base in the final four months of 2008. This article discusses the details of the programs that the Fed has initiated since the crisis began, shows which programs have grown as the monetary base grew, and discusses some factors that will determine whether this rapid increase in the monetary base will lead to rapid inflation.

Our results show that, although media disclosure falls well short of the polling industry's standards, the technical information surrounding non-election polls is at least as complete as the information accompanying election polls. Long articles about polls sponsored by the media that publish them provide significantly more methodological information than short articles in which polls sponsored by outside organizations are mentioned in passing.

We argue that public commenters play a critical agenda-setting role during rule development. To test this proposition, we analyze data from 36 Department of Transportation rules and almost 500 continents. Each of these rules began with an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking-a procedure that allows us to track the formal participation of interested parties during rule development. Our analyses are supplemented by face-to-face interviews with agency officials. We find a strong agenda-setting role for early commenters-both in terms of affecting the content of future regulations and in thwarting unwanted regulations.

Convenience takes various meanings in travel decisions: time involved in travel from airport to lodging, language barriers, cleanliness and sanitary concerns, access to interests (beaches, attractions, amenities) and special needs (Kotler, 2002).

The paper uses the typology of strategic decision-making produced by Whittington [(1993). What is strategy: and does it matter? New York: Routledge] to derive contrasting predictions of strategy-making by ethnic versus non-ethnic firms. Drawing on a questionnaire study of 76 high-growth family firms, and subsequent in-depth fieldwork with 40 of these, the findings show that the ethnic origin of the controlling family has a significant influence in determining the dominance of a particular strategy paradigm. However, successful high-growth family firms are not associated with any particular school of strategy. The influence of family bonding on strategy-making was greater in ethnic family firms than non-ethnic family firms. The advent of the second generation of South Asians in family firms, and closer integration of immigrant and host communities, has not altered these apparent differences. The findings challenge researchers on family firms to adopt a multiple perspective approach to strategy-making.","[Bhalla, Ajay; Lampel, Joseph] Cass Business Sch, Fac Management, London EC1Y8TZ, England; [Henderson, Steven; Watkins, David] Southampton Business Sch, Fac Management, Southampton SO14OYN, Hants, England",,"Bhalla, A (通讯作者)，Cass Business Sch, Fac Management, 106 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y8TZ, England.",a.bhalla@city.ac.uk,"Placido, Ivonete Telles Medei/P-6018-2016; Watkins, David/ABC-3783-2020","Watkins, David/0000-0001-6341-9595; Bhalla, Ajay/0000-0001-5436-9485",,,,,71,18,19,2,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The factors in question are changes in the structural characteristics of economies in transition, changing perception of inflation risks, the inconsistency of central bank's monetary decisions and central bank's weakened credibility and uncertainty about the efficient transmission of monetary measures. The empirical analysis documents non-stationary variability of ultra short-term PRIBOR interest rates and stability of longer maturity PRIBOR interest rates. These results reflect the role of CNB in bank system liquidity management, the uncertainty about the timing of CNB's monetary policy at the changing speed of the appreciation of the crown, tendencies of overestimation of expected inflation and changing structural characteristics.","Univ Econ, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Bruna, K (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",bruna@vse.cz,"Bruna, Karel/AAD-9178-2020","Bruna, Karel/0000-0003-3690-1364",,,,,26,3,3,0,2,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

This problem occurs in China's other major cities as well. On June 1, 2008, a law requiring large retail stores in China to charge for bags was enacted in an attempt to curtail plastic bag consumption. As a result, many plastic bag manufacturing plants were closed. However, because of the wide-spread usage of plastic bags, they are still being manufactured and consumed. It is possible that the current plastic bag cost of 0.3 CNY is too low to change customers' consumptive behavior. The purpose of this study is to explore people's attitudes regarding the substitution of plastic bags with bags made from alternative materials, and their willingness to pay for such substitutes. This study used a conjoint choice experiment to measure Tianjin residents' preferences for degradable and non-plastic materials bags. The results show that most people do not like non-degradable plastic bags and would use bags made of other materials if they were sold at a reasonable price. Based on the latent class and socio-demographic segmentation results, there are preference distinctions among age groups. Also, there are niche markets for paper, cloth, and degradable plastic bags where costs are of a lesser concern in consumer decisions. Manufacturers can use this information to more efficiently manufacture appropriate bags for different markets. This will help maximize revenue while continuing to meet demands.","[Chan-Halbrendt, Catherine] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Management, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Fang, Di] Arizona State Univ, Morrison Sch Management & Agribusiness, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA; [Yang, Fang] Yunnan Prov Forestry Dept, Wildlife Conservat Off, Kunming 650021, Yunnan, Peoples R China",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Arizona State University,"Chan-Halbrendt, C (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Management, 1910 E W Rd,Sherman 224, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",chanhalb@hawaii.edu; dfang3@asu.edu; aquayang2003@yahoo.com,,,,,,,34,6,6,1,39,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

The results of such analyses could then be the basis for taking appropriate decisions and measures in the domain of human resource management. The research presented in this paper seeks to explore the differences in attitudes between these two employee categories regarding different aspects of material and non-material character.

Participants in the experiment form their portfolios of two risky lotteries and one risk-free alternative with the target to reach a predetermined income. Subjects show illusion of control as they excessively invest in a lottery when they are in charge of the chance move. This finding is amplified when self-selection is possible and mitigated when a well-diversified default portfolio is offered. Presenting sequences of chance moves prior to investment does not affect diversification. In line with excessive extrapolation, the higher the number of observed positive prior outcomes, the more likely is a positive prediction and in turn a higher investment.","Univ Vienna, Econ & Business Inst Econ Policy & Ind Econ, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Fellner, G (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Econ & Business Inst Econ Policy & Ind Econ, Augasse 2-6, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",gfellner@wu-wien.ac.at,"Fellner-Röhling, Gerlinde/A-5995-2013","Fellner-Röhling, Gerlinde/0000-0002-8577-4456",,,,,39,20,25,2,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1542-7560,,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

Many companies would like to operate companies they acquired as separate legal entities rather than a whole company. However, from a financial reporting point of view, statement users want to see the entire economic entity's financial statement result. Accounting principles require consolidated financial statements when a parent company owns more than 50% of a Subsidiary company. Consolidated statements are basically used to present for the benefit of the shareholders, creditors and other resource providers of the parent. It is first necessary to obtain a conceptual understanding of goodwill in order to understand its composition, and measurement is then a separate issue.

But for non-traditional (i.e. older) students who tend to prefer community college, access is more about a school's location than about its tuition and fees. Using data on over 150,000 mature workers (aged 25 to 49) in the Greater Baltimore area. we analyze the impact of travel distance on community college enrollment decisions. We find that distance is a highly statistically significant factor in deciding whether to enroll in community college, and in which school to choose. Simulations of the model suggest that if the typical resident had to travel three additional miles from home to the nearest college, enrollment could drop by as much as 14%. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

At the core of the model is a moral hazard problem between depositors/bank regulators and stockholders. The solution to this problem takes the form of shared management of the bank. Stockholders manage the bank's portfolio and the regulator manages the financing of the portfolio. The model predicts that portfolio adjustments are made to conform to the risk aversion of shareholders and financing adjustments are made to offset changes in portfolio risk. Regression evidence for 1955-2000 fails to reject these predictions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The market size is positively related with FDI but agricultural import is negatively related with FDI. The effect of agricultural export is positive but not statistically significant. The orientation of open policy between FDI and trade in China's agriculture is still not clear. The decrease of the share of fiscal expenditure is not conducive to the FDI inflow to China's agriculture.

The trend towards a drop in taxable income was first observed in the fourth quarter of 2008, with the first quarter of 2009 being reported as worse than its predecessor. The deficit in the state budget for the month of March reached 2.35 billion crowns, but an additional 31 billion crowns were allocated to the state budget from the fund which had been reserved for dealing with possible damage caused by the influence of the world financial crisis. The aim of this abstract is to analyze the influence of macroeconomic entities an city and village budgets, where a large number of the grants are received from the European Structural Funds.

Secondly, after considering the differences of regional environment the firm lying in, the paper finds that the superiority private firms hold in political connection is significantly affected by regional fiscal situation, while the functioning of the local government's intervention is also constrained by regional fiscal situation.

The findings reveal that households with low initial income level, high share of wage income, high educational level of household members, high number of employed household members, and younger heads are more mobile. Moreover, besides initial income, change in the share of wage income, change in the share of the number of employed household members, and change in average year of education of household members are the most important variables that account for income mobility among rural households. As we separate households according to initial income ranks, we also find the primary importance of these change variables in accounting for income mobility among the initially rich. While changes in the share of wage income and the share of the number of employed household members remain consistently important contributors to mobility among the initially poor, change in the average years of education is less important for the poor than for the rich. These findings necessitate more emphasis on policies that promote employment and education to enhance household income mobility in rural China.","China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University,"Shi, XH (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,2,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,,,,,2009,,,,,,,161,178,,,,,,18,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BME64,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272028800012,0

Psychological alternatives abound. The Tversky-Kahneman heuristics approach is dominating, but it needs to be complemented with emotional and personality factors, since cognitive limitations do not provide exhaustive explanations of the psychology of decision making. In this paper, attitudes to financial risk taking and gambling are related to sensation seeking, emotional intelligence, the perceived importance of money ( money concern), and overarching values in groups of students of financial economics (N = 93). Comparative data were collected for a group of nonstudents. Data on values were also available from a random sample of the population. It was found that the students of finance had a positive attitude to economic risk taking and gambling behavior, a high level of sensation seeking, a low level of money concern, and gave low priority to altruistic values about peace and the environment. The subgroup of participants planning a career in finance showed an even more pronounced interest in gambling.","[Sjoberg, Lennart; Engelberg, Elisabeth] Stockholm Sch Econ, Ctr Risk Res, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm School of Economics,"Sjöberg, L (通讯作者)，Stockholm Sch Econ, Ctr Risk Res, Box 6501, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden.",lennartsjoberg@gmail.com,,,,,,,76,37,40,3,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

Efficient transport system is an important precondition of economic and social development. One of the essential problems here has been the low profitability of transportation in peripheral and sparsely populated areas in Estonia. The paper will deal with the study of ways how to guarantee the survival of regular bus line transportation for the whole territory of Estonia. Estonian transport sector is characterised by free access to regular services and occasional services, infrastructure services and operator business. On conditions of the sparseness of the population, the price for public transport is inevitably high, which necessitates a need to use sparse timetables in rural areas. Passenger transport related bus lines in Estonia can be divided into commercial lines and public lines. Commercial lines operate on the basis of an authorisation of the regular line or a contract concluded with the contracting entity and funding is fully executed on a commercial basis, i.e., all the means necessary for maintaining the line emanate from ticket income paid by passengers or from the contracting entity. Local bus lines are operating as subsidised lines but long-distance lines are not subsidised and they are operating as commercial lines. A few local lines are also operating on commercial grounds in the regions with such great passenger flow which enables to earn on ticketing to the extent that it covers the expenses incurred for servicing the lines.

Using a sampling from French companies in the wine industry from 2001-2005, these implicit financial export performance characteristics are estimated.

We focus on the long-term (that is low frequency) comovement of consumption and output in answering this question. Theoretically, the impact of financial globalization should show up first and most robustly in the lower frequencies of the data. We show that this is the case empirically: by the end of our sample period (1960-2007), up to 40% of long-term idiosyncratic consumption risk is shared between industrialized countries-as compared to less than 10% before 1990. This dramatic increase is associated with a huge increase in international capital income flows: while capital income flows remain relatively limited as a channel of risk sharing at business-cycle horizons, their contribution to international risk sharing at longer, horizons has increased substantially. Much of this increase can be attributed to the growth in international asset positions over the recent globalization period.","[Artis, Michael J.] Univ Manchester, Inst Polit & Econ Governance, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Hoffmann, Mathias] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Chair Int Trade & Finance, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Manchester; University of Zurich,"Artis, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Inst Polit & Econ Governance, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",mathias.hoffmann@econ.uzh.ch,,,,,,,37,17,18,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

However, less attention has been paid to the optimal composition of reserves and even less to the joint determination of level and composition. We show that despite the common belief that higher reserve levels should lead to greater diversification to minimize the opportunity costs of holding reserves, the opposite appears to be true. Across a sample of 20 countries, we find that reserve accumulation is driven primarily by precautionary motives, underpinning in turn the allocation of reserves to safe assets. More generally, we show that a positive relationship between increases in reserves and reserve diversification should be expected only if the reserve increase is not being driven by precautionary motives.","[Beck, Roland] European Cent Bank, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany; [Weber, Sebastian] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",European Central Bank; International Monetary Fund,"Beck, R (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Kaiserstr 29, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany.",roland.beck@ecb.int,,,,,,,46,13,13,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1367-0271,,,INT FINANC,Int.

Quality is defined as the extent to which patent systems comply with the patentability conditions in a transparent way. The methodology consists of a two-layer analytical framework encompassing legal standards (LS) and their operational design (OD) which includes several interdependent components that affect the stringency and transparency of the filtering process. The comparison of patent systems in Europe, Japan, and the United States shows that their operational designs differ substantially: the European system provides higher-quality and more expensive examination services than the United States one, while the Japanese Patent system is in an intermediate position. The results illustrate that different system designs lead to different outcomes in terms of backlogs, patent propensity, and the number of dubious patent rights in force. In this respect, these findings (i) provide an empirical validation of the conjecture of a vicious cycle linking the quality of examination and demand for patents and (ii) highlight the need for a multifaceted convergence of patent systems before mutual recognition is put in place.","Univ Libre Bruxelles, Solvay Brussels Sch Econ & Management SBS EM, ECARES, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"de la Potterie, BV (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, Solvay Brussels Sch Econ & Management SBS EM, ECARES, CP 114,50 Av FD Roosevelt, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",bruno.vanpottelsberghe@ulb.ac.be,"VAN POTTELSBERGHE, Bruno/AAN-4779-2020; van Pottelsberghe, Bruno/A-3073-2009","van Pottelsberghe, Bruno/0000-0001-7720-1685",,,,,89,45,48,2,48,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

We argue that a worker's job search intensity is decisively driven by her personality traits, reflected in her propensity to motivate and control herself while searching for a job. Moreover, personality traits, in as far as they can be signaled to a potential employer, may also enhance the probability of receiving and accepting a job offer. For our econometric duration analysis, we use the well-accepted taxonomy Big Five to classify personality traits. Based on individual unemployment data taken from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) our empirical findings reveal that the personality traits Conscientiousness and Neuroticism have a strong impact on the instantaneous probability of finding a job, where the former has a positive effect and the latter has a negative effect. The direction of the effect on the subsequent employment duration is the opposite. We do not find any significant effects of the personality traits Extraversion and Agreeableness on the duration of unemployment.

We then map the disaggregated aid and conflict data in Sierra Leone, Angola, and Mozambique as specific examples of how these data could help disentangle competing causal mechanisms linking aid to conflict onset and dynamics.

By considering the minimum travel time required to connect each pair of airports, it is possible to create new measures of hub competition, separating the effects of hub position and temporal coordination. This analysis was carried out at the global level, considering all 232 airports with more than 3 million seats yearly offered in departure flights in 2008, and also in relevant geographic markets. The results show a high level of competition among the most important world airports, but the major airports of Europe have a geographical advantage in relation to world markets over the major American and Asian airports.

In the process, an 'upland bias' has emerged where researchers focus narrowly on the uplands as localities with distinct, coherent features, neglecting how families engage place, social relations and ethnicity as they access opportunities in proximate spaces. This paper considers how the Tagbanua - long considered an upland swidden people - have 'stepped back' from swidden agriculture due to declining yields and debt to harvest the lucrative grouper (e.g. Plectropomus leopardus). We show how Tagbanua families on Palawan Island have adjusted swidden as they negotiate social relations, ethnic cleavages and economic barriers to effectively engage the grouper industry. Rather than cast such farmers and fishers as ideal types in place, we argue that how they negotiate social relations creates new livelihood opportunities in varied environments, reinforcing the dynamic, recursive context of agrarian change.","[Dressler, Wolfram H.] Univ Queensland, Sch Social Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Fabinyi, Michael] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland; James Cook University,"Dressler, WH (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Social Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.",w.dressler@uq.edu.au; wolfram.dressler@mail.mcgill.ca,"Fabinyi, Michael/G-5198-2012","Fabinyi, Michael/0000-0001-5293-4081",,,,,79,15,18,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

We also document that dividend smoothing has steadily increased over the past 80 years, even before firms began using share repurchases in the mid-1980s.

We primarily focus on experiments designed to test a hypothesis by comparing behavior across two or more games and highlight the drawbacks of using a between-subjects design or a within subjects design. An alternative design for laboratory experiments is proposed which may alleviate this concern especially in studies of social preferences. We argue that the proposed design does not introduce any conceptual problems in addition to those that are already present in the between and within subjects designs and may alleviate some of the problems inherent to these designs in certain cases. We also use the proposed design to answer some questions that have attracted continued attention in the literature on social preferences in general and reciprocity in particular.

Empirical analysis finds persistent net exposures to the spread between small vs large cap stocks in addition to the overall market. Together, these factors account for more than 80% of return variation. Additional factors are price momentum and market activity. Combining two major branches of hedge fund research, our model is the first that explicitly incorporates the effect of funding (stock loan) on alpha. Using a comprehensive dataset compiled from three major database sources, we find that among the three thousand plus hedge funds with similar style classification, less than 20% of long/short equity hedge funds delivered significant, persistent, stable positive non-factor related returns. Consistent with the predictions of the Berk and Green (2004) model we find alpha producing funds decays to beta-only over time. However, we do not find evidence of a negative effect of fund size on managers' ability to deliver alpha. Finally, we show that non-factor related returns, or alpha, are positively correlated to market activity and negatively correlated to aggregate short interest. In contrast, equity mutual funds and long-bias equity hedge funds have no significant, persistent, non-factor related return. Expressed differently, L/S equity hedge funds, as the name suggests, do benefit from shorting. Besides differences in risk taking behavior, this is a key feature distinguishing L/S funds from long-bias funds. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Minimum variance investing is one of these popular concepts. I show in this paper that the portfolio construction process behind minimum variance investing implicitly picks up risk-based pricing anomalies. In other words the minimum variance tends to hold low beta and low residual risk stocks. Long/short portfolios based on these characteristics have been associated in the empirical literature with risk adjusted outperformance. This paper shows that 83% of the variation of the minimum variance portfolio excess returns (relative to a capitalization weighted alternative) can be attributed to the FAMA/FRENCH factors as well as to the returns on two characteristic anomaly portfolios. All regression coefficients (factor exposures) are highly significant, stable over the estimation period and correspond remarkably well with our economic intuition. The paper also shows that a direct combination of market weighted benchmark portfolio and risk based characteristic portfolios will provide a statistically significant improvement over the indirect pickup via the minimum variance portfolio.

Results from a mixed integer linear programming model suggest that significant government support is required to stimulate biodiesel production, and support the notion of Funke et al.

However, there are significant implementation obstacles to accessing the world's forest carbon sequestration potential. The timing of regional participation and eligibility of sequestration activities are issues. The existing forest carbon supply estimates have made optimistic assumptions about immediate, comprehensive, and global access. They have also assumed no interactions between activities and regions, and over time. We use a global forest and land use model to evaluate these assumptions with more realistic forest carbon policy pathways. We find that an afforestation only policy is fundamentally flawed, accelerated deforestation may be unavoidable, and a delayed comprehensive program could reduce, but not eliminate, near-term accelerated deforestation and eventually produce sequestration equivalent to idealized policies - but with a different sequestration mix than previously estimated by others and thereby different forests. We also find that afforestation and avoided deforestation increase the cost of one another.","[Rose, Steven K.] Elect Power Res Inst, Global Climate Change Res Grp, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Sohngen, Brent] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI); University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Rose, SK (通讯作者)，Elect Power Res Inst, Global Climate Change Res Grp, 2000 L St NW,Suite 805, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",srose@epri.com; sohngen.1@osu.edu,,"Sohngen, Brent/0000-0002-9094-160X",,,,,24,16,17,3,22,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

While separate theories in industrial organization and labor literature are offered to account for this evidence, we demonstrate that it can be explained in a unified framework presented by noisy selection.

It is important to explore the time variants of short-term passenger flow for transportation planning and operation. When the data are sufficiently analyzed, transportation planners not only can make better decisions, but also enhance the performance of transportation systems. The data of short-term passenger flow may be difficult to analyze due to its exotic oscillation. Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) has recently been developed for analyzing non-linear and non-stationary data. In this paper, the proposed time variants exploration method includes two stages: empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and Hilbert spectral analysis (HSA). A real passenger flow dataset is collected from Taipei rapid transit corporation (TRTC) to investigate the viability of the proposed time variants exploration approach. The intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) extracted by EMD can represent the local characteristics of passenger flow and imply its meaningful time variants such as peak period pattern, semi-service period pattern, semi-daily pattern and daily pattern. By comparing the results of HHT with that of fast Fourier transform (FFT), it indicates that HHT can obtain the narrower frequency band, accurately capture time-frequency-energy distribution, and help to enhance the performance of transportation systems. The results show that HHT is an effective approach for exploring the time variants of short-term passenger flow in a metro system. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper investigates how automobility, a system of land-use and mobility, imposes on the ability to participate in discretionary activities. A theoretical argument couched in time-geography is used to describe the mechanism through which activity dispersion and traffic congestion, both features of the current realization of automobility, hampers accessibility. The concept is illustrated with an analysis of synthetic space-time prisms constructed under a variety of travel speed and activity dispersion assumptions. Following this, a descriptive analysis of time-use data drawn from several cycles of the General Social Survey of Canada is used to empirically test the argument. The empirical investigation provides evidence of declining participation in a variety of discretionary, out-of-home activities, and an increase in the amount of travel required to reach activity destinations. The work trip in particular is shown to have increased significantly between 1992 and 2005 and activity profiles for drivers and non-drivers show that participation in discretionary activities is severely affected by the duration of the daily work commute.

Most among them attribute this to their domestic political structures. Some, however, believe that the common and conflicting interests that the East-West conflict induced explain the relatively low democratic-dispute rate. Evidence from the post-Cold War world can help to arbitrate between these very different claims, as the collapse of the Soviet Union destroyed the bipolar system, precipitated a sharp rise in the number of democracies, and shifted dispute-rate patterns. The analyses in this paper show that dyadic dispute rates converge after the Cold War, casting doubt on the existence of a democratic peace.","Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Gowa, J (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",jgowa@princeton.edu,,,,,,,69,24,29,1,23,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

Podhoretz describes liberal Jews in the U.S. as expressively voting contrary to self-interest to confirm allegiance to liberalism, which he terms a new religion. Traditional Jews do not require the identity of the new religion and vote in accord with their self-interest.

This paper studies the determinants of the world pattern of legal and illegal corruption by proposing a simple theoretical model of endogenous corruption and related legal framework, and its thorough empirical test. Three types of equilibrium outcomes are identified: one based on illegal corruption, where the elite does not face any binding incentives to limit corruption; one centered around legal corruption, where the elite must incur a cost to legally protect corruption; and finally a no-corruption outcome, where the population is able to effectively react to corruption. Testable implications from the model are derived based on country-wide parameters. Crucially, we use a rich corporate survey, including 8,279 firms in 104 countries, tailored for this research, and featuring measures of legal corruption that are novel to the literature. The microdimension of the database enables improving on familiar shortcomings associated with the use of endogeneity-prone, country-wide indices of perceived corruption. The empirical results, making use of a broad range of proxies and sources, generally validate the model's explanations.","[Vicente, Pedro C.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Kaufmann, Daniel] Univ Oxford, Brookings Inst, CSAE, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",Trinity College Dublin; University of Oxford; Brookings Institution,"Vicente, PC (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin 2, Ireland.",vicentep@tcd.ie,,"Vicente, Pedro/0000-0002-9864-5012",,,,,39,105,124,0,29,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

Using firm-level data from Italy, we find that banks that establish long-term relationships with firms promote technological progress on average.

Transportation time and cost obtained from comprehensive industry sources are then fed into the intermodal transport network connecting two important Chinese origins and four Indian destinations, from which the most attractive routes are identified.

We propose an alternative, multiple hypothesis testing approach based on the closure test principle which controls the multiple type I error. We consider the US, the UK and the German stock markets and test Monday related pairwise comparisons of daily expected stock returns, while the probability of committing any type I error is always kept smaller than a prespecified level a, for each combination of true null hypotheses. Overall, the new testing approach supports previous findings of a Monday effect for the 1970s and 1980s, in particular for the US and Germany, while it suggests that the Monday effect has vanished in the 1990s and 2000s in all three markets. The comparison of the closure test procedure, the traditional multiple t-test and the Bonferroni test, a classical multiple test procedure, shows that traditional testing may result in spurious significance while the Bonferroni test may sometimes be too conservative.

On the basis of previous research on aspiration and goal regulation, we predicted that John Henryism would be negatively associated with happiness when controlling for demographic factors and attainment in various domains of life. We tested the prediction in a sample of hypertensive participants (n = 758) drawn from an inner-city, mainly African-American, safety-net hospital in Jefferson County, Alabama. Bivariate analysis revealed no association between John Henryism and attainment in six domains of life: marriage, children, education, employment, income, and health. However, a significant negative association between John Henryism and happiness was found both in bivariate analysis (Spearman's rho = -0.335: p < .001) and when controlling for demographic factors and attainment using ordinal logistic regression analysis. There was a significant interaction effect between John Henryism and gender: being male was positively associated with happiness among participants with low John Henryism, but negatively associated with happiness among participants with high John Henryism. While further study would be required in order to establish the extent to which these findings can be generalized as well as their causal underpinnings, the results support the hypothesis that John Henryism is negatively associated with happiness, especially among men, and underscore the limitations of using self-report measures of happiness as proxies for well-being for purposes of public policy.

The mechanism leads to an efficient level of emissions. and if the matching abatements process includes a quota trading stage, the marginal benefits of emissions are also equalized across countries. Given equilibrium matching rates, the initial allocation of emission quotas (before trading) reflects each country's marginal valuation for lower pollution relative to its marginal benefit from emissions. These results hold for any number of countries, in an environment where countries have different abatement technologies and different benefits from emissions, and even if the emissions of countries are imperfect substitutes in each country's damage function.

They also show that if the cohorts are fixed, small, and interact repeatedly over time, then tacit collusion in the WGD, but not the BGD, leads to suppression of expenditures.","[Rapoport, Amnon; Zwick, Rami] Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Chark, Robin] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of California System; University of California Riverside; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Zwick, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",ramiz@ucr.edu,,"Zwick, Rami/0000-0003-1241-0464",,,,,33,2,2,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUN,2011,147.0,3-4,,,,,305,329,,10.1007/s11127-010-9631-8,0.0,,,25,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,756RD,,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290031500004,0

This compares with typically negative R-squares obtained in a similar experiment with predictive regressions. The performance of the SOP method comes mainly from the dividend-price ratio and earnings growth components, and the robustness of the method is due to its low estimation error.

Representativeness is commonly measured by comparing parties' received votes with their shares of seats in the Parliament, this implies that proportional rule should always represent voters better. A coalition within the Parliament, however, rules the country without interference. When a coalition is formed, the pivotal role of small parties and the proposal right of the formateur may significantly impact the distribution of power. Focusing on the coalition formation stage, I demonstrate that proportional rule is more representative only under specific conditions. Otherwise, introducing certain distortions in the distribution of seats among parties can actually improve representativeness. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike in the usual approach based on the Nelson-Ramaswamy (Rev Financ Stud 3:393-430) transformation, we directly discretize the heteroskedastic spot rate process by a recombining binomial tree. Further, we reduce the computational cost of the pricing problem by associating with each node of the lattice a fixed number of accrued variance values computed on a subset of paths reaching that node.

On the other hand, higher intensity of outsourcing matters for both exporters and foreign affiliates. The message is clear: international outsourcing's initial learning effect on TFP is most pronounced when it serves as a first exposure to international markets, while the scale effect of outsourcing en masse only occurs to larger, already internationalised firms.","Univ Paris 01, Bur 316, F-75647 Paris 13, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"McCann, F (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Bur 316, 106-112 Blvd Hop, F-75647 Paris 13, France.",fergaljmccann@gmail.com,,,,,,,28,8,11,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

The study uses fixed effects panel data estimation with instrumental variables to account for the bias introduced by endogenous POH market entry (i.e., POHs may be more likely to open in high-growth/high-demand markets with high levels of Medicare per enrollee expenditures). After controlling for other variables that are likely to affect expenditures (especially the age and sex distribution of the MSA), we find no association between POH presence and Medicare expenditures per enrollee at the MSA level. The results are robust to changes in model specification, estimation technique, and definition of geographic market. These findings suggest that the demand inducement aspects of physician ownership of acute care hospitals (if any) have no meaningful impact on market-level Medicare expenditures per enrollee.

This prompts consideration of advance transit-oriented development (TOD)-development that takes place before LRT system operation. In this paper we break down almost $1 billion worth of advance TOO in the Phoenix area by type of TOO, type of station area, and use of overlay zoning. Factor analysis and cluster analysis are applied to GIS-based parcel-level data to identify five distinct station-area types. We then use ANOVA to verify statistically significant relationships between station-area type and: the value of advance TOO, the percentage of parcels with overlay zoning, and the percentage of advance TOO with overlay zoning. The five station-area types, ordered from highest to lowest advance TOO per station, are employment centers; Middle-Income Mixed-Use areas; transportation (park-and-ride) nodes; high population/rental areas; and urban poverty areas. Overlay zoning was used most in areas of urban poverty and least in station-area types with the most single-family housing. Advance TOO coincided strongly with overlay zoning in areas of urban poverty and least in employment and amenity centers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In our model, monetary policy has real effects in the flexible-price equilibrium because it affects the cost of external finance. As a consequence, under the standard definition, the natural rate of interest is not a useful policy indicator because it is itself affected by monetary policy. We propose a generalized definition and demonstrate that the resulting natural rate (i) is not policy dependent and (ii) delivers price stability if used as the intercept of a monetary policy rule. From a qualitative perspective, the dynamics of the natural rate in response to shocks can be very different in economies with or without financial frictions. Quantitatively, the policy implications of these differences tend to be minor for real shocks, but sizable for financial shocks of the magnitude observed during the financial crisis of 2007-09.",,,,fiorella.de_fiore@ecb.int; oreste.tristani@ecb.int,,,,,,,25,10,10,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Integrated and arms length relationships are the two possible relationship structures that dominate industrial life. Integrated types of relationships have unique characteristics such as commitment, trust, cooperation, communication structures, and joint conflict resolution techniques of the related parties that discriminate them from traditional business relationships. Both univariate and multivariate analysis showed that firms having at least one integrated relationship performed better than those operating only in an arms length manner for all relational outcome variables, which include product quality, delivery reliability, process flexibility and cost leadership. These firms were also more innovative but the differences were statistically significant only for innovativeness, process flexibility and cost leadership. The findings of hierarchical regression analysis supported a two-way relationship among the four integration intensity factors (cooperation, trust, communication, joint conflict resolution) and the three relational outcome variables (product quality, process flexibility and cost leadership). Innovativeness was found to be an important mediating variable between the two integration intensity factors communication and cooperation and the two relational outcome measures product quality and process flexibility.","Dogus Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",Dogus University,"Parlak, D (通讯作者)，Dogus Univ, Istanbul, Turkey.",dparlak@dogus.edu.tr,"Parlak, Didem/U-4743-2017","Parlak, Didem/0000-0001-9430-888X",,,,,24,1,1,0,11,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

Changes in the extent and composition of forests, grasslands, wetlands and other ecosystems have large impacts on the provision of ecosystem services, biodiversity conservation and returns to landowners. While the change in private returns to landowners due to land-use change can often be measured, changes in the supply and value of ecosystem services and the provision of biodiversity conservation have been harder to quantify. In this paper we use a spatially explicit integrated modeling tool (InVEST) to quantify the changes in ecosystem services, habitat for biodiversity, and returns to landowners from land-use change in Minnesota from 1992 to 2001. We evaluate the impact of actual land-use change and a suite of alternative land-use change scenarios. We find a lack of concordance in the ranking of baseline and alternative land-use scenarios in terms of generation of private returns to landowners and net social benefits (private returns plus ecosystem service value). Returns to landowners are highest in a scenario with large-scale agricultural expansion. This scenario, however, generated the lowest net social benefits across all scenarios considered because of large losses in stored carbon and negative impacts on water quality. Further, this scenario resulted in the largest decline in habitat quality for general terrestrial biodiversity and forest songbirds. Our results illustrate the importance of taking ecosystem services into account in land-use and land-management decision-making and linking such decisions to incentives that accurately reflect social returns.","[Polasky, Stephen; Pennington, Derric; Johnson, Kris A.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Nelson, Erik] Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, Nat Capital Project, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Stanford University,"Polasky, S (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, 1994 Buford Ave,1987 Upper Buford Circle, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",polasky@umn.edu,"Polasky, Stephen/AAC-5341-2019; Nelson, Erik/J-4192-2019","Nelson, Erik/0000-0002-7291-5192","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [0814628] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,57,478,614,24,626,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

I suggest that higher capital costs for cultivators' post-liberalisation increased the pressure to contain wage costs in a region where women form the majority of the agricultural wage labour force. Under such conditions, when women perform both own-cultivation as well as agricultural wage work in the fields of others, they face pressure to restrict bargaining for higher wages, contributing to a widening gender wage gap. To the extent that wages shape intra-household bargaining power, the empowering effect of workforce participation for such women would thus be blunted.

First, we find that the surprise components of both monetary policy actions and statements have important but differing effects on asset prices, with unexpected communication having a much greater impact on longer-term interest rates. Second, both the ECB and the Fed have proven to be equally successful in moving their domestic asset prices using either monetary policy or news shocks. However, the response of the American yield curve to the surprise component of Fed's statements is larger than the reaction of the European term structure to ECB's announcements. This result is intimately related to the amplitude of the policy rate cycle that is much larger in the US than in the euro area combined with the bounded support of the news shock. Third, we analyze the cross-effects and show that the Fed has been more able to move the European interest rates of all maturities than the ECB to move American rates.

One conclusion of the paper is that CSR is on a turning point and it is expected that a new orientation toward theoretical and practical approaches regarding the concept will be developed after this crisis.

Since audit market in Croatia is highly competitive, companies have great possibility of auditor choice. Thereby, the aim of this paper is to empirically investigate association between auditor selection and companies' characteristics on the sample of Croatian listed companies. Our research is based on assumption that companies with different financial and business characteristics demand different type of audit firms. In order to test stated hypotheses multinomial logistic regression is applied. The degree of association between the auditor choice and companies' performance characteristics is measured by following financial ratios: 1) absolute value of total accruals, 2) return on equity (ROE), 3) financial leverage (debt ratio), 4) cash flow ratio and 5) BEX index as overall business excellence measure. Moreover, ownership structure and size of the company as business oriented variables are included. Dependent variable audit firm is categorized into three groups in accordance with their reputation and size: 1) the Big Four audit firms (i.e. PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Ernst&Young, Deloitte and KPMG); 2) midsize audit firms and 3) small audit firms employing only one or two certified auditors. Data necessary for the research are extracted from annual financial statements for the period from 2003 to 2008, available on HANFA database. Results of the research indicate that debt ratio, size and ownership have statistically significant influence in auditor selection.","[Barac, Zeljana Aljinovic; Sodan, Slavko; Vuko, Tina] Fac Econ Split, Accounting Dept, Split 21000, Croatia",,,zbarac@efst.hr; ssodan@efst.hr; tina.vuko@efst.hr,"barac, zeljana aljinovic/D-5779-2017; Sodan, Slavko/D-7503-2014; Vuko, Tina/D-4791-2017","barac, zeljana aljinovic/0000-0002-8090-4186;",,,,,37,2,4,0,18,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

Thus Purchasing Power Parity Doctrine was found to be invalidated over this historical dataset.

There exists no evidence in favour of 'Purchasing Power Parity Doctrine' in the sub-period 1976:1-1993:1.

The results of our two-stage statistical analysis of bilateral HIV/AIDS assistance flows over the period 2002-2007 suggests that recipient need is an important determinant of aid flows.

We exploit state-time variation in the passage of the laws to evaluate the effects of these laws on the educational outcomes of Hispanic childhood immigrants who are not US citizens. Specifically, through the use of individual-level data from the 2001-2005 American Community Surveys supplemented by the 2000 US Census, we estimate the effect of the laws on the probability of attending college for 18- to 24-year-olds who have a high school degree and the probability of dropping out of high school for 16- to 17-year-olds. We find some evidence suggestive of a positive effect of the laws on the college attendance of older Mexican men, although estimated effects of the laws, in general, are not significantly different from zero. We discuss various reasons for the estimated zero effects. Two important considerations are that little time has elapsed since the state laws were passed and that unchanged federal policy on financial aid and legalization for undocumented students may dampen the state laws' benefits. Thus, the longer-run effects of the laws may well differ from the short-run effects presented in this chapter.","[Chin, Aimee; Juhn, Chinhui] Univ Houston, Houston, TX USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston,,achin@uh.edu; cjuhn@uh.edu,,,,,,,25,9,9,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4419-6681-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,63,94,,10.1007/978-1-4419-6682-7_4,0.0,,,32,Economics; Ethnic Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Ethnic Studies,BTU03,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288059300004,0

It describes and evaluates current proposals regarding the role of the central bank as a systemic regulator, the pros and the cons of locating financial supervision in the central bank, and the conflicts and synergies that such an arrangement entails. Once a crisis erupts, central bank liquidity injections constitute a first line of defense. But in the longer term these injections create a trade-off between price and financial stability, and may compromise central bank independence. Problems exposed by the crisis include the growth of a poorly regulated shadow financial system, shortermism in executive compensation packages and consequent adverse incentive effects, the too-big-to-fail problem, procyclicality in the behavior of financial institutions, conflicts of interest in the rating agencies industry and the trade-off between the scope of intermediation through securitization and transparency in the valuation of assets. The paper also discusses international dimensions including international cooperation in regulatory reform and the scope for limiting exchange rate variability. The conclusion points out inherent difficulties in distinguishing ex ante between a fundamentals based expansion and a bubble. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Empirical verification of the existence of harmful tax competition on the field of direct corporate taxation is difficult, but the literature have been tried several methods. In this paper, we analyze the trends in corporate income taxation in the European Union and the way they are related to tax competition. It is preceded by an analysis of both positive and negative aspects that accompany tax competition. Our data indicate that the hypothesis of tax competition generating a lining to the bottom level of taxation is only partially tested empirically, namely for statutory tax rates, and weakly for effective tax rates.

Increasing their college graduation rate is perhaps the most obvious way to foster and accelerate the pace of their economic mobility. At the same time, this is a very challenging public policy goal, partly because such a small percentage of Hispanics presently have a 4-year college degree. Currently, 13% of all Hispanics 25 years and older have graduated from college, compared to 33% of non-Hispanic whites. Not only is scale an issue, but policies must also overcome the paradox that college graduates generally come from college-educated households. According to this view, first-generation college students the first in their family to go to college are different from their socioeconomic and college-going peers in a multitude of ways and will, therefore, have differential educational outcomes. The descriptive analysis in this chapter reveals that first-generation college students of all ethnic backgrounds have lower 4-year completion rates and are also more likely to enroll in community colleges than in 4-year colleges. Such findings are not surprising considering that a multitude of family background factors, such as the emphasis given to learning, have a strong, but difficult to measure, impact on educational outcomes. The analysis shows that Hispanic college students stand out as being primarily first-generation college students-65% of all Hispanics even when compared to blacks (50%). The chapter concludes with a brief discussion of the programs designed to overcome the challenges facing first-generation college students, and hence the issues that simultaneously affect Hispanic college students.","[Gonzalez, Arturo] Off Comptroller Currency, Washington, DC 20219 USA",United States Department of the Treasury; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,,arturo.gonzalez@occ.treas.gov,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4419-6681-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,95,110,,10.1007/978-1-4419-6682-7_5,0.0,,,16,Economics; Ethnic Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Ethnic Studies,BTU03,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288059300005,0

The existing literature can provide several theories, hypotheses and concepts that could potentially help to explain those differences; the outcome of those approaches is the extrapolation of various demand and supply side factors that affect cross-country differences in the size of the sector. The exploratory approach taken in the paper is focused on combining the effect of those factors for the purpose of their empirical verification.

While there are several potentially useful methods to perform the task in question, Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter seems to have remained (despite some serious criticism) the most popular approach over the past decade. In this article I propose a straightforward and easy-to-implement bootstrap procedure for building pointwise and simultaneous confidence intervals around point estimates produced by HP filter. The principle of proposed method can be described as follows: first, we use maximum entropy bootstrap (Vinod, 2004, 2006) to approximate ensemble from which original time series is drawn and then apply the HP filter directly to each bootstrap replication. If necessary, the proposed method can be adapted to allow for uncertainty in the smoothing parameter. Practical usefulness of our approach is demonstrated with an application to the GDP data. Results are encouraging - obtained confidence intervals for the trend and cyclical component are overall plausible thus supplying a researcher with some measure of uncertainty related to HP filtering. Finally, we demonstrate that a former approach to build confidence intervals for HP filter (Gallego and Johnson, 2005) leads to erratic inference for cycle due to the shape-destroying block bootstrap sampling.","[Plasil, Miroslav] Czech Natl Bank, CZ-11503 Prague 1, Czech Republic; [Plasil, Miroslav] Univ Econ, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",Czech National Bank; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Plasil, M (通讯作者)，Czech Natl Bank, Prikope 28, CZ-11503 Prague 1, Czech Republic.",miroslav.plasil@cnb.cz,,,,,,,32,6,6,1,6,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

This might even propagate to the staff the strategic importance of these disciplines, beyond the compliance to laws, and to the requirements of government administration. An illustration of the method is the improvement of corporate operations even during an outsource process. Top management usually decides to outsource an activity to spare at least some of its costs.

This implies that country characteristics are important determinants of aggregate foreign currency exposure. (2) The sources of portfolio home bias have prominent effects on foreign currency exposure, and the robust results support the international diversification puzzle. (3) It is noteworthy that the cross-country and time-series variation in aggregate foreign currency exposure appears to be consistent with the original sin argument.

Such circumstances are prevalent since buyers often use the same input to produce different outputs, and even homogenous outputs are routinely sold through different locations. The typical view is that price discrimination stifles efficiency (and welfare) by resulting in price concessions to less efficient firms. When buyers serve multiple markets, price discrimination leads to price breaks for firms in markets with lower demand. When lower demand markets also have less competition, price discrimination can provide welfare gains by shifting output to less competitive markets.","[Arya, Anil; Mittendorf, Brian] Ohio State Univ, Fisher Coll Business, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Arya, A (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Fisher Coll Business, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",arya_4@fisher.osu.edu; mittendorf_3@fisher.osu.edu,"Mittendorf, Brian/C-9530-2012","Mittendorf, Brian/0000-0002-5182-4240",,,,,18,32,34,0,16,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-1821,,,J IND ECON,J.

However, raw TRI data. fails to transmit accurate information fitted to the publics interest. TRI is a massive and complex data set that, ill its raw form, provides information oil the pounds of toxics released, rather than the risks these releases pose to human health, which is the true quantity of interest. Consequently, raw TRI data needs to be refined and interpreted in terms of health risks by its users, which requires analytical sophistication and substantial data processing. State governments have attempted to increase of the usefulness of the TRI to the general public via two types of policies: (1) selection and dissemination of raw TRI data for plants within the state, and (2) data processing activities producing more refined reports and further data analysis. This study assesses the effectiveness of those two policies, asking how much each contributes to the intended policy outcome of reducing health risks. Our results show that state-level data dissemination efforts lowered the total number of pounds of chemicals released, but had little effect on health risks. State-level data processing efforts, in contrast, did lead to significant reductions in health risks. We conclude that simple dissemination of the data was ineffective (and even counterproductive in some instances), and that the states' data processing efforts have played a critical role in achieving the TRI intended policy goal by providing better information to end users.

Moreover, when a firm changes strategy it is optimal to change the CEO, because the incumbent has a vested interest in seeing the new strategy fail. Even though CEOs have no specific skills in our model, legacy issues can explain the empirical association between CEO and strategy change.","[Casamatta, Catherine; Guembel, Alexander] Univ Toulouse 1, Toulouse Sch Econ, F-31042 Toulouse, France; [Casamatta, Catherine; Guembel, Alexander] Univ Toulouse 1, Inst Adm Entreprises, F-31042 Toulouse, France; [Casamatta, Catherine] Europlace Inst Finance, Paris, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole,"Casamatta, C (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse 1, Toulouse Sch Econ, F-31042 Toulouse, France.",,,,,,,,45,24,29,5,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

Running an adjusted version of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) it finds that systematic risk accounts on average for more than 32% of COE total variance. This implies that potential CAPM mispricing related to undiversified idiosyncratic risk in Latin America has been relatively lower (but absolutely higher) than in United States and other European and Asian stock markets (such as the United Kingdom, Canada or Japan). A first robustness test for the omission of international sources of un-diversifiable risk suggests that both global market and real currencies portfolios do not add significant information to domestic market portfolios. Moreover, a second robustness check offers further evidence that well-diversified portfolios constructed by sorting stocks according to their size and book-to-market ratios a la Fama and French do not improve the goodness of fit in the regressions based on the adjusted version of CAPM.

South African farmers have to contend with low profit margins, and price volatility therefore affects agricultural producers in South Africa to a considerable degree. The autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity/generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH/GARCH) approach is used to quantify the volatility in the price of the July white maize futures contracts that trade on the South African Futures Exchange (SAFEX). Volatility tends to increase from December through the early part of May, which makes the timing of marketing decisions important. As a second sub-objective, linear regression is used to identify the factors that cause changes in volatility over time. The release of new information on local and international growing conditions is found to increase the level of volatility in the price of the July white maize contract. Maize producers should therefore take the release of important information into account when developing their marketing plans for the coming marketing season. The usefulness of put options as a price risk management tool is highlighted by the results of this research.","[Jordaan, Henry] Univ Free State, Dept Agr Econ, Bloemfontein, South Africa",University of the Free State,,,"Jordaan, Henry/AAF-8722-2019; Grove, Bennie/E-5395-2015","Jordaan, Henry/0000-0003-4845-1727; Grove, Bennie/0000-0002-5325-2637",National Research Foundation (NRF),National Research Foundation (NRF),Financial assistance provided by the National Research Foundation (NRF) is gratefully acknowledged.

The liquidity preference hypothesis predicts higher expected returns for bonds with longer times to maturity; the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) implies higher expected returns for stocks with higher betas; and standard asset pricing models imply that the pricing kernel is declining in market returns. The full set of implications of monotonicity is generally not exploited in empirical work, however. This paper proposes new and simple ways to test for monotonicity in financial variables and compares the proposed tests with extant alternatives such as r-tests, Bonferroni bounds, and multivariate inequality tests through empirical applications and simulations.

The justifications for these taxes range from punishing those deemed to have caused or unduly profited from the crisis, to addressing the budgetary costs of the crisis, to better aligning banks' and bank executives' incentives in light of the broader social costs and benefits of their actions. Although there is a long-standing literature on corrective, or Pigouvian, taxation, most of it has been applied to environmental externalities, and the externalities that arise from the actions of financial institutions are structurally different. This paper reviews the justifications for special taxes on financial institutions, and addresses what kinds of taxes are most likely to achieve the various stated objectives, which often are in conflict. It then critically assesses the principal taxes that have been proposed or enacted to date: financial transactions taxes, bonus taxes, and taxes on firms in the financial sector based on size, bank liabilities, or excess profits.","[Shackelford, Douglas A.] Univ N Carolina, Kenan Flagler Business Sch, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Shackelford, Douglas A.; Slemrod, Joel] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Shaviro, Daniel N.] NYU, Sch Law, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Slemrod, Joel] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; National Bureau of Economic Research; New York University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Shackelford, DA (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Kenan Flagler Business Sch, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA.",doug_shack@unc.edu; shavirod@exchange.law.nyu.edu; jslemrod@umich.edu,"Slemrod, Joel/AAJ-5709-2020",,,,,,32,26,27,0,13,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

This article inquires the necessity of training agriculture and rural development specialists within Lower Danube Region in the context of cross-border cooperation between Romania and Bulgaria. This research starts by analysing the European and national legal framework of adult training in those two fields. Subsequently, the main premises and advantages of those activities were emphasized. It is good to mention that the Academy of Economic Studies in Bucharest, Romania, and the D. Tsenov Academy of Economics in Svishtov, Bulgaria, proposed themselves to cooperate in the field of human resources development - common development of skills and knowledge. The legal base exists as the Romania-Bulgaria Cross-border Cooperation Programme 2007-2013 is enforced. Furthermore, a four years comparative study of the number of persons trained for the main jobs in rural area, including farmer, in Lower Danube Region was conducted. All these led to the idea that it is necessary to continue and to stress adult training of farmers and rural specialists as a solution for rural economy development and social welfare. Also, comparative analysis of supply and demand of professionals in the field of agriculture was elaborated. The main educational programs in training agriculture and rural development specialists were identified and some problems and perspectives were worked out. This research can be considered as a first step of future deeper and profound collaboration of Tsenov Academy of Economics, Svishtov and the Academy of Economic Studies, Bucharest in terms of creation of common Romanian-Bulgarian Research Area, as a part of European Research Area (ERA). It includes joint knowledge and skills development through cross-border linkages and exchanges between the universities, in accordance with Romania - Bulgaria Cross-Border Cooperation Programme 2007-2013.","[Istudor, Nicolae; Manole, Victor; Ignat, Raluca; Petrescu, Irina Elena] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Bogdanova, Margarita] D Tsenov Acad Econ, Svishtov, Bulgaria",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Tsenov Academy of Economics,"Istudor, N (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",,"Petrescu, Irina-Elena S/J-8044-2017; Istudor, Nicolae/AAW-2872-2020; Bogdanova, Margarita/C-3917-2019","Bogdanova, Margarita/0000-0003-0558-5274; Istudor, Nicolae/0000-0002-4581-4548",,,,,22,5,6,1,37,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2010,12.0,,,,4,,761,784,,,,,,24,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,699CQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285641900004,0

Next, we consider consequences for plan liabilities if aggregate mortality declines unexpectedly faster than is predicted by a putatively unbiased projection.

In this article, we examine whether a similar effect prevails in corporate bond markets. After controlling for common bond-level, firm-level, and macroeconomic variables, we find evidence that bonds of firms with higher dispersion demand significantly higher credit spreads than otherwise similar bonds and that changes in dispersion reliably predict changes in credit spreads. This evidence suggests a limited role of short-sale constraints in our corporate bond data sets.

We compared three consecutive creative executions of the world-famous Sony Bravia ads (Balls, Paints, and Play-Doh). We were looking for left hemispheric dominance, which according to the adopted theoretical model, indicated approach reactions of respondents to incoming stimulation. We ha ve found that dominant reactions were present only in response to one of the tested ads - Balls. Target group respondents reacted in such way to emotional part of the ad, as well as to its informational part (including product-benefit, product, and brand exposure scenes). No similar pattern was found for the remaining two ads. It yields a conclusion that frontal asymmetry measure may be a diagnostic tool in examining the potential of advertisements to generate approach related tendencies.

However, Roll (1992) shows that such portfolios are generally suboptimal because they do not belong to the mean-variance frontier and are thus overly risky. Our paper proposes an appealing method to lessen this suboptimality that involves the objective of selecting a portfolio from the set of portfolios that have minimum TEV for various levels of ex-ante alpha, which we refer to as the alpha-TEV frontier. Since practitioners commonly use ex-post alpha to assess the performance of managers, the use of this frontier aligns the objectives of managers with how their performance is evaluated.

This coherence is brought about by restricting acceptable behavior of agents to dynamic utility maximization and rational expectations. The problem of the DSGE-models (and more generally of macroeconomic models based on rational expectations) is that they assume extraordinary cognitive capabilities of individual agents. In addition, these models need a lot of ad-hoc assumptions to make them fit the data. I argue that we need models that take into account the limited cognitive abilities of agents. One can introduce rationality in such models by assuming trial and error learning.

Eight lessons from Japan,JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PREMIUM; CRISIS,"During the financial crisis that started in 2007, the U.S. government has used a variety of tools to try to rehabilitate the U.S. banking industry. Many of those strategies were also used in Japan to combat its banking problems in the 1990s. There are also a surprising number of other similarities between the current U.S. crisis and the recent Japanese crisis. The Japanese policies were only partially successful in recapitalizing the banks until the economy finally started to recover in 2003. From these unsuccessful attempts, we derive eight lessons. In light of these eight lessons, we assess the policies the U.S. has pursued. The U.S. has ignored three of the lessons and it is too early to evaluate the U.S. policies with respect to four of the others. So far, the U.S. has avoided Japan's problem of having impaired banks prop up zombie firms. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It first aims to assess the capacity of fiscal and monetary policy to reduce or eliminate the negative welfare effects of an unanticipated productivity shock affecting some or all of the sectors in each country. Second, it evaluates the possible gains from international monetary cooperation as well as the impact of active fiscal policy on the welfare performance of monetary policy. The setup also allows for international asymmetry concerning the uncertainty over the shocks. The results show that monetary and fiscal policies are efficient tools of stabilization and under several conditions they can replicate the flexible-price equilibrium. However, their welfare performance is not necessarily increased when both monetary and fiscal policies react to shocks at the national level. The existence of bilateral gains from monetary cooperation depends on the degree of asymmetry concerning the uncertainty over the shocks.","[Koenig, Gilbert] Univ Strasbourg, Bur Econ Theor & Appl, Strasbourg, France; [Zeyneloglu, Irem] Galatasaray Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",Universite de Lorraine; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Galatasaray University,"Koenig, G (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, Bur Econ Theor & Appl, Strasbourg, France.",,"ZEYNELOGLU, IREM/AAC-2480-2020","ZEYNELOGLU, IREM/0000-0001-5637-1992",,,,,9,2,2,1,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0036-9292,,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

Thus, this model enables us detecting insider transactions by applying stock return time series. We show that when there is an insider transaction in the market, time series can be derived as an ARMA(1,1) process having closed solution coefficients. For validation of the model, we test publicly released insider transactions and reverse takeover events using the minute-by-minute stock price data. The selected events show higher pass rate of the detection criteria than the current detection system which shows that our model produces smaller Type II error than the existing post transaction-based cumulative abnormal return model.

Yet relatively little is known about wide-scale interventions designed to improve children's behavior and mental health. This is the first nationally representative study of the provision, financing, and impact of school-site mental health services for young children. Elementary school counselors are school employees who provide mental health services to all types of students, typically meeting with students one-on-one or in small groups. Given counselors' nonrandom assignment to schools, it is particularly challenging to estimate the impact of these counselors on student outcomes. First, cross-state differences in policies provide descriptive evidence that students in states with more aggressive elementary counseling policies make greater test score gains and are less likely to report internalizing or externalizing problem behaviors compared to students with similar observed characteristics in similar schools in other states. Next, difference-in-differences estimates exploiting both the timing and the targeted grade levels of states' counseling policy changes provide evidence that elementary counselors substantially influence teachers' perceptions of school climate. The adoption of state-funded counselor subsidies or minimum counselor-student ratios reduces the fraction of teachers reporting that their instruction suffers due to student misbehavior and reduces the fractions reporting problems with students physically fighting each other, cutting class, stealing, or using drugs. These findings imply that there may be substantial public and private benefits derived from providing additional elementary school counselors.

This study suggests that a policy window may be opening through which babyboomers can advocate for a range of driver training, roadway and vehicle improvements, expansion and enhancement of traditional public transportation and community transport options, improvements in accessibility and pedestrian infrastructure, and supportive land use and housing policies that would allow older people to drive safely longer, and, find meaningful mobility options when they can no longer drive.

Controlling for selection, we find that firms with bank financing grow faster than similar firms without bank financing and that our results are not driven by bank corruption or the selection of firms that have accessed the formal financial system.

This can be done by defining sophisticated investors as those who meet the stringent participation requirements of the private equity market. Our results show private equity issuing firms overstate their earnings in the quarter preceding private equity placement announcements and that sophisticated investors do not ask for a fair discount when purchasing the shares of the private issuing firms. We also find evidence showing that the reversal of the effects of pre-issue earnings management is a significant determinant of the long-term performance of private issues.

Although RE can bring socio-economic and environmental benefits, its implementation faces a number of obstacles, especially in non-OECD countries. One of these obstacles is financing: underdeveloped financial sectors are unable to efficiently channel loans to RE producers. The influence of financial sector development on the use of renewable energy resources is confirmed in panel data estimations on up to 119 non-OECD countries for 1980-2006. Financial intermediation, in particular commercial banking, has a significant positive effect on the amount of RE produced, and the impact is especially large when we consider non-hydropower RE such as wind, solar, geothermal and biomass. There is also evidence that the development of the RE sector has picked up significantly in the period since the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol.","[Brunnschweiler, Christa N.] ETH, Ctr Econ Res, CER ETH, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Brunnschweiler, Christa N.] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Oxford,"Brunnschweiler, CN (通讯作者)，ETH, Ctr Econ Res, CER ETH, Zuerichbergstr 18, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",cbrunnschweiler@ethz.ch,,"Brunnschweiler Valente, Christa/0000-0002-8610-6433",,,,,47,183,191,4,43,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Though geographically diversifying bank M&As have the potential to reduce the risk of bank insolvency, they also have the potential to increase that risk due to the increase in risk-taking incentives by bank managers and stockholders following these transactions. This paper empirically investigates whether cross-border bank M&As increase or decrease the risk of acquiring banks as captured by changes in acquirers' yield spreads. This paper also investigates how differences in the institutional environments between bidder and target countries affect changes in yield spreads following M&A announcements. The study finds that bondholders, in general, perceive cross-border bank M&As as risk-increasing activities, unlike domestic bank mergers. Specifically, on average, yield spreads increase by 4.13 basis points following the announcement of cross-border M&As. This study also finds that these yield spreads are significantly affected by the differences in investor-protection and deposit insurance environments between the transacting countries. However, the study does not find that the regulatory and supervisory environment in the home countries of the transacting parties significantly affects the changes in yield spreads. The overall evidence suggests that regulators should judge the relative environment in both the home and the host countries in evaluating the associated risks of an active multinational financial institution and in setting the sufficiency of the banks' reserve positions.","[Choi, Sungho] Chonnam Natl Univ, Kwangju, South Korea; [Francis, Bill B.; Hasan, Iftekhar] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Troy, NY 12181 USA",Chonnam National University; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,"Choi, S (通讯作者)，Chonnam Natl Univ, Kwangju, South Korea.",hasan@rpi.edu,"Hasan, Iftekhar/IUM-3182-2023","Hasan, Iftekhar/0000-0003-2469-0539",,,,,56,17,18,1,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Our sample was collected by a mortgage technology firm, and consists of almost 1.1 million transactions during the boom-bust cycle since 2000. Our hedonic regressions include new spatial models that capture correlations within submarkets (using zip codes as proxies) and allow temporal asymmetry. Compared to a repeat-sales price index constructed from the same data, the hedonic indexes indicate that the market peaked about 11 months later in Los Angeles and about 2 months earlier in San Diego, show less pre-peak appreciation and post-peak depreciation in low-tier housing and more pre-peak appreciation in high-tier housing.

In the case of emerging markets, central banks can often ill afford to neglect exchange rate developments when setting monetary policy because of a high pass-through of nominal exchange rate changes to domestic prices. As a result, interventions and monetary policy are interrelated, a hypothesis that has been overlooked in the literature. To bridge this gap, this paper includes monetary policy indicators in the estimation of intervention reaction functions for Brazil and the Czech Republic since the adoption of inflation targeting. Our main finding is that interventions take place independently of the contemporaneous monetary policy setting in Brazil, but not in the Czech Republic, where both policies appear to be coordinated.","[Gnabo, Jean-Yves] Univ Namur, Louvain Sch Management, FUNDP, CeReFiM, B-5000 Namur, Belgium; [de Mello, Luiz; Moccero, Diego] OECD, Dept Econ, F-75775 Paris, France",Universite Catholique Louvain; University of Namur; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Gnabo, JY (通讯作者)，Univ Namur, Louvain Sch Management, FUNDP, CeReFiM, 8 Rempart de la Vierge, B-5000 Namur, Belgium.",jygnabo@fundp.ac.be; luiz.demello@oecd.org; diego.moccero@oecd.org,,,,,,,44,3,7,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

These paper analyses vertical alliances from the perspective of 98 traditional fashion retailers and 104 fashion manufacturers. Based on a process oriented value chain approach, the results show how primary market and supply chain oriented value chain activities are viewed in the context of alliances, particularly in terms of own competence, perceived potential for co-operation, and the level of co-operation achieved. The data show that retailers and manufacturers see co-operation potentials in value chain activities with both low and high levels of own competence. Secondly the data show that co-operation potentials identified by both partners and the co-operation levels achieved differ. Third the data show the relation between the co-operation levels achieved in the value chain activities and the degree of success in turnover, costs, and time-to-market.","[Swoboda, Bernhard] Univ Trier, D-54286 Trier, Germany; [Pop, Nicolae Al.] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Dabija, Dan-Cristian] Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania",Universitat Trier; Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Swoboda, B (通讯作者)，Univ Trier, D-54286 Trier, Germany.",b.swoboda@uni-trier.de,"Dabija, Dan-Cristian/I-8101-2012; Pop, Nicolae Alexandru/L-9045-2016","Dabija, Dan-Cristian/0000-0002-8265-175X; Pop, Nicolae Alexandru/0000-0003-4565-4879",,,,,53,17,17,0,36,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2010,12.0,28,,,,,634,649,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,617XA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279314000026,0

Over 1900 new public firms enter high-tech manufacturing between 1970 and 2004; they are increasingly R&D intensive and rely extensively on public equity finance in the 1980s and 1990s. We estimate dynamic R&D models and find a strong link between public equity finance and R&D for new entrants, but not established entrants or incumbents. Further, recent cohorts of public entrants have a substantial economic impact: by 2000, recent public entrants account for almost half of high-tech sales and more than half of R&D. Variation in the availability of public equity finance has a marked impact on entrant R&D and the rate at which entrants take market share from incumbents. Our findings identify a key channel through which public equity markets facilitate the process of creative destruction. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The other possible determinants offer relatively small additional explanatory power. It is also found that China's capital flight responds differently to the components of covered interest differentials and to the positive and negative components of these variables.

Our main finding is that the effectiveness of outside directors depends on the cost of acquiring information about the firm: when the cost of acquiring information is low, performance increases when outsiders are added to the board, and when the cost of information is high, performance worsens when outsiders are added to the board. The estimates provide some of the cleanest estimates to date that board independence matters, and the finding that board effectiveness depends on information cost supports a nascent theoretical literature emphasizing information asymmetry. We also find that firms compose their boards as if they understand that outsider effectiveness varies with information costs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We add a third level, namely institutional bargaining power. We define this as bargaining power which one party freely derives from unequal social norms. In the bargaining literature there is a common paradoxical finding, namely that more access to and control over individual resources sometimes decreases rather than increases women's bargaining outcomes. With household survey data from Ethiopia and making use of multilevel modeling and an aggregate model with interaction terms, we suggest that this paradoxical effect can be explained by very unequal gender norms-gendered institutions - at the group level. In our case, we used ethnic groups to show that in groups where gender norms are very unequal, individual and household level bargaining power variables effects are mediated by ethnic-gendered institutions. A policy implication of our findings is that gender policy may become more effective with shifting the emphasis from a largely individual approach to an institutional approach to support women's empowerment.

Empirical results are consistent with this explanation. The return premiums to low leverage and low distress are significant in raw returns, and even stronger in risk-adjusted returns. When in distress, low-leverage firms suffer more than high-leverage firms as measured by a deterioration in accounting operating performance and heightened exposure to systematic risk. The connection between return premiums and distress costs is apparent in subperiod evidence. Both are small or insignificant prior to 1980 and larger and significant thereafter.

Using data from rural Ethiopia, the analysis finds no relationship between participation in microfinance programs and the use of technologies or consumption growth among the poorest households even though the use of certain technologies, like fertilizer, contributes to their asset accumulation over time. For other households, microfinance has positive effects on both consumption and asset growth as well as on the use of improved technology. The findings imply variation in constraints faced by different classes of poor households and suggest the value of asset-based poverty classifications in identifying target groups for poverty interventions.

This paper develops a sequential game framework to explore the stability of international climate agreements allowing for multiple renegotiations. We analyse how the incentives to reach an international climate agreement in the first period will be impacted by the prospect of further negotiations in later periods and by the punishment options related to renegotiations. For this purpose we introduce a dynamic model of coalition formation with twelve world regions that captures the key features of the climate-economy impacts of greenhouse gas emissions. For a model with one round of renegotiations we find that a coalition of China and the United States is the unique renegotiation proof equilibrium. In a game with more frequent renegotiations we find that the possibility to punish defecting players helps to stabilise larger coalitions in early stages of the game. Consequently, several renegotiation proof equilibria emerge that outperform the coalition of China and USA in terms of abatement levels and global payoff. The Grand Coalition, however, is unstable.","[Weikard, Hans-Peter; Dellink, Rob; van Ierland, Ekko] Wageningen Univ, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Dellink, Rob] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Weikard, HP (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",hans-peter.weikard@wur.nl,"Weikard, Hans-Peter/O-1120-2013","Weikard, Hans-Peter/0000-0002-5209-9845; Dellink, Rob/0000-0002-9892-2278",,,,,40,15,15,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Using a large sample of securities lawsuits from 1996 to 2005, we show that institutional investors are more likely to serve as the lead plaintiff for lawsuits with certain characteristics. After controlling for these determinants of having an institutional lead plaintiff, we show that securities class actions with institutional owners as lead plaintiffs are less likely to be dismissed and have larger monetary settlements than securities class actions with individual lead plaintiffs. This effect exists for various types of institutions including public pension funds. We also find that, after the lawsuit filings, defendant firms with institutional lead plaintiffs experience greater improvement in their board independence than defendant firms with individual lead plaintiffs.

Our main ownership stability measures include ownership persistence and the time-lengths over which investors hold non-zero shares or maintain their shareholding. We find that there is a positive relationship between firm performance and institutional ownership stability, accounting for the shareholding proportion. This relationship is robust to the employment of ownership turnover measures used in the literature and consistent with the view that stable institutional investors play an effective role in monitoring. When we disaggregate institutional investors into pressure-insensitive and pressure-sensitive categories, we find that stable shareholding of each group has a positive impact on performance, with the first group exerting a larger effect.

Spending decisions are determined by negotiation between local representatives in the centralized legislature. If an agreement cannot be reached, policy is determined non-cooperatively by local governments.

Moreover, the effect of bank loans through the linkage program has been larger than that of bank loans only. Funds from saving and deposits have had the largest effect on the expansion of BPR credit.

Furthermore, our access to individual-level data with census tract identifiers allows us to separately identify recent in-migrants and long-term residents. Our results indicate that, on average, the demographic flows associated with the gentrification of urban neighborhoods during the 1990s are not consistent with displacement and harm to minority households.

This holds over a range of threshold levels and refund rates. We test whether thresholds perform better if they are endogenously chosen, i.e., whether a threshold is approved in a referendum, because voting may facilitate coordination due to signaling and commitment effects. We find that voting does have signaling and commitment effects, but they are not strong enough to significantly improve the efficiency of thresholds.","[Tyran, Jean-Robert] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Tyran, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Bldg 26, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",jean-robert.tyran@econ.ku.dk,"Sausgruber, Rupert/N-8478-2018; Tyran, Jean-Robert/C-5736-2017","Sausgruber, Rupert/0000-0002-0769-862X; Tyran, Jean-Robert/0000-0002-2958-667X",,,,,20,14,14,0,12,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,MAR,2010,66.0,1,,,,,34,64,,10.1628/001522110X503370,0.0,,,31,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,603KU,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000278208300004,0

These concepts enable us to forge a previously missing link between Granger (G-)causality and structural causality by showing that, given a corresponding conditional form of exogeneity, G-causality holds if and only if a corresponding form of structural causality holds. We introduce a variety of structurally informative extensions of G-causality and provide their structural characterizations. Of importance for applications is the structural characterization of finite-order G-causality, which forms the basis for most empirical work. We show that conditional exogeneity is necessary for valid structural inference and prove that, in the absence of structural causality, conditional exogeneity is equivalent to G noncausality. These characterizations hold for both structural VARs and natural experiments. We propose practical new G-causality and conditional exogeneity tests and describe their use in testing for structural causality. We illustrate with studies of oil and gasoline prices, monetary policy and industrial production, and stock returns and macroeconomic announcements.","[White, Halbert; Lu, Xun] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"White, H (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",hwhite@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,56,34,39,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

However, endogenous growth theory does not explain how or why spillovers occur. This paper presents a model that shows how growth depends on knowledge accumulation and its diffusion through both incumbents and entrepreneurial activities. We claim that entrepreneurs are one missing link in converting knowledge into economically relevant knowledge. Implementing different regression techniques for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries during 1981 to 2002 provides surprisingly robust evidence that primarily entrepreneurs contributed to growth and that the importance of entrepreneurs increased in the 1990s. A Granger test confirms that causality goes in the direction from entrepreneurs to growth. The results indicate that policies facilitating entrepreneurship are an important tool to enhance knowledge diffusion and promote economic growth.","[Braunerhjelm, Pontus] Royal Inst Technol, Dept Transport & Econ, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Acs, Zoltan J.] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Audretsch, David B.] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Carlsson, Bo] Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",Royal Institute of Technology; George Mason University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University,"Braunerhjelm, P (通讯作者)，Royal Inst Technol, Dept Transport & Econ, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",pontusb@infra.kth.se; zacs@gmu.edu; daudrets@indiana.edu; Bo.Carlsson@case.edu,"acs, zoltan j/I-5496-2013","braunerhjelm, pontus/0000-0003-0218-7924",,,,,51,293,338,8,127,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Importantly, this intertemporal association is driven by firms with high levels of information asymmetry. These firms are more prone to adverse selection costs and thus have more to gain by issuing equity after a narrowing of the information gap between managers and investors.

Other tests also fail to support the limits of arbitrage argument for the survival of overvaluation anomalies and suggest that at least some of the factor premiums for size, book-to-market, and momentum are unrelated to irrationality protected by limits to arbitrage.","[Brav, Alon] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Li, Si] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada",Duke University; Wilfrid Laurier University,"Brav, A (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",,,,,,,,41,46,52,1,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

This outperformance arises from outsized performance outside of the venture capital firms' office locations, including in peripheral locations. If the goal of state and local policy makers is to encourage venture capital investment, outperformance of non-local investments suggests that policy makers might want to mitigate costs associated with established venture capitalists investing in their geographies rather than encouraging the establishment of new venture capital firms.

We examine how this influences traders to allocate their trading activities over time. Traders employed at a U.

Employed traders intensify their trading at the very last moment to increase their ensuing compensation payout. We label this behavior the payday effect. The payday effect is not driven by a change in market trading conditions, or due to traders possessing more information. Instead, we show that this behavior is highly dependent upon a trader's cumulative income within the performance evaluation period.","[Garvey, Ryan] Duquesne Univ, Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15282 USA; [Wu, Fei] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Nanchang, Peoples R China",Duquesne University; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics,"Garvey, R (通讯作者)，Duquesne Univ, Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15282 USA.",Garvey@duq.edu,,,,,,,39,4,4,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1542-7560,,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

The authors analyze an exogenous support (the tools which are based on regional development sources) as well as endogenous sources of development (local initiatives and their strategies). The comparison deals with one village in Czechia and one village in Brandenburg region. This selection is based on similarities in demographic development and their current state, development of functions of these villages and their position in settlement structure, and also similarities within their visions for future development. It was considered that development of the German village would have a stronger exogenous accent, because the municipality was under heavy influence of regional reform, which implied a loss of independence and also an erosion of the local identity. The village has been firmly embedded in the German regional policy for the last 20 years. Contrary to this, development of the Czech village has started in 1990s with regaining independence, accompanied with a significant revival of local initiatives. However, external support from regional development sources is (in comparison with the German representative) negligible due to its short existence in the Czech Republic. Goal of the comparative study of these two villages with the similar structural features and with the common vision for development (but with different social context of actual development), is to unveil simultaneous effects of local and extra-local forces, which ensure that the endogenous sources are not used only for inner-development, but also for exchange and relations with external setting. The paper therefore aims to support validity of the neo-endogenous approach, which puts together endogenous and exogenous features in rural development. Empirical observation in the both localities is based on combination of different research techniques, such as documents study, observation and interviewing.","[Hudeckova, Helena; Pancova, Lenka; Sevcikova, Adela] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Humanities, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Hudecková, H (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Humanities, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",hudeckova@pef.czu.cz; pancova@pef.czu.cz; sevcikovava@pef.czu.cz,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2123-6,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2010,,,,,,,275,282,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA6AE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000337077600031,0

As a consequence, in the coalition operations, the multinational logistic support is increasing during the lower intensity stage, while in the alliance operations, due to the multinational mechanisms in place, it appears since at the commencement.

To analyze the relationships between income diversification and other farm's and household's specific factors, an econometric model has been estimated based on a comprehensive survey data. The results show that the main economic incentive for a farm's diversification is the expected income increase, whereas risk minimization is less important. The access to resources (labor, capital) is an important requirement for tapping alternative economic activities. The formal agricultural education of the farmer is a significant factor: The higher his education the stronger is the tendency towards diversification.

The variance risk is manifest in two salient features of financial returns: stochastic volatility and jumps. The pricing of these two components is analyzed in a general semiparametric framework. The key empirical results imply that investors' fears of future jumps are especially sensitive to recent jump activity and that their willingness to pay for protection against jumps increases significantly immediately after the occurrence of jumps. This in turn suggests that time-varying risk aversion, as previously documented in the literature, is primarily driven by large, or extreme, market moves. The dynamics of risk-neutral jump intensity extracted from deep out-of-the-money put options confirms these findings.","Northwestern Univ, JL Kellogg Grad Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Todorov, V (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, JL Kellogg Grad Sch Management, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",v-todorov@kellogg.northwestern.edu,"Todorov, Viktor/KCX-9394-2024","Todorov, Viktor/0000-0002-2360-7812",,,,,44,136,159,0,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

In the past rural households produced most of their own food, but recent studies have shown an increase in dependence on market purchases by both urban and rural households, in some cases reaching 90% of the food supplies. Food expenditures can account for as much as 60-80% of total household income for low-income households in some parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Subsistence/smallholder agriculture can play an important role in reducing the vulnerability of rural and urban food-insecure households, improving livelihoods, and helping to mitigate high food price inflation. There is a need to significantly increase the productivity of subsistence/smallholder agriculture and ensure long-term food security. This can be achieved by encouraging farmers to pursue sustainable intensification of production through the use of improved inputs. This will require a dramatic increase in the use of fertiliser, organic inputs and conservation investments, combined with the development of well-functioning input and output markets to help farmers acquire and use improved inputs, market their (surplus) output and reduce transaction costs and risks. Increased productivity will reduce pressure on marginal lands, as the intensification of cultivated land will reduce pressure to crop fragile marginal lands. There is a need to determine methods of identifying cost-effective ways to improve access to inputs by, among other things, improving delivery, and assisting farmers to earn cash to purchase inputs and invest in infrastructure, thereby improving food security.",,,,mbaiphethi@hsrc.ac.za; pjacobs@hsrc.ac.za,,"JACOBS, PETER T/0000-0001-5142-9059",,,,,45,143,185,1,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,DEC,2009,48.0,4,,,,,459,482,,10.1080/03031853.2009.9523836,0.0,,,24,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,586UM,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000276939000006,0

To that end, we Study the short-term anticipation and response of U.S. stock, Treasury, and corporate bond markets to the first release Of Surprise U.S. macroeconomic information. Specifically, we focus on the impact of these announcements not only on the level, but also on the volatility and comovement of those assets' returns. We do so by estimating several extensions of the parsimonious multivariate GARCH-DCC model of Engle (2002) for the excess holding-period returns Oil seven portfolios of these asset classes. We find that both the process of price formation in each of those financial markets and their interaction appear to be driven by fundamentals. Yet Our analysis reveals a statistically and economically significant dichotomy between the reaction of the stock and bond markets to the arrival of unexpected fundamental information. We also show that the conditional mean, volatility, and comovement among stock. Treasury, and corporate bond returns react asymmetrically to the information content of these surprise announcements. Overall, the above results shed new light on the mechanisms by which new information is incorporated into prices within and across U.S. financial markets.","[Brenner, Menachem; Subrahmanyam, Marti] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Pasquariello, Paolo] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",New York University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Brenner, M (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, 44 W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA.",mbrenner@stern.nyu.edu; ppasquar@bus.umich.edu; msubrahm@stern.nyu.edu,"Pasquariello, Paolo/A-1143-2007",,,,,,62,82,91,0,45,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

Existing studies find support for this hypothesis because they fail to control for the presence of omitted variables. Controlling for these factors either by including country fixed effects in a linear model or by including parameterized random effects in a nonlinear double hazard model removes the correlation between income and the likelihood of transitions to and from democratic regimes. In addition, the estimated fixed effects from the linear model are related to historical factors that affect both the level of income per capita and the likelihood of democracy in a country. This evidence is consistent with the idea that events during critical historical junctures can lead to divergent political-economic development paths, some leading to prosperity and democracy, others to relative poverty and non-democracy.

A key reason for congestion is that an airline schedules its flights without regard to the costs imposed on other airlines and their passengers. As a result, during some time intervals, airlines schedule more Rights to and from an airport than that airport can accommodate and flights are delayed. This paper explores how a specific market-based proposal by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which includes the use of auctions to determine the right to arrive or depart in a specific time interval at airports in the New York City area, might be used as part of a strategy to mitigate delays and congestion. By explaining the underlying economic theory and key arguments with minimal technical jargon, the paper allows those with little formal training in economics to understand the fundamental issues associated with the FAA's controversial proposal. Moreover, the basics of the proposed auction process, known as a combinatorial auction, and value capture are also explained.","[Cohen, Jeffrey P.] Univ Hartford, Barney Sch Business, Hartford, CT 06117 USA; [Coughlin, Cletus C.; Ott, Lesli S.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA; [Cohen, Jeffrey P.] Lincoln Inst Land Policy, Lincoln, NE USA",University of Hartford; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Cohen, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Hartford, Barney Sch Business, Hartford, CT 06117 USA.",,"Coughlin, Cletus/K-6860-2016","Coughlin, Cletus/0000-0002-8304-2796; Cohen, Jeffrey/0000-0001-5467-7584",,,,,25,4,4,1,5,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

If the co-op housing market is efficient, the present value of co-op rental payments due to underlying debt obligations of the cooperative should be fully reflected in the sales price. However, a one hundred kronor increase in the present value of future rents only leads to an approximately 75 kronor reduction in the sales price. These inefficiencies are larger at the lower end of the housing market and in poorer, less educated regions and appear to reflect both liquidity constraints and the existence of more 'sophisticated' buyers in higher educated areas. Overall, our findings suggest that there is some systematic failure to properly discount the future stream of rent payments relative to the up front sales price.

We demonstrate that these differences in wage differentials arise naturally as a compensating variation in Rosen's theoretical model of inter-city wages. For example, if the income elasticity of demand for housing services is less than unity, cities with higher house prices will have smaller money wage differentials between low and high skill workers. This result has no implications for differences in either absolute or relative real productivity or welfare of unskilled workers. Similarly, changes in the amenity of an urban area may result in changes in relative wages of skilled and unskilled workers with no implications for real productivity or welfare differentials. Empirical tests in which housing cost differentials are added as a determinant of inter-city differences in an intra-urban wage differential model provide empirical confirmation of the theoretical expectations. It appears that intra-urban money wage differentials, differences in the quality of life, and variation in the cost of living in each city are jointly determined variables just as Rosen's model of inter-city wage differentials predicts.

That result does not, however, justify negative conclusions about NK analysis, for a different criterion is logically satisfactory. It is that, to be plausible, a RE solution must satisfy the property of least-squares learnability. Adoption of this criterion serves to justify in principle the bulk of current mainstream analysis.

Our baseline model is a variant of the Calvo model in which firms observe the underlying nominal shocks with noise. In this model, the response of prices is pinned down by three parameters: the precision of available information about the nominal shock, the frequency of price adjustment, and the degree of strategic complementarity, in pricing decisions. This result synthesizes the broader lessons of the pertinent literature. However, this synthesis provides only a partial view of the role of incomplete information. Once one allows for more general information structures than those used in previous work, one cannot quantify the degree of price inertia without data on the dynamics of higher-order beliefs, or of the agents' forecasts of inflation. We highlight this with three extensions of our baseline model, all of which break the tight connection between the precision of information and higher-order beliefs featured in previous work.

However, this literature has ignored the concern that firms with better growth prospects are more vulnerable to bank rent extraction. This paper points out that funding competition from new equity as an effective natural mechanism solves this important concern. Using Japanese data from 1983 to 1997, we show that the relationship between loan-to-debt ratio and growth, while starting significantly negative (consistent with holdup theory), turns significantly positive towards the high end of the growth spectrum. We confirm that high-growth firms raise more new equity than do low growth firms and use more equity relative to bonds in external finance. This is consistent with a generalized Myers-Majluf framework. These results suggest that for high growth firms, when competition from public debt lessens due to increased growth-based valuations, competition from new equity steps in to restrain bank rent extraction.

J,"Dinan, TM",,,,"Dinan, Terry M.",,,Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions with a Tax or a Cap: Implications for Efficiency and Cost Effectiveness,NATIONAL TAX JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,UNCERTAINTY,"This paper compares a tax on greenhouse gas emissions with a cap-and-trade program for reducing those emissions. The comparison is made on the basis of two criteria: economic efficiency and cost effectiveness. If there were an accepted measure of the marginal benefit of reducing a ton of greenhouse gas emissions, a tax would clearly be advantageous from an efficiency perspective. Comparing the two policies on the basis of cost effectiveness is more complicated. This paper defines the characteristics of a cost-minimizing price path and then examines the ability of an adjustable tax and two alternative designs of a cap-and-trade program to create such a price path.","Congress Budget Off, Washington, DC 20515 USA",Congressional Budget Office,"Dinan, TM (通讯作者)，Congress Budget Off, Washington, DC 20515 USA.",,,"Dinan, Terry/0000-0002-6831-7798",,,,,21,3,5,0,9,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

The results depend crucially on the assumed data generating process for hours per capita. We show that the standard measure of hours per capita and productivity have significant low-frequency movements that are the source of the conflicting results. Hodrick-Prescott (HP)-filtered hours per capita produce results consistent with those obtained when hours are assumed to have a unit root. We show that important sources of the low-frequency movements in the standard measure are sectoral shifts in hours and the changing age composition of the working-age population. When we control for these low-frequency components to determine the effect of technology shocks on hours using long-run restrictions we get one consistent answer: hours decline in the short run in response to a positive technology shock. We further extend the analysis by examining the effects of demographic controls on the impulse responses to investment-specific technology shocks.

Both estimated policy rate responses and FOMC transcripts are consistent with intermediate targeting of monetary aggregates throughout the Great Inflation of the 1970s. The unpublished FOMC targets for M1 growth are tabulated. Empirical results support an effective inflation target of roughly 7% in the 1970s and 3% thereafter.

However, this is primarily a small firms effect, because for large firms the excess returns of the arbitrage portfolio that is long on the low EVHC stocks and short on the high EVHC stocks is zero.

J,"Chauvet, L; Guillaumont, P",,,,"Chauvet, Lisa; Guillaumont, Patrick",,,"Aid, Volatility, and Growth Again: When Aid Volatility Matters and When it Does Not",REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PANEL-DATA,"In previous papers the authors have argued that aid is likely to mitigate the negative effects of external shocks on economic growth (i.e. that aid is more effective in countries which are more vulnerable to external shocks). Recently an important debate has emerged about the possible negative effects of aid volatility itself. However, the cushioning effect of aid may involve some volatility in aid flows, which then is not necessarily negative for growth. In this paper the authors examine to what extent the time profile of aid disbursements may contribute to an increase or a decrease of aid effectiveness. They first show that aid, even if volatile, is not clearly as pro-cyclical as is often argued, and, even if pro-cyclical, is not necessarily destabilizing. They measure aid volatility by several methods and assess pro-cyclicality of aid with respect to exports, thus departing from previous literature, which usually assess pro-cyclicality of aid with respect to national income or fiscal receipts. The stabilizing/destabilizing nature of aid is measured by the difference in the volatility of exports and the volatility of the aid plus export flows. Then, in order to take into account the diversity of shocks to which aid can respond, they consider the effect of aid on income volatility and again find that aid is making growth more stable, while its volatility reduces this effect. They finally show through growth regressions that the higher effectiveness of aid in vulnerable countries is to a large extent due to its stabilizing effect.","[Guillaumont, Patrick] Univ Auvergne, CERDI, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Guillaumont, Patrick] CNRS, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Chauvet, Lisa] DIAL, IRD, F-75010 Paris, France",Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"Guillaumont, P (通讯作者)，Univ Auvergne, CERDI, 65 Blvd Francois Mitterrand, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France.",,"Chauvet, Lisa/J-8760-2016","Chauvet, Lisa/0000-0002-1918-4124",,,,,33,42,45,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The findings suggest that at least for moderate/high probability of loss do both 'level' and 'spacing' effects reach significance, with the impact of 'spacing' being both opposite to and stronger than the impact of 'level'.

The paper formally tests the econometric robustness of the SC estimates under three payment regimes: (a) a regional tax, where consumers must trade off welfare gains due to noise reduction for part of their income; (b) a transport tax reallocation scheme, where consumers must trade off a part of the tax payments that are currently spent on the public transport sector; and (c) an administration tax reallocation scheme, where consumers must trade off a part of the tax payments that are currently spent on the administration sector. The test results are varied. On the one hand, the SC estimates are found to be statistically different for the tax reallocation and the tax introduction regimes. This confirms previous valuation research results, and thus reiterates the hypothesis that states the inequality between marginal values of private income and public money. On the other hand, the SC estimates are not found to be statistically different for the two proposed tax reallocation regimes, suggesting that, in the case study investigated here, the marginal value of public money does not depend upon the budget source.","[Nunes, Paulo A.

In this study we examine the Granger causality between foreign institutional ownership and liquidity, while controlling for persistence in foreign ownership and liquidity measures. We find that foreign holdings have a negative impact on future liquidity: a 10% increase in foreign institutional ownership in the current month is associated with approximately 2% increase in the bid-ask spread, 3% decrease in depth, and 4% rise in price sensitivity in the next month, challenging the view that foreign institutions enhance liquidity in small emerging markets.

Data from panels of individual income tax returns suggest that there was considerable income mobility in the U.S. economy over the 1987-1996 and 1996-2005 periods. Consistent with prior mobility studies, the data show that over half of taxpayers moved to a different income quintile and that roughly half of taxpayers who began in the bottom income quintile moved up to a higher income group by the end of each period. By contrast, those with the very highest incomes in the base year were more likely to drop to a lower income group and the median real income of these taxpayers declined in each period. Economic growth resulted in rising incomes for most taxpayers over both time periods. Initial position in the income distribution and changes in marital status were found to be associated with the largest upward or downward movements through the income distribution.","[Auten, Gerald; Gee, Geoffrey] US Dept Treasury, Off Tax Anal, Washington, DC 20006 USA",United States Department of the Treasury,"Auten, G (通讯作者)，US Dept Treasury, Off Tax Anal, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",,,,,,,,28,28,36,0,8,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

A better access to medical care and to contraception for all sex workers would improve well-being also for trafficked women. Moreover. criminalization of sex work may move all sex workers in more secluded places, which will also have a negative impact on the well-being of sexually exploited trafficked individuals.

In his Theory of Moral Sentiments, Smith attempts to explain why and how an individual or household will feel sympathy for other less well-off individuals or households. At the heart of Smith's analysis is the general proposition that sympathy (and presumably discernible actions based on that sympathy) is embodied in the ability of an individual to imagine, from his own perspective, the plight of the less well-off household. In this paper we posit a model of charitable giving that is predicated on this basic proposition that we believe lies at the center of explaining the pattern of charitable giving in the United States. In particular, we suggest that understanding the fundamental human and economic drivers of giving requires us to consider the nature and determinants of the warm glow a household experiences when making charitable donations to other households. We borrow from cognitive psychologists' research into how people judge reward distributions and infer causality of such distributions to explain when households are more and less likely to experience this warm glow. Specifically, we explain how biased perceptions of effort and luck, as the causes of reward distributions, will systematically reduce warm glow of high-income households, which may help explain the essentially flat relationship between income and percentage donations to charity.

Hospitality industry in particular is a good example how it has been blurred the roles that customers play in dealing with service providers. The study reveals that customers can influence the quality of hospitality service through performing a quality-control function. This involves a series of activities to be achieved by them: (1) on-the-spot quality control, (2) service failure control, (3) quality consultancy, and (4) co-production control. However there are some difficulties and the hospitality organizations need a structured approach to overcome them. Developing a strategy to enhance the effectiveness in performing this function is an important challenge for the hospitality organization management. Our study recommends five courses of actions to be included in such a strategy. They envisage (1) increasing the customer's knowledge of the firm's quality standards,(2) encouraging customers to voice their concerns, (3) training customers (and employees) to manage the interpersonal encounter, (4) motivating customers to involve in performing the quality-control function and (5) training customers about their tasks in co-production.","Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Vasile, DC (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",dragoscv@gmail.com,"Claro, Jose Alberto/N-4055-2019; Trommer, Isabelle/B-5705-2012; Vasile, Dragos Constantin/D-1783-2015; Carvalho dos Santos Claro, Jose Alberto/H-6147-2012","Vasile, Dragos Constantin/0000-0002-2178-4719; Carvalho dos Santos Claro, Jose Alberto/0000-0003-1319-2382",,,,,24,2,3,1,13,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2009,11.0,26,,,,,441,450,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,462KQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267351800023,0

The need of interaction and networking uptakes more and more in the management of research-development and innovation (RDI) due, on the one hand, to the growth of its complexity in the knowledge-based economy and, on the other hand, to the urgent need of researchers to come up with solutions for the pressing socio-economic issues. International experience proves that high individual professional quality is not enough for a successful research team. It requires collaboration, including an efficient intergenerational partnership acting in a working environment based on responsibilities, merit acknowledgement, risk-taking, kindness, support, good standards, conflict-avoidance (except for conflicts of ideas) as well as on the scientific identity of every researcher, irrespective of their age. Recognition of scientific and managerial complementarities of the research team members and reciprocal respect for personal values ensures the most efficient valorization of researchers potential within the team. The appreciation and recognition given to the collaborative work are important factors for creativity and success, given the positive relationship between these factors and the quality and quantity of the research output. The research and development (R&D) activity performance is greater when decisions, objectives and priorities are collectively established, since research activity is no more an individual effort, but a consequence of team work contribution. The paper presents the research results regarding the way in which the above mentioned aspects are reflected in R&D intergenerational partnership in Romania, revealing its typology and characteristics, the age structure trends of research teams, as well as the factors that stimulate or hinder cooperation between young researchers and the more experienced ones.","[Zaman, Gheorghe; Sandu, Steliana; Anghel, Irina] Inst Natl Econ, Bucharest, Romania",,"Zaman, G (通讯作者)，Inst Natl Econ, Bucharest, Romania.",gheorghezaman@ien.ro; s_steliana@yahoo.com; irina_c_anghel@yahoo.com,,,,,,,17,2,2,0,14,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2009,11.0,26,,,,,606,615,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,462KQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267351800038,0

Rather, they replicate location choices of official backdonors. Moreover, NGOs follow other NGOs so that aid gets clustered. Finally, NGOs select recipient countries with common traits related to religion or colonial history. Our findings suggest that NGOs keep a low profile rather than distinguishing themselves from other donors.

It presents econometric estimates of firm growth for 56 two-digit industries in the UK. In about half of these industries, there is a positive and statistically significant association between firm growth and own-sector employment. Significant associations between firm growth and other-sector employment are less common, but where these arise they are generally negative. We find that a weak rule of thumb applies in most industries: own-sector effects are positive or insignificant, while other-sector effects are negative or insignificant. Cluster effects are strongest in manufacturing, manufacturing-related, and infrastructure, but weaker in services.","[Beaudry, Catherine] Ecole Polytech, Dept Math & Genie Ind, Montreal, PQ H3C 3A7, Canada; [Swann, G.

There is still little robust evidence of the growth benefits of broad capital account liberalization, but a number of recent papers in the finance literature report that equity market liberalizations do significantly boost growth. Similarly, evidence based on microeconomic (firm- or industry-level) data shows some benefits of financial integration and the distortionary effects of capital controls, but the macroeconomic evidence remains inconclusive. At the same time, some studies argue that financial globalization enhances macroeconomic stability in developing countries, but others argue the opposite. This paper attempts to provide a unified conceptual framework for organizing this vast and growing literature, particularly emphasizing recent approaches to measuring the catalytic and indirect benefits to financial globalization. Indeed, it argues that the indirect effects of financial globalization on financial sector development, institutions, governance, and macroeconomic stability are likely to be far more important than any direct impact via capital accumulation or portfolio diversification. This perspective explains the failure of research based on cross-country growth regressions to find the expected positive effects of financial globalization and points to newer approaches that are potentially more useful and convincing.

It illustrates that the mechanisms enabling those firms to benefit from financial globalization are more complex than the direct financial channels outlined in the neo-classical approach. China provides an important example in this context, as its capital market liberalization has been limited and neither the legal nor the financial system is well developed. Yet micro-level evidence from China's internationally listed enterprises indicates that innovative firms can overcome institutional thresholds, secure access to international capital, and benefit and learn from international capital markets. This can in turn induce market-level improvements through regulatory competition and demand for a more standardized system of economic regulation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A key result is that coexistence of trading systems generates systematic patterns in order flow, which depend on the degree of transparency. Further, we study overall welfare, measured by the gains from trade of all agents, and compare it with the maximum overall welfare. The discrepancy between both measures is attributable to two inefficiencies. Due to these inefficiencies, introducing a CN next to a DM, as well as increasing the transparency level, not necessarily produces greater overall welfare. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this assistance is twofold: to augment the recipient's capital base and to improve its allocation of resources. This paper offers a political-economy explanation for the limited success of some of these loan programs. In our model, governments select policies under the influence of interest groups. Their capacity to absorb IFI loans and their reform efforts are both unobservable to the IFI. An optimally designed loan mechanism must create sufficient incentives - in the form of rewards and punishments - to counter the influence of interest groups on economic policy choices. The loan mechanism is, however, constrained in two ways: it cannot punish a country so severely as to threaten its political stability and it must remain affordable to the IFI. Whenever reform incentives are inadequate, a government will accept the loan but cheat on the implementation of reforms. If, on the other hand, the mechanism design is optimal, it might be so costly to the IFI that a well-entrenched interest group can block the reform program. Nonetheless, the availability of properly designed loan mechanisms will push governments to implement partial reforms even if the optimal mechanism is too costly for the IFI.","[Mourmouras, Alex] Int Monetary Fund, European Div, IMF Inst, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Mayer, Wolfgang] Univ Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA",International Monetary Fund; University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati,"Mourmouras, A (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, European Div, IMF Inst, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",amourmouras@imf.org,,,,,,,29,2,3,0,2,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

Countries that have sustained reforms have seen their popularity grow, while others have witnessed sudden reversals of political support. Opinion can reverse itself, without any apparent provocation, when voters are learning about the effects of reform. In this model, structural adjustment causes a drop in government services and temporary unemployment. The unemployed gradually learn about when they will be re-employed. As labor markets adjust and the cost of reform is revealed, support can gradually rise, it can remain low and suddenly rise, or there can be a quick reversal of support for a previously popular policy.

Achieving and maintaining competitiveness can be done with different strategies and tools. One of them is also outsourcing. Outsourcing is widespread throughout the world and represents a commonly accepted business practice. An important feature of outsourcing is that it is determined by several characteristics at the same time. Since outsourcing is a multidimensional phenomenon, we examined it's most important and distinctive dimensions, including share of outsourcing particular activity, duration of the outsourcing contract, and number, size and location of outsourcing providers. For the purpose of research we have examined which activities are companies outsourcing and divide them on core and supportive activities. On this ground we studied differences in particular characteristics between those two groups of activities. The paper is based on empirical study of 154 Slovenian SMEs concluded in 2008.

This paper discusses whether entrepreneurial opportunity is a deliberate or an emergent process and what information based indicators can be used to define opportunity discovery. Based on the literature review, this research compare and contrast the deliberation and emergent school of thought on opportunity discovery and reaches following conclusions. The opportunity discovery process may be dominated by the active and deliberate search. It can also a process in which the accumulated information and knowledge possessed by the entrepreneur is stimulated by the new information in the environment, resulting in the emergence of the opportunity. Opportunity discovery may be defined by following information based indicators: number of ideas considered before the opportunity is discovered, opportunity precedents, prior knowledge and experiences, critical relationship, information accessibility, and sequential learning.","[Cheng Zhihui] Wuhan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan 430000, Peoples R China",Wuhan University,,chengzhihui@sina.com,"Cheng, Zhihui/AAN-4607-2020","Cheng, Zhihui/0000-0003-1285-0523",,,,,21,1,1,1,5,M & D FORUM,ALLAWAH,"17 AUGUSTA STREET, ALLAWAH, NSW 2218, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9806854-1-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,385,392,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BOT96,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277573000070,0

Finally, if village members themselves manage to bring about a political change, this does not automatically improve the conditions of the most excluded.

In the event, the new cabinet was announced shortly before this issue went to press. As had been widely expected, the president did indeed opt for a wide coalition, appointing to the ministry individuals from most - but not all-parties represented in parliament. The following discussion of the merits and likely consequences of this approach is therefore very timely and useful for understanding how the incoming administration is likely to function.

In half-hour intervals with (without) option trades 25% (12%) of call option quote changes have either the opposite sign or are larger in magnitude than the corresponding index futures quote changes. We calibrate a stochastic volatility model that allows for trade and no-trade periods using real data and simulate the joint co-movements of index quotes and option quotes in this model. We show that for trade intervals the observed co-movements differ from the benchmark case established by our simulations approximately three times too often. We provide empirical evidence that market microstructure effects - specifically, stale quotes and aggressive quotes - explain the majority of the deviations from the benchmark.

The paper finds that value chain specific investment is an irrevocable network collateral, with the increment of network specific investment, the embedding degree of the suppliers on the value chain will be deeper, which will help to form and expand the network of MNCs. The self-enforcing constraint function of value chain specific investment can overcome the opportunism to a large extent because of the imperfectness of contract. Value chain specific investment plays an important role, which cannot be neglected in the governance of MNCs' network, and the self-enforcing mechanism exists at the beginning of network emergence.","[Fan Libo; Wu Yongzhi; Wu Yiming] Univ Int Business & Econ, Int Business Sch, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics,,Fanlibo126@126.com,"WU, YONGZHI/I-6261-2012",,,,,,25,0,0,0,7,M D FORUM,ALLAWAH NSW,"17 AUGUSTA ST, ALLAWAH NSW, 2218, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9806854-2-8,,,,2009,,,,,,,929,937,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BPO33,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279533000112,0

Our results are based on a traditional retrospective analysis of student achievement in PASEC and SACMEQ countries. In contrast to the 'nothing works' result from most industrialized countries' studies we find robust positive correlations of achievement test scores and the possession of textbooks and negative correlations with teaching in shifts. The most striking result is the weak or even absent correlation of achievement test scores and teacher education and professional training.

I show that idiosyncratic volatilities are time-varying and thus, their findings should not be used to imply the relation between idiosyncratic risk and expected return. Using the exponential GARCH models to estimate expected idiosyncratic volatilities, I find a significantly positive relation between the estimated conditional idiosyncratic volatilities and expected returns.

The context is a 'Londoni' village in Sylhet which has high levels of internal and overseas migration. The economic boom caused by the latter provides important employment opportunities for people from much poorer areas of Bangladesh, who have moved into the area. Yet, as our findings show, the extent to which the poor can call upon the help and protection of rich overseas migrants depends upon the degree of closeness to, or separation from, them. This is marked both through real and fictive kinship as well as geography: those that come from nearby become 'our own poor', whereas those from further away are treated as 'outsiders', not qualifying for significant 'help'. As the paper argues, access to hierarchically ordered places is vital for the sustainability of precarious livelihoods. Yet whilst geographical movement is an important survival strategy for the poor, it is only when social relations are established with wealthy patrons that it can be said to contribute to informal social protection.","[Ahmed, Zahir] Jahangirnagar Univ, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Gardner, Katy] Univ Sussex, Arts C, Brighton BN1 9QN, E Sussex, England",Jahangirnagar University; University of Sussex,"Gardner, K (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Arts C, Brighton BN1 9QN, E Sussex, England.",K.Gardner@Sussex.ac.uk,,,,,,,38,16,20,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,,,J DEV STUD,J.

The main result is that the great emphasis put by Italian policy-makers in designing tax credits in the last 15 years has been mostly misplaced if the aim was that of supporting low-income households. On the other hand, child benefits - potentially a more effective tool have not proven to be a growing source of redistribution in the same period. Overall, the Italian experience shows a rather uncertain path in helping families with children, with comparable results achieved by very complex and much simpler tax/benefit systems.","[Gastaldi, Francesca] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy; [Liberati, Paolo] Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, Urbino, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; University of Urbino,"Gastaldi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.",francesca.gastaldi@uniroma1.it,,"LIBERATI, Paolo/0000-0002-6317-9701",,,,,16,1,1,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1748-7870,,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

The case of equally likely outcomes is of special importance for two reasons. First, it is encountered in practice often, when expectations are typically based on a given set of historical observations that are each observed once. Second, many researchers believe that in this case probabilities are not subjectively weighted. If this hypothesis is correct, the case of equally likely outcomes can be employed to make clear inferences about the utility/value function, with a neutralization of probability weighting effects. We experimentally examine whether equally likely outcomes are indeed perceived as equally likely. Surprisingly, we find a clear negative answer. Moderate outcomes are significantly overweighed relative to extreme outcomes. Several important implications for models of decision making and economics are discussed.","[Levy, Moshe] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Sch Business Adm, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Levy, M (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Sch Business Adm, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",mslm@huji.ac.il,,,,,,,20,2,5,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

Firstly, inter- and intra-sectoral studies confirm the relevance of a Ricardian approach in apprehending the determinants of specialisations. Secondly, the absence of total specialisation on a sectoral level, which is inconsistent with Ricardian theory, can be explained by intra-sectoral heterogeneity resulting from the use of accounting conventions. Consequently, the verification of comparative advantages requires the construction of other aggregates identifying the differences in the nature of North-South specialisations. Lastly, the link between the nature of specialisations and the level of development is conditioned by the sophistication and diversity of the goods supplied.

To this end, it analyses some of the major challenge faced by the US prior to its union in the 19th century and the way countries such as France and Germany contributed to the formation of the EU, despite their past animosity. The paper proposed a two tier system for the emergence of a union in the Asia Pacific region in which all countries could become part of a regional framework for regional security and free trade and some of the more advanced countries in the region could start the process of financial integration and invite other member countries to join them over time. The paper argues that in the 2st century, unlike the claim of the currency optimum theory, there is no need for labour mobility amongst Asian countries for the formation of a union in this region and hence Australia should not expect millions of workers from China to migrate there. The paper argues that the role of Japan and China in the process of regional integration has been underestimated, due to the claim that the former is a monoculture and the latter is too nationalistic. The paper highlights how diversity in the region could be seen as a strength in the Asia Pacific region. It also shows how the process of globalisation has already overcome differences in culture, religion and race which used to be stumbling blocks for more regional or global integration. The paper argues that a union in the Asia Pacific region would reduce home bias for international capital flows and hence there Would be significant financial transformation Of Countries in this region.

Patinkin and R.W. Clower belong to the first criticists of the model IS-LM, and they have revealed its theoretical weaknesses. It was in the half of the sixties of the 20 century, i.e. at the time when there was nobody to make the effectiveness of the Keynes's policies dubious. These analyses have become a starting point of the theory of economic disequilibrium. It has reached its full development as late as in the seventies and eighties of the 20 century, especially in France. The research programme of the theory of economic disequilibrium is carried out by searching the microeconomic basic points of the Keynes macroeconomics. This proves, that although in the real economic life an economic subject tries to reach the optimum, he/she is forced to choose a solution which is not an optimum one. The fact that some economic subjects are subject to limitations has very important macroeconomic consequences, unemployment being one of them. The theory of economic disequilibrium brings some interesting facts into the analysis of recent unemployment. They are such facts as limitations, relative rigidity of wages, spill-over effect and finally reasoning the existence of unvoluntary unemployment. Due to these contributions it helped the creation of the new Keynes economy.","Univ Econ, Narodohospodarska Fak, SK-85235 Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Prívarová, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Narodohospodarska Fak, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, SK-85235 Bratislava, Slovakia.",magda.privarova@euba.sk,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,9,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

In this paper, we compare results obtained using a linear approach with those from nonlinear and nonparametric models. Among firms that don't have a linear exposure, we find that a considerable proportion of these are exposed when nonlinear or nonparametric models are used. This exposure is most striking when a nonparametric model is used. We also find that firms hedging activities decrease linear exposure but don't affect nonparametric exposure. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper reconsiders the mutual interdependence between government size and growth volatility in a large sample of countries within a system of simultaneous equations. We find that higher volatility is associated with larger government size and vice versa. Thus emphasis on government size as a mean capable, per se, of reducing macroeconomic risk is ill-conceived.

In addition, his model is found to generate puzzling regression results when applied to real-world data.

In this paper, we propose a nonparametric method using an optimal window to estimate time-varying coefficients. In addition, we offer two empirical tests of a conditional factor model. Using our new method, we examine the performance of the conditional CAPM and the conditional Fama-French three-factor model in explaining the return variations of portfolios sorted by size, book-to-market ratios, and past returns, for which recent literature has generated controversial results. We find that, although in general the conditional FF model outperforms the conditional CAPM, both models fail to explain well-known asset-pricing anomalies. Moreover, for both models, the failure is more pronounced for the equally-weighted portfolios than for the value-weighted ones. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This evidence is puzzling given that tender offers are more efficient in disbursing free cash and in signaling undervaluation - the two main motivations suggested in the literature for repurchasing shares. We provide a theoretical model to explore this puzzle. In the model, tender offers disburse free cash quickly but induce information asymmetry and hence require a price premium. Open-market programs disburse free cash slowly, and hence do not require a price premium, but because they are slow, result in partial free cash waste. The model predicts that the likelihood that a tender offer will be chosen over an open-market program increases with the agency costs of free cash and decreases with uncertainty (risk), information asymmetry, ownership concentration, and liquidity. These predictions are generally consistent with the empirical evidence. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The empirical footprint of sector rotation has predictive power for the evolution of the economy and future bond market returns, even after controlling for relative sector returns.

Some of the effects of deregulation have been consistent with observed trends in other countries but others have been quite different. The abandonment of less profitable routes in the short term as well as the unfolding core-periphery structures following the emergence and dominance of certain core control centers replicates what obtained in the United States. However, evidence from literature suggesting that liberalization in practice has often resulted in the rising concentration of connectivity in a limited number of nodes and links rather than in its dispersal over the network at large does not hold yet in Nigeria's domestic air network. This paper shows that the shifting balance between concentration and dispersal in Nigeria's domestic network is generally skewed towards dispersal. Passenger traffic is more dispersed among nodes as gleaned from diminishing standard deviation values with increasing number of nodes. Generally speaking, overall connectivity also tends towards more evenness in the network since deregulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The findings demonstrate that the partial adjustment model is consistent with the traditional appraisal smoothing argument only when all appraisers choose the same smoothing technique. However, if appraiser behavior is heterogeneous and exhibits cross-sectional variation due to the difference in their access to, and interpretation of information, the model actually leads to a mixed outcome: The variance of the transaction-based returns can be higher or lower than the variance of comparable-based return depending on the degree of such heterogeneity. Contrary to what the traditional appraisal smoothing theory would predict, appraisal-based indices may not suffer any smoothing bias. These findings suggest that the traditional appraisal smoothing theory, which fails to consider the heterogeneity of appraiser behaviors, exaggerates the effect of appraisal smoothing.","[Cheng, Ping] Florida Atlantic Univ, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA; [Lin, Zhenguo] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA; [Liu, Yingchun] Univ Laval, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada",State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University; California State University System; California State University Fullerton; Laval University,"Cheng, P (通讯作者)，Florida Atlantic Univ, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA.",pcheng@fau.edu; zlin@fullerton.edu; yingchun.Liu@fsa.ulaval.ca,"LIU, YING/GZL-7252-2022; liu, ying/GXF-4294-2022",,,,,,54,21,22,0,7,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

First, we revisit the posed question within an in-sample setting by employing mean-variance and non-mean-variance spanning tests. Then, we form optimal portfolios by taking into account the higher order moments of the portfolio returns distribution and evaluate their out-of-sample performance. Under the in-sample setting, we find that commodities are beneficial only to non-mean-variance investors. However, these benefits are not preserved out-of-sample. Our findings challenge the alleged diversification benefits of commodities and are robust across a number of performance evaluation measures, utility functions and datasets. The results hold even when transaction costs are considered and across various sub-periods. Not surprisingly, the only exception appears over the 2005-2008 unprecedented commodity boom period.

Descriptive statistics indicate REIT credit lines represent an important component of capital structure. Credit line availability and utilization increased substantially over the sample period. REITs also maintain precautionary liquidity via credit lines rather than holding cash during the sample period. Multivariate results indicate that credit line availability is directly associated with cash flow uncertainty, dividend distributions, acquisitions, and capital market access and is inversely linked to the market-to-book ratio. Credit line use is unrelated to cash flow volatility and dividends, but is correlated with operating cash flow, acquisitions, and capital market access. Despite finding that line availability is influenced by dividend payments, REITs do not systematically use lines to pay dividends, implying that dividends are paid from operating cash flows.","[Hardin, William G., III] Florida Int Univ, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Hill, Matthew D.] Univ Mississippi, University, MS 38677 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University; University of Mississippi,"Hardin, WG (通讯作者)，Florida Int Univ, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",hardinw@fiu.edu; mhill@bus.olemiss.edu,,,,,,,33,25,27,0,15,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

We examine whether US equity mutual funds are disposition-prone, how that effect influences performance, investor flows and fund survival. and whether the disposition orientation of mutual funds affects stock prices in a sustained manner. We find that about 30% of all funds exhibit some degree of disposition behavior and that such funds underperform funds that are not disposition-prone by 4-6% per year. Moreover, after controlling for performance, tax overhang and other factors that potentially affect flows, disposition-prone funds attract significantly smaller flows than other funds. The results suggest that mutual fund investors are smart enough to minimize investment in disposition-prone funds. Consequently, disposition-prone funds have significantly higher rates of failure than other funds, thereby reducing the impact of such trading behavior on security prices. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Robustness of results to joint-endogeneity of output and government spending, alternative conditioning variables, and cointegration is investigated. Aggregate government spending appears to have positive output growth effects particularly in periods of below-trend growth in this variable. The government sector's productivity appears to be higher than non-government sector's productivity when spending growth is below-trend growth and only for non-OECD countries; no differences in sectoral productivities are detected for OECD countries. Government consumption spending has no significant output growth effects, but government investment spending has positive output growth effects particularly when its growth falls below its trend-growth; this favorable effect turns negative when government investment spending growth exceeds its trend-growth.

A comparison of the 1973-85 and 1986-2006 time periods reveals that substitution away from energy use in production and monetary policy were both important, with approximately two-thirds of the change in response of inflation to oil shocks being due to reduced energy usage, and one-third to monetary policy.

These effects are incremental to previously identified causes of wave activity. Our risk management hypothesis is further supported by cross-sectional differences in the likelihood that a firm vertically integrates, and by the post-acquisition characteristics of vertically integrating firms. These results are consistent with the view (from the industrial organization literature) that vertical integration is an operational hedging mechanism that reduces the cost of increased uncertainty.

Automatic stabilizers should depend on true GDP, while discretionary fiscal policy is contingent on the information that policy makers have in real time. We can compute a real-time measurement error by comparing the first release of GDP data with later revisions. Discretionary fiscal policy is influenced by this measurement error, whereas automatic fiscal policy is not. We use this identification approach to test the central identifying assumption of Blanchard and Perotti's (2002) seminal structural vector autoregression (VAR). According to this assumption, fiscal policy makers do not react to GDP developments contemporaneously in a discretionary fashion. We find that government expenditure is adjusted upward if GDP growth in real time is lower than true GDP. This suggests that fiscal policy makers use short-term funds to buy goods and services in response to their perception of GDP dynamics.","[von Kalckreuth, Ulf] Deutsch Bundesbank, Frankfurt, Germany",Deutsche Bank,"von Kalckreuth, U (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Frankfurt, Germany.",guntram.wolff@gmx.de,"Wolff, Guntram/AAY-9977-2021","Wolff, Guntram/0000-0003-2716-522X",,,,,19,7,7,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-2879,,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

An economic agent, who should allocate a limited amount of time to labor, leisure, and risky investment, is subject to the opportunity time cost of investment activity, which is foregone labor or leisure. Our model envisages its impact on equity premium and volatility in the presence of such a time constraint, in particular; with closed-form solutions to the risky asset returns, volatility, and risk-free rate in a simple equilibrium framework wherein agents have log utility. The model is shown to yield excess return and volatility consistent with historical values observed in the U.S. stock market, even with a small amount of time cost.

Introducing a special issue devoted to these agrarian dimensions of armed conflict, non-war violence and post-war repertoires of political mobilization, this paper argues for a new research and policy agenda. In doing so, we revive some older analytical approaches and suggest that they can refresh and enhance current scholarship. We argue too for a historical perspective: not simply to highlight precedents but, rather, because such a perspective helps to clarify the issues involved and their centrality to processes of rural change, as well as to show that there may be long-run continuities in patterns of conflict. Bringing the agrarian back in to the study of violent conflict means investigating access to land and capital and means of mobilizing labour; it means investigating changes in the institutional regulation of such access and control; and it means identifying the tensions, techniques of compulsion and modes of resistance developed around productive relations in, typically, a globalized context.","[Cramer, Christopher] Sch Oriental & African Studies, London WC1H 0XG, England; [Richards, Paul] Univ Wageningen, Technol & Agr Dev Grp, NL-6700 HB Wageningen, Netherlands",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); Wageningen University & Research,"Cramer, C (通讯作者)，Sch Oriental & African Studies, Thornhaugh St, London WC1H 0XG, England.",cc10@soas.ac.uk; paul.richards@wur.nl,"Cramer, Christopher/HQY-1319-2023","Richards, Paul/0000-0001-5813-0228",,,,,70,60,65,2,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

In the U. S. A, for example, the Consumer Price Index for the Urban population (CPI-U) calculated and reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has a lesser known cousin called the CPI-E (for the elderly) in which the sub-component weights are based on the consumption patterns of Americans above the age of 62. This suggests that Inflation-Linked Bond Funds (ILBFs) - whose individual component bond adjustments are based on broad population (CPI-U) inflation - might not be the best hedge for individual retirees' cost of living. But then again, broad shocks to inflation are likely to impact both indices. So, motivated by the question - is it good enough? - the current paper uses lifetime ruin minimization (LRM) techniques to investigate the optimal allocation between an ILBF and a nominal investment fund for a retiree facing an exogenous liability. Our model trades off the benefit of an imperfect hedge against the cost of lower investment growth. However, our numerical results suggest that although ILBFs can be a large part of the optimal retirement portfolio, it should be treated as just another asset class in the broad optimization problem as opposed to a special or unique category.","[Huang, Huaxiong] York Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada; [Milevsky, Moshe A.] York Univ, Schulich Sch Business, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada",York University - Canada; York University - Canada,"Huang, HX (通讯作者)，York Univ, Dept Math & Stat, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada.",milevsky@yorku.ca,"Milevsky, Moshe Arye/AAA-3482-2022","Milevsky, Moshe/0000-0002-5176-8904",,,,,29,2,2,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

We argue that the controversy in the empirical literature regarding the determinants of capital structure decisions is based on a failure to take into account the different degrees of information opacity, and, consequently, firms' characteristics and needs at specific stages of their life cycles. The results show that, in a bank-oriented country, firms tend to adopt specific financing strategies and a different hierarchy of financial decision-making as they progress through the phases of their business life cycle. Contrary to conventional wisdom, debt is shown to be fundamental to business activities in the early stages, representing the first choice. By contrast, in the maturity stage, firms re-balance their capital structure, gradually substituting debt for internal capital, and for firms that have consolidated their business, the pecking-order theory shows a high degree of application. This financial life-cycle pattern seems to be homogeneous for different industries and consistent over time.","[La Rocca, Maurizio; La Rocca, Tiziana; Cariola, Alfio] Univ Calabria, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, Cosenza, Italy",University of Calabria,"La Rocca, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Cubo 3C,Campus Arcavacata, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, Cosenza, Italy.",m.larocca@unical.it,"Cariola, Alfio/T-9213-2019; La Rocca, Maurizio/L-3143-2019","La Rocca, Maurizio/0000-0002-2097-2865; cariola, alfio/0000-0002-1447-7104",,,,,78,116,142,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The second common line of argument is that these massacres served as pilot runs for the subsequent genocide, implying that they were part of a plan that was not to see its full implementation until 1994. This paper puts forth a third, alternative interpretation of these massacres. The first of the aforementioned arguments, it is contended, does not take into account the detailed evidence that is available on the killings: the fact that they took place in the context of the civil war accounts for the timing of the massacres, but not for their genocidal character. In turn, the second interpretation fails to situate these massacres against the agro-pastoral and ideological background of the regime that committed them. By contrast, this paper shows that the massacres took place in areas characterized by a specific history of spatial and social engineering. They are best understood against the background of the processes of land colonization, resettlement, depredation and dispossession of cattle and land that were under way in the areas where the land was most scarce, and where the peasant society was being subject to rationalization and remodelling from above. The paper concludes that pastoralism was sentenced to disappear from Rwanda and that the massacres should be considered instances of ethnic cleansing.","[Verwimp, Philip] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Solvay Brussels Sch Econ & Management, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Verwimp, Philip] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Solvay SA; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Verwimp, P (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, Solvay Brussels Sch Econ & Management, Ave Roosevelt 42, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",philip.verwimp@ulb.ac.be,,,,,,,59,16,19,2,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

We find that the option-like performance fee structure prevalent among hedge funds is suboptimal to the symmetric performance fee structure. However, the use of high water mark (HWM) mitigates the suboptimality, though to a very limited extent. Both our theoretical models and simulation results show that HWM will induce more managerial efforts only when a fund is slightly under the water but it will unfavorably dampen incentives when a fund is too deep under the water and when the manager's skill is poor. Allowing managers to invest personal wealth in their own funds, however, helps align interests and provides positive managerial incentives.","Univ Massachusetts, Isenberg Sch Management, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Zhan, G (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Isenberg Sch Management, 121 Presidents Dr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",gzhan@som.umass.edu,,,,,,,22,1,1,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1380-6645,,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

In 2005, taxpayers deducted $48 billion in noncash donations, resulting in a tax expenditure of $9 billion. High-income taxpayers primarily donated stock and other appreciated property, thereby also avoiding the capital gains tax liability due on appreciation of the assets had they been sold, while middle-income taxpayers primarily donated used clothing and household items. We focus on donations of vehicles using tax and online vehicle auction data. Taxpayer valuations are compared with auction prices of vehicles of the same make, model, and year The results imply that either taxpayers are overstating the likely value of their vehicle or donating vehicles of higher average quality than those sold in online auctions.

However, the time-varying behavior of investors, for example, may cause the structure of volatility to change and the assumption of stationarity is no longer plausible. To deal with this issue, the current paper proposes a conditional volatility model with time-varying coefficients based on a multinomial switching mechanism. By giving more weight to either the persistence or shock term in a GARCH model, conditional on their relative ability to forecast a benchmark volatility measure, the switching reinforces the persistent nature of the GARCH model. The estimation of this benchmark volatility targeting or BVT-GARCH model for Dow 30 stocks indicates that the switching model is able to outperform a number of relevant GARCH setups, both in- and out-of-sample, also without any informational advantages.

Our results are robust to specifications that account for potential endogeneity related to a firm's derivatives use and capital structure decisions. We further find that the reduction in the cost of equity is attributable to both lower market beta and SMB beta, suggesting that firms use derivatives to reduce their financial distress risk and that this distress risk has a systematic component that is priced in the market.

First, we gather evidence on how inflation targets are set from official central bank and government publications, and from a questionnaire of our own design. Second, we estimate what determines the level of the inflation target in 19 inflation-targeting countries by using unbalanced panel interval regressions to deal with the issue that targets are typically set as a range rather than a point. We find that a higher target is associated with a higher level and variability of inflation. The setting of the inflation target is also found to have an important international dimension because higher world inflation is positively correlated with inflation targets. Rapidly growing countries exhibit higher inflation targets. Our results also show that authorities establish a wider target range for the inflation rate when the macroeconomic environment is less stable. We find that central bank credibility is negatively associated with the level of the inflation target, suggesting that less-credible central banks are likely to recognize the risks related to anchoring inflation expectations at low levels. On the other hand, government party orientation does not matter, even in less-independent central banks.","[Horvath, Roman] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague 11503 1, Czech Republic; [Mateju, Jakub] CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic; [Mateju, Jakub] Czech Natl Bank, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Czech National Bank,"Horváth, R (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Opletalova 26, Prague 11503 1, Czech Republic.",roman.horvath@gmail.com,"Horvath, Roman/AAD-8248-2019; Mateju, Jakub/H-2899-2014; Becka, Jan/C-1255-2010; Horvath, Roman/AAX-8903-2020","Horvath, Roman/0000-0002-9036-9746",,,,,65,8,9,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

This paper attempts to provide best practices for regional trade agreements (RTAs) to enhance global free trade by mitigating these negative effects. By adopting a gravity regression analysis, we quantitatively estimate the trade creation and diversion effects of cumulated RoO (bilateral, diagonal, and full cumulation) for RTAs established under GATT Article XXIV and under the Enabling Clause. We find that (i) RTAs, in general, create trade among members and divert trade from nonmembers, whereby the net trade-enhancing effect is rather weak; (ii) RTAs should be established under the comprehensive GATT Article XXIV, rather than the piecemeal Enabling Clause; and (iii) full cumulation is the most optimal provision in terms of creating the most intra-bloc trade and diverting the least extra-bloc trade. Overall, we strongly suggest that RTAs should employ full cumulation of RoO under GATT Article XXIV.","[Park, Innwon] Korea Univ, Div Int Studies, Seoul 136701, South Korea; [Park, Soonchan] Kongju Natl Univ, Dept Econ & Int Trade, Kong Ju 314701, South Korea",Korea University; Kongju National University,"Park, I (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Div Int Studies, 5-1 Anam Dong, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",iwpark@korea.ac.kr; spark@kongju.ac.kr,"Park, Innwon/I-6310-2019","Park, Innwon/0000-0001-8567-7907",,,,,43,10,11,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

We identified stress responses to uncertainty as an individual difference factor that should moderate the relative effectiveness of these social accounts. A denial should make acceptance of an unfair offer more likely among recipients who respond to uncertainty with low stress. An apology should make such acceptance more likely among recipients who respond with high stress. Further, we argued that this cross-over interaction should be observed particularly among recipients interacting with a high power allocator. Two ultimatum bargaining experiments supported these ideas. Employing the perspective of victims of unfairness, the present research identifies a relevant individual difference moderator of the effectiveness of social accounts in bargaining situations and identifies power as a situational variable that promotes the expression of this factor.

Compared to non-offshoring firms, firms that relocated activities were larger and more productive, and had a higher share of exports in total sales. These differences existed the year before some firms started to relocate, and this points to self-selection of better firms into offshoring. To investigate the causal effects of offshoring, six different variants of a matching approach are used. Contrary to what is often argued we find no evidence for a large negative causal effect of offshoring on employment in Germany.","[Wagner, Joachim] Leuphana Univ, Luneburg, Germany; [Wagner, Joachim] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Wagner, J (通讯作者)，Leuphana Univ, Luneburg, Germany.",wagner@leuphana.de,"Wagner, Joachim/AAF-4949-2020; Wagner, Joachim/D-8156-2012","Wagner, Joachim/0000-0001-6058-4536",,,,,55,49,51,1,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

It adopts the firm dynamics framework that allows testing of selection effects directly by assessing the impact of foreign firms' activity on the probability of exiting of local firms (crowding out). The results show that intra-industry productivity spillover effects offset only a minor part of the competition pressure which results from foreign firm entry, hence incumbent firms experience a drop in their survival probability upon a foreign firm's entry within a particular industry. This result is driven by foreign firm entry of the greenfield type, as entry through the acquisition of existing firms has no significant effect. The strength of the crowding-out effect decreases with the incumbent firm's export propensity. There is no significant evidence that inward FDI would stimulate the selection process through backward linkages in the upstream supplying industries, whereas foreign firms' activity reduces the exit probability of downstream local customers (through forward linkages).","Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Kejzar, KZ (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Kardeljeva Pl 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",katja.zajc@ef.uni-lj.si,,,,,,,35,16,20,1,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

However, there is some debate on the appropriate methodology for measuring the effects of distance on correlation. We modify a regression approach suggested in the literature and complement it with an approach from spatial statistics, the mark correlation function. For the stocks contained in the S&P 500 that we examine, both approaches lead to similar results. Contrary to previous studies we find that beyond 50 miles geographical proximity is irrelevant for stock return correlations. For distances below 50 miles, we can show that the magnitude of local correlations varies with investor sentiment. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This relationship hypothesizes that the number of road fatalities increases with increasing motorization in the early stages of economic growth. Eventually, due to advances in technical, policy and political institutions, it declines as per capita income increases. The quality of political institutions as well as improvements in medical care and technology are hypothesized to impact road fatalities. Results indicate evidence of a Kuznets curve relationship between per capita income and road fatalities for both highly developed and less developed countries and support our hypothesis that changes in institutional quality and medical improvements underlie the Kuznets relationship. The evidence presented in this study suggests that lowering corruption levels as well as improvements in medical care and technology would help to reduce road fatalities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

It discusses how, in the absence of a globally integrated financial framework, past and present regulations and interventions in reaction to national and global financial crises did not resolve the cross border regulatory arbitrage. The paper discusses how crises often lead to the emergence of new national and international institutions. It also analyses the proposed new global framework that needs to be in place if the policy recommendations contained in the G20 communique are going to be effectively implemented. The paper argues that unless international agreements are ratified by all nations and become part of national rules and laws, the presence of regulatory arbitrage and the lack of adequate cross border information and data may prevent the global economy from addressing the underlying causes of the recent global financial crisis. The paper also discusses the evolution of central banks and their new role in contributing to global financial stability. The paper argues that the recent global financial crisis has provided a unique opportunity to go beyond economic data and attempt to capture cross border financial data and other information that could assist international and national institutions to measure and manage financial risk more effectively. Finally, the paper discusses too big to fail and argues that only an internationally integrated financial system will make large banks global, both when operational and in the event of insolvency.

We provide an analytical solution for the 2-branch model and show that a liquidity center can be interpreted as an option on immediate liquidity. Therefore, its value can be interpreted as the price of information, i.e., the price of knowing the exact demand. Furthermore, we derive the threshold above which it is advantageous to open a liquidity center and show that it is a function of the volatility and the characteristic of the bank network.

It includes both theoretical and applied economic works and economic policy books. In the 1940's, Maurice Allais rigorously settled the foundations of neoclassical microeconomic theory. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences forty years later, in 1998, for his pioneering development of theories to better understand market behaviour and the efficient use of resources. After the Second World War, Maurice Allais was the leader of the French engineers-economists. In 1952, he questioned the theory of decision in uncertainty, hence becoming a precursor of behavioural finance. He then wandered into the mysteries of Hereditary, Relativistic and Logistic Theory of the Demand for Money, isolating himself from the scientific community. In the 1970's, he called into question the General Equilibrium Theory to propose a General Theory of Surpluses. As a heterodox liberal, he recommended a monetary reform (the 100% Money), allocating all rents to the State (through a tax on capital) and price-indexing all claims. After its Nobel Prize, he devoted himself to fighting against neoliberal and financial globalisation and free trade with low-wage countries.","Univ Paris 09, OFCE, F-75007 Paris, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine,"Sterdyniak, H (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, OFCE, 69 Quai Orsay, F-75007 Paris, France.",Henri.Sterdyniak@ofce.sciences-po.fr,,,,,,,73,3,3,0,4,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

The article challenges the standard industry conception and proposes a distinction between the emergent industrial sector, the emergent product market (or niche) and the industry as a more well-established entity. Based on empirical evidence from the IT security sector, two trajectories of complementary convergence are identified, lower-order integration, the integration of different product markets in a sectoral context, and higher-end integration, the integration of product markets into the offerings of established industries. While young ventures dominate lower-order integration, incumbents in established industries dominate higher-order integration. For both trajectories mergers and acquisitions represent a central means for realizing convergence.","[Christensen, Jens Froslev] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Innovat & Org Econ, DK-2000 Copenhagen, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Christensen, JF (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Innovat & Org Econ, Kilevej 14A, DK-2000 Copenhagen, Denmark.",jfc.ino@cbs.dk,,,,,,,66,14,18,1,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

We estimate a correlated random-effects quantile regression model, accounting for unobserved heterogeneity of researchers and applicable to count data. We find that the effect of most regressors, particularly system-factors incentivizing researchers (like promotion record and access to research resources), as well as the gender of the researcher differ significantly at different points in the distribution, yielding strong support for our quantile regression approach. Comparing publications versus citations as dimensions of research performance, we find the incentive factors to work stronger in affecting research quality.

We found a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs1486011) of the DRD3 gene on chromosome 3 to be significantly associated with the tendency to be an entrepreneur. This result is the first evidence of the association of a specific gene with entrepreneurship.

Given a well-established set of theoretical priors, the regulations considered are capital requirements, restrictions on bank activities and official supervisory power. We use data from the Central and Eastern European banking sectors over the period 1998-2005. The empirical results suggest that banks with market power tend to take on lower credit risk and have a lower probability of default. Capital requirements reduce risk in general, but for banks with market power this effect significantly weakens or can even be reversed. Higher activity restrictions in combination with more market power reduce both credit risk and the risk of default, while official supervisory power has only a direct impact on bank risk.

The reason for this confusion and lack of clarity can be attributed to a gap between the emerging KM and the current lack of understanding about this concept by practitioners.

Reliable measures of affective-symbolic and instrumental-independence motives were constructed. The results show that households with children use the car more than households with no children, that men make more car trips as drivers than women who use the car as passenger more than men, and that households living in rural areas use the car more than households living in semi-rural areas who use the car more than households living in urban areas.

This paper models the era of fiscal stress as stemming from growing promised government transfers that initially are fully honored, being financed by new sales of government debt that bring forth higher Attire income taxes. As debt levels and tax rates rise, the population's tolerance for taxation declines and the probability of reaching the fiscal limit increases. At the limit a,fixed tax rate is adopted, adjustments in taxes no longer stabilize debt, and, temporarily, debt grows rapidly. Eventually, a new stabilizing combination of policies is adopted. We examine how, in the period before the fiscal limit, rapidly rising debt interacts with expectations of how and when policies will adjust. If households believe it is possible that in the future monetary policy will shift from targeting inflation to stabilizing debt, then temporarily explosive debt feeds directly into the path of inflation. News that reduces expected primary surpluses can bring future inflation into the present, well before the news shows up in fiscal measures. This paper makes the point that even if long-run policies give monetary policy perfect control over inflation, in the transition to that long run, monetary policy can spectacularly lose control.

Specifically, we examine whether single and multiple earnings forecasts may differentially influence investors' expectations. We focus on two main aspects of investors' expectations: (a) predictions of future EPS and (b) subjective confidence about their own predictions. We conduct an experiment where we hold information content constant and ask participants to evaluate multiple earnings forecasts or a single earnings estimate. Results from the experiment suggest that multiple information sources improve participants' confidence, and participants are most confident when they receive multiple earnings forecasts with no variability. However, their confidence diminishes when variability in the multiple forecasts increases. Evidence from this study indicates that multiple information sources outperform the single source only when multiple reports have highly consistent information.","[Du, Ning] Depaul Univ, Sch Accountancy & Management Informat Syst, Chicago, IL 60604 USA",DePaul University,"Du, N (通讯作者)，Depaul Univ, Sch Accountancy & Management Informat Syst, 1 E Jackson Blvd, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",ndu1@depaul.edu,,,,,,,27,6,6,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY) has not become a more reformist and risk-taking president in his second term, contrary to the hopes of many, but has rather become more cautious, aloof and regal in style. He is irked by criticism and dislikes any disturbance to the authority of his rule. The political elite, often in concert with the SBY government, pushed through a range of democratically regressive measures, including allowing politicians to be appointed to the Elections Commission. The malaise within the party system deepened, with less than a quarter of the electorate professing any party affiliation. Most Islamic parties slid closer to the political periphery, and the largest one, PKS, was beset by controversy. Government and community responses to a brutal attack on the Ahmadiyah sect in early 2011 showed the limits of Indonesia's much lauded religious tolerance.","Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Fealy, G (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,,,,,,,15,21,21,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-4918,,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

We predict the likelihood of currency crises using standard macroeconomic variables and a probit equation estimation methodology with random effects. We employ a comprehensive panel data set comprised of 69 emerging market and developing economies over 1975-2004. Both standard and duration-adjusted measures of capital control intensity (allowing controls to depreciate over time) suggest that capital controls have not effectively insulated economies from currency crises at any time during our sample period. Maintaining real GDP growth and limiting real overvaluation are critical factors preventing currency crises, not capital controls. However, the presence of capital controls greatly increases the sensitivity of currency crises to changes in real GDP growth and real exchange rate overvaluation, making countries more vulnerable to changes in fundamentals. Our model suggests that emerging markets weathered the 2007-2008 crisis relatively well because of strong output growth and exchange rate flexibility that limited overvaluation of their currencies.

Furthermore, until 31 December 1992, the Czech Republic was part of the federal union of the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic. All these factors have influenced the legislative form of the law of the Czech Republic. Due to the fact that a major change in commercial law is currently being prepared (particularly a law on commercial companies and cooperatives- Act on Corporate Groups), the aim pursued in this paper is to briefly explore the legislative history of commercial law in the Czech Republic as well as to analyse the planned future legal norm, i.e. the reasons for its creation and the major changes that shall take place. In this context, another objective is to answer the question of whether the new legislation under preparation is really necessary with regard to the requirement of legal certainty for addressees of legal norms.","[Hanakova, Lenka] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Zlin, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,,lhanakova@fame.utb.cz,,"Hanakova, Lenka/0000-0002-2242-7588",,,,,6,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-6-9,,,,2011,,,,,,,474,482,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEO28,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000317550000044,0

These include suppliers of agricultural inputs, producers of agricultural commodities, and institutions that perform the functional aspects associated with marketing food and fiber products. Fundamental to the concept of agribusiness is that many problems related to agriculture are interrelated and dependent upon political, sociological, economic and behavioral factors. In this special issue of the journal, we argue that the field of agribusiness is inherently a scientifically pluralistic endeavor to which efforts to define it as an academic discipline is not useful.

Both explicit and tacit knowledge is important for regional development, but tacit knowledge seems to be more important particularly for rural areas due to the specific conditions of rural areas, and usually a lack of explicit (codified) knowledge. The importance of tacit knowledge is also consistent with an endogenous approach to rural development. These are the main reasons for choosing the topic of this paper, which is focused on knowledge creation and knowledge dynamics within particular rural areas of the Czech Republic. The paper is focused on specialized institutions for education within the rural areas which are called Schools for Rural Renewal. The main aim of the paper is to examine the role of these institutions within the process of knowledge creation within the rural areas. The specific aim is also to compare the functioning of different types of Schools for Rural Renewal (which differs mainly by their founders) and to research different approaches to education within the rural areas. From the methodological point of view, mainly secondary analyses and semi-standardized interviews with representatives of Schools for Rural Renewal are used. Attention is also paid to the typology of implemented projects and activities of Schools for Rural Renewal which differs between the regions of the Czech Republic.

IT complexity can take different forms such as integration of separate software and enterprise systems and the building of specific interfaces between these. The complexity of IT issues can make the quality of the ABC approach fragile and IT constraints on the use of management accounting solutions can lead to weak management information.

Even though it is strategic element of branding, it is difficult to measure. Previous researchers have made considerable attempt to develop constructs and tools to measure brand equity, but there is no universally accepted way to measure it. Most of the researchers have argued that antecedents and dimension of brand equity can be varied in different industries and different contexts. Therefore researchers have addressed this issue with considering antecedents of brand equity in the beer industry in Sri Lanka. The main objective of the study is to identify the most significant antecedents of brand equity in Sri Lankan beer market. Aaker's well-known brand equity model was used for developing conceptual framework. Survey method was used to gather primary data from 250 selected customers in age group 18 to 35 years by administrating detailed questionnaire. Structural equation Modeling was employed to investigate the causal relationships among the four dimensions of brand equity and overall brand equity in respective industry. Reliability test was carried out and Cronbach's Alpha values of every question items were found that a good interring reliability exist with the data. The results indicated that brand association and brand loyalty has direct relationship with brand equity of Sri Lankan beer market and perceived quality and brand awareness has indirect relationship. Therefore this paper shows that brand managers and marketing planners of beer manufacturers should consider the relative importance of brand equity dimensions in their overall brand equity evaluation, and should concentrate their efforts primarily on building brand loyalty and image.","[Wanninayake, W.

We propose a two-country Romer model of endogenous growth in which the South is endowed with the stock of an essential polluting non-renewable resource and world economic growth is driven by a northern research sector. We consider the stock of pollution as affecting global welfare. First, we characterize the optimal environmental taxation policies. Second, we examine the impacts of national taxes. Their time profile determines the extraction path, the dynamics of pollution accumulation and that of world output. Their respective levels entail inter-country interactions by altering the efficiency of the world resource allocation, the tax revenues and the resource rents. We study isolatedly the distortional and distributional effects of local taxes. Then, we completely assess the overall impact of a unilateral tax increase. Finally, we find that, even if heterogeneous countries coordinate their taxation policies to correct the global environmental problem, their divergent strategic interests cause another global, non-environmental distortion in the allocation of the resource.","[Daubanes, Julien] ETHZ, CER ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich, ZUE F12, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Grimaud, Andre] Toulouse Sch Econ, IDEI, Toulouse, France; [Grimaud, Andre] Toulouse Sch Econ, LERNA, TSE, Toulouse, France; [Grimaud, Andre] Toulouse Business Sch, ESCT, Toulouse, France",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; TBS Education,"Daubanes, J (通讯作者)，ETHZ, CER ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich, ZUE F12, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",jdaubanes@ethz.ch,,,,,,,32,18,19,1,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We analyze how and when a simpler, but coarser, elicitation method may be preferred to the more complex, but finer, one. Results indicate that the more complex measure has overall superior predictive accuracy, but its downside is that subjects exhibit noisier behavior. Our main result is that subjects' numerical skills can help better assess this tradeoff: the simpler task may be preferred for subjects who exhibit low numeracy, as it generates less noisy behavior but similar predictive accuracy. For subjects with higher numerical skills, the greater predictive accuracy of the more complex task more than outweighs the larger noise. We also explore preference heterogeneity and provide methodological suggestions for future work.","[Rojas, Christian] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Resource Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Dave, Chetan] New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Eckel, Catherine C.] Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, Richardson, TX 75080 USA; [Johnson, Cathleen A.] Univ Arizona, Norton Sch Family & Consumer Sci, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; University of Arizona,"Rojas, C (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Resource Econ, 219 Stockbridge Hall, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",cd86@nyu.edu; eckelc@utdallas.edu; cathleen@email.arizona.edu; rojas@resecon.umass.edu,,"Eckel, Catherine/0000-0003-1583-5214",,,,,33,253,288,2,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

In particular, we describe economic analysis of policy options designed to help the European Union (EU) to achieve its objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent and increasing the share of renewable energy to 20 percent by 2020. This analysis looked at cost-effectiveness and emission trading options as well as equity issues. We also discuss an economic analysis of policy options for including carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The analysis finds that CCS could result in significant cost savings. The additional costs of making CCS mandatory or using subsidies were also estimated. Economic assessments prepared for the revision of the national emission ceiling directive suggest that air pollution objectives can be met at modest costs and that monetary benefits exceed costs. The assessments also find that limiting the additional costs for poorer Member States does not increase overall costs significantly and that when limited to regional zones, emissions trading of air pollutants could save costs but might lead to hot spots.","[Delbeke, J.; Klaassen, G.; van Ierland, T.; Zapfel, P.] Commiss European Communities, DG Environm, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium",,"Delbeke, J (通讯作者)，Commiss European Communities, DG Environm, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium.",gerardus.klaassen@ec.europa.eu,,,,,,,17,13,13,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1750-6816,,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.
