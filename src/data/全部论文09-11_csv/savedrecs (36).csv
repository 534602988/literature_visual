The liberalisation of migration policy would induce an additional 1.80-2.98% of the total EU workforce to change their country of location, with most of migrant workers relocating from the East to the West. The average net migration rate is decreasing in the level of integration, suggesting that from an economic point of view no regulatory policy responses are necessary to labour migration in the enlarged EU.","[Kancs, d'Artis] DG Joint Res Ctr, European Commiss, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium; [Kancs, d'Artis] Catholic Univ Leuven LICOS, Louvain, Belgium; [Kancs, d'Artis] Econ & Econometr Res Inst EERI, Louvain, Belgium",European Commission Joint Research Centre; KU Leuven,"Kancs, D (通讯作者)，DG Joint Res Ctr, European Commiss, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium.",d'artis.kancs@ec.europa.eu,"Kancs, d'Artis/K-3374-2014","Kancs, d'Artis/0000-0002-8514-725X",,,,,22,5,5,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1748-7870,,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

The most valued assets are human resources, whose development is increasingly considered to be the key competitive advantage within the new global environment. The aim of this research is to evaluate the current status of the human resource management and to assess the functioning of the human resource management in relation to the desired corporate culture. Primary data were obtained from 60 small and medium-sized enterprises with the use of the questionnaire method. This study is a part of the research project GAJU 068/2010/S titled Process Management and its possible implementation in small and medium-sized enterprises. The results confirm the growing importance of developing human potential in the surveyed enterprises. Finally, we can say that human resource management is dealt with in most of the surveyed enterprises, but it seems that continuous human resources development is usually hindered by insufficiently developed corporate culture.","[Krninska, Ruzena; Dusek, Radim] Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Econ, Dept Management, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Krninská, R (通讯作者)，Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Econ, Dept Management, Studentska 13, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.",krninska@ef.jcu.cz; dusekr00@ef.jcu.cz,"Dusek, Radim/AAG-3982-2021","Dusek, Radim/0000-0003-1381-0064",,,,,20,0,0,1,7,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-2196-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,189,195,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000338036100019,0

Specific regional patterns of highly exploitative agrarian capitalist developments and the role of agro-commercial capital are analysed by the books. The essay argues that the agrarian crisis is class specific and that the capitalist farming classes are, in the main, able to successfully accumulate, although uneven development across India makes generalization difficult. The review concludes with some overall perspectives on agrarian transition in India.","Univ London Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Dev Studies, London WC1H 0XG, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Lerche, J (通讯作者)，Univ London Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Dev Studies, Thornhaugh St, London WC1H 0XG, England.",jl2@soas.ac.uk,,,,,,,26,48,51,1,13,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1471-0358,,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

We test two economic hypotheses on the connection between venture capital investment and subsequent firm performance. We find that lagged VC investments scaled by industry assets are negatively related to subsequent firm stock returns after adjusting for other factors. However, not all firms are equally impacted. We find that financially constrained firms suffer the most when new VC money pours into an industry. Firms receiving VC money are active in patent creation which appears to increase innovation pressures on established companies. It appears that the market is slow to incorporate the information contained in the venture capital investments.","[Loughran, Tim] Univ Notre Dame, Mendoza Coll Business, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",University of Notre Dame,"Loughran, T (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Mendoza Coll Business, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",Loughran.9@nd.edu,,,,,,,22,1,3,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1542-7560,,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

We extend previous studies by considering not only single but also multifactor models, and by taking into account some of the prescriptions for improving empirical tests suggested by Lewellen. Nagel and Shanken (2010). Our results reveal that SDF/GMM first-stage estimators lead to lower pricing errors than OLS, while SDF/GMM second stage estimators display higher pricing errors than the classical Beta GLS method. While Jagannathan and Wang (2002), and Cochrane (2005) conclude that there are no differences when estimating and testing by the Beta and SDF/GMM methods for the CAPM, we show that their conclusion cannot be extensible for multifactor models. Moreover, the Beta methods (OLS and GLS) seem to dominate the SDF/GMM (first and second stages) procedure in terms of estimators' properties. These results are consistent across benchmark portfolios and sample periods. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The overall result of the questionnaire survey was fmding that managers of small and medium enterprises knew threats relatively well, and they were aware of them but they did not prepare themselves in advance for their negative consequences, the preparation for crisis situations in those small enterprises was not considered normal part of manager's work.","[Mikusova, Marie] Tech Univ Ostrava, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Mikusová, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ, Fac Econ, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",marie.mikusova@vsb.cz,"Mikusova, Marie/H-2967-2018","Mikusova, Marie/0000-0003-0183-806X",,,,,6,0,0,0,0,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9173-2,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,12.0,,,,,,45,49,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8ZM,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000392895700009,0

The aim of this paper is to evaluate the role of the G-20 in the restructuring of the international financial and monetary system within the context of global governance reform. To this end, effectiveness and legitimacy of the G-20 are analyzed by utilizing the global governance concept. The discussions and negotiations among the developed and developing countries about the restructuring of the global financial architecture are evaluated. International and domestic political,obstacles to global governance reforms and representativeness, coherence and compliance deficits of the 0-20 are investigated. It was concluded that the financial crisis enhanced the importance of global governance and the G-20 came out as the organization that could abate the representativeness, coherence and compliance deficits of the global governance system.

Several special cases of a translog production function are estimated on the basis of a data set consisting of monthly time series for the period January 1996 to December 2003. The analysis focuses on key parameters of the production technology, such as the elasticity of scale, the elasticity of substitution of production factors and the rate of technical progress. The estimation results show that neoclassical production functions are less suited for the analysis than the unrestricted translog production function. Because of the special situation of the Ukrainian milk processing industry during the transition process, it can even be misleading to describe the production technology by a neoclassical production function. Thus, the marginal product of labour turns out to be negative, which is incompatible with neoclassical production theory. However, in view of the low capacity utilization this is not implausible. The estimation results with respect to the elasticity of scale cannot be interpreted unambiguously. The rate of technical progress is 2.7 % p. a. in the second half of the investigation period, while in the first half it is negative. The size of the Allen elasticities of substitution of production factors is calculated to be almost negligible.","[Perekhozhuk, Oleksandr] Leibniz Inst Agrarentwicklung Mittel & Osteuropa, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Grings, Michael] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Halle, Saale, Germany",Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Perekhozhuk, O (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Agrarentwicklung Mittel & Osteuropa, Theodor Lieser Str 2, D-06120 Halle, Germany.",perekhozhuk@iamo.de,"Perekhozhuk, Oleksandr/J-9964-2017",,,,,,50,2,2,0,10,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

This paper aims to present, from a critical perspective, the balanced scorecard (BSC), adapted to the assessment of intellectual capital, in order to help the decision making process. Given its flexible nature, this instrument can be used to focus the strategy of a company regarding its intellectual capital, taking into considerations the various organizational conditions that can modify indicators in different ways. In the same time, the BSC is an internal instrument and is mainly adapted to the specific conditions in each company, facts which make practical approaches difficult to compare. In these conditions, the main limitation is that the paper is primarily a theoretical study and therefore it is not certain that in practical situations companies will necessarily adopt the theoretical perspectives which characterize both the balance scorecard and the intellectual capital.","[Roxana-Manuela, Dicu] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,,rm.dicu@yahoo.com,"DICU, Roxana/W-4539-2017",,,,,,21,0,0,0,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-6-9,,,,2011,,,,,,,1757,1765,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEO28,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000317550001061,0

Specific random sampling technique is used in the selection of 415 households, which are divided into 23 districts in Bud Rain province. The result on vulnerability to poverty analysis is done by feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) method. Upon subjecting the data to analysis, the first stage of the OLS reveals that 61.17% of the variation in log consumption (a measure of well-being) can be explained by the following factor: household size, household size square, aged dependency ratio, family member: bachelor education and above, number of children go to school, unemployed household head, monetary assets, tangible asset value, ratio of rent of total expenditure, drought in the future, number of last year risk occurred (2009), prolong sickness of household head (2009), chronic disease of other working family member (2009), flood (2009). The rest, 38.83%, can be attributed to the disturbance term. The results of the regression model by FGLS present the determinants of vulnerability to poverty and variance of consumption. The comparison of the household consumption with Thailand poverty line in the year of 2009, that was at 1,586 Baht per capita per month. The rural headcount ratio in terms of household expected consumption less than poverty line is relatively high at 65.8%. The result indicates two groups of vulnerable households, which are, high and low vulnerable households. The estimates show that about 44.34% of households are vulnerable to poverty. The comparison of observed poverty status based on vulnerability index present that 75.2% of farm households are poor, whereas another 24.8% are non-poor.","[Sricharoen, Thitiwan] Khon Kaen Univ, Fac Management Sci, Dept Econ, Khon Kaen, Thailand",Khon Kaen University,"Sricharoen, T (通讯作者)，Khon Kaen Univ, Fac Management Sci, Dept Econ, Khon Kaen, Thailand.",thitiwans@googlemail.com,,,"Faculty of Management Science, Khon Kaen University","Faculty of Management Science, Khon Kaen University","First and foremost, I would like to express a special thank to Prof. Dr. Gertrud Buchenrieder who is encouraging me to continue this research.

The average underpricing of Chinese IPOs is 247%, the highest of any major world market. We model this extreme underpricing with a supply-demand analytical framework that captures critical institutional features of China's primary market, and then empirically test this model using a sample of 1377 IPOs listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges between 1992 and 2004. We find that Chinese IPO underpricing is principally caused by government intervention with IPO pricing regulations and the control of IPO share supplies. Besides the regulatory underpricing, this paper also documents some specific investment risks of IPOs in China's stock market. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Measuring trends in market work andleisure using 1976-2006 Japanese time-use survey Using Japanese time-use data from the Survey on Time Use and Leisure Activities (STULA), this paper measures trends in average hours worked (market work) and leisure for Japanese over the past three decades. OECD reports at least a 15% decline in market work for Japan since the 1970s. However, holding demographic changes constant, we found that market work per week increased from the 1970s until mid-1980s, and has been relatively stable for the last two decades for both male and female full-time workers. Furthermore, although the market work per week remained relatively constant since the mid-1980s, we found a significant change in the allocation of time to market work within the week during the period. Specifically, when dividing samples into weekdays (Monday-Friday) and weekends (Saturday and Sunday), average hours spent for market work per weekday among full-time males increased by 0.4 h since the mid-1980s, whereas a significant decline in market work on Saturday was observed. This suggests that people shifted their work time from Saturday to weekdays in response to the reduced work week introduced by the amendment of the Labor Standards Act at the end of 1980s. In the meantime, commuting time and home production had decreased by 3 h since the mid-1980s for full-time female workers, indicating that the average hours of leisure had increased for females even though market work remained the same. Interestingly, however, hours for sleep declined consistently over the last three decades, resulting in a 3-4 h reduction per week for both male and female workers. Lastly, a comparison of Japanese and US time-use data suggests that Japanese work much longer than their American counterparts. On average, Japanese males work 10 h longer per week, and Japanese females 7 h longer, than Americans, even after adjusting for demographic differences between the countries. J. Japanese Int.

J,"Marsden, G; Rye, T",,,,"Marsden, Greg; Rye, Tom",,,The governance of transport and climate change,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate change; Governance; Institutions; Transport,CITIES; PLANS,"Climate change is one of the key global policy issues of our time. Transport is the sector from which it has been hardest to cut emissions and, to make substantial progress in the future, action will be required at all levels of government from international to local. The governance of transport within this already challenging arena is further complicated by the existence of different structures for the management of transport modes and variations in formal governance structures across countries and regions. This paper examines the prospect for deep cuts in CO(2) emissions from transport through an examination of the key policy levers for change and considering the governance issues that surround them. The focus of the paper is the United Kingdom, and in particular England and Scotland. The UK is the first country to have a legally binding internal obligation to meet carbon dioxide reduction targets and this has prompted significant activity in both governance institutions and delivery. The research uses a multi-level governance framework to understand the policy environment in England and Scotland, capturing both the range of spatial actors and the influence of sectoral actors in what is a complex polity. It is concluded that the policy approach currently appears constrained by a desire to divide accountability by formal institutional structures, thus failing to tackle the dispersed nature of travel and the national and international nature of businesses. There is currently a lack of clarity about the tiering of responsibilities between spatial levels and there is therefore a comparative lack of commitment to the potential for demand management and travel reduction strategies to contribute to carbon reduction. Carbon reduction policies are also influenced by strong industry lobbies whose goals may not be fully aligned with carbon reduction strategies. The profusion of actors engaged in climate change policy seems to dilute rather than promote effective policy making. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

By focusing on policy-makers' responses to the emergence of speculative pressure on their currencies, we argue that the effect of democratic institutions on exchange-rate stability is likely to be conditioned by the officially announced exchange-rate regime. Officially fixed exchange rates are the main instrument of autocrats to signal commitment to long-term stability. Autocratic governments with strictly fixed exchange rates are thus more likely to defend their exchange rates than autocrats with an intermediate regime because the latter implicitly signal that they care less about monetary stability. In contrast, democrats defend more often in intermediately than in fully fixed official regimes by using a combination of external and internal adjustments, which reduce the negative effects of a devaluation on voters. Our analysis of 189 currency crises between 1975 and 1999 supports this conditional effect.","[Sattler, Thomas] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Walter, Stefanie] Heidelberg Univ, D-6900 Heidelberg, Germany",University College Dublin; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Sattler, T (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Dublin 4, Ireland.",thomas.sattler@ucd.ie,"Walter, Stefanie/A-5418-2012","Walter, Stefanie/0000-0002-0804-5647; Sattler, Thomas/0000-0002-0655-2135",,,,,58,8,11,0,11,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

J,"Bresnahan, T; Yin, PL",,,,"Bresnahan, Timothy; Yin, Pai-Ling",,,Reallocating innovative resources around growth bottlenecks,INDUSTRIAL AND CORPORATE CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MARKET; PRODUCT; TECHNOLOGIES,"Economy-wide increasing returns to scale embodied in a general purpose technology (GPT) and its applications are often a key source of long-run growth. Yet the successful exploitation of increasing returns calls for coordination on a particular technological direction, reducing flexibility and choice ex post and potentially creating a growth bottleneck. When the bottleneck is controlled by a single firm, the resulting entry barriers reduce the ability of demanders to choose superior, alternative technologies. We examine how such a growth bottleneck can eventually be overcome under certain key conditions. Demand must be fundamentally diverse so that the original GPT does not serve all demanders. Firms barred from entry into the primary GPT market can then reallocate innovative resources to create new markets to meet the unserved demand. The demand in these new markets must be valuable enough (even if not as valuable as in the primary GPT market) to generate a positive-feedback cycle that results in considerable technical advance in the alternative GPT. This ultimately can lead to indirect entry by the alternative GPT into the original GPT market if and when it becomes strong enough to compete with the original GPT. This sequence of (i) increasing returns to scale around a GPT, (ii) reallocation of innovative resources around growth bottlenecks, and (iii) indirect entry has growth implications. A large contribution to growth follows the exploitation of increasing returns to scale in the original GPT. Much later, another large contribution to growth follows when demand is finally met by an alternative, competitive GPT. Between these two periods falls a period of lesser contributions to growth due to the dominant firm bottleneck. The market-based resolution of the bottleneck is not merely a theoretical possibility. We illustrate the role of this sequence in the two most important technologies for automating white-collar work of the past 50 years.","[Bresnahan, Timothy] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Yin, Pai-Ling] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",Stanford University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Bresnahan, T (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",tbres@stanford.edu; pyin@mit.edu,,,,,,,40,8,9,1,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

The new bank initially decreases the loan rate further but eventually ratchets it up sharply. Other loan conditions follow a similar economically relevant pattern.

The intraday standard deviation of the federal funds rate is also affected by operational outages.

The green revolution successfully negotiated two tightropes: agricultural productivity increases were larger than the fall in prices that resulted from producing more food; and output per hectare rose faster than output per worker, thus increasing the demand for labor. The current challenge is to generate technology that helps poor farmers in low potential areas. Since research capacity is increasingly private, incentives to produce the needed technology are needed, perhaps through contracts to produce varieties with specific characteristics. Development of seeds needs complementary work on water, for which economists, plant scientists, and engineers need to pool their skills. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Using firm-level tests, we identify a number of characteristics of firms that engage in opportunistic behavior. We observe that large issuers located in developed markets with investment-grade ratings and low cash flow characterize those firms that are responsive to covered borrowing rate differences across currencies. Corporate responsiveness to uncovered borrowing rate differences appears more general. We observe that although the gains firms achieve through opportunistic currency denomination are economically significant, the yield differential tends to systematically decline after issuance.

We contribute to the trade-motivated set of papers on location choices by adding the domestic country in the choice set, while accounting for firm's heterogeneity in the choices. Our econometric results using French firm-level data show an important home bias in manufacturing investment decisions.

Tatsuyoshi. and Shimotsu. Katsumi-Decline in the persistence of real exchange rates, but not sufficient for purchasing power parity The paper investigates the possibility of decline in the persistence of real exchange rates, or deviations from PPP. To this end, we test the null hypothesis of no decline in the PPP deviation persistence between two subsamples using a fractional integration framework. The test rejects the null at the 10% significance level for nine out of 17 countries, providing solid evidence for a decline in the persistence of real exchange rates However, the decline is not sufficient for PPP, meaning we fail to reject the unit root hypothesis even in the latter period for all 17 countries. In addition, our rolling-window estimates show that the real exchange rate of many countries have experienced a sharp drop in their persistence once we use samples starting from the mid-1980s. Finally, we examine the relationship between the dynamics of PPP deviation persistence and several economic variables and confirm that the speed of convergence of PPP deviations is highly related to economic/financial integration and world economic stabilization.

We use 1,770 responses to an online stated preference survey. The domestic costs in our survey's policy choice scenarios are expressed as a set of randomized shares across four different payment vehicles, and the international cost shares are randomized across four groups of countries. We also elicit respondents' perceptions of the likely regressivity of climate change impacts under a policy of business-as-usual. WTP is higher when larger cost shares are borne by parties deemed to bear a greater responsibility for mitigation, and when respondents believe (and care) that the impacts of climate change may be borne disproportionately by the world's poor. That WTP for an environmental policy depends on the distributional consequences of the policy is an unsettling result: efficiency assessments are typically assumed to be separate from equity considerations in most benefit-cost analyses.","[Cai, Beilei; Cameron, Trudy Ann] 1285 Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Gerdes, Geoffrey R.] Board Governors Fed Reserve Syst, Washington, DC USA",University of Oregon; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Cameron, TA (通讯作者)，1285 Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, 435 PLC, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",cameron@uoregon.edu,"Cameron, Trudy Ann/A-2952-2008",,National Science Foundation [SES-9818875],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The data for this study were collected with funding from the National Science Foundation (SES-9818875).

The nonlinear solution method reveals that, depending on velocity, the disinflationary boom found by Ball (1994) may disappear even under perfect credibility and that early output losses may be much larger than previously thought.

Several meta-analyzes have examined the determinants of household water demand in industrialized countries, but little effort has been made to synthesize the growing body of literature evaluating household water demand in developing countries. This article reviews what is known and what is missing from that literature thus far. Analysis of demand for water in developing countries is complicated by abundant evidence that, contrary to what is observed in most developed countries, households in developing countries have access to, and may use more than one of several types of, water sources. The authors describe the different modeling strategies that researchers have adopted to estimate water demand in developing countries and discuss issues related to data collection. The findings from the literature on the main determinants of water demand in these countries suggest that, despite heterogeneity in the places and time periods studied, most estimates of own-price elasticity of water from private connections are in the range from -0.3 to -0.6, close to what is usually reported for industrialized countries. The empirical findings on decisions relating to household water sources are much less robust and should be a high priority for future research.

We apply Latent Class Analysis to segment consumers in Australia according to their allocation of the 2009 government rebate, which was paid as a tax bonus, across a broad set of expenditure categories. The analysis reveals segments with different spending patterns, including segments we have labeled as 'investors', 'travelers', 'debt-payers', and four other segments.

Observations on an Appropriate Response to the Climate Change Challenge to Development Strategies,WORLD BANK RESEARCH OBSERVER,,,English,Article,,,,,,,DAMAGE COSTS; UNCERTAINTY; POLICY; DECISIONS,"Climate change is a new and important challenge to development strategies. In light of the current literature a framework for assessing responses to this challenge is provided. The presence of climate change makes it necessary to at least review development strategies-even in apparently nonclimate-sensitive and nonpolluting sectors. There is a need for an integrated portfolio of actions ranging from avoiding emissions (mitigation) to coping with impacts (adaptation) and to consciously accepting residual damages. Proactive (ex ante) adaptation is critical, but subject to risks of regrets when the magnitude or location of damages is uncertain. Uncertainty on location favors nonsite-specific actions, or reactive (ex post) adaptation. However, some irreversible losses cannot be compensated for. Thus, mitigation might be in many cases the cheapest long-term solution to climate change problems and the most important to avoid thresholds that may trigger truly catastrophic consequences. To limit the risks that budget constraints prevent developing countries from financing reactive adaptation-especially since climate shocks might erode the fiscal base-rainy-day funds may have to be developed within countries and at the global level for transfer purposes. Finally, more research is required on the impacts of climate change, on modeling the interrelations between mitigation and adaptation, and on operationalizing the framework.

We construct a new measure, economies of diversification, and compare the results to those of the more conventional focus indices, which are based on the sum of squares of shares in different products or regions. Diversification is captured in four dimensions: loans, deposits, assets, and geography. We find that all four dimensions of diversification are associated with reduced profits and higher costs. These results are robust regardless of alternative measures of diversification and performance. Furthermore, we observe that banks with foreign ownership (both majority and minority ownership) and banks with conglomerate affiliation are associated with fewer diseconomies of diversification, suggesting that foreign ownership and conglomerate affiliation may play important mitigating roles. This analysis may provide important implications for bank managers and regulators in China as well as in other emerging economies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We consider the regulation by a three-part tax policy: the government sets an emission tax, a refunding scheme, and an entry-license tax. In contrast to the case of the two-part tax-refund policy under no entry, we show that even if it is impossible to obtain subsidies from outside, the first-best outcome is always attained. Further, the government's budget constraint is binding under the optimal schemes.

This study analyses factors influencing rural household labour allocation and supply decisions for competing livelihood activities, including wetland activities. The analyses employ the agricultural household framework, which takes into account that rural households are both producers and consumers. Results show that poor households are more dependent on wetland products and have less capacity to participate in off-farm opportunities, and hence allocate most of their labour time to farm and wetland activities. Better access to education is critical for enhancing employment potential in the non-farm sector, reducing pressure on wetland resources. Government policies that enhance access to education enable the poor to diversify into non-farm livelihood sources and provide necessary incentives for conserving wetland habitat.

This relationship is an important indicator of the economic impact of new technology adoption. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the literature on general purpose technologies as well as on the economic consequences of information and communications technology diffusion and develop a framework to empirically assess the impact of broadband deployment on the productivity. Our results find a positive relationship between broadband deployment and the carriers' productivity and suggest that encouraging the deployment of broadband technologies, in addition to the benefits to consumers and firms at the receiving end of the new technology, create the potential for better technological efficiencies and increased productivity for the deploying firms. The benefits can be enhanced as the firms studied operate in two-sided markets where the network effects brought about by the multitude of interconnections can be substantial because of possible second-order spillovers of productivity.","[Majumdar, S.

These flows cause inventory imbalances. This study models price setting in markets such as foreign exchange, U.S. treasury bonds, European sovereign bonds, and the London Stock Exchange, where market makers have multiple instruments to smooth inventory imbalances and update priors about asset values. Estimating a dealer pricing model with multiple instruments for inventory control and information-gathering yields support for what at times have been elusive inventory and asymmetric information effects. The model presented yields direct measures of the structural-liquidity cost parameters faced by market makers, akin to Kyle's Lambda. For example, the estimates presented suggest that a $10 million incoming purchase pushes price up by roughly one basis point, and dealers expect to immediately lay off one-third of every incoming order. Compared with estimates of price setting in single dealer markets, price shading is found to have a smaller role in inventory management and information effects are shown to be stronger. Hence, estimating traditional microstructure models (based on only one market maker per asset) on data from asset markets where market makers have multiple instruments misses information from sources other than incoming order flows, and overemphasizes price shading in managing inventories.

Recent doping scandals in sports as well as forgery and plagiarism scandals in academia have been partially explained by competitive pressures, which suggests a link between competition and cheating. In our experiment subjects conduct a task where they have the possibility to make use of illegitimate tools to better their results. We find that women react much stronger to competitive pressure by increasing their cheating activity while there is no overall sex difference in cheating. However, the effect of competition on women's cheating behavior is entirely due to the fact that women, on average, are doing worse with respect to the assigned task. Indeed we find that it is the ability of an individual to conduct a particular task and not sex that crucially affects the reaction to competition. Poor performers significantly increase their cheating behavior under competition which may be a face-saving strategy or an attempt to retain a chance of winning. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We show that given that the equilibrium characteristic of a foreign firm's product R&D lies to the left-hand side of its initial level (s) over bar, since the foreign firm has a unit cost advantage and the efficiency of its R&D technology is sufficiently low, a rise in the export subsidy of the domestic country increases a domestic firm's profits and then welfare by extending the degree of horizontal differentiation between the two products.

This paper addresses this question within a model where firms engage in two types of investment: a short-term one; and a long-term one, which contributes more to productivity growth. Because it takes longer to complete, long-term investment has a relatively less cyclical return; but it also has a higher liquidity risk. The first effect ensures that the share of long-term investment to total investment is countercyclical when financial markets are perfect; the second implies that this share may turn procyclical when firms face tight credit constraints. A novel propagation mechanism thus emerges: through its effect on the cyclical composition of investment, tighter credit can lead to both higher volatility and lower mean growth.

We discuss some possible intuitive reasons for why there may be differences in the impact of outsourcing across the three countries, based on labour market institutions.","[Geishecker, Ingo] Fac Econ Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Goerg, Holger] Univ Kiel, Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24098 Kiel, Germany; [Goerg, Holger] CEPR, London, England; [Geishecker, Ingo] Univ Gottingen, D-3400 Gottingen, Germany; [Geishecker, Ingo] Aarhus Sch Business, Aarhus, Denmark; [Munch, Jakob Roland] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Munch, Jakob Roland] EPRU, Copenhagen, Denmark",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Kiel; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Gottingen; Aarhus University; University of Copenhagen,"Geishecker, I (通讯作者)，Fac Econ Sci, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",ingo.geishecker@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de,,"Munch, Jakob Roland/0000-0002-4387-1039",,,,,23,20,21,2,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

This study investigates the extent to which chief executive officers (CEOs) trade pay for pension benefits. For a sample of S&P 500 CEOs, I find that an additional dollar of pension benefits is associated with a 48 cent decrease in pay. Although the tradeoff estimate is significantly different From zero, it is also significantly less than the anticipated rate of dollar-for-dollar, especially for CEOs with relatively more bargaining power over their boards of directors. This implies that the implicit price of pension benefits decreases with the CEO's bargaining power, so pooling datasets on CEOs with varying degrees of power blurs the size of the pay pension tradeoff.","Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Gerakos, J (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",jgerakos@chicagobooth.edu,,,,,,,32,11,13,0,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

Specifically, it aims to provide a convincing answer to the newly posed question of the existence of individual differences among referees in terms of the home advantage (Boyko. Boyko, & Boyko, 2007; Johnston, 2008). Using multilevel modelling on a large and representative dataset we find that (1) the home advantage effect differs significantly among referees, and (2) this relationship is moderated by the size of the crowd. These new results suggest that a part of the home advantage is due to the effect of the crowd on the referees, and that some referees are more prone to be influenced by the crowd than others. This provides strong evidence to indicate that referees are a significant contributing factor to the home advantage. The implications of these findings are discussed both in terms of the relevant social psychological research, and with respect to the selection, assessment, and training of referees.

Using the standard realized volatility estimator, we find that one can sample dollar/euro returns as frequently as once every 15 to 20s without contaminating estimates of integrated volatility; 10-year Treasury note returns may be sampled as frequently as once every 2 to 3 min on days without U.S. macroeconomic announcements, and as frequently as once every 40s on announcement days. Using a simple realized kernel estimator, this sampling frequency can be increased to once every 2 to 5s for dollar/euro returns and to about once every 30 to 40s for T-note returns. These sampling frequencies. especially in the case of dollar/euro returns, are much higher than those that are generally recommended in the empirical literature on realized volatility in equity markets.

There are however limitations of some widely-used risk management methods that either calculate risk measures under the Gaussian distributional assumption or involve numerical difficulty. The primary aim of this paper is to present a realistic and fast method, GHICA, which overcomes the limitations in multivariate risk analysis. The idea is to first retrieve independent components (ICs) out of the observed high-dimensional time series and then individually and adaptively fit the resulting ICs in the generalized hyperbolic (GH) distributional framework. For the volatility estimation of each IC, the local exponential smoothing technique is used to achieve the best possible accuracy of estimation. Finally, the fast Fourier transformation technique is used to approximate the density of the portfolio returns. The proposed GHICA method is applicable to covariance estimation as well. It is compared with the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) method based on the simulated data with d = 50 GH distributed components. We further implement the GHICA method to calculate risk measures given 20-dimensional German DAX portfolios and a dynamic exchange rate portfolio. Several alternative methods are considered as well to compare the accuracy of calculation with the GHICA one. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Consistent with the notion that competition mitigates managerial slack, we find that while firms in non-competitive industries experience a significant drop in operating performance after the laws' passage, firms in competitive industries experience no significant effect. When we examine which agency problem competition mitigates, we find evidence in support of a quiet-life hypothesis. Input costs, wages, and overhead costs all increase after the laws' passage, and only so in non-competitive industries. Similarly, when we conduct event studies around the dates of the first newspaper reports about the BC laws, we find that while firms in non-competitive industries experience a significant stock price decline, firms in competitive industries experience a small and insignificant stock price impact.

Economic theory predicts complete voluntary disclosure without mandatory rules. This article introduces plans' selection motives to avoid high-risk consumers as a deterrent of full unraveling; if disclosure is expected to attract high-risk members, plans have incentives to withhold information. The empirical analysis shows that while market unraveling was an important mechanism to bring disclosure, it was not complete, and plans in markets with high-risk consumers were less likely to disclose.

I find that a monetary policy contraction leads to a substantial fall in wealth. Nevertheless, while financial wealth effects are of short duration, housing wealth effects are very persistent. After a positive interest rate shock there is a flight towards assets that are less liquid and earn higher rates of return. Moreover, expected inflation seems to be the major source of fluctuations in nominal rates over long periods. Finally, the findings suggest that the money demand function is characterized by small output elasticity and large interest elasticity. By its turn, the estimated policy rule reveals that the monetary authority pays a special attention to developments in monetary aggregates and adopts a vigilant posture regarding financial markets.

The framework is based on prospect theory, in which consumption and saving decisions are based on a reference point rather than on lifetime income. Prospect theory also posits that individuals construct various mental accounts, thereby allowing for households to have multiple saving motives. Since prospect theory does not assume that saving decisions are based on lifetime income, saving horizons are allowed to vary. The emergency and retirement saving motives are found to significantly increase the likelihood of saving regularly. Longer saving horizons are also found to have a highly significant effect on the likelihood of saving, while poor health is shown to have a significantly negative effect on the likelihood of saving. The results show that the saving motives held by households differ by saving horizon, but the exact relationships are unclear. Further research on the link between saving motives, saving horizon, and saving behaviors is needed. It is important for financial professionals and educators to consider a household's saving goals, saving horizon, and health status when making recommendations or developing financial plans.

The model is based on two key processes: the first is that the emergence, growth, decline and renewal of the cluster depend on the technological heterogeneity of firms; the second is that firms have a larger relative absorptive capacity, when they are in the same location, and thus especially localized learning changes heterogeneity: it leads to a technological convergence when learning takes place within the cluster and technological divergence, when learning takes place outside the cluster, yet in the same region.

Per acre rates were 26% greater in west versus east Mississippi. Depending on the decomposition procedure employed, differences in resource endowments accounted for 43% to 69% of the gap. Differences in habitat quality were primarily responsible. Lessors in east Mississippi can improve their rates by reducing lease sizes and shortening contract lengths.

The main purpose of this research is to confirm that the CC coefficient is an appropriate methodology to determine ex post arbitrage opportunities and to maximize ex ante arbitrage profits through the analysis of the price relationship derived from the cost-of-carry model. To increase the robustness of the results and to enable us to generalize our conclusions, this analysis is carried out in consideration of external uncertainty, including the marking-to-market procedure of futures contracts and the transaction cost on the stock index and its futures markets, under several assumptions related to the conditions of transactions. Examining transaction price data on the S&P 500 stock index and its futures markets shows that the CC coefficient gives a good result for ex ante arbitrage profits and is appropriate for analyzing the relationship between the observed stock index futures market price and its theoretical price derived from the cost-of-carry model.

Nevertheless, this pervasive economic activity generates tens of billions of dollars in income a year, worldwide. In order to better understand this seemingly irrational behavior to tip, this study investigates other potential motives for tipping that draw from the behavioral economics and psychology literature. We test several of these motives in the context of tipping car guards in South Africa and find evidence supporting the ideas that tipping is motivated by desires to: reward good quality service, help service workers, and gain social approval.

An exact solution of the algorithm is presented for arbitrary price distributions. Furthermore the algorithm is extended to cover the case of a market neutral portfolio, revealing additional evidence that anchoring is involved in the decision making of market participants. The exposure of arbitrage possibilities created by anchoring gives yet another illustration on the difficulty proving market efficiency by only considering lower order correlations in past price time series.","CNRS, Inst Non Lineaire Nice, F-06560 Valbonne, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Andersen, JV (通讯作者)，CNRS, Inst Non Lineaire Nice, 1361 Route Lucioles, F-06560 Valbonne, France.",vitting@unice.fr,,,,,,,15,17,22,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

High unemployment rates, low incomes and lack of economic opportunities - these are current problems faced by people living in rural areas. This can result in an acceleration of rural to urban migration and altering of population structures. The main aim of this paper is to study the relationship between the depopulation of rural areas and the rate of unemployment in order to detect if the depopulation is caused by high unemployment in these rural areas. A secondary aim is to analyze if the relationship between the migration balance and rate of unemployment is connected with the size of municipality and if there are differences between municipalities located near large cities i.e. suburban villages and the others. Another question is to determine whether there are also other factors that influence depopulation of rural areas? The methodological tool for achieving these aims is an analysis using a Granger causality test based on F-test. The analysis was based on balanced panel data from all Czech municipalities, obtained over the period 2004-08. Analyzed municipalities were divided into four groups: Small (up to 499 inhabitants), Middle (500-999 inhabitants), Big (over 1000 inhabitants) and Suburban villages. The model of panel data used a special configuration of the model with respect to heterogeneity. The proper specification of the model was based on analysis of variance and Hausman test. Results from the analyses indicated that depopulation of the rural area is influenced by the unemployment of rural population and also by the number of economic subjects located in rural areas. Such a relationship is typical in big villages. However in the small ones the number of economic subjects does not influence the depopulation, which is only effected by the unemployment.","[Antouskova, Michaela; Mala, Zdenka; Cervena, Gabriela] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Antousková, M (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",antouskova@pef.czu.cz; malaz@pef.czu.cz; cervena@pef.czu.cz,"Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova/AAO-8608-2021; Trnková, Gabriela/GXV-9406-2022; Trnková, Gabriela/AAF-9882-2021; Havlikova, Michaela/H-5272-2018","Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova/0000-0001-5834-3338; Trnková, Gabriela/0000-0001-5181-5689; Havlikova, Michaela/0000-0002-2694-3862",,,,,11,0,0,0,5,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2123-6,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2010,,,,,,,267,273,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA6AE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000337077600030,0

Since equity funds are typically diversified at the national or international level, we use data on equity fund ownership to proxy for regional home bias. Cross-regional patterns of equity fund ownership are qualitatively consistent with simple portfolio theory: regions with more asymmetric business cycles are more diversified because they have higher fund participation rates (the extensive margin of diversification) and higher average holdings of equity funds (diversification's intensive margin). Also, fund holdings increase with the exposure of non-tradable income components (such as labor or entrepreneurial income) to regional shocks. Finally, interregional consumption risk sharing increases with fund holdings and this effect seems strongest when participation is widespread. Increased equity market participation could substantially improve interregional risk sharing. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Although interest in remodeling has presently staggered with the recent transition of policies towards the activation of reconstruction in Korea, remodeling is evaluated as a better technique than reconstruction in the aspect of saving resources and preserving the environment. Moreover, according to the policy that was implemented in the late-1980s to supply 2 million apartment-oriented housing units, 2. 9 million households require remodeling in apartments more than 15 years old by 2009 standards. The high gravity mandates the necessity for solutions,which collectively elevates the necessity of remodeling. Furthermore, since residences have a strong concept as assets and investment targets, it is of utmost importance to satisfy the residents, who are the owners of these residences. Based on such background, this research presents a guideline on plan extension remodeling based on the analysis of needs of the residents. The guideline presented in this research collectively presents the resident need analysis database with the plan techniques to allow the planner to delicately reflect the needs of the residents without the hassle of complex procedures,in order to enhance the satisfaction rate of the remodeling,and ultimately contribute to the activation of remodeling.","[Choi, Jaepil; Kang, Hyojeong; Lee, Yunjae; Lee, Jungwon] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Architecture, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),,jpchoi@snu.ac.kr; sonyeo3@hanmail.net; deitzl@snu.ac.kr; luckyboy55@hanmail.net,"kang, hyojeong/HRB-8066-2023",,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,CHINA ARCHITECTURE & BUILDING PRESS,BEIJING,"BAIWANZHUANG XICHENGGU, BEIJING, 10037, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-112-12328-5,,,,2010,,,,,,,287,303,,,,,,17,Economics; Urban Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,BRM62,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000283112400021,0

The empirical analysis shows that college enrollment varies by family income-in particular, low-income students with demonstrated financial need are less likely to enroll at private colleges, controlling for other factors including race and financial aid. Grant aid tends to have a moderating effect but the amount of aid under the existing college pricing and financial aid system appears to be inadequate. This finding provides support for recent revamping of financial aid offerings to low-income students by some highly selective private colleges. In addition, the results suggest that while family income appears to be a strong determinant of enrollment at these colleges, race does not seem to play a role.

The public debate about its future post 2013 was launched in April 2010 and a formal Commission Communication on the future of the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) is due in the Autumn/Winter 2010. Our paper contributes to this debate by re-visiting the CAP Bond. We argue that the CAP Bond should be considered as a core element of the development of the CAP and could contribute to the solution of several problems of the existing policy. We argue that the compensatory logic still embedded in the current CAP is now a hindrance to further development of the CAP, and is a major cause of debilitating uncertainty for the industry and its farmers. The Bond provides a coherent adaptive option for both the policy and the European agricultural sector and its farmers. Among the Bond's chief advantages is its capacity to reduce the uncertainty about both the needs for future policy intervention and about individual farmers' future family and business strategies.","Newcastle Univ, Sch Agr Food & Rural Dev, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Harvey, D (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Agr Food & Rural Dev, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",david.harvey@ncl.ac.uk,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2123-6,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2010,,,,,,,57,69,,,,,,13,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA6AE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000337077600008,0

The paper deals with a proposal of the methodological instrument of regions comparison which enable ranking of regions and their categorization in light of state and changes of selected regional indicators over time. This methodology is based on multivariate statistical analysis using composite indicators. The aim is to create methodology which is easy for potential user, which is applicable for all selected variables and which reflects regional disparities. In the paper are explored different methodologies for aggregating indicators into a composite indicator acceptable for regional development. Author stress the need for multivariate analysis prior to the aggregation of the individual indicators. Using multivariate point of view on regional development is possible to detect relations among indicators and regions. Finally utilization of this methodology is verified on evaluation of regional development of Czech regions based on selected indicators from Czech regional development strategy 2007 - 2013.

There is less consensus on whether expanding access to consumer credit helps borrowers, particularly when loans are extended at high interest rates. Popular skepticism about unproductive, usurious lending is fueled by research highlighting behavioral biases that may induce overborrowing. We estimate the impacts of expanding access to consumer credit at a 200% annual percentage rate (APR) using a field experiment and follow-up data collection. The randomly assigned marginal loans produced significant net benefits for borrowers across a wide range of outcomes. There is also some evidence that the loans were profitable.","[Zinman, Jonathan] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Karlan, Dean] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Dartmouth College; Yale University,"Zinman, J (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, HB 6106, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",jzinman@dartmouth.edu,"de Groot, M/A-2025-2012","karlan, dean/0000-0003-0164-1398",,,,,42,261,329,4,94,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

In this paper we explore the impact of decoupling on the productivity of Irish dairy farms using a modified version of Olley and Pakes methodology for productivity estimation. We isolate the effect of decoupling on productivity by controlling for other policy changes that have occurred alongside decoupling.

The statistical analysis shows that the cities in question do not have severe housing affordability issue as a whole. The empirical findings exhibit that the house price has played a more important role in housing affordability than household income. Secondly, the magnitude of housing possession has exerted a great impact upon housing affordability. Accordingly, developing more affordable houses is the most effective approach to mitigate the housing affordability issue in China over the current period. Thirdly,I find that the origination year of the housing reform significantly alleviates the housing affordability issue. Fourthly, the discrepancies of the housing affordability between cities do not derive from the differentials of the population growth rate.

Export price data during the post-1991 economic reforms period is disaggregated at the two-digit industry level and using a novel methodology in the ERPT literature (cointegration for heterogeneous panels) cross-industry differences in adjustment are identified. We observe that there is clear evidence of incomplete ERPT to prices in India's export markets, after having controlled for the level of exchange rate volatility and domestic inflation as an indicator of variations in marginal cost. The empirical results indicate that monthly data reflect more incomplete ERPT to destination market prices, relative to annual data, in which all the short run rigidities are more likely to have been adjusted. Thus studies that use higher frequency data are more likely to find incomplete ERPT in the short-run, even in the context of an emerging market economy. In the long-run, incomplete ERPT subsists in a few industries for both data frequencies. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The analysis leads to the conclusion that the accounting framework in force in these countries is not dominated, but tends to emerge as a compromise of differences observed in dominant accounting models.","[Ngantchou, Alexis] Univ Douala, Dept Finance & Accounting, FSEGA, Douala, Cameroon",,,ngantchalex@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,22,0,0,2,4,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",,,978-606-505-347-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,637,656,,,,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BSE06,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284258100038,0

We also find that investors look at the monetary value change longer than at change in percentages. Specifically, participants look longer at the value change of gaining assets than at the value change of losing assets.

The uncertainty of future incomes complicates both short-term production decisions and long-term planning which can adversely affect the provision of loans to farmers. The key drivers of farm profit or loss are production risks pertaining to the price and yield volatility of agricultural commodities. Because of the existence of heterogeneous agricultural policies over the world, which have recently changed due to the global economic crisis, it is highly topical to focus on the risk-related effects of the past and current public support of agriculture. The aim of this paper is to make an international comparison of risk management policies in OECD countries as well as in selected emerging economies. The results are based on the data from OECD PSE Database (Producer Support Estimates) and GSSE Database (General Services Support Estimates), a study of agricultural insurance schemes carried out by the European Commission (JRC-ISPRA) and an overview of risk-related policy measures formulated by the OECD. The results indicate that the maximum tariffs were fixed after the WTO Uruguay Round Agreement on agriculture in 1995, which banned countercyclical border measures (variable levies), but countries could react to world price fluctuations by modifying the applied tariffs and applying special safeguard measures within the WTO rules. All OECD countries have the price stabilizing support for at least some commodities. Although the share of market price support in the PSE has been decreasing for a long time, it still remains an important component in most countries around the world. The analysis also revealed the pilot experiences with index based insurance in developing countries whose economy is considerably dependent on agriculture.","Univ Econ, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Spicka, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",jindrich.spicka@vse.cz,"Spicka, Jindrich/C-9855-2013; Spicka, Jindrich/C-9855-2013","Spicka, Jindrich/0000-0001-5699-9544; Spicka, Jindrich/0000-0002-9266-9435",,,,,16,3,3,0,0,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2123-6,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2010,,,,,,,173,180,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA6AE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000337077600020,0

These areas are characterized by a number of limitations such as shorter growing season, lower average annual temperature, the worse traffic conditions, higher environmental protection and others. Sustainable development of these areas depends not only on development of agriculture in these areas that is well supported, but also on the development of other sectors of the economy. An important element of development of these areas is a sufficient number of job opportunities. An analysis of employment in the years 2002-2006 was performed to investigate this. The method shift-share analysis was used. The analysis revealed that the total change of employment in the LFA was influenced mainly by a positive development of the regional component in the most important sectors. In the non LFA, the decrease of a number of workers due to the industry-mix component (mainly transport and trade) was intensified by unfavourable values of the regional component.

We study the costs and benefits of order exposure and test hypotheses regarding hidden order usage using a sample of Euronext-Paris stocks, where hidden orders represent 44% of the sample order volume. Our results support the hypothesis that hidden orders are associated with a decreased probability of full execution and increased average time to completion, and fail to support the alternate hypothesis that order exposure causes defensive traders to withdraw from the market. However, exposing rather than hiding order size increases average execution costs. We assess the extent to which non-displayed size is truly hidden and document that the presence and magnitude of hidden orders can be predicted to a significant, but imperfect, degree based on observable order attributes, firm characteristics, and market conditions. Overall, the results indicate that the option to hide order size is valuable, in particular, to patient traders. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

They are: (1) abolishing currency (which would also be a useful crime-fighting measure); (2) paying negative interest on currency by taxing currency; and (3) decoupling the numeraire from the currency/medium of exchange/means of payment and introducing an exchange rate between the numeraire and the currency; this exchange rate can be set over time to achieve a forward discount (expected depreciation) of the currency vis-a-vis the numeraire when the nominal interest rate in terms of the numeraire is set at a negative level for monetary policy purposes.

We examine the dynamics of the two variables and their respective uncertainties using a bivariate dual long-memory model. We distinguish volume trading before the Asia financial crisis from trading after the crisis. We find that the apparent long-memory in the variables is quite resistant to the presence of breaks. However, when we take into account structural breaks the order of integration of the conditional variance series decreases considerably. Moreover, the impact of foreign volume on volatility is negative in the pre-crisis period but turns to positive after the crisis. This result is consistent with the view that foreign purchases tend to lower volatility in emerging markets-especially in the first few years after market liberalization when foreigners are buying into local markets-whereas foreign sales increase volatility. Before the crisis there is no causal effect for domestic volume on volatility whereas in the post-crisis period total and domestic volumes affect volatility positively. The former result is in line with the theoretical underpinnings that predict that trading within domestic investor groups does not affect volatility. The latter result is consistent with the theoretical argument that the positive relation between the two variables is driven by the uninformed general public. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

These results suggest that gender-diverse boards allocate more effort to monitoring. Accordingly, we find that chief executive officer turnover is more sensitive to stock performance and directors receive more equity-based compensation in firms with more gender-diverse boards. However, the average effect of gender diversity on firm performance is negative. This negative effect is driven by companies with fewer takeover defenses.

The tests show the presence of structural breaks and jumps in the price series. The price series is stationary after incorporating the structural breaks, and therefore a mean reversion with jumps process, and not geometric Brownian motion, is used to characterize the prices. The presence of structural breaks requires partitioning of the series into three subperiods. Results indicate that ignoring the structural breaks and jumps will lead to suboptimal investment decisions.

This conflict can be divided into two distinct phases that have seen the involvement from village to state level of different actors: in particular the traditional fishing people and the dominant classes in Orissa. This article analyzes the socio-economic dynamics governing the conflict. The specific aim is to investigate the dynamics of class reproduction, new forms of class oppression and the emergence of new forms of class consciousness related to the transformations caused by the new aquaculture practices. The role of class in India today is discussed and related to a fieldwork-based analysis of the two phases of this movement against intensive aquaculture.","Univ Turin, Dept Polit Studies, I-10123 Turin, Italy",University of Turin,"Adduci, M (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Polit Studies, Via Giolitti 33, I-10123 Turin, Italy.",matildeadduci@hotmail.com,,,,,,,41,29,34,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

This phenomenon, which can be termed inter-firm reverse technology transfer and which has not been directly analyzed by either the international management or foreign direct investment literature, may have significant implications for policy-particularly in Europe. This article is a first attempt in this direction. Patent citation analysis on a database of EPO patents granted to 17 European chemical and pharmaceutical multinationals over the period 1985-2005 shows that they act as a channel for the transmission of knowledge developed in the United States, to other home country firms; these results are robust to the exclusion of examiner citations. We find that this technology transfer process is explained by the degree of home country embeddedness of the multinational firm, the US subsidiaries' engagement in asset-augmenting activities, and the presence of a technology gap between the United States and the home country. These results point to an alternative understanding of foreign direct R&D investment and its implications for the home country's technological activity and general competitive performance.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Imperial Coll Business Sch, London SW7 2AZ, England",Imperial College London,"Criscuolo, P (通讯作者)，Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Imperial Coll Business Sch, S Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England.",p.criscuolo@imperial.ac.uk,,"Criscuolo, Paola/0000-0002-0365-6975",,,,,47,43,53,1,71,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

The study shows that firms with liquid stocks have better performance as measured by the firm market-to-book ratio. This result is robust to the inclusion of industry or firm fixed effects, a control for idiosyncratic risk, a control for endogenous liquidity using two-stage least squares, and the use of alternative measures of liquidity. To identify the causal effect of liquidity on firm performance, we study an exogenous shock to liquidity-the decimalization of stock trading-and show that the increase in liquidity around decimalization improves firm performance. The causes of liquidity's beneficial effect are investigated: Liquidity increases the information content of market prices and of performance-sensitive managerial compensation. Finally, momentum trading, analyst coverage, investor overreaction, and the effect of liquidity on discount rates or expected returns do not appear to drive the results. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Other determinants of transaction costs are distance and nominal exchange rate volatility. The authors' results show that the half-lives of sectoral real exchange rate shocks, calculated by Monte Carlo integration, imply much faster adjustment in the post-NAFTA period.

However, this credit spread puzzle can be resolved if one accounts for the fact that default rates and Sharpe ratios strongly covary; both are high during recessions and low during booms. As a specific example, we investigate credit spread implications of the Campbell and Cochrane (1999) pricing kernel calibrated to equity returns and aggregate consumption data. Identifying the historical surplus consumption ratio from aggregate consumption data, we find that the implied level and time variation of spreads match historical levels well.","[Goldstein, Robert S.] Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Chen, Long] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Collin-Dufresne, Pierre] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Collin-Dufresne, Pierre; Goldstein, Robert S.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Michigan State University; Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Goldstein, RS (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Room 3-122,321-19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",golds144@umn.edu,,,,,,,80,151,181,1,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Convergence has been driven by the increase in the frequency and severity of catastrophic risk, market inefficiencies created by (re)insurance underwriting cycles, advances in computing and communications technologies, the emergence of enterprise risk management, and other factors. These developments have led to the development of hybrid insurance/financial instruments that blend elements of financial contracts with traditional reinsurance as well as new financial instruments patterned on asset-backed securities, futures, and options that provide direct access to capital markets. This article provides a survey and overview of the hybrid and pure financial markets instruments and provides new information on the pricing and returns on contracts such as industry loss warranties and Cat bonds.","[Cummins, J.

First, we justify the linkage between the insurance and the financial markets by the underwriting cycle theory and financial models of insurance pricing. Second, we examine the relationship between the NLIP, the interest rate, and the stock price using the recent developments of nonlinear econometrics. We use threshold cointegration models: the switching transition error correction models (STECM). We show that STECM perform better than a linear error correction model (LECM) to reproduce the NLIP dynamics. Our empirical results show that the adjustment of the NLIP in France, Japan, and the United States is rather discontinuous, asymmetrical, and nonlinear. Moreover, we suggest a strong evidence of significant linkages between insurance and financial markets, show two regimes for the NLIP, and find that the NLIP adjustment toward equilibrium is time varying with a convergence speed that varies according to the insurance disequilibrium size.","[Jawadi, Fredj] Amiens Sch Management, Amiens, France; [Jawadi, Fredj; Bruneau, Catherine; Sghaier, Nadia] EconomiX Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre Def, Paris, France",,"Jawadi, F (通讯作者)，Amiens Sch Management, Amiens, France.",fredj.jawadi@supco-amiens.fr; catherine.bruneau@u-paris10.fr; nsghaier@u-paris10.fr,"Nizar, Sghaier/AFY-1176-2022","Nizar, Sghaier/0000-0002-4591-7360; JAWADI, Fredj/0000-0003-3655-8391",,,,,60,26,26,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

The country is a member of the European Common Aviation Area, but despite air transport liberalisation, spatial concentration of traffic and asymmetry remain high and have not decreased significantly over time. Greece is still short of traffic generated by low-cost carriers especially outside the main metropolitan airports. The paper argues that further dispersion of traffic could be possible primarily in the mainland if low-cost carriers decide to dynamically enter the Greek market.

This descriptive failure casts doubt on the validity of classical utility measurements. Prospect theory can better explain choice behaviour because it makes the plausible assumption that risk attitudes are not only driven by sensitivity towards outcomes (utility curvature), but also by sensitivity towards probabilities (probability weighting), and by sensitivity towards whether outcomes are above or below a reference point (loss aversion). This paper presents an experiment that completely measures the utility-and loss aversion component of risk attitudes, using a representative sample of N = 1935 respondents from the general public, in a parameter-free way. This study thereby provides the first measurement of the utility of money for the general population that is valid under (cumulative) prospect theory, does not depend on prior assumptions about the underlying functional form of utility, is externally valid, and does not rule out heterogeneity of individual preferences. The results confirm the concave-convex pattern of utility as predicted by prospect theory, suggest that utility curvature is less pronounced than suggested by classical utility measurements, and show that women are significantly more loss averse than men.

We present a simple theoretical model to illustrate how the presence of social objectives in the firm's objective function changes its investment behaviour. Our theoretical model accommodates special features of Chinese SOEs, whose social welfare investment is driven by both social objectives and profit concerns. The model is then tested using a panel of Chinese enterprises during the period 1995-1999. The empirical analysis indicates that despite of the corporatization reform social welfare investment undertaken by Chinese SOEs is still inefficient due to the lack of profit concerns, suggesting that social objectives still dominate profit concerns in motivating the SOEs' social welfare investment.

These life-cycle profiles are constructed for separate income quartiles and education groups as well as for the whole population. It is crucial to understand the consumption and saving behavior of different income groups in Turkey due to the high level of income inequality. As current income could be affected by temporary income shocks, we use educational attainment level as an instrument for permanent income in analyzing the relationship between income and consumption/saving. Furthermore, the age profiles presented in this study provide us information as to how savings may evolve in the future as a result of changing demographic conditions. In the second part of the study, cross-section profiles of income, consumption, and saving from 2002 to 2006 are compared to see how these profiles have evolved over time.","[Kirdar, Murat Gueray] Orta Dogu Tekn Univ, Iktisat Bolumu, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey; [Cilasun, Seyit Muemin] Atilim Univ, Isletme Fak, Iktisat Bolumu, Ankara, Turkey; [Kirdar, Murat Gueray] Middle E Tech Univ, Ankara, Turkey",Middle East Technical University; Atilim University; Middle East Technical University,"Kirdar, MG (通讯作者)，Orta Dogu Tekn Univ, Iktisat Bolumu, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey.",smcilasun@atilim.edu.tr; kirdar@metu.edu.tr,,,,,,,29,8,8,0,13,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

We hypothesize that there is a societal norm against funding operations that promote vice and that some investors, particularly institutions subject to norms, pay a financial cost in abstaining from these stocks. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that sin stocks are less held by norm-constrained institutions such as pension plans as compared to mutual or hedge funds that are natural arbitrageurs, and they receive less coverage from analysts than do stocks of otherwise comparable characteristics. Sin stocks also have higher expected returns than otherwise comparable stocks, consistent with them being neglected by norm-constrained investors and facing greater litigation risk heightened by social norms. Evidence from corporate financing decisions and the performance of sin stocks outside the US also suggest that norms affect stock prices and returns. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We combine net revenue from livestock and crops and regress total net revenue on a set of climate, soil, and socio-economic variables with and without country fixed effects. Although African crop net revenue is very sensitive to climate change, combined livestock and crop net revenue is more climate resilient. With the hot and dry CCC climate scenario, average damage estimates reach 27% by 2100, but with the mild and wet PCM scenario, African farmers will benefit. The analysis of AEZs implies that the effects of climate change will be quite different across Africa. For example, currently productive areas such as dry/moist savannah are more vulnerable to climate change while currently less productive agricultural zones such as humid forest or sub-humid AEZs become more productive in the future.","[Seo, S.

We develop an equilibrium model of the market for ratings and use it to examine possible origins of and cures for ratings inflation. In the model, asset issuers can shop for ratings-observe multiple ratings and disclose only the most favorable-before auctioning their assets. When assets are simple, agencies' ratings are similar and the incentive to ratings shop is low. When assets are sufficiently complex, ratings differ enough that an incentive to shop emerges. Thus, an increase in the complexity of recently issued securities could create a systematic bias in disclosed ratings, despite the fact that each ratings agency produces an unbiased estimate of the asset's true quality. Increasing competition among agencies would only worsen this problem. Switching to an investor-initiated ratings system alleviates the bias, but could collapse the market for information.

Although this line of research shows in many cases a negative correlation between the proportions of the elderly and educational expenditures, a causal link is difficult to prove. To further analyse this topic, this paper uses a unique and representative survey of Swiss voters of all age groups. Results show that elderly people have a clear tendency to be less willing to spend money on education. They rather prefer to spend public resources on health and social security than on education. Furthermore the paper shows that although the elderly are more conservative and in general less inclined to pay for expenditures in the public sector as a whole, there is still an age effect on the willingness to pay for education after controlling for these factors.

The Ultimatum Came is one such exchange which is assumed to measure preferences for fairness. The current experiment tests if cueing interdependence triggers an exchange heuristic prompting proposers to give more equal offers, and responders to reject more unequal offers from a particular (yet anonymous) partner. Contrary to expectations, interdependence did not affect proposer behavior, while it spurred responders to be more rational. Responders who were told that they would be matched with one of the other participants after making their decision, rejected an unequal offer more frequently than those who were told they had already been matched prior to making the decision, and for whom the interdependent nature of the exchange was made salient. Based on post-experimental questionnaire data, a plausible explanation for the observed result is that unmatched responders, fostering the illusion of control, reject more in order to signal that they are tough bargainers.

In contrast, low control on managerial discretion attenuates the negative price reaction to contributions consistent with empire-building theories.

Developing a financing game with both fundamental and strategic uncertainty, we first show that inefficient liquidation of a fundamentally solvent project can arise in equilibrium as a result of coordination failure among lenders. We then investigate the effects of two types of public policies: an information policy and a public guarantee program. The analysis shows that the inefficiencies caused by coordination problems among lenders can be effectively and efficiently removed only when both policies are simultaneously designed and implemented in an appropriate combination. We also address the potential cost of public intervention, focusing particularly on the negative influence on the ex ante effort incentives of borrowers. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Among the lowest-income filers, the 1994 expansion is associated with a significant increase in the probability of reporting positive self-employment income, equal to 3.2 percentage points for unmarried filers and 4.1 percentage points for married filers.","Williams Coll, Dept Econ, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA",Williams College,"LaLumia, S (通讯作者)，Williams Coll, Dept Econ, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA.",,,,,,,,41,13,26,0,11,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

We further demonstrate that the democracy and freedom deficits are larger in the Islamic heartland than elsewhere in Muslim-majority countries. We show that the democracy deficit is not driven by demands for autocracy in Muslim-majority countries, and indeed, that individual Muslims value democracy more than non-Muslims.

Based on a panel of 50 states during 1979-2006, the empirical results indicate that EPSCoR, while increasing federal R&D support to EPSCoR states, crowded out financial support for academic research from the governments of EPSCoR states. About one-third of EPSCoR funds went to subsidize state budgets. The crowd-out effect calls for some reconsideration of EPSCoR program design in order to maintain or even increase the state government financial support for academic research activities deemed critical to academic competitiveness and economic prospects.

Using cohabiting couples, we conduct a choice experiment field study valuing reductions in dietary health risks. In one treatment a random individual is chosen from the couple and interviewed alone; in the other treatment, both partners are questioned jointly. We find significant differences in household values calculated from joint as opposed to individual responses, with further variation between the values elicited from men and women.

Agents have a desire to trade but short-sale restrictions and other frictions limit their trading strategies and enable prices of two similar securities to be different, Thus, divergent prices for similar securities can be sustained in a rational expectations equilibrium.

This raises great technical challenges when sufficient default data are not available, as is the case for low default portfolios.

The model captures patterns of obligor heterogeneity and ratings migration dependence through unobserved systematic macroeconomic shocks. We describe a Bayesian hierarchical framework for model calibration from historical rating transition data, and show how the predictive performance of the model can be assessed, even with sparse event data. Finally, we analyze a rating transition data set from Standard and Poor's during 1981-2007.

Moreover, it seems to have been as much, if not more, a failure of government and its agencies inclusive of regulators as much as any failure of capitalism. Finally, the apparently arbitrary, if not self-interested, bank bailouts seem to indicate that governments are likely to directing bank policy for some time. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Hence expanding access remains an important challenge across the world, leaving much for governments to do. However, not all government actions are equally effective and some policies can even be counterproductive.

We identify reasonable and stable money demand relationships for Germany, France and Spain as well as the EMU-4 aggregate. For the case of Italy, results are less clear. From the estimated money demand functions, we derive both EMU-4 and country-specific measures of money overhang. We find that the EMU-4 overhang measure strongly correlates with the country-specific measures, particularly since the start of EMU, and is useful to predict country-specific inflation. However, it generally does not encompass country-specific money overhang measures as predictors of inflation. Hence, aggregate money overhang is an important, but by far not an exhaustive, indicator for the disaggregate level.","[Carstensen, Kai] Univ Munich, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Hagen, Jan] European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy; [Hossfeld, Oliver] Leipzig Grad Sch Management, Leipzig, Germany; [Neaves, Abelardo Salazar] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Munich; European University Institute; University of Nottingham,,,"Carstensen, Kai/AAF-7834-2020",,,,,,55,8,9,0,6,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0036-9292,,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

Comparing abnormal performance estimates from the Carhart (1997) model to extensions designed to correct for bond holdings, we find that the estimates within one of our samples change from positive to significantly negative. Additional evidence indicates that cash flows to the funds are more closely correlated with the traditional Carhart measure, clearly indicating that the absence of bond indices misleads investors who use a fund's risk-adjusted performance as the basis for investment decisions.","[Comer, George] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Larrymore, Norris] Quinnipiac Univ, Hamden, CT USA; [Rodriguez, Javier] Univ Puerto Rico, San Juan, PR 00936 USA",Georgetown University; Quinnipiac University; University of Puerto Rico,"Comer, G (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, 417 Old N, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",gc45@georgetown.edu,"Rodriguez, Javier/HNP-0304-2023","Rodriguez, Javier/0000-0002-8886-4940",the Georgetown University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences; the Dean's Leadership Fund of the McDonough School of Business; the University of Puerto Rico Graduate School of Business Administration; Office of the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research,the Georgetown University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences; the Dean's Leadership Fund of the McDonough School of Business; the University of Puerto Rico Graduate School of Business Administration; Office of the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research,"We appreciate the comments of Jeffrey Busse, Martin Gruber, Phyllis Keys, Wayne Lee, Matthew Spiegel (the editor), and an anonymous referee.

The buyer's information is conveyed through a first-stage competitive auction. A seller with unfavorable information about the asset accepts the cash offer of the highest bidder. A seller with favorable information proposes a take-it-or-leave-it counteroffer that entails buyer equity. Thus, the cash-equity decision reflects the seller's but not the buyer's information in contrast to the theoretical and empirical findings for mergers. The central prediction of our model is that there are large gains in wealth for both buyers and sellers in equity-based asset sales, whereas cash sales generate significantly smaller gains that typically accrue only to sellers. Our empirical results are consistent with the predictions of our theoretical model.","[Hege, Ulrich; Lovo, Stefano; Slovin, Myron B.; Sushka, Marie E.] HEC Sch Management, Paris, France; [Sushka, Marie E.] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC) Paris; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Hege, U (通讯作者)，HEC Sch Management, Paris, France.",hege@hec.fr,,,,,,,30,23,28,2,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

First, the dynamic effects on the UK economy of an unanticipated fall of short-term interest rates in the rest of the world are: real house price inflation, investment, GDP and consumption growth peak after 1 year, wages peak after 2 years, and CPI and GDP deflator inflation peak during the third year. Second, a positive international supply shock makes the distribution of the components of the UK consumption deflator negatively skewed.

Credit risk evaluation is essential for any bank's long-term success.","[Baltes, Nicolae] Lucian Blaga Univ, Sibiu, Romania",Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu,,baltes_n@yahoo.com; alinaciuhureanu@yahoo.com,"Ciuhureanu, Alina/I-3847-2016",,,,,,6,0,0,1,9,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,31,35,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS73,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287985000005,0

The Learning Guarantee Programme in Karnataka, India, is prominent among such efforts, providing cash transfers to government schools that achieve learning at specified high levels. This study examines whether schools that self-selected into the incentive programme are different than those that did not. The answer has important implications for how to evaluate the impact of such a programme. Although we find no significant differences in resources and characteristics, we do find significant and substantial differences in test scores prior to selection into the programme, with better performing schools more likely to opt-in. These findings also provide insight into how incentive-based programmes that focus on levels of (rather than changes in) achievement can exacerbate inequality in education. Failing schools, since they are more likely to opt-out of incentive programmes, are likely to require other targeted programmes in order to improve. In addition, our findings reinforce the value of randomised controlled trials to evaluate incentive programmes since evaluations that rely on matching schools based on resources (if, for instance, pre-programme test scores are unavailable) will be biased if resources poorly predict test scores.","[Karlan, Dean] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Barnhardt, Sharon] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Khemani, Stuti] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Yale University; Harvard University; The World Bank,"Karlan, D (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, POB 208209, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",Dean.Karlan@yale.edu,,"karlan, dean/0000-0003-0164-1398",,,,,23,3,3,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Some of those convicted for corruption have successfully challenged the constitutionality of Indonesia's anti-corruption framework in the Constitutional Court. This article discusses the impact of one Constitutional Court decision, which removed some flexibility from the definition of corruption under the Corruption Eradication Law. That flexibility had allowed defendants to be convicted for corruption if they had caused loss to the state and enriched another party and, in so doing, had breached 'community standards'. The Constitutional Court decided that 'community standards' was too vague and uncertain a notion to ground a conviction for corruption. This article shows that the Supreme Court has, deliberately and explicitly, circumvented the Constitutional Court's decision.

Since the general perception, also supported by empirical evidence, is that an integration process should be observable at the level of higher correlations between countries' capital markets, we test whether such an increase in correlations between the six markets above took place in the recent years. At the same time, we explore the link between correlations and stock market volatilities in this sample of countries. We find that there is an observable and statistically significant positive trend in cross-market correlations between 1999 and 2008, with an increase in correlations over the ten year period ranging from 13.2% to 59.3%. We find that correlations between the three emerging markets and the three developed markets increased on average between 1999 and 2008, which may indicate a higher integration of these capital markets. At the same time, we observe that movements in national stock markets are not fully synchronized, but correlations tend to be high in periods of high market volatility, as measured by the standard deviation of stock market returns. Regressing the rolling correlations on markets rolling volatilities, we find that almost all coefficients are statistically significant and positive, which indicates that increases in market volatilities lead to increases in cross-country correlations during the ten years under analysis. Our findings confirm previous studies and lead to the conclusion that stock markets from Central and Eastern Europe became more integrated with the developed markets in European Union, as revealed by the evolution of correlations between these markets.

By combining the auditing processes and CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Processing for Data Mining), we could find out a justified process of auditing data mining.","[Hu, Jia-jiang] Taizhou Univ, Coll Econ & Int Business & Management, Taizhou 318000, Peoples R China",Taizhou University,,hujj@tzc.edu.cn,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,3,AMER SCHOLARS PRESS,MARIETTA,"3238 HARVEST WAY, MARIETTA, GA 30062 USA",,,978-0-9798471-5-8,,,,2009,,,,,,,648,651,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BNT76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275501800137,0

Nevertheless, strategic alliances are confronting with challenge of high failure rate due to the risk of opportunism, so the first important issue for managers to consider is how to choose the appropriate governance structure when they decide to enter an alliance. The primary purpose of this paper is to contribute with a review of the existing research on alliance governance. The paper begins by illustrating the concept of alliance governance structure, and this is followed by analyzing theories on alliance governance including transaction cost economics, property right theory and relational contract theory. Finally, a systematic framework and some suggestion for future research are proposed.","[Huang Yujie; Zhang Guomei; Zhang Yijuan] Hebei Univ Econ & Business, Sch Management, Shih Chia Chuang 050061, Peoples R China",Hebei University of Economics & Business,,hyjsjz2@163.com,,,,,,,38,1,1,0,7,M D FORUM,ALLAWAH NSW,"17 AUGUSTA ST, ALLAWAH NSW, 2218, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9806854-2-8,,,,2009,,,,,,,37,44,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BPO33,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279533000005,0

We test the hypothesis in an actual decision-making context by investigating how stock market investors time their sales of stocks when realizing gains and losses. If the principles that guide investors' behavior are those suggested by the hedonic editing hypothesis, we should observe investors integrating losses more frequently than gains and integrating smaller losses with larger gains rather than the other way around.

This paper examines the choice of FDI mode, and shows that the profitability of greenfield investment influences this choice not only directly, but also indirectly since it determines the outside option of potential acquisition targets and joint venture partners. In particular, even if greenfield investment is a viable option, the multinational may prefer a joint venture to M&A, and M&A to greenfield investment, provided that M&A and joint venture both involve sufficiently low fixed costs. The reason is that the profitability of greenfield investment both reduces the acquisition price in the case of M&A, and gives local firms an incentive to agree to a joint venture.

They should strengthen their transformation of growth mode, strengthen capital operation, strengthen their operation and management of enterprises and enhance training of professionals.

Controlling for the standard determinants, the paper shows that all types of capital inflows tended to appreciate the peso.

The purpose of the research is to determine the method of valuation that is the most appropriate and reliable for the valuation of a broiler farm. A sample of 15 out of the 196 contract broiler farm valuat ons was selected in the Mpumalanga and North West provinces in South Africa. The size of the broiler houses was at least 1 000 m(2). Broiler units with a minimum of four houses were taken into account. Data was gathered by means of assessments of previous valuations as well as physical valuations done in the field and analysed statistically. Figures were tested for normality; differences between the overall means were determined by the analysis of variance using the ANOVA test; the correlation coefficients between the two different methods and the dependable variable were determined; and regression analysis was fitted. The differences in the coefficient of variance between the two sets of data used indicate that the cost approach has a smaller variation around the mean. The income approach, on the other hand, indicates a more realistic approach, because the basis is the net margin and not a norm for replacement and depreciation. Although differences do exist, a strong correlation exists between the two methods.","[Joubert, J. C. N.; Cloete, C.

In the 3 years following a leveraged buyout, targets become more profitable, grow much faster than their peer group, issue additional debt, and increase capital expenditures. We then provide evidence consistent with the idea that in our sample, private equity funds create value by relaxing credit constraints, allowing LBO targets to take advantage of hitherto unexploited growth opportunities. First, post-buyout growth is concentrated among private-to-private transactions, i.e., deals where the seller is an individual, as opposed to divisional buyouts or public-to-private LBOs where the seller is a private or a public firm. Second, the observed post-buyout growth in size and post-buyout increase in debt and capital expenditures are stronger when the targets operate in an industry that is relatively more dependent on external finance. These results contrast with existing evidence that LBO targets invest less or downsize. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Banks pay more for liquidity when positions are more imbalanced across banks, consistent with the existence of short squeezing.

We show that the probability of the joint occurrence of extreme stock returns may be higher for asymmetric thresholds than for symmetric thresholds. We propose a non-parametric measure of extreme dependence which allows capturing extreme events for different thresholds and can be used to compute different types of extreme dependence. We find that extreme dependence among the stock markets of ten initial EMU member countries, the United Kingdom, and the United States is largely asymmetrical in the pre-EMU period (1989-1998) and largely symmetrical in the EMU period (1999-2010).

The relation is hump-shaped when EG is weak, but is insignificant when EG is strong. The results imply that CEO ownership and EG are substitutes for mitigating agency problems when ownership is low. However, very high levels of share ownership can reduce firm value by entrenching the CEO and discouraging him from taking risk, unless mitigated by strong EG. We identify channels through which CEO ownership affects firm value by examining R&D, which is discretionary and risky. We find CEO ownership similarly exhibits a hump-shaped relation with R&D when EG is weak, but no relation when EG is strong.

This paper presents a new perspective in this research area by examining the calling patterns of container shipping services in order to understand the dynamics of port connectivity and inter-port relationships in the supply chains. Empirical evidence is drawn from four major ports in East Asia, namely Shanghai, Busan, Kaohsiung and Ningbo. The study identifies the shipping capacity, trade routes and geographical regions connected to the ports, shipping lines involved, and the extensity and intensity of inter-port relationships among the four container ports from liner shipping network's perspective. The findings show that most of the shipping capacity employed on the major east-west trade routes became non-exclusive and involved calls at two or more of the four ports. Port planners, terminal operators and carriers could capitalise on opportunities through exploitation of complementary relationships that exist among the selected ports, such as offering a package for shipping lines to call at a portfolio of terminals owned by the same terminal operator. Policy and research implications as well as recommendations are discussed for various stakeholders concerned with port planning and regional development. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a large sample of U.S. firms during the 1994-2002 period, we find that the shadow value of external funds is significantly higher for companies with a wider insider control-ownership divergence, suggesting that companies whose corporate insiders have larger excess control rights are more financially constrained. The effect of insider excess control rights on external finance constraints is more pronounced for firms with higher degrees of informational opacity and for firms with financial misreporting, and is moderated by institutional ownership. The results show that the agency problems associated with the control-ownership divergence can have a real impact on corporate financial and investment outcomes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis jointly focuses on the tax-based preferences of five categories of shareholders, including both domestic and foreign-domiciled shareholder classes. Incorporating the dividend franking percentage as a direct measure of the degree of tax benefit associated with dividends, strong evidence supporting the existence of tax-based dividend clienteles is present for both domestic and foreign shareholder categories. This includes domestic corporate blockholders and company directors, and local institutional investors following tax reforms in 2000. and foreign institutional shareholders which, alternatively, demand lower dividends and dividend franking.

In this text we will examine the numerical performance of this so-called beta-family, both in the equity world and in the field of credit risk. In order to do this, we will calibrate a particular member of this family to a vanilla option surface (by means of the Fast Fourier Transform-technique due to Carr and Madan (J Comput Fin 2(4):61-73, 1999) and use the resulting parameters to determine the prices of a digital down-and-out barrier (DDOB) option, written on the same underlying. In a second experiment, we will try and calibrate the model to some real-life credit default swap (CDS) term structures. The parameters of the model under investigation are chosen such that its L,vy density is approximately equal to that of the famous Variance Gamma (VG) process, which will serve as a benchmark. Hence, the former will be referred to as the beta-VG model. The option prices will be determined both semi-analytically [using the formulas derived by Kuznetsov (Ann Appl Prob, 2009)] and through a Monte-Carlo simulation. However, the CDS spreads will only be determined semi-analytically, due to the very close relation between pricing DDOB options and determining the par spread of a CDS. Furthermore, in both cases, the results will be compared with the ones obtained using the VG model [Cf. Schoutens (L,vy processes in finance: pricing financial derivatives, Wiley , Chichester, 2003) and, Cariboni and Schoutens (Levy processes in credit risk, Wiley, Chichester, 2009)]. It will turn out that, w.r.t. vanilla option prices, the beta-VG model performs almost identically as the VG model, whereas the semi-analytical expressions by Kuznetsov (Ann Appl Prob, 2009) lead to a (fast and) accurate pricing of DDOB options and CDSs.","[Schoutens, Wim; Van Damme, Geert] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Math, Sect Stat, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Schoutens, W (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Math, Sect Stat, Celestijnenlaan 200B,POB 02400, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",wim.@schoutens.be; geert.vandamme@wis.kuleuven.be,,,,,,,16,10,10,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

To do so we analyze the one-dimensional income tax case, and then we introduce a partial order, based on the Lorenz dominance criterion, which induces a lattice structure within the set of bilinear tax reforms whenever certain conditions on the tax reform policies and the dual income distribution hold. We illustrate this result empirically in the case of the Spanish dual personal income tax.

We use balance sheet and cash flow data, including purchases and sales of equity, fixed income and real estate. We trace asset reallocations back to both active trading and revaluations and link investment decisions to firm-specific characteristics and macroeconomic variables. Overall, our results indicate that all three investor types tend to be contrarian traders, i.e. they buy past losers and sell past winners. Especially pension funds showed this behaviour in the most turbulent part of the sample - the crash of 2002 and early 2003 - implying that these institutions have a stabilising impact on financial markets when this is needed most. Life insurers tend to be contrarian traders when they have a high proportion of unit-linked policies, while non-life insurers are contrarian when they have a more risky business model.

However, after instrumenting for BID presence, any significant effect of BIDs on public spending and service provision disappears.

Scheduled and unscheduled news typically raises volatility for about an hour and often causes price discontinuities or jumps. News contributes substantially to volatility but other factors contribute even more to periodic volatility. The same types of news that affect returns-payrolls, trade balance, and interest rate shocks-are also the most likely to affect volatility, and U.S. news tends to produce more volatility than foreign news. Recent research has linked news to volatility through the former's effect on order flow. Empirical research has confirmed the predictions of microstructure theory on how volatility might depend on a number of factors: the precision of the information in the news, the state of the business cycle, and the heterogeneity of traders' beliefs.","Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Neely, CJ (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA.",,"Neely, Chris/N-8182-2019","Neely, Chris/0000-0003-2852-9419",,,,,82,26,28,0,11,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

Our model illustrates how greater complexity and concentration in the financial network may amplify this fragility. The analysis suggests how a range of policy measures - including tougher liquidity regulation, macro-prudential policy, and surcharges for systemically important financial institutions could make the financial system more resilient.

It focuses on decisions to start and liquidate family-member funds. Hedge fund families tend to liquidate funds that underperform compared to other member funds, and to replace them by new ones. By choosing a launch time after a short period of superior performance by their member funds, families extend the spillover to new funds. Hedge fund families seem to be more experienced in promoting their funds and attracting fund inflow than in generating superior performance. This results in higher dollar compensation earned by managers within multi-fund families than in stand-alone funds. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, an analytical framework, which can be applied to other cities to quantify the potential commuting travel savings and environmental benefits of different job policies in cities having different rates and patterns of population decentralization, is presented. A case study of Hong Kong in the 1992-2002 decade is used to illustrate the analytical framework. The findings suggest that a city's population patterns did have significant implications on the commuting travel savings from alternative job relocation policies. With a dispersed population pattern, the expected environmental benefits from a job decentralization policy can be very substantial. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Loo, Becky P.

By applying a citizen-candidate model of representative democracy, the paper analyzes how corruption distorts the allocation of resources between public and private consumption, altering the policy preferences of elected and nonelected citizens in opposite directions. The outcome is a reduction in real public expenditure and, if the median voter's demand for public goods is sufficiently elastic, a reduction in taxes. In this case, some citizens benefit indirectly from corruption. The paper also presents some empirical evidence that, in democratic countries, corruption results in lower tax revenue, and proceeds to show that, when this occurs, citizens anticipating a shift in preferences in favor of public expenditure may support institutions that favor corruption. This result complements the findings of other studies that have attributed the persistence of corruption in democracy to some failure on the part of the voters or the electoral system. It also bears implications for developing effective anticorruption strategies and for redefining the role that can be played by the international community.","IMF, Washington, DC USA",International Monetary Fund,"Pani, M (通讯作者)，IMF, Washington, DC USA.",mpani@imf.org,,"Pani, Marco/0000-0003-1148-9799",,,,,51,13,13,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2011,148.0,1-2,,,,,163,196,,10.1007/s11127-010-9651-4,0.0,,,34,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,766GV,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290769900009,0
J,"Pietrobelli, C; Rabellotti, R",,,,"Pietrobelli, Carlo; Rabellotti, Roberta",,,Global Value Chains Meet Innovation Systems: Are There Learning Opportunities for Developing Countries?,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,global value chain; innovation system; learning,INDUSTRY; SCALES,"The Innovation Systems (IS) literature tends not to emphasize the crucial impact of international knowledge and innovation exchange and collaboration through, for example, inter-firm and intra-firm networks and Global Value Chains (GVC). In developing countries this aspect is crucial, with integration in GVC playing a growing and very important role in accessing knowledge and enhancing learning and innovation. However, there is no agreement in the literature about how innovation systems and GVC interact, and how this interaction is likely to affect enterprise learning. Three main conclusions emerge from the theoretical analysis and evidence presented in this paper. First, learning mechanisms can vary widely within the various forms of governance of GVC: they can be the result of the pressure to achieve international standards, or be facilitated by direct involvement of the value chain leaders when the suppliers' competence is low and the risk of failure to comply is high. When the competences of the actors in the value chain are complementary, learning is mutual and is based on intense face-to-face interactions. Second, as we open IS to foreign sources of knowledge, the relationship between GVCs and IS is nonlinear and endogenous, and mutually affecting. On the basis of our model, we would expect a well-structured and efficient innovation system would help to reduce transaction complexity and enable transactions based on relational forms of GVC governance. Third, the internal governance of GVC is a dynamic phenomenon that is subject to continuous adjustments and changes, and the nature of the IS affects this co-evolution. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The empirical results support this hypothesis, and highlight the importance of evaluating whether the institutions measure used captures the institutional framework applying to the population at large.","Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Isaksson, AS (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Box 640, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",ann-sofie.isaksson@economics.gu.se,,"Isaksson, Ann-Sofie/0000-0003-2447-3665",,,,,82,3,3,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUN,2011,147.0,3-4,,,,,331,357,,10.1007/s11127-010-9632-7,0.0,,,27,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,756RD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290031500005,0

Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the effect of ignoring starting point bias depends on the bid design and on the true distribution of WTP. A well-balanced, symmetric bid design may result in very modest biases even when the anchoring mechanism is very strong. The power of bid set dummies in detecting starting point bias is low. They tend to account for misspecifications in the distribution assumed by the researcher for the latent WTP, rather than capturing the presence of starting point bias.","[Veronesi, Marcella] ETH, Inst Environm Decis, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Alberini, Anna] Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Cooper, Joseph C.] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Veronesi, M (通讯作者)，ETH, Inst Environm Decis, Univ Str 22,CHN K 76-1, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",marcella.veronesi@env.ethz.ch,"Veronesi, Marcella/JAX-3674-2023","Veronesi, Marcella/0000-0001-5520-8093",,,,,36,33,35,1,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The central challenge in evacuation planning is to determine the optimum evacuation routing to safe areas. We describe the evacuation network within a stadium as a hierarchical directed network. We propose a multi-objective optimization approach to solve the evacuation routing problem on the basis of this hierarchical directed network. This problem involves three objectives that need to be achieved simultaneously, such as minimization of total evacuation time, minimization of total evacuation distance and minimal cumulative congestion degrees in an evacuation process. To solve this problem, we designed a modified ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm, implemented it in the MATLAB software environment, and tested it using a stadium at the Wuhan Sports Center in China. We demonstrate that the algorithm can solve the problem, and has a better evacuation performance in terms of organizing evacuees' space time paths than the ACO algorithm, the kth shortest path algorithm and the second generation of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm were used to improve the results from the kth shortest path algorithm.

Those heads can be either widows or married women; unlike most prior studies, this one controls for such heterogeneity by separately analyzing data from the two types of households. Like earlier studies, it compares the absolute differences in children's schooling outcomes across household types. Unlike earlier studies, however, it also attempts to quantify the relative improvements in children's schooling outcomes within different households that correspond to marginal improvements in households' educational and economic status. Finally, using household fixed effects, it investigates the differences in the schooling outcomes of boys and girls across the different household types. The findings concur with those of recent studies in other South Asian countries. Controlling for family background, in absolute terms, children in widow-headed households are no worse off than are those in male-headed households, and children in households headed by married females may enjoy even better schooling outcomes.

Much of the literature, including prominent work by Arrow et al.

This article offers a simple, explicit decomposition that clarifies the distinction, reveals unappreciated difficulties with the reduced-form approach, and relates them to the literature.

Did the inflow of institutional funding in the syndicated loan market lead to mispricing of credit? To understand this relation, we look at the institutional demand pressure defined as the number of days a loan remains in syndication. Using market-level and cross-sectional variation in time-on-the-market, we find that a shorter syndication period is associated with a lower final interest rate. The relation is robust to the use of institutional fund flow as an instrument. Furthermore, we find significant price differences between institutional investors' tranches and banks' tranches of the same loans, even though they share the same underlying fundamentals. Increasing demand pressure causes the interest rate on institutional tranches to fall below the interest rate on bank tranches. Overall, a one-standard-deviation reduction in average time-on-the-market decreases the interest rate for institutional loans by over 30 basis points per annum. While this effect is significantly larger for loan tranches bought by collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), it is not fully explained by their role. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Over the subsequent century and more, the growth in public support for agricultural R&D, extension and technical services has waxed and waned and the policies and public institutions directed at them have changed markedly. In the early 20th century the focus was on tapping technologies and expertise from other countries. Subsequent changes in agricultural R&D mirrored broader agricultural and economy-wide policy thrusts. The period through to the Second World War saw an expansion of the area farmed, mostly involving white farmers. During the decades immediately following the war, public R&D mainly supported intensification and promoted technological change by large commercial operators. The early 1980s heralded large structural changes in agriculture and the economy generally and policies were enacted to redistribute land to block farmers, with associated shifts in the focus of public research and extension services. The emphasis given to regional versus more centralised cum national research and extension agencies has changed dramatically as well over the decades. As food security and associated agricultural productivity concerns resurface, the R&D policies and institutions supporting agriculture are likely to be revisited, hopefully with an eye to the long-run nature and ramifications for agricultural R&D.","[Liebenberg, Frikkie] Agr Res Council, Pretoria, South Africa; [Pardey, Philip G.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Pardey, Philip G.] Univ Minnesota, Int Sci & Technol Practice & Policy InSTePP Ctr, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",Agricultural Research Council of South Africa; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Liebenberg, F (通讯作者)，Agr Res Council, Pretoria, South Africa.",ppardey@umn.edu,,"Pardey, Philip/0000-0002-8012-1341",South African Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Council,South African Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Council,"The research supporting this paper was funded principally by the South African Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Council, with additional support from the International Food Policy Research Institute, InSTePP, the University of Pretoria, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation via the HarvestChoice project.

Our approach consists in designing a stochastic mechanism for deriving the transaction prices from the latent efficient price. The main idea behind the model is that, if a transaction occurs at some value on the tick grid and leads to a price change, then the efficient price has been close enough to this value shortly before the transaction. We call uncertainty zones the bands around the mid-tick grid where the efficient price is too far from the tick grid to trigger a price change. In our setting, the width of these uncertainty zones quantifies the aversion to price changes of the market participants. Furthermore, this model enables us to derive approximated values of the efficient price at some random times, which is particularly useful for building statistical procedures. Convincing results are obtained through a simulation study and the use of the model over 10 representative stocks.","[Robert, Christian Y.] CREST, F-92245 Malakoff, France; [Robert, Christian Y.] ENSAE Paris Tech, Paris, France; [Rosenbaum, Mathieu] CMAP Ecole Polytech Paris, CNRS, UMR 7641, Paris, France",Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Mathematical Sciences (INSMI),"Robert, CY (通讯作者)，CREST, 3 Ave Pierre Larousse, F-92245 Malakoff, France.",chrobert@ensae.fr; mathieu.rosenbaum@polytechnique.edu,,,,,,,33,44,46,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

Based analysis of replication datasets using structural break analysis and rolling windows, we show how careful attention to the passage of time reveals important macro-historical changes in the coefficients on ethnic diversity in explaining conflict incidence.

In Palanpur we find that the largest Scheduled Caste group failed to share in the gradual rise in village prosperity. This would not have emerged from standard decomposition analysis.

We find that the size and international nature of collaborative projects and co-authors' past productivity have very significant impacts on current productivity, while age, gender, and past productivity are also influential determinants of both productivity and probability of promotion.

Using nationally representative household survey data from Nepal, we find that stove type significantly affects the firewood demand for household uses. Traditional mud-stove user households seem to use less firewood than the open-fire stove users. Surprisingly, households with the so-called 'improved' stoves seem to use more firewood than the households with mud stoves. Thus, converting traditional open-fire stoves to mud stoves may be a better conservation strategy in the short term rather than installing improved stoves, unless the technology improves.

Minimizing the central bank loss function produces controllability conditions. Optimality conditions depend on specific models, and controllability conditions do not. We propose a concept of consistent targets, which refer to the targets that satisfy both optimality and controllability conditions.

With regards to time spent gathering water, we focus on the effects of gender, age, and distance to water. Women and girls spend the most time gathering water. The response to reducing distance to water sources differs in rural and urban areas, as well as by gender and age of household members.

Chemicals are sourced either in the Far East via a Hong Kong based commercial partner or purchased directly from other European domestic suppliers. TA is responsible for the formulation and packaging of the finished product, which is then distributed in the domestic Italian market. Although TA is now profitable, further sales growth is unlikely. One of the owners is convinced that significant benefits may be obtained by identifying and controlling the key risks that TA is exposed to, in particular by reducing the price risk in their international supply chain.

The paper attempts to elaborate on the following questions. The first questions concern technology - are there any inter-and/or intrasectoral differences in Czech agriculture? The second question is connected to technological change among the sectors, while the third question deals with the relationship between technical efficiency, direct payments and localization of the company. We elaborate on these questions by employing the parametric approach - Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA). Specifically, we employ the Random Parameter Model specification, in which sector dummies are used to capture the intersectoral differences in technology. The results show there is significant heterogeneity among the studied sectors (i.e., combined, plant, animal and other production). Animal production results differ from other sectors in Labour elasticity, where this value reaches its lowest level (this may be connected to the fact that technology is labour saving). Capital and Material elasticities in animal production may suggest the use of other forms of financing, such as leasing, in this sector. Moreover, the analysis shows that technological change has a negative impact on production, and that it accelerates with time. We found that added value in Czech agriculture is going down, since technological change is Material using and the other production inputs saving. The intrasectoral differences in technological change are not statistically significant, thus we suppose that direct payments may not have such a strong impact on farmers' motivation to invest in new technology. Finally, the analysis did not confirm any statistically significant relationship between SAPS subsidies and technical efficiency. On the other hand, the estimation shows technical efficiency may be increased by TOP UP subsidies. Localization of the company in LFA has a negative impact on technical efficiency.

The trend to expect better urban living standards for inhabitants has significantly increased the demand for efficient and sustainable multi-modal transportation systems in large urban areas.

But still, the development of urban transportation policies partly relies on the availability of appropriate data and information. The research presented in this paper proposes a multi-modal and multi-scale GIS-T data model. The model introduced takes into account different transportation modes and integrates them within an integrated data model designed using an object-oriented approach. The model allows the development of specialised services designed after a survey and study of users' and planners' requirements. The approach is applied in a district of the city of Guangzhou and validated by a prototype development. This experimental system enables transportation planners and decision-makers to take better decisions effectively, and provides high-quality geospatial information-based services to final end-users.

This article attempts to answer the question by distinguishing between a 'dependence' on natural resources and an 'abundance' of the same. Dependence is measured in terms of exports of metals and fuel, while resource abundance is calculated on the basis of the subsoil assets per square kilometre and per capita. Results show the existence of a negative correlation between metals and ore exports and human development, while subsoil assets measures are, rather, positively related. These effects are particularly significant in countries with a comparatively lower institutional quality. The cases of Botswana, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Equatorial Guinea, briefly examined, suggest, however, that the effects of natural resources on human and economic development can be very different, and strictly related to specific national political and institutional characteristics.","Magna Graecia Univ Catanzaro, Dept DOPES, I-88100 Catanzaro, Italy",Magna Graecia University of Catanzaro,"Daniele, V (通讯作者)，Magna Graecia Univ Catanzaro, Dept DOPES, Viale S Venuta Germaneto, I-88100 Catanzaro, Italy.",v.daniele@unicz.it,"Daniele, Vittorio/ABI-6663-2020","Daniele, Vittorio/0000-0002-5977-6810",,,,,95,57,62,3,61,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Especially during the last years many biogas plants have been built due to increased feed-in tariffs for electricity guaranteed by the German renewable energy law. We analyse whether the use of arable and pasture land to produce 'feed' for the biogas plants increases farmland rental rates. The analysis is based on farm-level data of newly contracted rental agreements in 2005 and 2006 collected by the national agricultural census. We apply a spatial econometric approach to estimate the determinants of rental rates which explicitly takes dependence among neighbouring rental rates into account. Agricultural biogas production, measured as the share of acreage cultivated with energy crops, increases the rental rates in Western Germany significantly, but not in Eastern Germany. The estimated annual sum of additional rental payments due to biogas production projected on the whole rented acreage in Western Germany amounts to approximately (sic) 7 - 9 m. However, for rental agreements contracted after 2006 a higher impact on rental prices is expected.","[Habermann, Hendrik] Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Breustedt, Gunnar] Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Kiel; University of Gottingen,"Breustedt, G (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Okon & Landliche Entwicklung, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",gbreust@gwdg.de,,,,,,,44,34,34,1,8,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

This sector is put under the consideration of the Third National Agricultural Policy (1998-2010) in order to become the major area of concentration in fisheries production to improve the competitiveness of agriculture sector in Malaysia. At the national level, the development of aquaculture sector serves to resolve the insufficient fish supply as the main protein source of the household and reduces the social problems such as poverty, malnutrition and income inequality of the aquaculture farmers. Although the physical and financial drivers play their roles well in enhancing this sector, the climate variability provides major challenges in sustaining future outlook of aquaculture sector. Furthermore, the climate fluctuation raises the socio-economic vulnerability to aquaculture farmers due to the high production cost and production loss. The major concern of this study is to identify the association between climate variability and socio-economic vulnerability of the aquaculture farmers. Primary data was obtained from 120 aquaculture farmers in Sarawak, Malaysia. The findings revealed that there is significant association between climate variability and production loss especially when the water temperature changes and there is pandemic disease outbreaks. However, all factors have small effect on the aquaculture production loss. From the fanners' view, other factor such as less dissolved oxygen, drought season, raining season and flood event were also factors that contributing to production loss. The results suggest that an effective and accurate adaptation strategy is needed to help aquaculture farmers cope with the climate variability impacts in their production.","[Hamdan, Rosita; Kari, Fatimah; Othman, Azmah] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,,rositahamdan@gmail.com,"HAMDAN, ROSITA/AAE-4846-2021",,,,,,29,2,2,0,16,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9925-7,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,16.0,,,,,,47,52,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEW95,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000318459200009,0

A fuzzy-based approach is applied for the agriculture energy demand forecasting using socio-economic indicators. This approach is structured as a fuzzy linear regression (FLR). A hierarchical FLR model is designed properly. This paper indeed proposes a hierarchical FLR model by which the inputs to the ending level are obtained as outputs of the starting levels. Actual data from 1993-2006 is used to develop the hierarchical FLR and illustrate capability of the approach in this regard. The estimation fuzzy problem for the model is formulated as a linear optimization problem and is solved using the linear programming based simplex method. Furthermore, having obtained the. fuzzy parameters, the agriculture energy demand is predicted from 2007 to 2020. The results provide scientific basis for the planned development of the energy supply of agriculture sector in Iran.","[Kazemi, A.; Mehregan, M.

The primary goal of this paper is to identify social, economic, cultural and political changes which help rural (and urban) households to reduce energy consumption. The empirical work (tape interviews and surveys) was conducted in five European countries; each has rural and urban study areas (UK, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Germany and Hungary). The comparative research has found three (hierarchical, autocratic and democratic) energy governance models which are present in diverse (urban and rural) terrains inside the EU. None of these models have an absolute benefit regarding an effective energy-saving policy, or dominant influence on household behavior. Combinations of strengths and weaknesses are present in each energy-governance model, and no single one should be appointed as an ideal. One conclusion of this study is that successful and effective energy governance can be linked to multi-actor or hierarchical, single-centred political structures and networks. In European rural context local involvement and project class activity intermediate between governmental and local levels, enhance articulation of local needs, and facilitate a new coalition between stakeholders and non-governmental actors, that mutually adjusts all their interests, and promotes new governance approaches, may be the best practice toward reduction in household energy demand and management of climate change. The imperative introduction of new rural governance related to climate change management is seen as a main potential driver of European rural development.","Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Sociol, H-1014 Budapest, Hungary",Hungarian Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Social Sciences,"Kovách, I (通讯作者)，Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Sociol, Uri U 49, H-1014 Budapest, Hungary.",ikovach@socio.mta.hu,"Kovach, Imre/HSH-0281-2023","Kovach, Imre/0000-0002-3966-1274",,,,,32,0,0,0,6,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-2196-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,339,348,,,,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000338036100036,0

We conduct experiments with a longer horizon of 200 periods to find a possible reason for the timing of the crash. If the reason for the crash is the inability of subjects to backward induct, a long bubble should be observed. If, on the other hand, it is a learning effect, then the crash should occur after approximately 13 periods.

In our case we adopt a stated preference approach to study this problem and evaluate the effects of possible policy interventions. We also perform a detailed segmentation of the sample studied according to the socio-economic variables that prove statistically relevant when interacted with the attributes used to characterise airport choice. Moreover, in order to test for the presence of heterogeneity in agents' preferences we estimate several mixed logit models with different specifications, including heteroscedasticity and error component. With respect to previous studies we develop and extend the traditional SP approach by also analysing the role and relevance of attribute cut-offs in this research field.

The specific risk management practices which were considered include, risk capital determination approaches, risk infrastructure and stress-testing practices. A survey research design was used to carry out the research through use of questionnaires and interviews; additionally the Basic Indicator approach was used to quantitatively assess the adequacy of the risk capital. The main objective of the research was to check if Zimbabwean Merchant bank practices are in conformity with international best practices in risk management, covering the above mentioned areas. There is a lack of momentum towards Basel II implementation despite calls by the Central Bank since 2006. Risk management infrastructure of Merchant Banks in the form of operational and credit risk technology lacks capabilities recommended by the BIS,operational risk capital set-aside by Merchant banks is insufficient to cover operational risk, less benefits are being derived from risk management investments and this retard their desire by banks to conform to international best practices in risk management, majority of banks' ORM practices are placed between foundation and intermediate stage of capco framework, whereas CRM practices are placed on the intermediate stage, stress testing approach on credit risk is disastrous considering the integrated nature of risk exposures. Basel II implementation challenges were identified and their magnitude explains non-conformity to international best practices in risk management.","[Muvingi, Jacob] Harare Inst Technol, Harare, Zimbabwe",,"Muvingi, J (通讯作者)，Harare Inst Technol, Harare, Zimbabwe.",,"Muvingi, Jacob/HFZ-8335-2022",,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9173-2,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,12.0,,,,,,549,554,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8ZM,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000392895700104,0

We utilize compliance data from the Code of 'Best' Corporate Practices, disclosed annually by public firms in Mexico, as a measure of corporate governance strength. We document a significant increase in compliance over 2000-2004 indicating Mexican companies view non-compliance as costly. However, we find no association between the governance index and firm performance, nor is there a relation with transparency. Instead, we find firms with greater compliance resort to the more costly mechanism of making dividend payments (higher propensity to pay and greater yield) to reduce agency conflicts. We conclude these associations are the direct result of the institutional features of the Mexican business environment, which is characterized by concentrated ownership of insiders, interlocked boards of directors, a lack of insider trading enforcement, and generally poor protection of minority investors. Our results show that monitoring mechanisms alone are not enough to fundamentally change economic behavior. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM.

Its foundations can be expressed as follows: an improvement of regional quality of business environment stimulates the development of entrepreneurial activities with positive impacts on employment rate and creation of innovations; thus generated synergic effects reinforce the territorial integration of economy and regional competitiveness, which form the basic prerequisites for sustainable regional development. The objective validity of the theory has been confirmed mainly based on hypotheses that BEQ values have strong links to GDP level and further and correspond with the population of regions as the essential measure of their significance.

The findings show that establishing logistics functionality in China is the key for maintaining low prices. The critical challenges in procurement: quality, cost, and delayed delivery are seriously affected by logistics problems. The logistics barriers Japanese firms encountered in China have been changing; however, regulatory restrictions and local protection regulations still remain the most critical problems. Meanwhile, some new issues: a rise in logistics costs, local labor costs, and a shortage of human resources are becoming major concerns.","[Yu, Lanfeng] Gunma Prefectural Womens Univ, Fac Int Commun, Gunma, Japan",,,yu@gpwu.ac.jp,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,3,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8720-9,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,4.0,,,,,,384,388,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX59,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303217400075,0

I estimate parameters via indirect inference and show that under considerable real rigidity, sticky prices in a sticky-information environment are consistent with micro and macro evidence.

Fortification of food is viewed as a means of overcoming some of the problems associated with poor nutrition. This study analyses the market for fortified cereal foods in Botswana. The specific objectives of the study are to: (1) determine the importance of various product attributes of cereal products in influencing the purchasing decision of consumers in Botswana, (2) assess the willingness of consumers in Botswana to pay for fortified cereal foods, and (3) develop recommendations to guide private strategy and public policy for fortification in Botswana. The study is based on primary data collected from 452 consumers in Gaborone and the south-east administrative districts using a clustered sampling approach. Results show that, for consumers, the most important attributes, listed in order of importance, were product brand, product quality, price, colour/appearance and nutritional value. Consumers knew little about fortified foods. There is a close correlation between residential area and knowledge about fortified foods, with rural residents having the least knowledge. Willingness to pay for fortified milled products was very low among consumers owing to limited knowledge about fortification and its benefits. The segment-target-position (STP) framework is used to develop strategic recommendations for a market-led fortification programme.","[Mabaya, Edward] Cornell Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Jordaan, Danie] Market Matters Inc, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Malope, Patrick; Monkhei, Milly] Botswana Coll Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Gaborone, Botswana; [Jackson, Jose] Univ Botswana, Off Res & Dev, Gaborone, Botswana",Cornell University; Botswana College of Agriculture; University of Botswana,"Mabaya, E (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,"MALOPE, Patrick/HSE-7324-2023; Jackson, Jose/I-7211-2013; Jordaan, Danie/L-3259-2019","Jackson, Jose/0000-0001-5879-0306; Jordaan, Danie/0000-0002-6736-1789",,,,,27,8,11,0,8,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,DEC,2010,49.0,4,,,,,459,483,,10.1080/03031853.2010.526692,0.0,,,25,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,710CT,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000286489200005,0

Total factor productivity (TFP) growth is decomposed into efficiency change and technological change by using the Malmquist productivity index. The empirical results show that efficiency improvement is the major driver of TFP growth in the food-processing industry, whereas technological progress is the dominant contributor in the electrical machinery industry. There are positive spillovers on efficiency change but negative spillovers on technological change in the food-processing industry. However, FDI spillovers turn out to be negative in efficiency change while positive in technological progress in the electrical machinery industry. These findings demonstrate that different industries experience different sources of productivity gains, which are dependent on the characteristics of firms in the industry.","[Suyanto] Univ Surabaya, Fac Econ, Surabaya, Indonesia; [Salim, Ruhul A.] Curtin Univ, Curtin Business Sch, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA, Australia",Universitas Surabaya (UBAYA); Curtin University,"Suyanto (通讯作者)，Univ Surabaya, Fac Econ, Surabaya, Indonesia.",,"suyanto, suyanto/B-4381-2016","suyanto, suyanto/0000-0001-9084-8379",,,,,51,14,14,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

Small-cap firms outperform large caps over the year subsequent to an economic trough. In the year prior to the business cycle peak, however, small caps tend to lag. US style based large caps perform better over peaks, but there is no dominant category across size and book to market asset classes over troughs. The US small cap premium is related to default risk, although recessions per se do not on average impact on this premium. Default risk and the inflation risk differential between Canada and the US significantly impact on the Canada-US equity premium. Abnormal positive performance observed for US small caps in the recent (post 2001) period as well as for the long horizon is attributable to the small cap growth cohort. Canadian small firm stocks also exhibit significantly positive performance in the post 2001 period. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Specifically, following an expansive monetary policy shift, funding conditions improve and market-wide liquidity increases, which is especially beneficial for illiquid securities. The improved liquidity and funding conditions reduce the returns required for holding illiquid securities. Consequently, illiquid stocks experience relatively large price increases when monetary conditions become expansive, and thus, the measured return spread between illiquid and liquid stocks expands substantially. Overall, our evidence supports the claim that the price of asset liquidity is dependent on monetary conditions.

The p-median model, one of the most widely used location models of any kind, locates p facilities and allocates demand nodes to them to minimize total weighted distance traveled. In comparison, the flow-refueling location model (FRLM) is a path-based demand model that locates p stations to maximize the number of trips on their shortest paths that can be refueled. For a path to be considered refuelable, one or more stations must be located on the path in a way that allows the round trip to be completed without running out of fuel, given the vehicle driving range. In this paper, we analyze how well the facilities located by each model perform on the other's objective function on road networks in Florida. While each objective function degrades somewhat when facilities are located by the other model, the stations located by the flow-refueling model generally do better on the p-median objective than the stations located by the p-median model do on the flow-refueling objective. This difference between the two models is even more pronounced at the state scale than at the metropolitan scale. In addition, the optimal locations for the FRLM tend to be more much more stable as p increases than those located by the p-median model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

But in the daily practice of mobility planning we come across more and more critical statements. As the Flemish Ministry of Mobility and Public Works considers investing resources in an improved location policy, they asked for evidence on the possible results of location policy on sustainable commuting in a Flemish context, including Brussels. Quite exceptionally, we utilise the individual census data from nearly all 1, 2 million Flemish commuters. These detailed data allow a precise description of the commuter characteristics of different locations and allow the construction of a robust geographical pattern. We focus the analysis on four kinds of locations: railway stations, public transport junctions, urban areas and areas with a high economic density. An exploratory data analysis suggests that people working and/or living in these areas travel less distance, especially by car, and make more use of public transport and slow modes. A cluster analysis shows that there are spatial differences, resulting in clear geographical patterns, which suggest that policies should be spatially differentiated. As a result, we support the idea of using location policy to produce more sustainable commuting. From a methodological point of view, we conclude that census data are irreplaceable to meet the requirements of spatial representativity needed to construct detailed geographical patterns of commuting.

Funding ratios - pension assets relative to pension liabilities - have long been considered important for estimating cash flows needed for current and future pension contributions (Ballester et al., 1998). However, US GAAP or IFRS funding ratios that companies report in their financial statements may differ from funding ratios used by pension regulators. These regulatory funding ratios may be more useful for predicting future contributions. We investigate whether US regulatory and GAAP funding ratios are different and whether regulatory funding ratios provide useful information for predicting future contributions. For 3,877 firm years from 1995 through 2002, we observe that regulatory and GAAP funding ratios differ by more than 5% for 73% of our sample.

Model results provide evidence that national anti-smoking policies increased both quitting success and intention to quit. However, the impacts of these policies are uneven throughout Korean society. Females and those who exercise for health maintenance experienced higher quit success. Heavy smokers and high frequency alcohol drinkers stated they are less likely to quit smoking post-policy. One impact of national anti-smoking policies is reduced provincial differences among Koreans in both quit success and intention to quit.

Yet, wind is an open access resource, and past experiences with open access resources suggest that tragedies of the commons may occur. While the engineering literature has focused on turbine siting within a wind farm to maximize profits and minimize interaction effects, the economics literature has overlooked interaction effects between windfarms. We provide a qualitative framework for measuring wake externalities and use simulation modeling to determine their magnitude. We find that: a) turbine wake externalities (and thus losses) to downwind sites increase with the square of wind velocity and can be substantial, b) decentralized ownership across wind farms leads to overcapitalization in upwind sites and undercapitalization in downwind sites relative to sole ownership, c) when multiple potential patches are considered, more land will be used upwind for wind power under decentralized ownership, and d) numerical simulations suggest that total rents are reduced under decentralized ownership by up to 12%, while total power produced increases by approximately 10%.

I investigate this issue by estimating how much reading time increases as a result of public library use. To address the endogeneity of library use I use an IV approach where the instrument is a household's distance to their closest public library. Using data from the Current Population Survey, American Time Use Survey, and National Household Education Survey, I find that library use increases the amount of time an individual spends reading by approximately 27 min on an average day. Moreover, it increases the amount of time parents spend reading to/with young children by 14 min. This increase in reading is more than offset by a 59 min decrease in time spent watching television, and there is no significant change in time spent on other activities. For children in school, library use positively impacts homework completion rates. A simple cost-benefit exercise highlights the potential application of these results for local governments who fund these libraries. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We then show that the expected distribution of member shares within a fully IEA is a harmonic series, with the share distribution depending only on the number of IEA members. This property is then used to develop a composite indicator of the degree of economic integration within an IEA that indicates the distance between the theoretical and actual distribution of shares: the closer is the actual distribution to the expected distribution, the greater the degree of integration.

The net equalization scheme reduces ex-post federal intervention and should therefore be favored over the gross equalization scheme in order to reduce opportunistic regional behaviour. In addition, the two equalization schemes differently affect the composition of public expenditures. The gross equalization scheme generates an upward distortion of the amount of capital public expenditures whereas the net equalization scheme generates a downward distortion of the amount of current public expenditures compared to the optimum. A welfare analysis reveals that incentives to use a net equalization scheme are strengthened for a sufficiently high number of regions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Economics experiments and game-theoretic analyses suggest that cooperation can arise from a willingness to punish noncooperative behavior, even at personal cost. Such behavior is often based on the notion that people who punish noncooperators value cooperation in itself. We show, by contrast, that people who like to cheat but also punish other cheaters - people who are Unpleasant, but who also have a strategic desire to avoid being punished themselves - can form the basis for widespread, even complete cooperation in society. Ultimately, such Unpleasant but strategic types can create conditions where all cooperate even though everyone would prefer to cheat. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

I find that the superior forecasting power of cday is due to: (i) its ability to track the changes in the composition of asset wealth; and (ii) the faster rate of convergence of the coefficients to the long-run equilibrium parameters.

Material values are investigated under the concept of materialism which is broadly defined as a set of centrally held beliefs about the importance of possessions in one's life (Richins & Dawson, 1992). The current study is primarily concerned with specifying value antecedents of materialism in a Turkish adult sample. Data were collected from a sample of 948 university students through the measure of materialism by Richins and Dawson and the Schwartz Value Survey. Two measures were used to test the effect of materialism on subjective well-being. Results provided strong evidence toward positive associations between self-enhancement motives and materialism. The findings also validate the central assumption in the literature that materialism diminishes well-being. The relationships among values, materialism, and well-being are discussed within a value congruity perspective. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The main interest resides in the average frequency of price re-optimization by firms. We use the labor income share as the driving variable and consider a source of real rigidity by allowing for a fixed firm-specific capital stock. A GMM estimation strategy is employed as well as an identification robust method based on the Anderson-Rubin statistic. We find that the German Phillips curve is purely forward-looking. Moreover, our point estimates are consistent with the view that firms re-optimize prices every 2-3 quarters. These estimates seem plausible from an economic point of view. But the uncertainties around these estimates are very large and also consistent with perfect nominal price rigidity, where firms never re-optimize prices. This analysis also offers some explanation as to why previous results for the German NKPC based on GMM differ considerably. First, standard GMM results are very sensitive to the way in which orthogonality conditions are formulated. Further, model mis-specifications may be left undetected by conventional J tests. This analysis points out the need for identification robust methods to get reliable estimates for the NKPC. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This article provides empirical evidence from German CIS data on the innovative performances of this specific type of firms, supporting why they matter. We first characterize YICs in the sample of innovation active firms. We show that firms that combine newness, smallness, and high R&D intensity are rare in the sample of innovative firms, but achieve significantly higher innovative sales than other innovative firms, especially innovative sales that are new to the market. Not surprisingly, YICs view financial constraints, both internal and external, as an important factor hampering their innovation activities, significantly more so than other innovation active firms. This access to finance problem is an often used motive for government intervention. On the effectiveness of subsidies, our results suggest that the subsidy allocation mechanisms at place in Germany during the sample period are not associated with relatively higher innovative performance of the subsidized YICs as compared to other recipients.","[Schneider, Cedric] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Econ, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Veugelers, Reinhilde] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Veugelers, Reinhilde] CEPR London, London, England",Copenhagen Business School; KU Leuven; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Schneider, C (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Econ, Porcelaenshaven 16A, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",csc.eco@cbs.dk; reinhilde.veugelers@econ.kuleuven.be,,"Schneider, Cedric/0000-0002-4403-104X",,,,,64,197,208,1,52,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Changes in the relative convenience and cost of checks can explain directly about 34% and 11%, respectively, of the 8.4 percentage point decline in check share from 2003 to 2006. Changes in the relative characteristics of substitute payment instruments also likely contributed indirectly to the decline in check use through an increase in the number of payment instruments per consumer, but the exact magnitude of this indirect channel cannot be identified with available data.

The results show that agents who are likely to achieve a higher level of conservation should be offered a contract where transfers depend on the final outcome, with a bonus for a high ecological level of the forest. When conservation measures are correlated with forest management, we show that the contractual measures involve distorted transfers.

Concerning the costs, a full discrimination of the abatement effort minimizes the total cost when the impact of polluters changes spatially, while a uniform effort can reach a pollution target in flexible ways. In this case, the increase of the degree of discrimination of the abatement effort is required only if it generates significant positive economies. Our theoretical and empirical results have shown that the discrimination advantage becomes insignificant for either very demanding or very little demanding ecological standards and varies according to the polluters' profile. In the case of intermediate standards, efficiency gains become negligible with a restricted number of effort levels.","[Destandau, Francois; Nafi, Amir] UMR Cemagref Engees, Lab GSP, F-67070 Strasbourg, France",INRAE,"Destandau, F (通讯作者)，UMR Cemagref Engees, Lab GSP, 1 Quai Koch,BP 61039, F-67070 Strasbourg, France.",francois.destandau@engees.unistra.fr; amir.nafi@engees.unistra.fr,,,,,,,17,2,2,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

First, the return difference between low and high IV stocks - that we dub as IVF - is a priced factor in the cross-section of stock returns. Second, loadings on lagged market variance and lagged average IV account for a significant portion of variation in average returns on portfolios sorted by IV. Third, the variance of IVF correlates closely with average IV, and the two variables have similar explanatory power for the time-series and cross-sectional stock returns. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Controlling for cross-country differences in regulatory and environmental conditions, we find that, on average, cost efficiency increases irrespective of whether we use OBS or non-interest income, although the results for profit efficiency are mixed. Our results also reveal that while the inclusion of non-traditional outputs does not alter the directional impact of environmental variables on bank inefficiency, regulations that restrict bank activities and enhance monitoring and supervision provisions improve both cost and profit efficiency.

We find that issuance is positively and significantly related to increases in all three supply measures.

We examine the profitability of such trades for the period 2001-2009. Yen carry trades generated high mean returns and Sharpe ratios prior to the recent financial crisis. They continued to outperform major stock markets for the full sample period. Given the non-normality of carry trade returns, we apply non-parametric tests based on stochastic dominance (SD) to evaluate whether the high returns of yen carry trades are compatible with risk as reflected in returns on US and global stock market indices. We apply a general test for SD developed recently by Linton, Maasoumi and Whang (2005) to six currencies as well as portfolios of these currencies. For a large class of risk-averse investors, profits from yen carry trades cannot be attributed to risks. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A rotation policy that routinely reassigns loan officers to borrowers of a commercial bank affects the officers' reporting behavior. When an officer anticipates rotation, reports are more accurate and contain more bad news about the borrower's repayment prospects. As a result, the rotation policy makes bank lending decisions more sensitive to officer reports. The threat of rotation improves communication because self-reporting bad news has a smaller negative effect on an officer's career prospects than bad news exposed by a successor.","[Hertzberg, Andrew; Paravisini, Daniel] Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY USA; [Liberti, Jose Maria] Depaul Univ, Chicago, IL 60604 USA",Columbia University; DePaul University,"Hertzberg, A (通讯作者)，Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY USA.",,,,,,,,46,108,118,1,49,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

First, items eligible to differentiate between the intentions of compliance and non-compliance were collected from past research and newly developed, and tested empirically with the aim of producing four validated scales with a clear factorial structure. Second, findings from the first analyses were replicated and validated on the basis of motives of compliance and non-compliance, and on the basis of behaviour in a tax experiment. A standardised inventory is provided which can be used in surveys in order to collect data which are comparable across research focusing on self-reports.

To address this question, we use a unique micro price dataset which we have compiled from individual listings (or transactions) in a widely circulated real estate advertisement magazine. This dataset contains more than 700,000 listings of housing rents over the last 20 years. We start from the analysis of microeconomic rigidity and then investigate its implications for aggregate price dynamics, closely following the empirical strategy proposed by Caballero (Caballero and Engel, 2007). We find that 90% of the units in our dataset had no change in rents per year, indicating that rent stickiness is three times as high as in the United States. We also find that the probability of rent adjustment depends little on the deviation of the actual rent from its target level, suggesting that rent adjustments are not state-dependent but time-dependent. These two results indicate that both the intensive and extensive margins of rent adjustments are small, resulting in a slow response of the CPI for rent to aggregate shocks. We show that the CPI inflation rate would have been higher by 1% point during the bubble period, and lower by more than 1% point during the period following the burst of the bubble, if Japanese housing rents were as flexible as those in the United States.

While Basel II backtests VaR by counting the number of exceptions, this paper proposes to use the saddlepoint technique by summing the sizes of tail losses. Monte Carlo simulations show that the technique is extremely accurate and powerful, even for small samples. Empirical applications for the proposed backtest find substantial downside tail risks in S&P 500, and demonstrate that risk models which account for jumps, skewed and fat-tailed distributions failed to capture the tail risk during the 1987 stock market crash. Finally, the saddlepoint technique is used to derive a multiplication factor for any risk capital requirement that is responsive to the sizes of tail losses. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In accord with the predictions of recent models of strategic settlement of financial claims, we document a tendency by lenders to delay delivery of loaned funds until the afternoon hours. We find banks to follow a simple strategy to manage the risk of account overdrafts, by delaying settlement of large payments relative to that of small payments. More sophisticated strategies such as increasing delays when own liquid balances are low and when dealing with small trading partners play a marginal role.

It also allows for conditional nonnormal return innovations, which is critically important because heteroskedasticity alone does not suffice to capture the option smirk. We analyze a class of EMMs for which the resulting risk-neutral return dynamics are from the same family of distributions as the physical return dynamics. In this case, our framework nests the valuation results obtained by Duan (1995) and Heston and Nandi (2000) by allowing for a time-varying price of risk and nonnormal innovations.

The upper level shows car ownership, motorcycle ownership, and no vehicle-ownership choices, and the lower level shows the mode choice combinations for two-traveller households. Trip sharing is considered as one of the mode-choice options in the model. The proposed model is analysed using data from the Bangkok Metropolitan Region. The analysis conducted informs that Central Business District (CBD) travel, long distance travel, household income, job status, age of travellers and presence of school children in households are key aspects in household travel decisions. Based on these aspects, households make important decisions on vehicle ownership, mode choice and trip sharing. In addition, this study reveals commuters' hidden preferences for modes that are not in existence, in particular the Mass Rapid Transit System in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region due to be fully implemented in 2010.

The fifty-six IPOs had first-day returns that were, on average, 23% higher than similar IPOs. The profits collected by these executives were only a small fraction of the incremental amount of money left on the table by their companies when they went public. These companies were dramatically less likely to switch investment bankers in a follow-on offer: only 6% of issuers whose executives were spun switched underwriters, whereas 31% of other issuers switched.

At the market level, investor sentiment is the most important determinant of credit spreads. At the firm level, credit spreads generally rise with cash flow volatility and beta, with the effect of cash flow beta varying with market conditions. We identify implied volatility as the most significant determinant of default risk among firm-level characteristics.

One tool that has been suggested for combating sprawl is the land or split-rate tax. In theory, such taxes can raise the ratio of housing capital to land. This in turn can raise the density of housing units where it is applied, if the average size of housing units does not increase enough to offset an effect on the number of housing units. This research explores these issues, looking at a panel of land uses and demographics in Pennsylvania. We confirm the theoretical prediction that the split-rate tax raises the capital/land ratio. We also find that the primary effect is in more housing units, rather than bigger units, suggesting the split-rate tax is potentially a powerful anti-sprawl tool.

Did euro introduction benefited to French exporters? And if so, how did they expand? We investigate these issues by using detailed French firm-level exports data, provided by the French customs. First, we find that French firms export disproportionately more to the most integrated destinations (European Union). When these destinations are considered, we find that more firms export more products, each year, as compared to less integrated regions. Hence, more individual shipments are registered, each year, for these destinations. The value of exports that is recorded for each individual shipment is also more important. In a second step, we quantify the effects of a greater integration due to the adoption of the euro in 1999. We find that the euro promoted French exports to eurozone destinations, as compared to similar destinations outside the eurozone. This effect is channeled mainly through the number of individual shipments. French firms increased the number of products they export, each year, to eurozone destinations. However, the number of exporters remained unaffected.","[Fontagne, Lionel] Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, F-75231 Paris 05, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Paris School of Economics,,antoine.berthou@cepii.fr; lionel.fontagne@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,13,0,0,1,9,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

The aim is to disentangle instances when this constitutes a natural phenomenon associated with a process of financial development and innovation from those where it constitutes a worrisome signal. We identify economic variables that have leading indicator properties, thus helping to distinguish between benign episodes from those likely ending with downward pressures on the exchange rate or even a fully-fledged banking crisis. We find that a large current account deficit, a fall in price competitiveness, strong real growth and high public debt-to-GDP ratio increase the probability that a lending or housing boom would be accompanied by financial market tensions shortly after the peak.

We focus on empirical work that seeks to test the basic coverage-risk prediction of adverse selection theory-that is, that policyholders who purchase more insurance coverage tend to be riskier. The analysis of this body of work, we argue, indicates that whether such a correlation exists varies across insurance markets and pools of insurance policies. We discuss various reasons why a coverage-risk correlation may not be found in some pools of insurance policies. The presence of a coverage-risk correlation can be explained either by moral hazard or adverse selection, and we discuss methods for distinguishing between them. Finally, we review the evidence on learning by policyholders and insurers.","[Cohen, Alma] Tel Aviv Univ, Eitan Berglas Sch Econ, NBER, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Cohen, Alma] Harvard Univ, Sch Law, John M Olin Ctr Law Econ & Business, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Siegelman, Peter] Univ Connecticut, Sch Law, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",Tel Aviv University; Harvard University; University of Connecticut,"Cohen, A (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Eitan Berglas Sch Econ, NBER, Tel Aviv, Israel.",almac@post.tau.ac.il,"Cohen, Alma/R-9690-2019",,,,,,111,204,236,14,105,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

Alternative financing schemes, which rely on larger contributions from students, are being increasingly adopted. Those based on income-contingent loans provide insurance against uncertain educational outcomes. We consider a unified framework where we analyze the following schemes: 1) the traditional tax-subsidy, 2) pure loans, 3) income-contingent loans with risk-sharing, and 4) income-contingent loans with risk-pooling. We focus on their insurance role and their effect on higher education participation.

We find that, at the median, pension accruals under the old scheme rules were worth 14.7 per cent of current salary to members, while if the new scheme rules were applied to all current members this would fall to 11.2 per cent. We find that this reduction in generosity is more than sufficient to offset the increase in generosity implied by rising life expectancies over the last quarter of a century. In addition, we show how the estimates depend on both the shape of the underlying age-earnings profile and the headline pay award. We find that the value of the new scheme rules to Teachers' Pension Scheme (TPS) members is similar to the value of the defined contribution pension offered to civil servants, but worth more than a simple, example, private sector defined contribution scheme.","[Disney, Richard] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Tetlow, Gemma] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of Nottingham; University of London; University College London,"Disney, R (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",richard.disney@nottingham.ac.uk; carl_emmerson@ifs.org.uk; gemma_tetlow@ifs.org.uk,,,"ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1, RES-544-28-5001] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,30,1,1,1,9,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0143-5671,,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

It shows that the stabilizing properties of monetary policy strategies are sensitive to both the existence of lags in the transmission mechanism and the design of target rules. A strategy focusing on the change in the output gap is likely to prove inferior to targeting the average rate of inflation in a model where monetary policy affects the real economy sooner than inflation. Even more favourable results for average inflation targeting emerge in a framework that also includes forward-looking expectations. These results stand in marked contrast to those in standard models where policy lags are absent. To ensure sound choice of policy, central banks are advised to examine the stabilizing properties of monetary policies in a variety of models.","[Guender, Alfred V.] Univ Canterbury, Dept Econ & Finance, Christchurch 1, New Zealand; [Gillmore, David R.] Reserve Bank New Zealand, Wellington, New Zealand",University of Canterbury; Reserve Bank of New Zealand,"Guender, AV (通讯作者)，Univ Canterbury, Dept Econ & Finance, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 1, New Zealand.",alfred.guender@canterbury.ac.nz; david.gillmore@rbnz.govt.nz,,"Guender, Alfred/0000-0001-6234-5643",,,,,28,0,0,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

The results of our study indicate that the association between parent ownership and subsidiary performance is nonlinear and that some parents behave opportunistically toward their publicly traded subsidiaries.","[Atanasov, Vladimir] Coll William & Mary, Mason Sch Business, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA; [Boone, Audra] Univ Kansas, Sch Business, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Haushalter, David] Penn State Univ, Smeal Coll Business, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",William & Mary; University of Kansas; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Atanasov, V (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Mason Sch Business, POB 8795, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",vladimir.atanasov@mason.wm.edu; alboone@ku.edu; dhaushalter@psu.edu,"Atanasov, Vladimir/N-1806-2014","Atanasov, Vladimir/0000-0002-1893-6187",,,,,41,25,31,1,27,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

Cross-country cultural differences are measured with an individualism index developed by Hofstede (2001), which is related to overconfidence and self-attribution bias. We find that individualism is positively associated with trading volume and volatility, as well as to the magnitude of momentum profits. Momentum profits are also positively related to analyst forecast dispersion, transaction costs, and the familiarity of the market to foreigners, and negatively related to firm size and volatility. However, the addition of these and other variables does not dampen the relation between individualism and momentum profits.","[Chui, Andy C.

With a new data set covering approximately 85% of the buyout funds active in Italy during the period of 1999-2006, we find that a regulation that prohibits LBOs can reduce their frequency, but does not exclude them altogether.

The regulator must here cope with two simultaneous price distortions: one that comes from pollution and the other which is caused by the eco-industry's market power. In this context, we show that taxing emissions while subsidizing polluters' abatement efforts cannot lead to first-best, but the opposite occurs provided it is the eco-industry's output which is subsidized. When public transfers also create distortions, welfare can be higher if the regulator uses only an emission tax, but subsidizing abatement suppliers while taxing emissions remains optimal when the eco-industry is concentrated.","[David, Maia] AgroParisTech Econ Publ, INRA, UMR, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Sinclair-Desgagne, Bernard] HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada; [Sinclair-Desgagne, Bernard] CIRANO, Montreal, PQ H3A 2A5, Canada; [Sinclair-Desgagne, Bernard] Ecole Polytech, F-75230 Paris, France",AgroParisTech; INRAE; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; Universite de Montreal,"David, M (通讯作者)，AgroParisTech Econ Publ, INRA, UMR, 16 Rue Claude Bernard, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",maia.david@agroparistech.fr; bsd@hec.ca,,,,,,,25,47,51,0,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

A Problem with Comparative Return Plots on Finance Websites and a Bias Against Income-Generating Assets,JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Comparative return charting; Portfolio efficiency; Total returns; Dividends; Finance websites,DIVIDEND POLICY; INFORMATION,"This paper brings to light and discusses a systemic issue in the calculation and display of relative return information as currently seen on some of the most prominent finance websites; income-generating events such as dividends and interest are not included in relative return calculations and all comparative return graphics. The resulting ranking of the securities, based on such incomplete returns, is essentially meaningless from a total return perspective, yet they are being served to millions of investors every day. This could lead to the formation of a possible availability heuristic and an optical bias against fixed-income and other income generating assets. This problem has gone unnoticed for many years with no discussion of the topic either in the academic or practitioner press. The ready availability of such unclear or inaccurate information from sources generally perceived to be credible can, in this age of do-it-yourself portfolio management, have serious and damaging financial consequences to the unsuspecting investor. The paper also shows the effect of this return differential on the calculation of the asset correlation matrices and the subsequent effect on the resulting asset-weight vectors that are used to generate Markowitz style mean-variance portfolios. The visual discrepancies are then supported by the application of the Gibbons, Ross and Shanken [1989] W-test for portfolio efficiency. The authors' proposed correction, based on elementary finance, fixes the problem.","[Agrrawal, Pankaj; Borgman, Richard] Univ Maine, Orono, ME 04469 USA",University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono,"Agrrawal, P (通讯作者)，Univ Maine, DPC Business Bldg, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",pankaj.agrrawal@maine.edu,"Agrrawal, Pankaj/AAM-6317-2020","Agrrawal, Pankaj/0000-0002-8617-433X",,,,,26,9,11,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1542-7560,,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

Because lagged skewness alone does not adequately forecast skewness, we estimate a cross-sectional model of expected skewness that uses additional predictive variables. Consistent with recent theories, we find that expected idiosyncratic skewness and returns are negatively correlated. Specifically, the Fama-French alpha of a low-expected-skewness quintile exceeds the alpha of a high-expected-skewness quintile by 1.00% per month. Furthermore, the coefficients on expected skewness in Fama-MacBeth cross-sectional regressions are negative and significant.

It departs from usual prescriptions based on the permanent income hypothesis and argues that capital-scarce countries should prioritize domestic investment. Because revenue streams are highly volatile, governments should protect consumption from shocks by increasing it only cautiously. Volatility in domestic investment can be moderated by a buffer of international liquidity, but it is also important to structure investment processes to be able to cope efficiently with substantial fluctuations.

Following the tradition of the accounting literature, two accounting cultures were selected for their paradigmatic opposition: the French and the British financial reporting systems, using a balanced sample of 50 companies extracted from each country. Using content analysis, the environmental elements expressed in monetary terms were subsequently summarized, while as the relevant regulatory benchmark, four separate accounting frameworks were used: the French chart of accounts, UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the European directives and recommendations on account preparation and corporate reporting, and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The results of this investigation are aiming to enrich the existing evidence in support of a highly relevant assumption: environmental accounting becomes relevant to stakeholders only when environmental impacts are quantifiable in monetary terms and are assimilated into public corporate disclosure.","[Dragomir, Voicu Dan; Anghel (Ilcu), Elena Roxana] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,ilcu_roxana@yahoo.com,"Dragomir, Voicu D./B-6745-2012","Dragomir, Voicu D./0000-0003-3704-6996",,,,,32,0,0,1,3,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",,,978-606-505-347-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,693,715,,,,,,23,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BSE06,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284258100041,0

As the public and media noticed, from the start of the current recession in December 2007 through June 2009 men accounted for more than three-quarters of net job losses. Other differences have garnered less attention but are just as interesting. During the same period, the employment of single people fell at more than twice the rate that it did for married people and the decline for black workers was one and a half times that for white workers.

The aim of the study was to verrify a hypothesis, that biochanin A, another phytoestrogen, influences meiotic maturation of pig oocytes in a manner analogous to data published on genistein or estradiol. We monitored effects on the nuclear maturation and the expansion of cumular cells during meiotic maturation in vitro. The oocytes were cultured 24 hours to the metaphase I stage. Five concentrations of biochanin A in the culture medium (0, 20, 30, 40, 50 pg/ml) were tested. Biochanin A inhibited both the nuclear maturation as well as the expansion of cumular cells of pig oocytes, depending on the dose. The cumular expansion process seems to be even more sensitive than nuclear maturation. When the highest concentration used increased presence of abnormal oocytes (20%) was found. The changes in nuclear maturation induced by biochanin A were more pronounced than in data published on comparable concentrations of genistein, the phytoestrogen with higher binding ability to ER.","[Hoskova, K.; Vodkova, Z.; Klabanova, P.; Rajmon, R.; Petr, J.] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Agrobiol Food & Nat Resources, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,,hoskovak@af.czu.cz,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-2141-0,,,,2010,,,,,,,137,142,,,,,,6,Economics; Environmental Sciences,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BG8RL,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000392678700018,0

This method is compared with several different basic methods of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM). The following analysis is based on a mathematical algorithm of an established MCDM method and does not consider validity of any selected socio-economic criteria. The paper focuses on the normalization of criteria values. The normalization of data is one of many possible approaches that enable the comparison of indicators with different units of measurement or non comparable value intervals. Both the strengths and weaknesses of MCDM method for regions with concentrated state aid are presented. The established method is the most intuitive Weighted Sum Approach (WSA). For the purposes of Czech districts evaluation the normalization in WSA is modified in a way which decreases sensitivity on the lowest criteria values of a dominated variant. This enables to satisfy the need of the comparison of all Czech districts, with some districts being dominated with very low criteria values. Even though the normalization method has been chosen correctly, the procedure to normalise the whole set of criteria decreased the quality of output. For previous period, some criteria were not normalised before their aggregation and the normalization was applied only to the aggregated indicator. Therefore, the evaluation and classification of districts could be distorted. Due to the international crisis, these regions were updated and, subject to a criteria change, the procedure was modified in a correct way. The paper includes a simple proposal of the examined method modification that will prevent reversion to previous incorrect normalisation. Data used for all calculations were obtained from the Ministry for Regional Development. They were used for calculations of periods 2007 - 2009 and 2010 - 2013.","[Krejci, Igor; Hornicka, Andrea] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Syst Engn, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Krejcí, I (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Syst Engn, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",krejcii@pef.czu.cz; hornicka@pef.czu.cz,"Krejci, Igor/R-9263-2016","Krejci, Igor/0000-0003-2723-7289",,,,,7,0,0,0,1,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2123-6,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2010,,,,,,,291,297,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA6AE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000337077600033,0

We conducted fine-tuned field work with farmers in order to understand the key factors of substitution between underground and surface water at the farm level. A mixed integer linear programming framework has been used to model fruit and vegetable production systems and to infer the impact of instruments on farmers' income. Assuming this impact will sharply influence the acceptability of the instruments by the agricultural sector, we demonstrate why farmers' acceptance is of central concern for both the design and the implementation of an environmental policy. We further assessed the potential financial transfers that could be undertaken to increase acceptability. Our results echo scholars' doubts about the capacity of taxes to manage irrigation water use. We suggest that a policy relying on a well-priced substitutable resource would be greatly favoured by farmers and potentially by policy makers, since it will sharply decrease the transaction costs arising from the implementation of the instrument.","[Lenouvel, Vincent; Montginoul, Marielle] Irstea, G EAU Res Unit, F-34196 Montpellier 05, France; [Lenouvel, Vincent] Irstea, LAMETA Res Unit, F-34196 Montpellier 05, France",INRAE; INRAE,"Lenouvel, V (通讯作者)，Irstea, G EAU Res Unit, 361 Rue JF Breton,BP 5095, F-34196 Montpellier 05, France.",vincent.lenouvel@cemagref.fr,,"Montginoul, Marielle/0000-0002-8029-6475",Region Languedoc Roussillon; Montpellier Supagro; ONEMA,Region Languedoc Roussillon(Region OccitanieRegion Ile-de-France); Montpellier Supagro; ONEMA,"We thank Sophie Thoyer for comments on earlier drafts and the two anonymous referees for their valuable comments.

Generally the researchers argue that shareholders of a firm with more concentrated ownership may prefer less debt or even show their aversion to using it. This paper deals with the capital structure and financing choices of the companies. The main goal of the article is to analyze the relationship between ownership and capital structure in the food industry sector of polish companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. To measure firm's ownership concentration, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index of the firm's ownership structure (HHI) was used. The analysis shows slight correlation between researched parameters. To make the research deeper we included also other financial data, like liquidity and efficiency, to find their influence on capital structure, but through ownership concentration analysis. We found that higher level of ownership concentration caused lower debt financing, which meant that these companies avoided debts and did not use the financial gearing. Strong shareholders rather tend to use equity. Cash, not the rate of return seems to be important to major shareholders. This means that growth of the shareholder concentration determines more passive financial policy, avoiding debt in the capital structure. Weak positive correlation between the liquidity ratios and ownership concentration level has bee also observed. This means that growing shareholder concentration causes higher liquidity, and less risk acceptance. Analyzed companies with higher ownership concentration tend to minimize their assets in stock which another argument for the safe inventory policy. This fact supports passive financial strategy of these items, avoiding debts in the capital structure.","[Marszalek, Jakub; Kazmierska-Jozwiak, Bogna] Univ Lodz, Fac Management, PL-90131 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Marszalek, J (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Fac Management, Ul Matejki 22-26, PL-90131 Lodz, Poland.",jakmarszalek@gmail.com; bognakaj@uni.lodz.pl,"Bogna, Kaźmierska-Jóźwiak/P-6086-2017","Marszalek, Jakub/0000-0002-7665-1497",,,,,17,0,0,1,8,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2123-6,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2010,,,,,,,233,240,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA6AE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000337077600026,0

Many wonder how the current and capital accounts. which add up to zero, can influence exchange rates. This paper shows how payment flows arising from balance of payments imbalances affect the demands for different currencies in the foreign exchange market over time. Based on a dynamical system approach, the paper demonstrates how international payments evolve depending on the joint dynamic behaviour of different balance of payments components. It finds that international payments and exchange rates interact in fundamentally different ways depending on whether a country restricts its capital inflows and outflows. whether capital flows are accommodating or autonomous and whether the exchange rate is fixed, flexible or, say, governed by a crawling peg. Empirical evidence from major industrial countries as well as from countries hit by currency crises support the paper's theoretical predictions. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The steps that should be taken by internal auditors to improve the IT change management processes in order to reduce business risks and increase IT efficiency and effectiveness will be presented in this article. Because every change develops risks, appropriate controls over the IT changes to the system should exist and should be applied by the internal auditor in order to ensure that they are made properly. Therefore, the internal auditor has a significant role in governing successfully the IT change management processes which lead to increased business value. All organizations have to deal effectively with IT changes since virtually every business decision requires one or more changes to assets. When changes fail or are poorly controlled, the impact on the business can range from minor inconvenience to events that impact the achievement of business objectives, including the ability to comply with the growing body of regulation. In this new IT change management environment, internal auditors need to coordinate the IT risks with other risk-related control functions. Internal audit plays a key role in satisfying the organization's needs and expectations regarding IT change management processes. The last part presents an example of a business case, in which a company has an ineffective IT change management, which results in major issues for the business. After underlying the main disadvantages and issues the IT organization was previously facing and the benefits from implementing effective IT change management audit procedures, the authors bring their contribution by developing a set of control objectives for implementing an effective IT change management program in order for the top managers to have full control of all the changes that occur within that company ( regular changes, patches and emergency changes). These control objectives can help internal auditors to implement an effective IT change management program. All IT changes should be managed and controlled by the internal audit department, and result in outputs that are acceptable to the business.","[Nastase, Pavel; Ionescu, Corina] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest 010374, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,pavel.nastase@ase.ro; pavel.nastase@ase.ro,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,8,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",,,978-606-505-347-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,85,97,,,,,,13,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BSE06,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284258100005,0

Although growth in the region slowed dramatically with the onset of the crisis, only in the dominant province of East Kalimantan did overall growth turn (slightly) negative. There were strong negative effects on the agricultural, manufacturing and mining sectors, but these differed greatly across individual provinces. This study presents evidence on price trends for three key commodities - palm oil, rubber and gold - and discusses the effect on farmers of the steep falls in palm oil and rubber prices. Surprisingly, the crisis had remarkably little impact on open unemployment, and the ongoing decline in poverty was hardly interrupted (although this may simply have reflected the timing of the surveys used to measure poverty). The end of the crisis saw oil palm making a speedier recovery than rubber, with gold mining remaining the 'safety net' for poor farmers.","Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Potter, L (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,,,,,,,17,4,6,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-4918,,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Despite a growing literature on the economic theory of vaccine externalities and several innovative mathematical modeling approaches, there have been almost no empirical applications. The first objective of the paper is to develop a transparent, accessible economic framework for assessing the private and social economic benefits of vaccination. We also describe how stated preference studies (for example, contingent valuation and choice modeling) can be useful sources of economic data for this analytic framework. We demonstrate socially optimal policies using a graphical approach, starting with a standard textbook depiction of Pigouvian subsidies applied to herd protection from vaccination programs. We also describe nonstandard depictions that highlight some counterintuitive implications of herd protection that we feel are not commonly understood in the applied policy literature. We illustrate the approach using economic and epidemiological data from two neighborhoods in Kolkata, India. We use recently published epidemiological data on the indirect effects of cholera vaccination in Matlab, Bangladesh (Ali et al., 2005) for filling a simple mathematical model of how, protection changes with vaccine coverage. We use new data on costs and private demand for cholera vaccines in Kolkata, India, and approximate the optimal Pigouvian subsidy. We find that if the optimal subsidy is unknown, selling vaccines al full marginal cost may, under some circumstances, be a preferable second-best option to providing them for free.

The credit markets of the former socialist economies of Central and Eastern Europe were characterized, in general, by the syndrome of SBCs, whereby resources were often invested inefficiently. This paper empirically analyses the effect of joining the EU, where conditions for membership included the removal of SBCs, on restructuring the traditional financing methods for capital formation in EU transition economy enterprises. In the pre-entry period, enterprises in the transition economies are found to be sensitive to credit in financing capital formation, exhibiting the prevalence of SBCs. However, the cost of capital becomes more important in the post-entry period, which may be seen as a consequence of the reduced prevalence of SBCs, while market-driven interest rates become more important in determining investment.","Brunel Univ, Ctr Empir Finance, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England",Brunel University,"Moore, T (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, Ctr Empir Finance, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",tomoe.moore@brunel.ac.uk,,,,,,,30,5,5,0,11,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1367-0271,,,INT FINANC,Int.

This paper develops a methodology to estimate the REER that incorporates two distinctive elements that are not considered in the current literature and applies it to the Mediterranean quartet (MQ) of Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, whose common pattern of real appreciation has created concern in policy and academic circles. The two elements that this paper adds to the existing literature are (1) product heterogeneity when identifying each country's international competitors and their weights, and (2) a comprehensive treatment of services exports. Our refined measure suggests a modest reduction in the observed REER gap between the MQ countries and the other euro area countries. In particular, considering product heterogeneity and services exports implies a lower real appreciation from 1998 to 2006 on the order of 2 to 3 percent for all MQ countries. These are difference-in-difference estimates relative to the results obtained for the rest of the euro area countries using the same methodology.

Moreover, when the stock price changes, the recalculation of the prices and hedge ratios of the American options under the SHP method is quick because there is no need to solve the static hedge portfolio again. Finally, our static hedging approach also provides an intuitive derivation of the early exercise boundary near expiration. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The results indicate that the impacts of Internet activities on people's activity-travel patterns are significantly different across gender. in general, Internet use for maintenance purposes has a greater impact on women's activity-travel in the physical world, while Internet use for leisure purposes affects men's physical activities and travel to a greater extent.

To this end, qualitative choice models based on random utility theory have been widely employed in outdoor recreation studies. A frequent goal of applied studies has been the estimation of welfare changes associated with site attribute changes at recreation sites in order to inform regulatory policy and resource management. We review the evolution of the methodology of random utility theory in this field with a focus on taste heterogeneity models and then focus on the recent proposal of specifying utility in the WTP-space (Train K, Weeks M (2005) Discrete choice models in preference space and willing-to-pay space.

Under competing assumptions that ISO 14001 certification is adopted by firms either proactively or reactively, we test competing hypotheses about how this certification affects the market value of firms. The analysis is based on a sample of 80 environmental certifications of the plant systems or processes of large Spanish firms which traded on the continuous market of the Madrid Stock Exchange from 1996 to 2002. Using event study methodology, we found that ISO 14001 certification has a negative effect on the market value of certain firms. Specifically, the results obtained seem to show that the market negatively views the allocation of resources to ISO 14001 certification in the case of less polluting and less internationalised firms. On the other hand, the results obtained do not suggest clear evidence that the economic impact of ISO 14001 certification is negative for more polluting and more internationalised firms.","[Canon-de-Francia, Joaquin; Garces-Ayerbe, Concepcion] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ, Zaragoza 50005, Spain; [Canon-de-Francia, Joaquin; Garces-Ayerbe, Concepcion] Univ Zaragoza, Direcc Empresas, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",University of Zaragoza; University of Zaragoza,"Cañón-de-Francia, J (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",jcanon@unizar.es; cgarces@unizar.es,"de FRancia, Joaquín Cañón/ABF-9213-2020; AYERBE, CONCEPCIÓN GARCÉS/ABF-8162-2020","AYERBE, CONCEPCIÓN GARCÉS/0000-0003-4045-5918",,,,,64,89,95,0,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Then why is the supply of health care in the United States so insensitive to steeply rising prices? This paper conducts an econometric study to show that high health-care costs have an adverse impact on labor productivity, causing a negative production externality in all industries. So, can the rising cost of health-care affect the U.S. comparative advantage? The paper seeks answers to these questions in a general equilibrium model and finds that the labor productivity shock is responsible for the sluggish or declining supply of health care. Consumers are able to afford less health care due to a possible decline in real wages. U.S. comparative advantage becomes a nonissue, provided that the equilibrium is stable in spite of a negatively sloped health-care supply curve. Negative externality, leading to market failure, may be addressed in two alternative ways.

In general, waste generation is still increasing proportionally with income, and economic and environmental costs associated to landfilling are also increasing. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of waste generation, incineration and landfill dynamics based on panel data for the EU25, to assess the effects of different drivers (economic, structural, policy) and the eventual differences between Western and Eastern EU countries. We show that for waste generation there is still no Waste Kuznets Curve (WKC) trend, although elasticity to income drivers appears lower than in the past. Landfill and other policy effects do not seem to provide backward incentives for waste prevention, and in terms of landfill and incineration, as expected, they are respectively decreasing and increasing, with policy acting as a strong driver. Eastern countries appear to be performing generally quite well, thus benefiting from EU membership and related policies in terms of environmental performance. We can conclude that although absolute delinking is far from being achieved for waste generation, there are some first positive signs of an increasing relative delinking for waste generation and robust landfill diversion, and varying evidence of a significant role of the EU waste policies implemented in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Our evidence suggests that if while landfill diversion is currently associated to a delinking partly explained by EU policies, waste prevention must be the next objective of waste regulation efforts.","[Mazzanti, Massimiliano] Univ Ferrara, Dept Econ Inst & Terr, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy; [Mazzanti, Massimiliano; Zoboli, Roberto] CNR, CERIS, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Zoboli, Roberto] Catholic Univ Milan, Milan, Italy",University of Ferrara; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Mazzanti, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ferrara, Dept Econ Inst & Terr, Via Voltapaletto 11, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy.",ma.maz@iol.it,"Zoboli, Roberto/F-5974-2015","Zoboli, Roberto/0000-0003-4662-5949; mazzanti, massimiliano/0000-0002-6538-7942",,,,,74,120,126,1,41,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Apart from the usual cooperative or conflictual societies, their strategic choice can result in hierarchically stratified societies in which one group is dominant. We show how the presence and exploitation of certain types of resources matters for the occurrence of conflict or social hierarchical stratification and for the possible effects of trust manipulation. In particular we find that, first, robust (encompassing point and lootable) resource rich economies tend to be conflictual, plantation economies hierarchically stratified and diversified economies cooperative. Second, foreign intervention, aimed at changing the balance of power in the case of conflict, is most effective in robust and diffuse resource rich economies. Third, trust manipulation (as a means to counter conflict) is most effective in subsistence and diffuse resource rich economies. Throughout the article, we cite ample case study and econometric evidence to support our model.","[Schollaert, Arne; Van de Gaer, Dirk] Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Van de Gaer, Dirk] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium",Ghent University; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Schollaert, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Tweekerkenstr 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",arne.schollaert@UGent.be,"Van de gaer, Dirk/A-3899-2013",,,,,,50,3,3,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

In particular, we examine the extent to which individuals use features of the expenditure question to construct their answers. We test whether respondents interpret question wording as researchers intend and examine the extent to which prompts, clarifications and seemingly arbitrary features of survey design influence expenditure reports. We find that over one-quarter of respondents have difficulty distinguishing between 'you' and 'your household' when making expenditure reports; that respondents report higher pro-rata expenditure when asked to give responses on a weekly as opposed to annual timescale; that respondents give higher estimates when using a scale with a higher midpoint; and that respondents report higher aggregated expenditure when categories are presented in a disaggregated form. In summary, expenditure reports are constructed using convenient rules of thumb and available information, which will depend on the characteristics of the respondent, the expenditure domain and features of the survey question. It is crucial to further account for these features in ongoing surveys.","[Comerford, David; Harmon, Colm] IZA Bonn, UCD Geary Inst, UCD Sch Econ, Bonn, Germany",IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Comerford, D (通讯作者)，IZA Bonn, UCD Geary Inst, UCD Sch Econ, Bonn, Germany.",David.Comerford@ucd.ie; Liam.Delaney@ucd.ie; Colm.Harmon@ucd.ie,,"Delaney, Liam/0000-0002-3644-1161",,,,,33,4,4,0,7,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0143-5671,,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

We estimate that extending the carryback period from two to five years, as recently proposed in President Obama's budget blueprint, would provide $19 ($34) billion of additional liquidity to the corporate sector for 2008 (2009). Our calculations imply that the benefits of the extended carryback period would be concentrated in the homebuilding, automobile, and financial industries. Extending the carryback period would increase the marginal tax rate of loss firms by more than 200 basis points on average, which all else equal would lead corporations to use an additional $8 ($10) billion of debt and reduce tax payments by another $1.2 ($1.5) billion in 2008 (2009). Overall, the tax break proposed by the Obama administration would have a significant liquidity effect on corporations suffering large losses in recent years.

In exchange for illiquidity, these products provide the consumer with access to mutual-fund style portfolio choice, as well as the survival credit generated from pooling mortality risk. Our model generates optimal asset location patterns indicating how much to hold in liquid versus illiquid survival-contingent payouts over the lifetime, and also asset allocation paths, showing how to invest in stocks versus bonds. We show that the investor who moves her money out of liquid saving into survival-contingent assets gradually from middle age to retirement and beyond, will enhance her welfare by as much as 50%. The results are robust to the introduction of uninsurable consumption shocks in housing expenses, income flows during the worklife and retirement, sudden changes in health status, and medical expenses.

Moreover, we show that the relation between bank risk and capital regulations, deposit insurance policies, and restrictions on bank activities depends critically on each bank's ownership structure, such that the actual sign of the marginal effect of regulation on risk varies with ownership concentration.

A numerical simulation and an empirical application to an afforestation program in Spain show that the latter is the procedure that yields closer values to the CVM estimations, followed by (ii).","[Mogas, Joan] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Reus 43204, Spain; [Riera, Pere] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ Aplicada, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Brey, Raul] Pablo Olavide Univ, Dept Econ, Seville 41013, Spain",Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Mogas, J (通讯作者)，Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Avda Univ 1, Reus 43204, Spain.",joan.mogas@urv.cat; pere.riera@uab.es; rbresan@upo.es,,"Brey Sanchez, Raul/0000-0003-1376-1266",,,,,36,16,19,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

J,[Anonymous],,,,[Anonymous],,,Poverty and Governance: The Contest for Aid,REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Countries compete with one another for funds distributed by non-government organizations (NGOs). The authors consider a competition over poverty and governance conducted by a non-government organization trying to allocate its funds among potential recipient countries. In its decision-making the NGO also takes into account the initial conditions each potential recipient faces, including the current quality of governance and wealth (poverty). For example, all else being equal the poorer country will have a higher probability of obtaining funds; or, the better the applicant's governance, the more its gains. Moreover, the maximum aid a country can obtain depends on its wealth. Investment in good governance, the wealth/poverty status of the applicant, and its current quality of governance will, together, determine the funds potential recipients expect to obtain. The authors also consider recent changes in the levels of these factors. They want to understand the roles these factors play in the competition for aid and the outcome for the quality of governance.",,,,,,"Gang, Ira/0000-0003-3788-8798",,,,,12,1,1,0,3,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1363-6669,,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Corrupt countries are more likely to impose capital controls because corruption reduces a government's ability to collect tax revenue. If controls exist, however, individuals try to mitigate the burden by offering bribes, thereby increasing corruption. We test the model using panel data for 80 countries over the period 1984-2002 and find that corruption and restrictions indeed affect each other. Government's attempts to increase revenue via controls on capital might thus invoke a restrictions-rent-seeking spiral with destructively high levels of both. Using capital controls to increase revenue should be reconsidered.","[Dreher, Axel] Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Dreher, Axel] KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Zurich, Switzerland; [Dreher, Axel] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Dreher, Axel] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Siemers, Lars-H.

In the trust game paradigm, participants decided whether to hand money over to an anonymous individual who could either return more money back or keep all the money. Participants trusted too little, in that they grossly underestimated the proportion of their peers who would return money, prompting them to forgo profitable decisions to trust. However, participants also trusted too much. Given their high levels of cynicism and tolerance for risk, few should have handed money over, yet many still chose to trust. Possible explanations for this paradox of trusting too little yet too much are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The negative association is large; economically meaningful; long-lasting lip to five years; robust to known return-informative effects of size, value. price and earnings momentums and illiquidity; and extends to both systematic and idiosyncratic cashflow volatilities. Using the standard deviations of cashflow to sales and of cashflow to book equity as proxies for cashflow volatility, the least volatile decile portfolio outperforms the most volatile decile portfolio by 13% a year relative to the Fama-French four factors. The cashflow volatility effect is closely related to the idiosyncratic return volatility effect documented in Ang et al. [Ang, A., Hodrick. R.J., Xing, Y. and Zhang, X. The cross-section of volatility and expected returns. Journal of Finance, 51 (2006), 259-299.]. However, in portfolios simultaneously sorted on both cashflow and return volatilities, and in cross sectional regressions of returns at the firm level, these two effects neither drive out nor dominate each other, While the pricing of idiosyncratic cashflow volatility represents an anomaly against the traditional asset pricing theories, the pricing of historical cashflow uncertainty sheds light on potential fundamental risks embodied in the Fama-French HML and SMB factors.

It constitutes 30% of the risk for a portfolio of small cap stocks but less than 1% for a portfolio of large cap stocks. The national supervising agency in each membership country is advised by the Basel rules to add an additional capital charge to a bank whose models do not capture event risk. The large variation in event risk, also found across 10 individual stocks, suggests that an approach that varies the capital surcharge, based on the type of asset, should be used by the supervisors.","[Wilhelmsson, Anders] Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ, S-22007 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Wilhelmsson, A (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ, POB 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.",anders.vilhelmsson@nek.lu.se,"Vilhelmsson, Anders/H-8047-2019","Nyberg, Peter/0000-0002-3688-9740",,,,,33,5,5,1,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

The initial step was made considering the processes administration approach, because an efficient administration leads to an increased efficiency, efficacy and finally to a better quality. The basic assumption is that, within the assessment process, assessing the quality for the supplier is essential. Moreover, quality should be related to process and to organizational structure from which it derives.

Although many influent scholars highlight the necessity of a new economic model - based on the recognition of the superior quality of human activities that preserves the environment, including resources considered to be abundant - there are still a lot of problems related to the correct interpretation and valuation of the services in this new approach. The article discuses the experience of a big international corporation involved in environment related services in including sustainable development considerations in its quality management system. At Veolia Environnement the quality management of its service activities is based, besides the classic economic and financial indicators, on a series of sustainable development indicators, chosen by the company, pending on the respective service activity. The critical analysis of these indicators shows interesting results, from the point of view of the long term efficiency of the activity. It is a possible model for other companies, independently of size or specialization.","FORADEX SA Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",,"Seichea, CF (通讯作者)，FORADEX SA Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania.",catalin.seichea@gmail.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,12,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2009,11.0,26,,,,,503,510,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,462KQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267351800029,0

However, profitability and sustainability in the sector are constrained by low returns to investment due to a number of factors. The study investigates the factors influencing mainstream market participation among small-scale farmers in the five districts of the province. The main aim is to calculate the probability of small-scale farmers selling their livestock to more profitable mainstream markets, for example auction pens, against the odds of selling to informal speculators. A binary logistic regression model is applied to primary data collected from 60 sampled households in the districts of Kgalagadi, Pixley ka Seme, Frances Baard, Siyanda and Namakua. The partial effects of the conditional probability of selling livestock to mainstream markets and the impact of changes to the variables on the probability of selling to formal markets are estimated. The results show that farming experience, extension visits and infrastructure have a profoundly positive effect on the probability of small-scale farmers marketing their animals to the mainstream markets. On the other hand, household size, distance to the nearest market, and whether or not farmers have outstanding debts have a negative impact on the probability of them selling their animals to the formal markets. A unit increase in the farmer's debts, household size and distance to nearest market decreases the probability of profitable operation by 69.84%, 9.04% and 2.79% respectively. This result implies that an intervention policy is needed to alleviate these constraints that are impeding participation in the mainstream markets.","[Uchezuba, I.

Consistent with financial constraints based theories, the largest and least financially constrained firms are the most likely to hedge with insurance strategies (Put options), while more constrained firms finance the purchase of puts by selling calls (collars). The most financially constrained firms use strategies that involve selling calls. Firms with large investment programs are also more likely to use insurance rather than linear strategies. Firms' hedging instrument choices are also correlated with current market conditions, suggesting that managers' market views partially drive hedging instrument choices. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Valuation in these circumstances can best be described as fuzzy in terms of the amenity being valued, perceptions of property rights, and the numbers chosen to reflect values. In this paper, we apply fuzzy logic to contingent valuation, employing a fuzzy clustering approach for incorporating preference uncertainty obtained from a follow-up certainty confidence question. We develop a fuzzy random utility maximization (FRUM) framework where the perceived utility of each individual is fuzzy in the sense that an individual's utility belongs to each cluster to some degree. The model is then applied to a Swedish survey that elicited residents' willingness to pay for enhanced forest conservation and to a Canadian survey of agricultural landowners that elicited their willingness to accept compensation for a tree planting program. Both the WTP and WTA measures we obtain using the fuzzy approach are well below those obtained using standard probability methods. Based on goodness of fit measures and Monte Carlo experimentation, a case can be made for using a fuzzy preference approach for modeling preference uncertainty as opposed to incorporating respondent uncertainty within the random utility maximization framework.","[Sun, Lili; van Kooten, G.

To resolve this paradox, one has to recognize that many economists accept the criticism of the GDP indicator but deny its relevance. This paper evaluates the reasons for denial. This entails five steps: (1) a brief review is offered of the extensive literature showing that GDP per capita (growth) is far from a robust indicator of social welfare (progress); (2) the influence of GDP information on economic decisions by firms, consumers, investors and governments is examined; (3) behavioural explanations for a widespread belief in the relevance of GDP are discussed; (4) the customary arguments in favour of the GDP indicator are analysed; and (5) proposed alternatives to GDP are evaluated. The paper ends with outlining the implications of giving less attention to GDP information in policy and politics. It is argued that removal of the information failure which GDP represents, in monitoring economic progress and guiding public policy, will lead to decisions and developments being more in line with improving human well-being. Moreover, ignoring GDP information is consistent with a perfectly neutral stance regarding economic (GDP) growth. Indeed, an unconditional anti- or pro-growth imperative acts as an unnecessary constraint on our search for human progress. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[van den Bergh, Jeroen C. J.

The measure derives from established theoretical concepts of power and pivoting first introduced by Shapley and Shubik (Am. Political Sci. Rev. 84:787-792, 1954). Pivotal states identified by this approach generally conform to popular interpretations-Ohio in 2004, Florida in 2000, and so forth-but, historically, pivotal states are also frequently small or medium-sized states. Also, pivotal states by this approach are not necessarily competitive states. In general, whether or not a state is pivotal is mainly a function of its size and bellwether tendency-i.e., its tendency to mirror the national voting trend. A state's pivot position is also an excellent predictor of how presidential candidates allocated time and money across states in the general elections of 2000 and 2004. Controlling for a state's pivot position, size and electoral competitiveness have little effect on the allocation of campaign resources.","Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Wright, JR (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",wright.569@osu.edu,,,,,,,36,3,6,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,APR,2009,139.0,1-2,,,,,21,37,,10.1007/s11127-008-9374-y,0.0,,,17,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,421AB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000264329200003,0

As the investment horizon increases, transitory risks disappear, and the asset's beta is dominated by long-run consumption risks. We show that the return betas, derived from the cointegration-based VAR (EC-VAR) model, successfully account for the cross-sectional variation in equity returns at both short and long horizons; however, this is not the case when the cointegrating restriction is ignored.

The idea is that effective exchange of information is impeded if the number of lenders is too large, as is the case if households lend directly. Financial intermediation gets around this difficulty by separating the identity of capital ownership from the identity of lenders. Since each intermediary represents many capital owners, the number of direct lenders (the intermediaries) can be kept small enough for them to share information effectively even when the number of indirect lenders (depositors) is very large.

We empirically investigate this trade-off by estimating a weighted conditional logit model of airport-airline choice, using survey data on travels departing from one of three San Francisco Bay Area airports and arriving at one of four airports in greater Los Angeles in October 1995. Non-price characteristics like airport access time, airport delay, flight frequency, the availability of particular airport-airline combinations, and early arrival times are found to strongly affect choice probabilities. We calculate marginal effects and counterfactual scenarios to compare the values of these characteristics among each other and across traveler type. In order to examine the robustness of the conditional logit model, we estimate a mixed logit model, and find that the results are similar. We attribute the similarity to our strictly defined travel market and to our distinction between leisure and business travelers, thus controlling for two important sources of consumer heterogeneity. We consider the implications of our empirical findings on vertical integration between airlines and airports, on the effectiveness of airport dominance, and on the competitive effect of entry by low cost carriers.

First, we provide several generic meta-analysis models as reference points and discuss major estimation issues. Five econometric issues are identified as part of a complete analysis: (1) sample selection criteria; (2) basic data summary; (3) primary data heterogeneity; (4) heteroskedasticity; and (5) non-independence of multiple observations from primary studies. Second, a tabular summary is presented for the 140 meta-analyses with respect to estimation methods. Third, a narrative summary is presented for 19 meta-analyses, including the three value-of-statistical-life studies examined by the EPA Work Group and one analysis from each of 16 other categories. Fourth, we offer a set of best practice guidelines for future meta-analyses in this and other areas of economics.

The asymptotic as well as the exact finite-sample distribution of the test statistic, dealing with the possibility of parameter uncertainty, are established. The model averaging idea and the VaR diagnostic tests are illustrated by an application to portfolios of daily returns on six currencies, four equity indices, four ten year government bonds and four commodities over the period 1991-2007.

Time geography, which examines human activities under various constraints in a space-time context, provides a useful framework to analyze the complex spatio-temporal relationships among activities and interactions taking place in both physical and virtual spaces. However, virtual activities and interactions conducted via ICT have characteristics that cannot be properly represented and analyzed under the classical time-geographic framework. This paper extends classical time-geographic concepts to accommodate the needs of representing and analyzing all activities and interactions in a hybrid physical-virtual space. In addition, this paper presents a space-time geographic information system (GIS) design that is capable of organizing complex activity and interaction data as spatio-temporal processes in an integrated space-time environment. This space-time GIS design offers a useful analytical environment for researchers to study increasingly dynamic human activity and travel patterns in today's society and their implications toward changing travel demand patterns from both spatial and temporal perspectives.

We consider not only traditional performance measures, but also some recently developed measures that capture the non-normality of the return distribution (value-at-risk, expected shortfall, and the Omega measure). We compare them to the more comprehensive stochastic dominance criteria. The impact of changing the rebalancing frequency and level of capital protection is examined. We find that, even though a buy-and-hold strategy generates higher average excess returns, it does not stochastically dominate the portfolio insurance strategies, nor vice versa.

We find that on these dates the clients of AA and other Big Five auditors that are characterized by higher information uncertainty experience relatively larger share price declines compared to clients with lower information uncertainty. The findings suggest that the market relies more heavily on auditor reputation for higher information uncertainty firms, which implies that the value of an audit is greater when a firm is harder to value. Our results highlight the importance of information uncertainty in financial markets: where there is a shock to auditor reputation, firms with greater information uncertainty stiffer the largest losses.

Using a repeated leave-one-out convergent validity framework, the analysis contrasts errors for a hypothetical ideal case in which correct methodological covariate treatments are known to the realistic case in which the correct treatment is unknown.

A critical margin is the price of a credit card charge. A revolver who did not pay her most recent balance in full pays interest; other credit card users do not. I find that revolvers are substantially less likely to incur credit card charges and substantially more likely to use a debit card, conditional on several proxies for transaction demand and tastes.

Does the exit probability of multinationals depend on its export orientation?, and Does the presence of multinationals affect the survival of other firms in the economy? Our results show that foreign plants are more likely to exit the economy, controlling for other firm and industry characteristics, only during the late 1990s, a period when the Chilean economy experience a massive slowdown. Our data also suggest that only domestic market oriented multinationals responded to this negative shock by being more footloose. We also find that the presence of multinationals has a positive effect on plant survival in the early 1990s. This positive effect, however, is fully captured by productivity, once controlling for TFP in our exit regressions we do not find any further impact of multinational presence on a plant's probability of exit.

The purpose of this paper is to discuss the extra cost incurred due to the implementation of the traceability system and analyze whether the traced product equals to the product at high price. So that we can give some useful suggestions to the enterprise implementing traceability system how to set price reasonably in china. Design/methodology/approach- We conduct the market research to collect all the data used in the paper, using the break-even analysis to calculate the price of the product implemented traceability system. Findings- The results show that implementing traceability system will add the cost but it doesn't directly lead to the high price. The price of the traceability product (cucumber) is only 7 cents higher than the ordinary product in our calculation. The research result of the consumers' willingness to pay also suggests that the price of the traceability product should not be too high. When setting the price, income level and education are some important considerations. The risk awareness is also a significant factor. Enhancing the education of the risk awareness and the popularity of traceability system knowledge will help the acceptance of the traceability product. Originality/value- The implementation of traceability system is at the initial stage in china. It is the first time to study the cost of the company implementing the traceability system in china. The findings clarify some misunderstandings for the traceability system in china, and have important implications for enterprises implementing traceability system when setting the price.","[Chen, Honghua; Tian, Zhihong] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University,"Chen, HH (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.",honghuachen@sohu.com; tianzh@cau.edu.cn,,,,,,,6,1,1,0,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,,,,,2009,,,,,,,94,101,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BME64,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272028800007,0

This paper explores the importance of fragmented versus unified communication networks for socio-economic development, using data from Cape Town, South Africa. Like other cities in low- and middle-income countries, Cape Town shows growing linguistic diversity due to high levels of rural-urban migration. Two aspects of the city's economy will be discussed on the basis of specialised survey data and anthropological fieldwork: (a) the labour market, and (b) informal entrepreneurial activities. The analysis shows the importance of language as an explanatory variable in the study of economic life, and allows us to advance our understanding of human and social capital formation in ethnolinguistically fragmented societies.

The results suggest that the patterns of bank regulations imply important differences between developed and developing countries. While developing countries have stricter banking regulations, they are more likely to reduce competition among banks and provide greater safety nets to existing banks. The choice of banking regulations is affected by countries' political characteristics, which are in turn endogenous to countries' historical experiences and cultural characteristics. When political characteristics are replaced by corruption control, less corruption leads to less denied entries and banking restrictions as well as more constrained deposit insurance schemes. This implies that bank regulations may not be easy to change.","So Illinois Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University Edwardsville,"Evrensel, AY (通讯作者)，So Illinois Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA.",aevrens@siue.edu,,,,,,,19,3,4,2,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

Willingness-to-pay the premium was modeled as a function of a series of demographic, socioeconomic and knowledge variables, plus degrees of awareness concerning the environment, and risk attitudes. Results suggest that when making food choices, although the environment may be regarded as important, ultimately consumers in eastern New Brunswick prioritize their health over the environment. Moreover, the more income households earn, and the more consumers perceive a potential negative impact on health from pesticides usage, the more likely they would be willing to pay a premium for fresh organic produce.","[Haghiri, Morteza] Mem Univ Corner Brook, Corner Brook, NF A2H 6P9, Canada; [Hobbs, Jill E.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Bioresource Policy Business & Econ, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada; [McNamara, Meaghan L.] Mt Allison Univ, Dept Econ, Sackville, NB E4L 1A7, Canada",University of Saskatchewan; Mount Allison University,"Haghiri, M (通讯作者)，Mem Univ Corner Brook, Univ Dr, Corner Brook, NF A2H 6P9, Canada.",mhaghiri@mun.ca; jill.hobbs@usask.ca; mlmcnmr@mta.ca,,,,,,,25,39,39,0,12,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

In contrast, the growth theoretic literature on saving, social welfare and sustainable development is built upon a central finding, that the change in real wealth (as measured by net or 'genuine' saving) is proportional to the change in social welfare. We show that the change in total wealth exceeds the change in real wealth in optimal and non-optimal models of resource-extracting economies. This suggests that the change in social welfare is over-estimated when the change in total resource asset value is used as the measure of depletion.

The banking companies must define their policies concerning the market risk's management regarding at least the risks they intent to take, as well as the way those risks are controlled.","[Iuga, Iulia; Socol, Adela; Briciu, Sorin] 1Decembrie 1918 Univ Alba Iulia, Alba, Italy",,,Iuga_Iulia@yahoo.com,"SOCOL, ADELA/AFV-9062-2022","SOCOL, ADELA/0000-0002-9774-2494",,,,,11,0,0,0,2,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,362,371,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS73,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287985000055,0

According to analysis, several measurable benefits of clustering in rural areas may be identified. Results of several studies demonstrate positive impact on wages within cluster in comparison to those outside. Not only have been wages higher for sophisticated professions, but also younger and semi-qualified workers have benefited from being employed within rural cluster. On the other hand, positive correlation between production technology levels or average skills requirements and wage premium has not been confirmed. Location of industry within the cluster might also stimulate higher rate of return on investment and on equity. Moreover, clusters generate synergy effects in terms of higher productivity due to a larger market for workers with specialised skills, more rapid information flows and knowledge diffusion and specialisation as a result of relations between contracting agencies. Some benefits may be attributed only to several types of industries as e. g. food and wood products as well as tourism. This may be well applied to the Czech conditions as the examples of forest and wood processing cluster in Moravian-Silesian region and Cluster of tourism America suggest. A great potential particularly for rural areas may consists in knowledge clusters as the case of Cluster of Saint Zdislava imply. Indubitably, clustering as a potential strategy for promoting economic performance of rural areas is yet to be discussed in the future.","[Lungova, Miroslava] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,,miroslava.lungova@tul.cz,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-523-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,210,218,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BMK17,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272657000024,0

However, it is often unclear what policy could do to change the distribution of income as to date there is little quantitative evidence about the household characteristics that determine the level of income inequality and its changes over time. This paper sets out to identify these determinants by adapting a regression-based inequality decomposition technique and applying it to panel data from rural Pakistan. Land ownership is key to explaining the level of inequality, but not its changes. In contrast, higher education drives changes, but not the level of inequality. Household location affects both, reflecting growing differences in market access across regions.","Cornell Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",Cornell University,"Naschold, F (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, 313A Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",fn23@cornell.edu,,,,,,,33,15,17,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Interestingly, we find strong evidence of crowding out between bilateral donors in the sense that bilateral aid from other EU members significantly reduces exports from Germany to the recipients.

In contrast, economic historians have broadened the measure of well-being with particular interest in mortality, morbidity, nutrition, education and leisure. When one takes this broader view of the standard of living, there appears to be a strong trend toward more equality in the distribution of well-being since the industrial revolution. Gini coefficients calculated for the distributions of lifespan and educational attainment have declined dramatically since the mid-nineteenth century for the United States. Mortality and educational differentials have also declined. Inequality of leisure time and consumption, though not as consistently measured, also show trends toward equality over the twentieth century. These trends toward equality in well-being as measured by indicators other than income and wealth seem to be generated by provision of public goods, natural boundaries to lifespan, educational attainment and leisure, and by the growth in mean per capita income. The divergent trends in the distributions of income and the other measures of well-being caution against reliance on the distribution of income to interpret trends in inequality.

Our model shows that financially distressed firms are acquired by liquid firms in their industries even in the absence of operational synergies. We call these transactions liquidity mergers, since their purpose is to reallocate liquidity to firms that are otherwise inefficiently terminated. We show that liquidity mergers are more likely to occur when industry-level asset-specificity is high and firm-level asset-specificity is low. We analyze firms' liquidity policies as a function of real asset reallocation, examining the trade-offs between cash and credit lines. We verify the model's prediction that liquidity mergers are more likely to occur in industries in which assets are industry-specific, but transferable across firms. We also show that firms are more likely to use credit lines (relative to cash) in industries in which liquidity mergers are more frequent. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In a contest model, agents fight over a contested resource and their investment in 'guns' determines how much of the resource is secured by each agent. In a bankruptcy problem, agents claim a share of a contested resource, and their claims determine the allocation to each agent. The integrated model of this paper allows the combination of guns and claims to jointly determine the distribution of a contested resource. The relevance of such a model is motivated using the Arctic scramble as a leading example. This contest over the Arctic's oil and gas reserves involves the five coastal Arctic countries, each with its own distinct territorial claim. I propose four contest-bankruptcy rules that integrate the most common contest success function with four classical bankruptcy rules. These four rules are assessed and effects of integrating claims and guns in one rule are analysed for a resource contest model. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We show that PPINs have explanatory power for the cross-section of asset returns in long sample tests. We also investigate whether information risk vitiates the influence of other variables on asset returns. We develop a PPIN factor and show that it dominates the Amihud factor in asset returns.

The study further evaluates the impact of technological innovations and other policy variables on technical, allocative and cost efficiency from both approaches in a second-stage endogeneity-corrected Tobit regression model. Mean technical, allocative and cost efficiency ranges from 80.1 per cent to 86.7 per cent, from 57.8 per cent to 73.8 per cent, and from 50.3 per cent to 62.3 per cent respectively. The analysis of technical, allocative and cost efficiency with respect to technological innovation and other policy factors is robust. Results show that policies aimed at maize technology development and its timely dissemination, as well as improvements in education and access to credit and extension, could promote technical, allocative and cost efficiency, reduce yield variability, enhance farm income and food security and reduce poverty in Nigeria.","[Aye, G.

The value of housing services is determined by neighborhood effects as well as the physical attributes of the property itself. In the existing hedonic literature, future transactions have not been utilized to describe neighborhood effects. The rational expectations asset pricing model in this study accounts for expected future neighborhood effects as well as observed current neighborhood effects. The reduced form of the rational expectations model is a spatial autoregressive (SAR) model with two spatial lags. After employing the generalized method of moments (GMM) in estimating the spatial asset pricing model, I find that both expected future transactions and prior transactions in the neighborhood are significant. The inclusion of expected future transaction prices in the neighborhood takes into account the influence of expected changes in the community and factors these potential changes into the current house price. This is consistent with forward-looking households. The forward-looking model generates superior out-of-sample prediction performance relative to both the conventional hedonic model without considering neighborhood effects or the standard spatial hedonic model including only past transactions.

We show that the efficacy of adaptation determines the level of both countries' mitigation, and thereby causes them to be better or worse off. For both countries to be better off, it is required that the innovation be neither very effective nor very ineffective.

The purpose of this paper is to elevate our understanding of air freight by determining which specific variables most influence and shape the geographic distribution of air freight by metropolitan area using stepwise regression analysis. The empirical results suggest a regression model of five independent variables was the most parsimonious solution where the final model accounted for 71.1% of the variation in air freight shipments by metropolitan area (MA). The most important predictor was the traffic shadow effect, where less populated MAs under the traffic shadow of larger MAs tended to generate lower levels of freight. The model also suggested that other key predictors included the employment market share in transportation-shipping-logistics industries, per capita personal income, the number of medical diagnostic and supplier establishments, and above average wages in high technology. Overall, metropolitan markets with diverse and efficient ground support systems, freight forwarders and other transportation services, a more affluent population, an intense agglomeration of medical laboratories and related suppliers, and a well paid skilled workforce engaged in computer systems design and electronic product manufacturing are more likely to ship freight by air.

Next we explore a number of possible explanations of the observed gender differences by controlling for background factors that capture the evolution of family and society.

J,"Lucas, K",,,,"Lucas, Karen",,,Making the connections between transport disadvantage and the social exclusion of low income populations in the Tshwane Region of South Africa,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Transportation policy; Poverty; Disadvantage; Social exclusion; South Africa,MOBILITY; TRAVEL; POVERTY; GENDER,"To date, the majority of studies which consider transport from a social exclusion perspective have been conducted in the context of the developed world where both income poverty and lack of transport are relative rather absolute states. In a unique departure from these previous studies, this paper explores the relationship between transport and social disadvantage in the development context, the key difference being that income poverty is absolute and where there is much lower access to both private and public transportation generally. Thus, it seeks to explore whether the concept of social exclusion remains valid, when it is the majority of the population that is experiencing transport and income poverty compared with the minority who do so in advanced economies. The paper is based on a scoping study for the Republic of South Africa Department of Transport (RSA DOT), which primarily involved focus group discussions with a range of socially deprived urban and pen-urban population groups living in the Tshwane region of South Africa. In a second departure from previous studies which consider transport and social disadvantage in the development context, the study takes a primarily urban focus. The rationale for this is that theoretically low income urban settlements do not suffer from the lack of transport infrastructure and motorised transport services in the way that more remote rural areas do. The policy issue is therefore less a question of addressing a deficit in supply and more one of addressing particular aspects of public transit service failure, which are more readily amenable to relatively low cost, manageable, small-scale national and local policy interventions. A primary aim for the study was to reinvigorate cross-government debate of these issues in the hope of breaking South African government's long-standing and persistent policy inertia in the delivery of equitable and socially sustainable urban transport systems.

This research develops a model to analyze the economic consequences of an attack on a major element of the highway network. We add a freight network to a national multiregional economic impact model and make freight traffic flows endogenous. The use of a sub-national interstate model recognizes that most infrastructure planning is at the state level and most political leaders' interest is local. We base our approach on the National Interstate Economic Model (NIEMO) and refer to an elaboration that we name Transportation network and the National Interstate Economic Model (TransNIEMO). The new model enables us to study the state-specific and industry-specific economic impacts of some significant changes in the nature of highway freight movements.

Expectations for the 21st century are less certain due to changes in climate and energy policy, increasing congestion and increased mobility of production factors. This paper presents a strategic model for the movement of containers on a global scale in order to analyse possible shifts in future container transport demand and the impacts of transport policies thereon. The model predicts yearly container flows over the world's shipping routes and passing through 437 container ports around the world, based on trade information to and from all countries, taking into account more than 800 maritime container liner services. The model includes import, export and transhipment flows of containers at ports, as well as hinterland flows. The model was calibrated against observed data and is able to reproduce port throughput statistics rather accurately. The paper also introduces a scenario analysis to understand the impact of future, uncertain developments in container flows on port throughput. The scenarios include the effects of slow steaming, an increase in land based shipping costs and an increased use of large scale infrastructures such as the Trans-Siberian rail line and the opening of Arctic shipping routes. These scenarios provide an indication of the uncertainty on the expected port throughputs, with a particular focus on the port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

First, companies voluntarily invest to reduce the environmental burden that they cause under threat of regulation. Second, ex ante estimates of the compliance cost tend to be systematically higher than ex post estimates. Finally, regulators use limited information provided by the industry. I construct a game-theoretic model of environmental regulation under uncertainty with a benevolent regulator. In equilibrium, companies undertake voluntary action to induce regulation that raises barriers to entry. This profit-driven behavior is not always socially detrimental, however, as the regulator obtains a credible commitment to production and a more accurate estimate of the compliance cost. Additionally, the results provide a selection explanation for the mismatch between ex ante and ex post cost estimates: if companies condition compliance on the installation cost, only low-cost companies install in equilibrium. The analysis combines regulatory capture with social welfare maximization to explain the curious combination of voluntary action and low ex post compliance cost without serious information collection by the regulator.","Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Urpelainen, J (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ju2178@columbia.edu,,,,,,,38,9,10,2,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This paper establishes the asymptotic distribution of the estimators obtained by this method in univariate GARCH models. Comparisons with the standard QML are provided and the merits of the variance targeting method are discussed. In particular, it is shown that when the model is misspecified, the VTE can be superior to the QMLE for long-term prediction or value-at-risk calculation.

This paper presents findings from an evaluation of a demonstration program developed to help noncustodial parents with large child support debts reduce their debt while simultaneously increasing child support paid to families, through gradual forgiveness of arrears conditional on payment of current child support obligations. The evaluation employs a randomized experimental design, nonexperimental analyses using propensity score matching and multilevel modeling techniques, and focus groups and follow-up interviews. Results show a pattern of effects that suggests individuals responded to the program as intended. State- and family-owed child support debt balances decreased for program participants, and participants paid more toward their child support obligations and arrears and made more frequent child support payments. The study findings suggest promise for the effectiveness of this program model in reducing child support debt burdens and in increasing families' receipt of child support, and they also point to ways in which the implementation of the program might be improved.

In particular it investigates the turbulent mobilities of the 'desperate passenger' as a means to position the role of corporeal passage within this debate. It argues that forms of desperate passage differ markedly from other forms of corporeal mobility due to the limitations of choice. Given that undocumented migrants are 'locked out' of legitimated mobility networks, alternative forms of movement are often necessitated, in this case the infiltration of non-corporeal networks such as the underside of lorries. These acts of desperate mobility are used to discuss the inherent 'violence of speed' as outlined by Paul Virilio (2006a,b). In contrast to the protective, capsularised mobilities of legitimated passengers, it is suggested that the desperate passenger has to enact such violent mobilities in order to reach their destination.

In this context, the influence of experimental economics on the use of scientific methods in economic methodology and the dynamics of the trade-off between internal validity-external validity are discussed.

We define context broadly to include (1) the cause of death (respiratory illness, cancer, road traffic accident), (2) the beneficiary of the risk reduction (adult v. child), and (3) the mode of provision of the risk reduction (public program v. private good). The survey was conducted following similar protocols in Italy and the Czech Republic. When do not distinguish for the cause of death, child and adult VSL are not significantly different from one another in Italy, and the difference is weak in the Czech sample. When we distinguish for the cause of death, we find that child and adult VSLs are different at the 1% level for respiratory illnesses and road-traffic accidents, but do not differ for cancer risks. We find evidence of a cancer premium and a public program premium. In both countries, the marginal utility of income is about 20% lower among wealthier people, which makes the VSL about 20% higher among respondents with incomes above the sample average. The discount rate implicit in people's choices is effectively zero. We conclude that there is heterogeneity in the VSL, and that such heterogeneity is primarily driven by risk characteristics mode of delivery of the risk reduction, and income, while other individual characteristics of the respondent (e.g., age and education) are less important.

Results suggest that corruption hinders growth through its adverse effects on investment, human capital, and political instability, while fostering growth by reducing government consumption and, less robustly, increasing trade openness. Overall, a total negative effect of corruption on growth is estimated from these channels. These effects are found to be robust to modifications in model specification, sample coverage, and estimation techniques as well as tests for model exhaustiveness. The negative effect of corruption on growth is found to diminish in economies with low governance levels or a high degree of regulation.

No single religion stands out as more gender inequitable than others. The impact of religiosity is likely transmitted via stealth effects on everyday behavior in economic transactions in labor markets, household resource allocation, and government spending.

Conditional on the various states of the market, on market volatility, and on the risk level of the securities they trade, we find that both individual and institutional investors trade more aggressively following market gains in bull markets, in up-market states, in up-momentum market states, and in low-volatility market states and that only individual investors trade more in riskier securities following market gains. More importantly, we find that individual investors trade more aggressively following market gains in the three conditional states of the market and in high-volatility market states than institutional investors. Also, individual investors trade more in relatively riskier securities following gains than institutional investors.

As a result, the provision of transport infrastructure services in China has been steadily moving from the realm of government to that of private sector. In the same period, governments at the central and regional levels were actively engaged in this institutional transition by devising corresponding policies and enacting new laws and regulations. However, in late 2009 it became clear to the authors of this article that there has been a tendency of rolling back private participation in transport infrastructure and service because of various forms of opportunistic behavior on the part of some private players and malpractices among some governmental officials in their interaction with private players, and in relatively recent a number of large transport projects have been granted to state-owned enterprises. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to analyze and explain the processes of rise and fall of Public-Private Partnership in China. We argue that the adoption of Public-Private Partnership in China is a path-dependent process rather than some economic optimum advocated by a variety of international organizations. Specifics of wider Chinese political, cultural and institutional context are recognized as important factors that influence the performance of Public-Private Partnership. Effects of decisions made under transitory conditions can persist long after those conditions have vanished. In addition, these historical legacies are important in understanding contemporary use of Public-Private Partnership in China, and they are also the origins from which the sub-optimal statuses are often led.

The shorter distance may facilitate more than a doubling of vessels' operational energy efficiency performance. There is at present substantial uncertainty in schedule reliability via the NSR. Unless the schedule reliability is improved, the NSR should primarily be explored for bulk rather than for liner shipping. A major disadvantage with the NSR is its seasonality. Shipping operations in the summer time via the NSR may already today be profitable for minor bulk trades. Additional shipping routes may give more flexibility, and the NSR route choice option may facilitate supply chain agility and adaptability. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Using information about the physical location of an entrepreneurial firm and the geographic distance between the VC investor and the firm, I show that VC investors located farther away from an entrepreneurial firm tend to finance the firm using a larger number of financing rounds, shorter durations between successive rounds, and investing a smaller amount in each round. However, VC investors' propensity to stage is independent of whether the firm is located in a close-knit community. I also find that VC staging positively affects the entrepreneurial firm's propensity to go public, operating performance in the initial public offering (IPO) year, and post-IPO survival rate, but only if the firm is located far away from the VC investor. However, the effect of VC staging on entrepreneurial firm's performance is independent of whether it is located in a close-knit community. The findings are robust to a variety of alternative proximity measures, instrumental variables, and econometric approaches for dealing with endogeneity problems. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This literature focuses on attacking three problems. The first is the endogeneity of measures of investments. The second is the measurement error in skills and investments that are widely used in the literature. Endogeneity and measurement error produce, in general, inconsistent estimates. The third problem is the lack of a metric for tests designed to measure skills. The fact that scores have no cardinal meaning implies that the coefficients of the production function have no economic meaning. We show that anchoring test scores on outcomes that have a natural metric produces estimates that are economically interpretable.","Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Cunha, F (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",flaviocunha@gmail.com,,,,,,,12,1,3,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0143-5671,,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

We try to analyze the degree of opposition in adopting them, the limits and motivations, the preference for a certain type of teaching-learning (usual, e-learning, mixed), as well as at finding out the way in which students perceive the assessment of their knowledge by using the new information technologies. The research demonstrates that there are significant differences between what is required and what is expected on a theoretical level from the new educational systems as well as the way in which they are accepted and used by students in practice. The main identified barrier is the students' reluctance towards the new learning methods due, in our opinion, to the human opposition to change on the one hand and on the other hand to the lack of information about its advantages.

However, they did not take into account the price differences across states that arise because high cost areas pay less in real terms than low cost areas, since federal unit sales taxes on cigarettes and gasoline do not differ across states. Consequently, we propose that vertical tax competition can be estimated by using a federal tax variable that is expressed in real terms and thus shows cross-sectional variation across states. To estimate real prices we deflate all financial variables using the House Price Index (HPI), which is disaggregated by states. This empirical strategy enables us to disentangle the vertical interdependence between state and federal tax rates from aggregate shocks over time. We use U.S. data from 1975-2006 on gasoline and tobacco taxes, and find significant horizontal tax competition, but no vertical tax reactions. The results are robust to the period analyzed.","[Esteller-More, Alejandro] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ Polit & Hisenda Publ, Barcelona, Spain; [Esteller-More, Alejandro; Rizzo, Leonzio] Inst Econ Barcelona IEB, Barcelona, Spain; [Rizzo, Leonzio] Univ Ferrara, Dept Econ, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy",University of Barcelona; University of Ferrara,"Esteller-Moré, A (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ Polit & Hisenda Publ, Barcelona, Spain.",aesteller@ub.edu; leonzio.rizzo@unife.it,,"Rizzo, Leonzio/0000-0001-8099-8699",,,,,40,6,6,0,2,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

The empirical framework includes a set of econometric models that predict land conversion, crop choices, and crop rotations at the parcel level based on commodity prices, land quality, climate conditions, and other physical characteristics at the sites. The predictions are then combined with site-specific environmental production functions to determine the effect of rising commodity prices on nitrate runoff and leaching, soil water and wind erosion, and carbon sequestration. Results suggest that increasing commodity prices will result in widespread conversions of non-cropland to cropland. Fifty percent of the region's pasture and range land will be converted to cropland with $6 corn. Rising commodity prices will also result in dramatic changes in crop mix and rotation systems in the Midwest. With $6 corn, the total acreage of corn will increase by 23% and 40% in the Corn Belt and Lake States, respectively; the acreage of continuous corn will increase considerably in both regions as well. These changes in land use and crop mix will have a large impact on agricultural pollution.

We find that a significant portion of securities contains long periods of increasing or decreasing idiosyncratic risk. The series of idiosyncratic risk though are unlikely to have a life-long deterministic trend, and can be often characterized by a long memory process. Our evidence suggests that the proportions of securities with rising and declining risk continuously change, which in turn affects fluctuations of the market average. This evidence implies that an average idiosyncratic risk may not be a good representative of the dynamics in risk of a given security. We demonstrate that the companies with an increasing idiosyncratic risk tend to have deteriorating performance, and investigate factors behind these empirical observations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

To this end we express a present-value stock-price model in state-space form which we estimate using the Kalman filter. This procedure enables us to estimate a two-regime Markov-switching specification of the unobservable bubble process. The respective Markov-regimes represent two distinct phases in the bubble process, namely one in which the bubble survives and one in which it collapses. We ultimately identify bursting stock-price bubbles by statistically separating both Markov-regimes from each other. In an empirical analysis we apply our methodology to a plethora of artificial and real-world data sets. Our study has two major findings. First, we find significant Markov-switching structures in real-world stock-price bubbles. Second, in the stock markets considered our identification procedure correctly detects most speculative periods which have been classified as such by economic historians. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

First, we find that workers who solicit online largely represent growth in the overall prostitution market, as opposed to simple displacement of the off-line, street-focused market, although we find sizeable displacement effects among sex workers in their 30s and 40s. Using a newly-implemented survey, we also find that most sex workers who solicit online engage in lower-risk behaviors than traditional street-based workers: however, workers close to the margin for migration from outdoor work bring riskier business and sexual practices with them as they enter the off-street-sector.

At the aggregate market level, we find that prices and cost tend to equalize in the long run. Short-run adjustment appears to be sufficiently fast and properly anticipated to prevent systematic excess profit opportunities.

Second, we find evidence of a variety of types of support that producer firms transmit to their local suppliers. Importantly, FDI firms are significantly more supportive than Mexican firms. This applies in particular to types of support that are linked closely to improving the production processes of suppliers.

Competition has a positive impact on productivity for the old Indian private banks, and all the other banks are hurt by competition the worst hit being new Indian private banks. A similar picture emerges on the productivity growth side, with the new Indian private bank productivity growth being the worst affected as competition increases. An analysis of the pre- and post-1998 periods shows that the latter period displays a much higher productivity gap between the Indian private banks and the public and foreign banks.

This network pricing approach is applicable to all Levy processes for which the characteristic function is readily available. In other words, the log-value of the underlying asset can follow finite-activity or infinite-activity Levy processes. With the powerful computation of FFT, the proposed network has a negligible additional computational burden compared to the binomial tree approach. The early exercise policy and option values in the continuation region are determined in a way very similar to that of the lattice approach. Numerical examples using American-style barrier, lookback, and Asian options demonstrate that the FFT-network is accurate and efficient. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We propose an explanation that is based on a dynamic politico-economic model where the evolution of bequest taxation is determined by wealth inequality. Since economic development induces a growing role of labor income and thus a reduction of wealth inequality, bequest taxation is reduced over time. The model also embeds a process of structural reallocation from agriculture to manufacturing and a consequent shift of the tax base from easy-to-tax land to hard-to-tax capital. This process implies a lower tax level and slower equalization-induced tax reduction, the higher is the tax avoidance rate and the less developed is the economy. The introduction of franchise restrictions which are gradually lifted over time allows the hump-shaped long-term evolution of bequest taxation to be reproduced starting from the nineteenth century for those countries that are now modern industrial democracies. The evolution of political institutions also helps to explain the discrepancies currently observed between tax systems in developed and underdeveloped countries.","[Bertocchi, Graziella] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dipartimento Econ Polit, I-41100 Modena, Italy",Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia,"Bertocchi, G (通讯作者)，Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dipartimento Econ Polit, Viale Berengario 51, I-41100 Modena, Italy.",graziella.bertocchi@unimore.it,"Bertocchi, Graziella/O-6435-2019; Bertocchi, Graziella/C-3565-2016","Bertocchi, Graziella/0000-0003-1004-2362",,,,,66,10,10,0,12,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

The paper develops a simple dynamic model in which new suburban and older central-city properties compete for mobile residents. The level of housing services generated by older properties depends on current maintenance or reinvestment expenditures. In this setting, market failures that reduce the cost of occupying suburban locations, thus leading to excessive suburban development, also depress central-city housing prices and undermine maintenance incentives, leading to deficient levels of central-city reinvestment. Corrective policies that shift population from the suburbs to the center result in higher levels of reinvestment in central-city housing, therefore reducing blight. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The DD helps us analyze whether mergers that took place in the late 1990s and 2000s made the merged banks financially more robust, as intended. Our findings include: (1) A merged bank fundamentally inherits financial soundness of premerged banks, without incremental value from the merger; and (2) A negative DD was observed following the merger. The findings of this case study are consistent with the view that large Japanese banks' mergers either failed to implement intended scale economies or were motivated by a belief in the too-big-to-fail policy.

We illustrate, through case studies of decentralization in natural resource sectors in Botswana and Senegal, how repertoires of domination prevent local-level democratization. The concept of repertoire brings attention to the availability of multiple, substitutable acts of domination that draw upon varied sources of power.

Although various observed and unobserved aspects of firms have been suggested as potential drivers of firm heterogeneity, economists disagree sharply on the role of financial structure in influencing firm growth. In this paper. I use a sample of quoted and unquoted firms to show that the effect of financial structure on firm growth is statistically significant and quantitatively important. In the presence of external financing constraints, firms rely more on internal funds to finance growth, but the effect of internal financing on firm growth decreases with an increase in the firm's access to an external bank credit facility. As the external financing constraint is alleviated, the firm relies less on internal funds and switches to external financing as the primary source of financing for its growth. This pattern of transition between internal and external financing is particularly pronounced in small unquoted firms (conditional on their survival). These results suggest a real effect of financial structure on growth via the channel of an external financing constraint. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Beyond some threshold, some cities disappear from the space-economy.

Using a sample of 110 top US universities observed during the late 20th century we find that knowledge flows, both in total and in their major components, are a significant and positive determinant of research output. Outside knowledge-flows from other universities have increased at a faster rate than inside flows from the same university. Over time, the importance of outside flows for research output has risen, and it has done so at a faster rate than the importance of inside flows has decreased. Thus the overall contribution of knowledge-flows has increased and has shifted towards outside flows. Turning to knowledge-flows by field, we find that interdisciplinary knowledge-flows have increased only slightly relative to same field flows, despite policy initiatives that favor interdisciplinary research. Moreover, the importance of interdisciplinary flows for research output, while positive and statistically highly significant, has stayed about the same, even as same field flows have become more important, probably because of growth in cyber infrastructure. Although a final verdict is yet to be reached, one interpretation is that interdisciplinary research is still in its early stages. While interdisciplinary flows have begun to increase, the resulting discoveries, and their influence on subsequent research, may still lie in the future.","[Adams, James D.] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Econ, Russell Sage Lab 3504, Troy, NY 12180 USA; [Clemmons, J.

Via literature review and job-offer analysis, we investigate the existence of corporate social responsibility practices in Romania and its implications on the accounting profession. We find that such practices are developed to an incipient but increasing extent in Romania. Romanian accountants are increasingly called to transpose the general framework of CSR, which is legal compliance, communication with stakeholders and performance measurement, thus leading to an increase in the importance of the accounting function in an organization. The following step would be the accountants' involvement in specific actions regarding environmental and social implications, but this is very rare in Romania.

In order to do so, we estimate hazard rate models for match separations, as well as for worker flows from employment to another job, to unemployment, and to nonparticipation. Outsourcing has a positive but small impact on overall job stability in the manufacturing sector, and considerably increases job stability in the service sector. However, the effect of outsourcing varies strongly across skill levels and age groups, with negative effects for some workers. This is especially the case in the manufacturing sector, where the hazard of transiting to nonemployment rises with international outsourcing for medium-skilled and older workers.","[Braun, Sebastian] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Braun, Sebastian] Humboldt Univ, D-1086 Berlin, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); Humboldt University of Berlin,,,,"Bachmann, Ronald/0000-0001-7675-5272; Braun, Sebastian Till/0000-0001-7714-2048",,,,,40,16,18,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

The method exploits the stickiness of consumption growth (sometimes interpreted as reflecting consumption habits) to distinguish between immediate and eventual wealth effects. In U.S. data, we estimate that the immediate (next quarter) marginal propensity to consume from a $1 change in housing wealth is about 2 cents, with a final eventual effect around 9 cents, substantially larger than the effect of shocks to financial wealth. We argue that our method is preferable to cointegration-based approaches, because neither theory nor evidence supports faith in the existence of a stable cointegrating vector.","[Carroll, Christopher D.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Econ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Johns Hopkins University,"Carroll, CD (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Econ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",ccarroll@jhu.edu; misuzu.otsuka@oecd.org; jiri.slacalek@ecb.europa.eu,"Carroll, Christopher D/A-5450-2010; Otsuka, Masaaki/AAP-4081-2021","Carroll, Christopher D/0000-0003-3732-9312;",,,,,50,173,196,2,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

This is because such authorities should be considered legitimate to communicate what is morally acceptable and unacceptable. This interactive effect of sanction size and procedural fairness on compliance should thus be mediated by moral evaluations of the authority. A field survey and an experiment revealed support for these predictions. These results thus support a non-instrumental perspective on the effectiveness of sanction severity in increasing compliance with authorities. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We interpret the observed difference in outcomes between childhood immigrants who arrive during the critical period and those who arrive later (adjusted for non-language-related age-at-arrival effects using childhood immigrants from English-speaking countries) as an effect of English-language skills and construct an instrumental variable for English-language skills. We find that both Hispanics and non-Hispanics exhibit lower English proficiency if they arrive after the critical period, but this drop in English proficiency is larger for Hispanics. The effect of English proficiency on earnings and education is nevertheless quite similar across groups, while some differences are seen for marriage, fertility, and location of residence outcomes.

Evidence from Tanzania,JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Sub-national governments usually depend on the central government for a large share of their revenues. Therefore, a fair allocation of intergovernmental grants is essential for financing vital local services like education and healthcare. In Tanzania, and many other countries, regions that are better represented in the national parliament receive significantly more funds than others. Recently, Tanzania replaced the previously existing discretionary method of grant allocation by allocation formulas. We study whether this has reduced the effect of malapportionment on grant allocation. Surprisingly, we find that formula allocation does not significantly change this effect. This has important policy implications.","[Allers, Maarten A.] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Ishemoi, Lewis J.] Inst Finance Management, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania",University of Groningen; Institute of Finance Management (IFM),"Allers, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",m.a.allers@rug.nl,"Allers, Maarten/A-8276-2010","Allers, Maarten/0000-0002-6838-9046",,,,,19,6,10,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,,,J DEV STUD,J.

The standards setters try to decrease the reporting burden for SMEs, keeping the relevant information for their reports users, while considering harmonization goals in the same time. In such an attempt, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued an International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) designed for use by small and medium-sized entities (SMEs) the 9th of July 2009, however some national European standard-setters seem not to be keen to introduce them.

It is within this context that questions related to understanding the concept of perceived service quality and its relations to customer satisfaction and behavioural intentions once again arise as an area in which important theoretical contributions and practical insights can be presented. The concept of perceived service quality as well as its linkage to concept of customer satisfaction and consumers' behavioural intentions has long been a source of vigorous debate in academic community. While collectively recognising the importance of research and understanding of this concept for successful management of service enterprise resources, authors have taken a wide variety of courses in their approaches toward conceptualising, operationalizing and measuring this concept. Seminal studies on establishing content and structure of service quality concept, and claims of its universal applicability were followed by re-examinations and extensions which resulted in findings indicating a need for adaption of the concept to differing service settings. More precisely the need for adaption of the most prevailing Servqual scale to particularities of various service industries was recognised. This resulted in further investigation of variations of service quality concept in a range of service industries, one of them being hospitality. Although studies employing Servqual and Servqual-based scales in hospitality industry have been relatively limited in number, their contribution was important as they provided insights which allowed for better understanding of dynamics of service quality construct across service industries. Additional important route of enquiry has been focused on linkage of perceived service quality to customer satisfaction and causal links to behavioural intentions. In an attempt to expand the body of knowledge on this subject, this paper provides an application of an adapted service quality measure in hotel setting in Croatia. Through application of PLS path modelling an analysis of empirical data and comparison of findings with the results of preceding studies, major areas of divergence from predominant conceptualisation of service quality satisfaction behavioural intentions chain are identified and implications of these findings for management of service operations in hospitality are discussed. Finally, limitations of this research coupled with potential areas of interest for future research are identified.","[Dedic, Goran; Pavlovic, Danijela Krizman; Miocevic, Dario] Univ Split, Fac Econ, Split, Croatia",University of Split,,goran@efst.hr; dkrizman@efpu.hr; dmiocevi@efst.hr,"Dedić, Goran/F-9523-2017; Miocevic, Dario/D-4726-2017","Dedić, Goran/0000-0001-9800-0313; Miocevic, Dario/0000-0003-4895-7090",,,,,37,0,0,0,6,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

Performance budgeting, accrual accounting and accountability for results require different type of audit and control than in the past. Internal audit and control in modern conditions demand more than reconciliation with the normative framework Therefore, it is necessary to move towars controlling and auditing for results. Thereby, improvement of internal audit and internal control systems is crucial to help public managers in achieving results and make government management more efficient and effective. In order to achieve noted goals, it is necessary to implement Public Internal Financial Control (PIFC) in government entities. PIFC is set of principles internal financial controls system established for the purpose of controlling, auditing, supervising of the use of national budget and European Union budget and funds, but the goals and purpose of PIFC can be set up broader. General goals include performing business activities in a correct, ethic, economic, efficient and effective way; conformity of business with legislative framework; protection of assets and other resources from losses caused by bad governance, unjustified using and discontinuity and fraud; strengthening accountability for the successful realization of the tasks; and timeliness financial reporting and monitoring operating results. PIFC must be understood as completed and consolidated system of internal supervision that includes both internal audit and internal control. This paper aims to examine current practice and trends in developing internal audit and control in the public sector of selected transition countries: Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Precisely, we will give comparison of main characteristics of internal audit and internal control in selected countries. The primary focus will be on the following parameters: types of internal audit and internal control, human resources, legislative framework and systems of funding. The main result of this paper will be to highlight the current situation in developing internal audit and internal control in selected countries and distinguishing certain similarities and differences that are significant for further development of internal supervision in these countries.","[Dragija, Martina; Vasicek, Vesna; Hladika, Mirjana] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,,mdragija@efzg.hr; vvasicek@efzg.hr; mhladika@efzg.hr,"Hladika, Mirjana/I-1152-2018; Hladika, Mirjana/I-1145-2018; Dragija Kostic, Martina/H-9443-2018; VASICEK, VESNA/H-9685-2018","Hladika, Mirjana/0000-0003-3170-9138; Dragija Kostic, Martina/0000-0003-0131-0345; VASICEK, VESNA/0000-0002-5060-1678",,,,,12,0,0,1,21,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

A review of literature offers a number of studies using the ANN, however SVM is a late bloom. The study involves 35 privately commercial banks operated in Turkey between 1996 and 2000. A prediction of bank failure via the SVM was made and the results were compared using a Multi Layer Perceptron Model (MLP), one of the models use in ANN approach. The study consists of 3 different models. In the first model, a one-year data set was used while the second one uses a-two-year and the third uses a-three-year data set. A significant difference in favour of the SVM when compared with MLP was observed in the prediction of the total accuracy and non-failed banks. While Model 1 and Model 2 were equally accurate according to both the SVM and MLP in terms of the classification of failed banks, the MLP yields more accurate results in Model 3.","[Ekinci, Aykut] Turkiye Kalkinma Bankasi, Risk Izleme Mudurlugu, Ankara, Turkey; [Erdal, Halil Ibrahim] Turkiye Kalkinma Bankasi, Kredi Degerlendirme Mudurlugu, Ankara, Turkey",,"Ekinci, A (通讯作者)，Turkiye Kalkinma Bankasi, Risk Izleme Mudurlugu, Ankara, Turkey.",aykutekinci@gmail.com; halil.erdal@kalkinma.com.tr,"Ekinci, Aykut/AAY-8819-2021","Ekinci, Aykut/0000-0002-2111-706X",,,,,27,3,3,1,11,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

Thanks to their knowledge of local specificities and developmental potential, they are qualified to prepare quality strategies and propose necessary projects. Furthermore, they are able to use their already existing social ties, and contacts. These contacts can be on social as well as entrepreneurial or political level. How extended a network of such contacts is depends on the position of each local actor in each individual locality. Built on the principles of the LEADER program, Local Action Group (LAG) represents by its composition and character of its nature a complex element of development of rural area. It is a group combining various types of local stakeholders - representatives of communities, businesses, special interest societies and associations, NGOs and other actors. If the community finds a powerful leader, willing to engage for the development of the municipality, he or she may apply their influence, either officially in the municipal administration or in the form of voluntary cooperation of several participants, such as LAG. Given the above facts, the existence of an extensive network of social contacts and relationships and strong social capital can be assumed in LAGs. To obtain a sufficient volume of data and a coherent picture of the functioning of these networks and expressions of social capital in chosen rural locality in the Vysocina region, a field survey was carried out in the LAG Havlickuv region. The aim was to map the structure and extent of networks of social contacts and relationships. The carried out analysis showed that in the case of LAG Havlickuv region close cooperation between the public sector (local and municipal authorities) and the business sector particularly agriculture and forestry is crucial for the development of the locality.","[Marikova, Pavlina; Herova, Irena] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Humanities, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Maríková, P (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Humanities, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",marikova@pef.czu.cz; herova@pef.czu.cz,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-2196-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,359,365,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000338036100038,0

We interpret this decline as evidence that an increase in the relative demand for LEP Hispanics could have offset the increase in their relative labor supply, particularly during the 1980s. However, when comparing workers who completed high school with those who did not, this penalty increased among high school graduates during this time.

The objective of this paper is to understand better the approaches used by the food and agricultural sector to select product innovation projects, and to draw a picture of an innovation portfolio of a food and agribusiness company. This paper adds to the management literature by studying a different sector, the U.S. agricultural sector and focusing on the implementation of theoretical models. The survey of about 100 companies, indicate that the food and agribusiness sector tends to use cross-functional teams and several selection methods when they select product innovation projects. This selection process yields to a diversified portfolio in terms of potential for return, time to market, and costs already incurred. However, companies tend to be biased towards in-house and low risk projects. Company and industry characteristics' effects on the results are present but limited. It is important to note that this dissertation does not study the effect of these practices on performance, which is a necessary follow-up.","[Roucan-Kane, Maud] Sam Houston State Univ, Dept Agr & Ind Sci, Huntsville, TX 77340 USA; [Gray, Allan W.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Boehlje, Michael D.] Dept Agr & Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Texas State University System; Sam Houston State University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Roucan-Kane, M (通讯作者)，Sam Houston State Univ, Dept Agr & Ind Sci, 1831 Univ Ave, Huntsville, TX 77340 USA.",mrr017@shsu.edu; gray@purdue.edu; boehljem@purdue.edu,,,,,,,44,9,10,1,32,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

We find that companies with higher labour intensity tend to operate with higher EBITDA margins, potentially the effect of their larger flexibility to changes in demand and overall economic conditions. However, we find that companies with higher labour intensity have lost relatively more in their profitability during the 2008-2009 economic crisis. This may relate to potentially large redundancy costs of labour intensive companies under a need to decrease workforce as a result of lower activity levels. Another explanation might be that salaries as well as staff numbers did not react to the economic crisis as quickly as other costs and companies' profits did.","[Ruubel, Raul; Hazak, Aaro] Tallinn Univ Technol, Dept Econ, Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,,aaro.hazak@tseba.ttu.ee,"Ruubel, Raul/AAG-1421-2019","Ruubel, Raul/0000-0001-9661-5699",,,,,6,0,0,0,5,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-07-0625-8,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,22.0,,,,,,178,182,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEW99,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000318459600034,0

The first consists of identifying major constraints for value chain upgrading: market access restrictions, weak infrastructures, lacking resources and institutional voids. In the second component three elements of a value chain are defined: value addition, horizontal and vertical chain-network structure and value chain governance mechanisms. Finally, upgrading options are defined in the area of value addition, including the search for markets, the value chain-network structure and the governance form of the chain. Part of this component is the identification of the most suitable partnerships for upgrading the value chain. The three components of the framework are derived from major theoretical streams on inter-company relationships and from the literature on developing country value chains. The framework is applied in a case example of a developing country value chain.","[Trienekens, Jacques H.] Wageningen Univ Management Studies, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Trienekens, Jacques H.] Maastricht Sch Management, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Maastricht University,"Trienekens, JH (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ Management Studies, Hollandseweg 1, Wageningen, Netherlands.",Jacques.Trienekens@wur.nl,"trienekens, jacques/JFA-0126-2023",,,,,,78,197,223,11,84,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

To prove the hypothesis an equilibrium model of the stock prices movements and their respective fundamental value is created. Results show that the change in earnings and book value cannot explain the change in price. This short and medium term irrational behaviour could be explained by behavioural theories like price to price feedback theory, overconfidence, representativeness or herding behaviour. On the long term stock prices tend to circle round the fundamental equilibrium with larger deviations from it. The goal of this paper is to prevent future big losses like investors and pension fund holders had during the past years because fund managers and individual investors bought stocks at values that were too high.

This paper provides an operational version of this approach that incorporates realistic priors about consumption growth volatility, while guaranteeing finite asset pricing quantities. In contrast to the extant literature, the resulting asset pricing model with subjective expectations yields well-defined expected utility, finite moment generating function of the predictive distribution of consumption growth, and tractable expressions for equity premium and risk-free return. Our quantitative analysis reveals that explaining the historical equity premium and risk-free return, in the context of subjective expectations, requires implausible levels of structural uncertainty. Furthermore, these implausible prior beliefs result in consumption disaster probabilities that virtually coincide with those implied by more realistic priors. At the same time, the two sets of prior beliefs have diametrically opposite asset pricing implications. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Others argue that cross-country differences in terms of gross job flows are minor. However, these statements are usually based on the comparison of national estimates, typically collected on the basis of different definitions and collection protocols. In contrast, in this article, we use cross-country comparable data on both job and worker flows to examine key determinants of these flows and of their cross-country differences. We find that idiosyncratic firm characteristics (industry, age, and size) play an important role for both gross job and worker flows in all countries. Nevertheless, in contrast with part of the literature, we find that, even controlling for these idiosyncratic factors, cross-country differences concerning both gross job and worker flows appear large and of a similar magnitude. Both job and worker flows in countries such as the USA and the UK exceed those in certain continental European countries by a factor of two. Moreover, the variation of worker flows across different dimensions is well explained by the variation of job flows. Consistently, churning flows, that is flows originating by firms churning workers and employees quitting and being replaced, display much less variation across countries.","[Bassanini, Andrea] OECD, ERMES Paris 2, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Bassanini, Andrea] OECD, IZA, F-75775 Paris 16, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Bassanini, A (通讯作者)，OECD, ERMES Paris 2, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",andrea.bassanini@oecd.org,,,,,,,45,14,15,1,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Many researchers have argued that these characteristics are due to shifts in volatility that may be associated with significant economic events such as financial crises. Indeed, several authors have investigated the case of pure structural changes, in which all of the parameters in the GARCH model are assumed to change simultaneously. In this paper, we take an alternative approach by studying the case in which changes occur in individual parameters of a GARCH model. We investigate the impacts of such changes on the underlying return series and its volatility, and propose an iterative procedure to detect them. In all cases, the changes affect permanently the level of the volatility, but in some cases, the changes also alter the dynamic structure of the volatility series. Monte Carlo experiments are used to investigate the performance of the proposed procedure in finite samples, and real examples are used to demonstrate the impacts of detected volatility changes and the efficacy of the proposed procedure. Practical implications of the parameter changes in financial applications are also discussed.","[Galeano, Pedro] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Estadist, Madrid 28903, Spain; [Tsay, Ruey S.] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; University of Chicago,"Galeano, P (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Estadist, Madrid 28903, Spain.",pedro.galeano@uc3m.es,"Galeano, Pedro/H-2186-2015","Galeano, Pedro/0000-0003-2577-2747",,,,,39,18,22,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

It argues that the cost of governing knowledge processes depends as much on the cognitive background of the exchange partners as on the tacitness of their knowledge. The perspective supports and explicates previous arguments regarding the ability of firms to enable and support integration and combination of tacit knowledge across the epistemic boundaries of professional expertise, but suggests that knowledge transactions that take place within such epistemic communities-articulation and replication-can be accommodated equally well, and often better, in other institutional settings, such as those of markets, guilds, or universities. Firms often become epistemic communities in their own right, providing them with superior enabling and motivational conditions for the combination and integration of tacit functional or occupational expertise. The establishment of a firm as an epistemic community requires transaction-specific investments on part both of the owners, managers, and employees which is why these conditions are difficult to create under market and other non-firm modes of governance. In the case of codified knowledge, the problems associated with the crossing of epistemic boundaries can be overcome by the definition of clear interfaces between knowledge domains.","[Hakanson, Lars] Univ Queensland, Dept Int Econ & Management, Copenhagen Business Sch, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Hakanson, Lars] Univ Queensland, UQ Business Sch, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland; University of Queensland,"Håkanson, L (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Dept Int Econ & Management, Copenhagen Business Sch, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",lh.int@cbs.dk,,,,,,,133,64,78,2,62,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

We use a multinomial probit model to analyze participation in Oregon's two VCPs. In contrast to previous VCP research, we find that these programs attract sites with significant contamination, not just clean ones.

Henceforth, we follow the main technical advances of the theory, from the first impossibility theorem proved by List and Pettit to the completely general results of Dietrich and Mongin. We stress the collective achievement of the canonical theorem - by Dietrich and List, Dokow and Holzman, Nehring and Puppe - which provided the theory with a specific method of analysis: it consists in mathematically characterizing the impossibility agendas of a given aggregator - i.e., the sets of propositions such that no collective judgment function exists with a certain list of axiomatic properties.

Using a comprehensive sample of completed LBOs of U.S. publicly traded targets conducted by prominent private equity firms, we find that target shareholders receive approximately 10% less of pre-bid firm equity value, or roughly 40% lower premiums, in club deals compared to sole-sponsored LBOs. This result is concentrated before 2006 and in target firms with low institutional ownership. These results are robust to controls for target and deal characteristics, including size, Q measures of risk, and time and industry fixed effects. We find little support for benign motivations for club deals based on capital constraints, diversification motives, or the ability of clubs to obtain favorable debt amounts or prices, but it is possible that the lower pricing of club deals is an inadvertent byproduct of an unobserved benign motivation for club formation.

The project provides a strong test of the ability of poorer households to participate in a PES program as it required participants to make substantial and complex land use changes. The results show that poorer households are in fact able to participate at levels that are broadly similar to those of better-off households. Moreover, their participation was not limited to the simpler, least expensive options.

Using data for SMEs in Taiwan's IT industry, we find that (1) SMEs involved in R&D activities tend to have lower debt levels and (2) TMT characteristics exert considerable influence on the R&D investment-financial leverage relationship in SMEs. One important implication of the empirical evidence is that for SMEs trying to compete on the basis of innovation, the TMT characteristics significantly influence financing decisions.

We find that funds investing in markets with higher indirect investment barriers as measured by market turnover and country risk have higher premiums. We also document that the relation between the country risk and CECF premium is much stronger after the stock market liberalization. Since investors prefer to invest in emerging markets with high indirect barriers through country funds, they increase the premiums of the funds targeting those countries. In addition, we find that direct investment barriers as measured by the investable weight factor do not explain the large variation in the CECF premiums. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

J,"Tregenna, F",,,,"Tregenna, Fiona",,,How significant is intersectoral outsourcing of employment in South Africa?,INDUSTRIAL AND CORPORATE CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PRODUCER SERVICES; DEINDUSTRIALIZATION; EXTERNALIZATION,"South Africa, like many other middle-income countries as well as most upper-income countries, has seen an increase in services and fall in manufacturing as shares of total employment. There has been speculation about the extent to which these changes actually represent a genuine structural shift, as opposed to a statistical artifact deriving from the domestic outsourcing of activities from manufacturing to services. Very limited evidence is available as to how much of the apparent changes in the sectoral composition of employment are explained by intersectoral outsourcing. This article develops a methodology, using household and labor survey data, to analyze the extent of intersectoral outsourcing of specific labor-intensive activities in South Africa from 1997-2007. It is shown that the relatively high growth in services employment is driven by expansion of employment of cleaners and security guards, and in particular by outsourcing-type reallocation of these activities from manufacturing and the public sector toward private services. Once outsourcing is accounted for, employment seems to have grown at similar rates in manufacturing and in private services. The analysis has implications for understanding changes in the sectoral structure of middle-income economies, and whether services employment is as dynamic as it appears to be.","Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, ZA-2006 Auckland Pk, South Africa",University of Johannesburg,"Tregenna, F (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, POB 524, ZA-2006 Auckland Pk, South Africa.",ftregenna@uj.ac.za,,,,,,,30,11,11,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

We suggest the idea that firms who do not grow under all realizations of potentially profitable opportunities can be considered as zero-learning. In order to explain why some firms are zero-learning and how these are different from growing ones, we put forward and discuss the hypothesis that both start-up size and founders' pre-entry history affect the firm's ability to adjust to market. Using a sample of 3,905 Italian firms born in 1999 and 2000, we find that individual competencies influence start-up size, but not directly growth. We also find a significant nonlinear relationship between start-up size and growth, implying that firms which were born smaller than a given size grow significantly less. The results support the hypothesis that multiple and heterogeneous growth processes coexist and that the growth process of microfirms below a given organizational threshold may be structurally different, in the long run, from that of firms starting up above that threshold.","[Giannangeli, S.] St Anna Sch Adv Studies, Lab Econ & Management, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Bonaccorsi, A.] Univ Pisa, Sch Engn, I-56126 Pisa, Italy",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; University of Pisa,"Giannangeli, S (通讯作者)，St Anna Sch Adv Studies, Lab Econ & Management, Piazza Martiri Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.",s.giannangeli@sssup.it,,,,,,,62,15,15,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Moreover, our results show that consumption risk sharing and smoothing in China have deteriorated since the 1979 economic reform.

Ex ante moral hazard implies that the CEO must receive ex post quasi rents, which endogenously biases him toward continuation. Our model shows that to induce bad CEOs to quit, it may be best to make continuation costly (through steep incentive pay) rather than simply rewarding quitting (through severance pay). Incentive pay makes continuation attractive for good CEOs, who can expect high future on-the-job pay, but unattractive for bad CEOs, who may instead prefer to take their outside option payoff. Our model generates novel empirical implications that jointly relate CEO compensation and turnover to corporate governance, firm size, cash-flow risk, and the informativeness of performance measurement.

It usually considers situations in which individuals negotiate on a single issue. This paper explores a different environment and reports on an experiment based on a non-cooperative game in which the choice of the bargaining agenda is endogenous. We find that firms reveal a strong preference for single-issue bargaining although the subgame perfect equilibrium predicts the choice of the multi-issue bargaining. In multi-issue bargaining unions offer smaller relative payoff shares to firms than in single-issue bargaining and this leads to a higher conflict rate than in a single-issue bargaining. Social preferences and a concern for relative payoffs support this preference for a restricted bargaining agenda but they induce a loss of efficiency. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We test this win win claim by surveying households before and after rapid appreciation in argan prices. The argan boom has benefited some rural households. Those well positioned to benefit increased their goat herds more than other households, which bodes poorly for forest impacts, and were more likely to send their girls to secondary school. While locals are keeping their goats out of argan trees during the harvest, they may also be resorting to more aggressive harvesting techniques.

The shape of the no-trade region depends on the correlation between the two risky assets. With predictable returns, there is instead a no-trade region for each state.

We apply this framework to test the empirical admissibility of 3 and 4-moment versions of the CAPM. We find that, while coskewness and cokurtosis risk help price a number of stock strategies and portfolios, including static strategies based on a fine industry-level diversification, momentum strategies and portfolios managed on the basis of available information, the CAPM and its 3 and 4-moment versions cannot provide an exhaustive account of observed asset returns.

The best recent work in political ecology presents agrarian political economy with a challenge to address that intellectual deficit by interrogating and problematizing its inherited conceptions of the productive forces, both theoretically and historically.

Our theory builds on Holmstrom's (1982, 1999) hidden effort principal-agent model. The election pressures that politicians face, and the absence of such pressures for technocrats, give rise to a dynamic incentive structure that formalizes two rationales for delegation, one highlighted by Hamilton (1788) and the other by Blinder (1998). Delegation trades off the cost of having a possibly incompetent technocrat with a long-term job contract against the benefit of having a technocrat who (i) invests more effort into the specialized policy task and (ii) is better insulated from the whims of public opinion.

Macroeconomic risk affects deposits regardless of traditional bank-specific characteristics. Furthermore, bank exposure to macroeconomic factors can explain differences in deposit withdrawals. During crises, the evolution of bank-specific characteristics is mainly driven by macroeconomic factors, while the informational content of bank-specific variables declines.

The article presents several elements regarding consumer protection management and the manager's profession in the consumer protection field. In order to reflect the human factor's degree of involvement in the consumer protection management we carried out a survey at the level of National Authority for Consumer Protection (NACP). The findings of our study imply that consumer protection and its management represent a new step of human civilization, a better quality life style, implying the intensive use of information from various fields, involving the human factor not only as a producer, but also as a consumer, with a great economic and social impact. Under these circumstances, consumer protection management at the level of NACP and its local institutions is an important source of information and decision; this is not only as a way of data processing. Moreover, in order to be socially efficient visible it is necessary to imply operational and top management in fields of planning-decision, organization-coordination, training-leading and controlling-monitoring, all of them being in a special position of priority.

In this paper, a Saving Gateway account is embedded alongside an ordinary interest-bearing account in a simple life-cycle model of saving to assess the implications of the scheme for optimal saving. Among the findings are that, for agents with access to credit, the Saving Gateway is associated with a fall in saving during the life of the account and a rise in consumption. However, the scheme increases saving by the credit-constrained. On their own, empirically plausible levels of habit formation in consumption preferences have too small an effect on saving to justify the scheme.","Brunel Univ, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England",Brunel University,"Rablen, MD (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",matthew.rablen@brunel.ac.uk,"Rablen, Matthew/Z-4674-2019","Rablen, Matthew/0000-0002-3521-096X",,,,,36,1,1,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0143-5671,,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

Existing evidence suggests that people make systematic mistakes in affective forecasting that lead to suboptimal decisions. The paper hypothesizes that such errors are important in the context of the private provision of environmental goods and shows in a simple theoretical model that decision errors imply a non-zero net marginal utility at the chosen level of environmental-friendly consumption. Using life satisfaction as a proxy for experienced utility, the empirical analysis finds a positive and significant association between life satisfaction and pro-environmental behavior, which is consistent with environmental-friendly consumption being less than individually optimal.

One response has been a growing 'slow travel' movement. Slow travel is an emerging concept which can be explained as an alternative to air and car travel where people travel to destinations more slowly overland and travel less distance. At first glance, slow travel might seem to preclude much international tourism, however, as an adaptation strategy, slow travel has the potential to reduce tourism's overall carbon footprint. Data were collected using in-depth interviews with 15 UK participants before and after a holiday to another European country. The analysis explores the discourses used by both slow and non-slow travellers to justify modal choice in relation to climate change. Then, using a social practices model, the paper explores how holiday travel is constrained by both individual agency to act and the structures that exist within the travel and tourism industry. The paper concludes with some recommendations for the development of slow travel as a tourism adaptation strategy for a lower carbon future. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the average credit spread on a syndicated loan with multiple tranches is higher than that on a non-tranched loan. However, after accounting for the risk characteristics of a tranched loan, I show that borrowings that are a part of tranched loans have lower credit spreads than otherwise identical non-tranched loans.
