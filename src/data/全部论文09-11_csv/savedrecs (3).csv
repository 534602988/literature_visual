Based on the data covering the period from the first quarter of 1986 to the third quarter of 1998, our results indicate that in neither sector J-curve exists and that the violation of the J-curve effect is more severe in the sector with higher import content.","[Yazici, Mehmet; Klasra, Mushtaq Ahmad] Cankaya Univ, Dept Int Trade, TR-06530 Balgat Ankara, Turkey",Cankaya University,"Yazici, M (通讯作者)，Cankaya Univ, Dept Int Trade, Ogretmenler Cad 14, TR-06530 Balgat Ankara, Turkey.",myazici@cankaya.edu.tr,"YAZICI, Mehmet/GWZ-2001-2022","YAZICI, Mehmet/0000-0003-2924-9865",,,,,24,10,11,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Such mergers enable the integrated firms to extend market power from the TGC market to the physical energy market. We find that the price of TGCs is indeed higher in the integrated market than the disintegrated market, indicating the presence of market power leveraging. However, despite higher TGC price, the total supply of electricity is greater under integration than disintegration, reflecting efficiency gains from vertical integration, which eliminates double marginalization. The thrust of this paper is that market changes induced by environmental policies will in turn affect environmental and economic regulations. For example. increased supply resulting from integration induced by the renewable source mandate may reduce the effectiveness of programs that promote energy saving behavior, but at the same time creates room for raising the minimum of renewable sources without unduly depressing production and consumption.

This article studies the role of such disputes in a situation where two players have to make a transaction-specific investment and when contracts are incomplete. I show that potentially contested ownership may mitigate the inefficiency of investments due to the incompleteness of contracts generating an exchange surplus that comes closer to the first-best surplus as compared to any other ex ante distribution of ownership typically discussed in the literature following the influential work by Grossman, Hart, and Moore. If the contest is an all-pay auction, each player makes a transaction-specific investment as if he or she owns the asset. This article can explain why shared ownership-as for example in equity joint ventures, family firms, start-up partnerships, and so on-is an important part of today's corporate landscape.","Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph,"Annen, K (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",kannen@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,,26,5,5,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

In equilibrium, contests that aim to maximize the number of participants will award multiple prizes if and only if this sensitivity is sufficiently high. Moreover, the prize awarded to the winner is decreasing in the contests' sensitivity. We provide empirical evidence from professional road running using race-distance as a measure of sensitivity. We show that steeper prize structures are more attractive to top-ranked runners in longer, that is, less sensitive, races.

When recycling requires consumers to undertake costly sorting activities to separate scrap from household waste, they will participate only if the net reward from sorting is positive. Consumers' sorting cost is subject to a network effect arising due to social norms. With heterogeneous consumers differing in terms of their sorting cost, the entire output of the recyclable product may not be subsequently available as scrap to the recycling firms. This increases the virgin producer's monopoly power, and may also lead to multiple equilibria if the network effect of sorting is sufficiently large. The latter result suggests a role for the government in influencing equilibrium selection to improve social welfare. Depending on the fraction of consumers that participate in recycling, increased societal pressure on consumers to recycle may decrease consumer participation and increase the virgin producer's market power.","[Van Long, Ngo] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada; [Baksi, Soham] Univ Winnipeg, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada",McGill University; University of Winnipeg,"Van Long, N (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada.",ngo.long@mcgill.ca,,,,,,,19,5,6,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

We conduct an experiment to study the conjecture that an environment with strong punishment possibilities may lead to higher material payoffs but lower subjective well-being, in comparison with weaker punishment or no punishment possibilities at all. The more general motivation for our study stems from the notion that people's subjective well-being may be affected by the institutional environment they find themselves in. Our findings show that harsher punishment possibilities lead to significantly higher well-being, controlling for earnings and other relevant variables.

In contrast to recent Studies that demonstrate the benefits of targeting the price of output, model simulations provide evidence that favors targeting the price of labor, or the nominal wage, instead. While both policies impart inertia (a salient feature of commitment), wage targeting dominates output price targeting because the former delivers more favorable tradeoffs between the stabilization goals appearing in the social welfare function. Delegating joint price and wage targets, however, nearly replicates the commitment policy from a timeless perspective. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

It is often argued that the American productivity increase is due to the widespread introduction of new information and communication technologies (ICT). But why have the same technologies not similarly increased Europe's labor productivity? This paper provides a theoretical explanation for this productivity puzzle based on at extension of Radner's (1992) model of hierarchical information aggregation. The introduction of new ICTs enables organizations to process any given amount of information with a shorter delay. This enables organizations to restructure and solve incentive problems without risking to produce with excessive delay. Even a marginal improvement in the ICT can yield significant increases in labor productivity if - and only if - the organization is drastically restructured. Restructuring yields hierarchies with fewer layers and fewer managers, all working under incentive pay and providing first best effort. However, managers need not participate in the gains associated with the restructuring of their business firms. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We characterize the conditions under which tax incentives reach the socially desirable level of firm-financed R&D spending. The outcome of the market depends not only on the level of technological spillover in the industry but also on the degree of strategic interaction between the firms. One major result emerges from the model: The socially desirable level of R&D investment is not necessarily reached by subsidizing R&D. When the technological spillover is sufficiently low, the government might want to tax R&D investments, and this result does not necessarily arise because firms are overinvesting in R&D. There are also cases in which an R&D tax is desirable even though firms are underinvesting in R&D compared with the first-best optimum.

The present paper shows that, in contrast, long-term nominal debt might have destabilizing effects when a government introduces an inflation stabilization policy. It is shown that a stabilization policy that is successful in the absence of long-term nominal debt can cause a crisis when long-term nominal debt exists. The model implies that a government with a large stock of long-term nominal debt must overcome a high fiscal hurdle for a successful stabilization policy. This difficulty is avoidable if long-term debt is indexed to inflation.","Kobe Univ, Res Inst Econ & Business Adm, Kobe, Hyogo 657, Japan",Kobe University,"Kitano, S (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Res Inst Econ & Business Adm, Kobe, Hyogo 657, Japan.",kitano@rieb.kobe-u.ac.jp,,"Kitano, Shigeto/0000-0003-0934-2691",,,,,29,0,0,1,10,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1742-7355,,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

Hodges and Neuberger [1989. Optimal replication of contingent claims under transactions costs. Review of Futures Markets 8, 222-239] introduced an approach that is based on maximization of the expected utility of terminal wealth. We develop a new algorithm to solve the corresponding singular stochastic control problem and introduce a new approach to option hedging which is closer in spirit to the pathwise replication of Black and Scholes [1973. The pricing of options and corporate liabilities. journal of Political Economy 81, 637-654]. This new approach is based on minimization of a Black-Scholes-type measure of pathwise risk, defined in terms of a market delta, Subject to an upper bound on the hedging cost. We provide an efficient backward induction algorithm for the problem of cost-constrained risk minimization, whose associated singular stochastic control problem is shown to be equivalent to an optimal stopping problem. This algorithm is then modified to solve the singular stochastic control problem associated with utility maximization, which cannot be reduced to an optimal stopping problem. We propose to choose an optimal parameter (risk-aversion coefficient or Lagrange multiplier) in either approach by minimizing the mean squared hedging error and demonstrate that with this best choice of the parameter, both approaches have similar performance. We also discuss the different notions of risk in both approaches and propose a volatility adjustment for the risk-minimization approach, which is analogous to that introduced by Zakamouline [2006. European option pricing and hedging with both fixed and proportional transaction costs. journal of Economic Dynamics and Control 30, 1-25] for the utility maximization approach, thereby providing a unified treatment of both approaches.

A large literature debates the relative importance of countries' legal and political environment. In this paper, I present evidence from ancient Rome, where an early form of shareholder company, the societas publicanorum, developed. I show that the societas publicanorum flourished in a legally underdeveloped but politically supportive environment (Roman Republic) and disappeared when Roman law reached its height of legal sophistication but the political environment grew less supportive (Roman Empire). In the Roman, case, legal development appears to have mattered little as long as the law as practiced was flexible and adapted to economic needs. The law as practiced, in turn, reflected prevalent political interests. After discussing parallels in more recent history, I provide a brief overview of the literature on law and finance and on politics and finance. The historical evidence suggests that legal systems may be less of a technological constraint for growth than previously thought-at least at the origin.

We provide weak evidence that supplier density in the at-home care market is positively correlated with probability to use care or expenditure on care.

We look at the ownership structure that results from privatization and its evolution; the determinants of private ownership concentration; and the impact of private ownership concentration, identity and board composition on firm performance. We find that the state gives up control over time to the private sector, but still controls, on average. more than 35% of these firms. We also document a trend in private ownership concentration over time, mostly to the benefit of foreign investors. Firm size, sales growth, industry affiliation, and timing and method of privatization seem to play a key role in determining private ownership concentration. Ownership concentration and ownership identity, in particular foreign investors, prove to have a positive impact on firm performance, while employee ownership concentration has a negative one. The higher proportion of outside directors and the change in the board composition following privatization have a positive effect on firm performance. These results could have some important policy implications where private ownership by foreign investors seems to add more value to firms, while selling state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to employees is not recommended. Also, the state is highly advised to relinquish control and allow for changes in the board of directors following privatization as changing ownership, per se, might not have a positive impact on firm performance unless it is coupled with a new management style.

Recent developments in social ontology as well as the expansion of the theoretical analysis of institutions have provided new tools and new sets of arguments in support of such an endeavor. A conception of money that combines institutionalism with chartalism does not need to suffer from the shortcomings and the inconsistencies of the descriptions of money within commodity theory, while it subsequently enjoys sounder ontological foundations. This framework of study can also address questions in which the neoclassical analysis of money has proved unable or misleading; it can provide a dynamic account for the evolution of money and a clear understanding of the relation between money and technology.","[Papadopoulos, Georgios] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Inst Philosophy & Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Papadopoulos, G (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Inst Philosophy & Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,32,13,14,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The biomedical factors considered may be important in explaining the level of stunting, but their contribution to explaining inequality is relatively small.

There has been a sustained increase in intra-regional trade in EA. On finance, however, regional financial integration has been lagging behind trade integration and EA has reached out to global financial markets to effect deeper global integration. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the effects of intra-regional and extra-regional financial integration on changes in the pattern of EA's business cycle since 1990 to see whether there is any ground for decoupling of EA from the United States and the EU. On trade relations, the empirical results show that deepening trade integration contributes to more synchronized output movements among EA countries. There is also evidence that financial integration enhances more synchronization of output, but because its impact is not strong, the extra-regional integration does not necessarily dispute the prediction that EA's output movement has become more idiosyncratic than before, and therefore less closely tied with that of the United States.","[Park, Yung Chul] Korea Univ, Div Int Studies, Seoul 136701, South Korea; [Shin, Kwanho] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea",Korea University; Korea University,"Park, YC (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Div Int Studies, 5-1 Anam Dong, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",yungcp@korea.ac.kr; khshin@korea.ac.kr,"Shin, Kwanho/AAL-7502-2021","Shin, Kwanho/0000-0001-9747-7603",,,,,33,24,26,0,19,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

Urban rates of the overweight, measured by the body mass index (BMI), are also far higher than those in rural areas. In examining the inter-temporal changes in the entire standardized weight distribution, there are nonetheless many instances where it is not possible to reject the null of non-dominance, especially in rural areas. It is also clear that the distribution of women's BMIs in most countries is becoming markedly less equitable, and that this increase in univariate inequality is driven largely by the increase in BMIs among overweight and obese women. This is somewhat analogous to the oft discussed rich get richer story. That is, the increasing concentration of weight, standardized by heights, among the overweight is driving a significant share of the overall increase in BMI inequality. A related finding is that when I decompose the changes in the prevalence of overweight into the effect of shifts in the mean versus changes in the distribution, in many countries, even holding mean BMI constant, there would be a marked increase in the prevalence of clinically overweight women due to changes in the shape of the BMI distribution.","Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Sahn, DE (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, 3M12 MVR Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",David.Sahn@cornell.edu,,,,,,,23,14,14,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

Using a simple three-player, three-period Baron and Ferejohn (1989) style legislative bargaining model with incomplete information, we evaluate two kinds of majority rules: the simple majority rule and the unanimity rule. Under the simple majority rule, it is less expensive to form a minimum-winning coalition, so that every type of proposer prefers his proposal to be passed immediately. The proposer has fewer incentives to reveal his information by delaying the bargaining, since there is a possibility of being excluded from the majority in future periods. Thus, in contrast to the unanimity rule, there does not exist any fully separating equilibrium. We also show that if the first-period proposer has greater agenda-setting power, it can help to reduce the probability of delay. Journal of Comparative Economics 37 (4) (2009) 674-684.

We establish two main empirical regularities: both higher trade and financial openness (i) reduce central banks' inflation bias, yielding lower average inflation and (ii) are associated with a larger output-inflation tradeoff. This evidence is at odds with the standard Barro-Gordon framework, which would require globalization to have a negative effect on the output-inflation tradeoff to yield lower equilibrium inflation, but it is consistent with a recent strand of new Keynesian models emphasizing the role of imperfect competition and nominal rigidities. Our findings also support the relevance of the time-inconsistency hypothesis, which underlies the theoretical models predicting a relation between globalization and inflation. For the OECD subsample, however, we do not find an effect of openness on inflation (the output-inflation tradeoff), suggesting that these countries have created an institutional framework for central banks that eliminates distortions due to the time-inconsistency problem.

We identify an overlooked but practical alternative to defaults: requiring individuals to make explicit choices for themselves. We study such active decisions in the context of 401(k) saving. We find that compelling new hires to make active decisions about 401(k) enrollment raises the initial fraction that enroll by 28 percentage points relative to a standard opt-in enrollment procedure, producing a savings distribution three months after hire that would take thirty months to achieve under standard enrollment. We also present a model of 401(k) enrollment and derive conditions under which the optimal enrollment regime is automatic enrollment (i.e., default enrollment), standard enrollment (i.e., default nonenrollment), or active decisions (i.e., no default and compulsory choice). Active decisions are optimal when consumers have a strong propensity to procrastinate and savings preferences are highly heterogeneous. Financial illiteracy, however, favors default enrollment over active decision enrollment.","[Carroll, Gabriel D.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Yale University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University,"Carroll, GD (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",gdc@mit.edu; james.choi@yale.edu; dlaibson@harvard.edu; brigitte_madrian@harvard.edu; metrick@yale.edu,"Laibson, David/AAA-7362-2022; Choi, James J/D-4706-2012; Metrick, Andrew/B-9296-2008","Metrick, Andrew/0000-0002-7930-9830","NIA NIH HHS [R29 AG013020-05, R01 AG021650-06, R01 AG021650, R01 AG016605-03, T32 AG000186, T32 AG000186-16] Funding Source: Medline",NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,28,314,358,1,94,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

We show that healthy people are in general happier than individuals with poor health, controlling for a number of personal and household characteristics. On the basis of the regression results, we computed the monetary value of good health, suggesting that relatively large sums of money would be required to compensate individuals for the loss in happiness associated with poor health. Finally, we show that people become unhappy when the health status of their loved ones deteriorates. In particular, the compensating value associated with a spouse's poor health can be very large, thus pointing to some altruism in the relationship between health status and happiness.","[de Mello, Luiz] OECD, Dept Econ, F-75775 Paris 16, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"de Mello, L (通讯作者)，OECD, Dept Econ, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",luiz.demello@oecd.org; etiongson@worldbank.org,,,,,,,47,14,14,0,8,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0023-5962,,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,NOV,2009,62.0,4,,,,,594,610,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2009.00453.x,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,509QK,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271033000010,0

This is consistent with educated workers being more effective at complex tasks such as labour management. In all countries, the education wage gap widens rapidly at high levels of education. Most of the education wage gap at low levels of education can be explained by selection across occupations. We also find that the education wage gap tends to be higher for women, except in Morocco where many poorly educated women work in the garment sector.

Their combination allows the utilisation of the advantages of both types. The aim of this paper is to describe the state-of-the-art in simulation analysis and to illustrate the benefits and problems of linking micro and macro models by analysing flat tax reform proposals for Germany. Taking feedback effects into account has important implications for the evaluation of tax reforms. The analysis shows that a personal income flat tax can indeed overcome the fundamental equity efficiency trade-off while simultaneously increasing the tax revenue. However, this result does not hold for a flat tax combining a personal income flat tax with a corporate cash flow flat tax, even when allowing for an expost loss in revenue, as the top of the distribution still gains the most.","[Peichl, Andreas] IZA, Inst Study Labor, ISER, D-53072 Bonn, Germany",IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Peichl, A (通讯作者)，IZA, Inst Study Labor, ISER, POB 7240, D-53072 Bonn, Germany.",peichl@iza.org,"Peichl, Andreas/D-7829-2018",,,,,,44,22,22,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

Although boards are often on friendly terms with executives, it is less clear that they have systematically failed to function in the interests of shareholders. Understanding board monitoring requires a theory of boards that takes into account how firms provide incentives for their Chief Executive Officer's (CEOs) through other means. We develop a model in which a CEO's ownership stake and private benefits have opposite effects on his willingness to share private information with an independent board of directors. To encourage the CEO to communicate, the board may optimally commit to a low monitoring intensity when either CEO ownership is low or private benefits are high. Our model suggests that the existing cross-section evidence on the correlation between board composition and CEO ownership and tenure needs re-evaluation. Using a new proxy for board monitoring, we provide new evidence that this cross-sectional correlation appears to be non-monotonic, with board independence first decreasing and then increasing in CEO ownership and tenure. We discuss the implications of our model for the design and evaluation of governance structures.

Soft laws reduce the frequency of liquidations and thus ex post inefficiencies, but they worsen credit rationing ex ante. This hinders firm creation and thus depresses labor demand. Rich agents who need few outside funds can invest even if creditor rights are weak. Hence, they favor soft laws that exclude poorer agents from the credit market and reduce the competition for labor. Such laws can generate greater utilitarian welfare than under perfect contract enforcement: By barring access to credit to some agents, soft laws lower wages, which increases the pledgeable income of richer agents and decreases the liquidation rates they must commit to. When they induce strong credit rationing, however, soft laws are Pareto-dominated by tougher laws combined with subsidies to entrepreneurs.

In spite of breeding stronger economic growth, a higher number of patents, and a higher share of R&D in total production, direct R&D support generates slightly less welfare than subsidising formation of capital varieties. The costs in terms of welfare relates to a lower production within each variety firm, which in presence of mark-up pricing results in efficiency losses. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This aspect of the Chinese labour force has attracted surprisingly little attention in the literature, a fact which this paper aims to rectify. We define various segments of the urban population in work-active ages and use data from the Chinese Income Project (CHIP) covering eastern, central and western China for 1995 and 2002. For 2002, persons of high rank make up 3% and persons of middle rank make up 14% of persons in work-active ages. Factors that affect a person's likelihood of having high or middle rank are investigated by estimating a multinomial probit model. We find that education, age and gender strongly affect the probability of being employed as a worker of high rank. There is relatively little income inequality among workers of high rank as well as among workers of middle rank. Mean income and household wealth per capita of highly-ranked workers developed more favorably than for other segments of the population studied, and personal income is more polarized by segment in 2002 than in 1995. Workers of high rank, and to a lesser degree, workers of middle rank, are among the winners in economic terms while the increasingly large category of non-workers is the losers. Rates of return to education have increased but income function analysis indicates that this provides only a partial explanation for the increased favorable income situation for workers of high and middle ranks.

J,"Jordan, JS",,,,"Jordan, J. S.",,,Power and efficiency in production pillage games,REVIEW OF ECONOMIC DESIGN,,,English,Article,,,,,,Conflict; Efficiency; Coalitional game; Pillage; Core; Stable set; Legitimacy,COMMITMENT,"A pillage game is a formal model of Hobbesian anarchy as a coalitional game. The technology of pillage is specified by a power function that determines the power of each coalition as a function of its members and their wealth. A coalition can despoil any other coalition less powerful than itself. The present paper studies the problem of achieving an efficient allocation of resources when the required reallocation changes the distribution of power. For example, land redistribution may increase total production, but may also deprive the original owners of the power they need to compel compensation. In this case the original owners would block the redistribution. Previous work on pillage games has focused on the stable set (von Neumann-Morgenstern solution) as a representation of a stable balance of power. However, the balance of power is typically too delicate to support all efficient allocations. The present paper shows that for a large class of power functions, a recently developed extension of the stable set, called the legitimate set, can be rich enough to support all efficient allocations.","Penn State Univ, Dept Econ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Jordan, JS (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Dept Econ, 514 Kern Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",jsjordan@psu.edu,,,,,,,12,5,6,0,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

Under the near unit root specification with a row-normalized spatial weights matrix, it is shown that the possible spurious regression phenomena in the spatial setting are relatively weaker than those in the nonstationary time series scenario. The regression estimates might or might not converge to 0. The divergence might occur only when the regressant has a near unit root much closer to unity than that of the regressor. For the t and F statistics, there could be over-rejection of the null of uncorrelatedness under certain situations, but they do not diverge. However, the coefficient of determination R-2 converges to 0, which provides strong evidence of the spurious regression even when t and F statistics are large. Simulation results about different statistics are in line with the theoretical results we derive in this paper.","[Yu, Jihai] Univ Kentucky, Gatton Coll Business & Econ 335C, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Lee, Lung-Fei] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University of Kentucky; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Yu, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Kentucky, Gatton Coll Business & Econ 335C, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",lflee@econ.ohio-state.edu; jihai.yu@uky.edu,,,,,,,26,19,21,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

Obviously, any deterioration in the health of older adults will inevitably increase pressure on the Medicare system. However, if older adults respond to changes in their health by reducing their labor supply, than this will also increase demand for the Social Security system. Using data on married and employed couples from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), this paper determines how the labor supply of each member of a married couple is influenced by changes in the health, assets and medical expenditures of the other member of the couple. Therefore, adding to the extant literature as we determine how the labor supply of an individual responds to health shocks visited on their spouse. We find that the labor supply of both males and females is influenced by their own health shocks and health shocks suffered by their spouses.","Drexel Univ, Dept Econ & Int Business, LeBow Coll Business, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Drexel University,"McGeary, KA (通讯作者)，Drexel Univ, Dept Econ & Int Business, LeBow Coll Business, Suite 503-D Matheson Hall,32nd & Market St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",kmcgeary@drexel.edu,,,,,,,22,16,20,1,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

The main results characterize, under two alternative modes of taxation, the equilibrium fiscal rules chosen by countries, i.e., the level of the positive rate and the set of taxed commodities. Under the origin principle, it appears that the equilibrium fiscal base is narrower than the optimal one and the tax rate is too high.

Still others combine elements of evolution and design. We differentiate a variety of approaches to conceptualizing the interaction between formal and informal rules.

AD duties installed by the United States during the period of 1990-1996 have caused a fall in the amount of imports from the targeted countries in industries concerned. At the same time, AD duties have brought about the import diversion effect. Yet import diversion falls short of import reduction on average, so that import protection took place following the imposition of AD duties. Comparing the result of this paper with those of Staiger and Wolak (1994) leads to the conjecture that the import protection effect of U.S. AD measures does not change much from the period 1980-1985 to the period 1990-1996 When it comes to sectoral or country-wise protection, the protection effect is not homogeneous.

On average customers pay $8.20, far more than the minimum of $5 and even higher than the recommended price of $8. We analyse the relationship between artists/labels and customers in online music. We consider social preferences, in particular concerns for reciprocity. The resulting sequential reciprocity equilibrium corresponds to the observed pattern of behaviour.

Reforms, however, raise the opposition of incumbents and, therefore, are politically difficult to implement. When there are important cross-border policy spillover effects, national governments are more easily captured by vested interests, as they fail to internalize the benefits of reforms on the rest of the union. In this situation, productivity growth may be sluggish and the economy can fail to converge to the frontier. On the other hand, when policy is chosen by a union government (or a collective body that takes into account union welfare), the internalization of spillovers raises the perceived benefit of reforms and, consequently, lowers the ability of lobbies to obtain high levels of protection.

These declines have continued and a new gender gap is emerging-one with higher subjective well-being for men.","[Stevenson, Betsey; Wolfers, Justin] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Business & Publ Policy Dept, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Stevenson, B (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Business & Publ Policy Dept, Suite 1400 Steinberg Dietrich Hall, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",betsey.stevenson@wharton.upenn.edu; jwolfers@wharton.upenn.edu,,,,,,,37,265,305,6,65,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7731,,,AM ECON J-ECON POLIC,Am.

There is also a divisible good (money) and the individuals consume money and one object each. The class of fair allocation rules that are strategy-proof in the strong sense that no coalition of individuals can improve the allocation for all of its members, by misrepresenting their preferences, is characterized. It turns out that given a regularity condition, the outcome of a fair and coalitionally strategy-proof allocation rule must maximize the use of money subject to upper quantity bounds determined by the allocation rule. If available money is nonnegative, objects may be jobs and the distribution of money a wage structure. If available money is negative, the formal model may reflect a multi-object auction.

We construct an overlapping generation model in which agents are heterogeneous in income and innate ability, and the final goods are produced with differentiated intermediate goods. It is shown that under a realistic condition, the diversity of human capital induced by income inequality always lowers the GDP of the next period, while the diversity of human capital induced by heterogeneous ability can increase GDP, if the produced intermediate goods are sufficiently substitutable and firms have a large span of control. Hence, as public education equalizes education resources across households, it mitigates the negative effect of income inequality on GDR while the effects of ability tracking crucially depend on the production structure of the economy.

Drawing on economics and psychology the paper provides an hypothesis and empirical evidence on how individuals may value freedom of choice and derive utility from it. It is argued that the degree of perceived control that individuals have over choice - a construct known as the locus of control in psychology regulates how we value freedom of choice. People who believe that the outcome of their actions depends on internal factors such as effort and skills (the 'internals') have a greater appreciation of freedom of choice than people who believe that the outcome of their actions depends on external factors such as fate or destiny (the 'externals'). We find some evidence in support of this hypothesis using a combination of all rounds of the World and European Values Surveys. A variable that measures freedom of choice and the locus of control is found to predict life satisfaction better than any other known factor such as health, employment, income, marriage or religion, across countries and within countries. We show that this variable is not a proxy of happiness and measures well both freedom of choice and the locus of control. 'Internals' are found to appreciate freedom of choice more than 'externals' and to be happier. These findings have important implications for individual utility, social welfare and public policies.

Instead, an identification approach to individual giving is proposed here that combines the results focus of the public goods formulation with the scale of the warm-glow model.

Tracts where projects are awarded 30% higher tax credits receive approximately six more low income housing units on a base of seven units per tract. These additional new low income developments cause homeowner turnover to rise, raise property values in declining areas and reduce incomes in gentrifying areas in neighborhoods near the 30th percentile of the income distribution.

On nonstandard beliefs, I present evidence on over-confidence, on the law of small numbers, and on projection bias. Regarding nonstandard decision, making, I cover framing, limited attention, menu effects, persuasion and social pressure, and emotions.

What if there are two (or more) latent decision-making processes generating the observed choices? Some choices might then be better characterized as being generated by one process, and other choices by the other process. A finite mixture model can be used to estimate the parameters of each decision process while simultaneously estimating the probability that each process applies to the sample. We consider the canonical case of lottery choices in a laboratory experiment and assume that the data is generated by expected utility theory and prospect theory decision rules. We jointly estimate the parameters of each theory as well as the fraction of choices characterized by each. The methodology provides the wedding invitation, and the data consummates the ceremony followed by a decent funeral for the representative agent model that assumes only one type of decision process. The evidence suggests support for each theory, and goes further to identify under what demographic domains one can expect to see one theory perform better than the other. We therefore propose a reconciliation of the debate over two of the dominant theories of choice under risk, at least for the tasks and samples we consider. The methodology is broadly applicable to a range of debates over competing theories generated by experimental and non-experimental data.","[Harrison, Glenn W.; Rutstrom, E.

Without tax competition, the price on the public good is zero. Tax competition induces each country to choose a positive price.

When training creates an information asymmetry between the principal and the agent, the principal may overinvest in general training relative to specific training.

The NCM has become associated with the use of interest rate policy to target inflation and to reach a zero output gap, and to ignore fiscal policy. This paper argues that interest rate policy is an ineffectual policy instrument. It proposes that interest rates should be set broadly in line with the rate of growth. Fiscal policy can be used to partially address short-run fluctuations in economic activity through a combination of automatic fiscal stabilizers and discretionary policy. The general fiscal stance should be set to be consistent with a high level of economic activity along the lines of functional finance. The task remains to find a coherent policy for the containment of inflation.","Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Econ Div, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Sawyer, M (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Econ Div, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",,,,,,,,25,5,5,0,5,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0160-3477,,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

The rules differ by (1) whether an individual can receive a proportional rebate of excess contributions, a winner-takes-all of any excess contributions, or a full rebate of one's contribution in the event the public good is provided and excess contributions exist, and (2) whether the probability of receiving a rebate is proportional to an individual's contribution relative to total contributions or is a simple uniform probability distribution set by the number of contributors. The paper adds to the existing experimental economics literature on threshold public goods by investigating both aggregate and individual demand revelation under the winner-take-all and random full-rebate rules. Half of the rules (proportional rebate, winner-take-all with uniform probability among all group members, and random full-rebate with uniform probability) provide total contributions that nearly equal total benefits, while the rest (winner-take-all with proportional probability, winner-take-all with uniform probability among contributors only, and random full-rebate with proportional probability) exceed benefits by over 30%. Only the proportional rebate rule is found to achieve both aggregate and individual demand revelation. Our experimental results have implications for both fundraisers and valuation practitioners.

S. Shackle in fostering an unconventional approach to individual decision making. Up until the early 1970s Shackle was the single critic of the probabilistic approach to decision making who proposed an alternative formal corpus for dealing with uncertainty. The main aim of the paper is to analyse Shackle's non-probabilistic conceptualization of individual decisions under uncertainty from a specific viewpoint, namely that of a possible connection between his theory and one of the most interesting recent approaches to decision under uncertainty, the so-called non-additive probability approach of Gilboa and Schmeidler. The paper shows that these developments in modern decision theory take Shackle's issue seriously and confirm that the reliance of strict Bayesian theory on probabilistic judgements based on point-probability estimates, a reliance that Shackle intended to oppose, is untenable. Non-additive decision theory also provides a usage of non-additive probability distributions in choice that is an alternative to Shackle's approach of using a qualitative notion of probability, such as potential surprise.","[Basili, Marcello; Zappia, Carlo] Univ Siena, Dept Econ Policy Finance & Dev, I-53100 Siena, Italy",University of Siena,"Zappia, C (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, Dept Econ Policy Finance & Dev, Piazza San Francesco 7, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",basili@unisi.it; zappia@unisi.it,,"ZAPPIA, CARLO/0000-0003-2471-5839",,,,,115,16,16,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,MAY,2009,60.0,2,,,,,245,282,,10.1111/j.1467-999X.2008.00333.x,0.0,,,38,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,664TI,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000282985000003,0

Markets could select across traders with different beliefs, or, reminiscent of 'the wisdom of crowds', markets could balance the diverse information of many participants. We provide theoretical support in favor of the first mechanism, and against the second. Along the way we demonstrate that the necessary condition for long-run survival in complete markets found in Sandroni [2000. Do markets favor agents able to make accurate predictions? Econometrica 68 (6), 1303-1342] and in Blume and Easley [2006. If you're so smart, why aren't you rich? Belief selection in complete and incomplete markets. Econometrica, 74 (4), 929-966] is not sufficient for long-run survival. We also demonstrate some surprising behavior of market prices when several trader types with different beliefs survive. This paper continues the research program of Blume and Easley [1992. Evolution and market behavior. journal of Economic theory 58 (1), 9-40] and Beker and Chattopadhyay [2006.

In this paper we reexamine welfare costs of inflation within a stochastic general equilibrium balanced growth model paying a particular attention to recursive utility, portfolio balance effects, and monetary volatility and monetary policy uncertainty. Our numerical analysis shows that a monetary policy that brings down inflation to the optimum level can have substantial welfare effects.

If there are many matchings between each strategy revision, the randomness due to matching will be small; our question is when a very small noise due to matching has a negligible effect. We study two different senses of this idea, and provide sufficient conditions for each. The less demanding sense corresponds to sending the matching noise to zero while holding fixed all other aspects of the adaptive process. The second sense in which matching noise can be negligible is that it does not alter the limit distribution obtained as the limit of the invariant distributions as an exogenous mutation rate goes to zero.

This paper focuses on the fact that the IMF may favour geopolitically important countries in the distribution of IMF loans, differentiating between concessional and non-concessional facilities. To carry out the empirical analysis, we construct a new database that compiles a wide array of proxies for geopolitical importance for 107 IMF countries over 1990-2003, focusing on emerging and developing economies. We use a factor analysis to capture the common underlying characteristic Of Countries' geopolitical importance as well as a potential analysis since we also want to account for the geographical situation of the loan recipients. While controlling for economic and political determinants, our results show that geopolitical factors influence notably lending decisions when loans are non-concessional, whereas results are less robust and in opposite direction for concessional loans.

Labor taxation distorts not only labor supply, but also education and retirement decisions. Actuarially unfair pensions further exacerbate labor tax distortions on retirement. Education subsidies can nevertheless cushion the adverse impact of taxation on skill formation. Feedbacks between education, labor supply, and retirement are important. The model is simulated with realistic behavioral elasticities that are consistent with microeconometric evidence. If, besides labor supply, also learning and retirement are endogenous, the uncompensated (compensated) elasticity of the tax base equals 0.46 (0.85), which is more than twice as large as the standard uncompensated (compensated) labor supply elasticity of 0.18 (0.40). Furthermore, life-cycle interactions between education, working, and retirement are quantitatively important and the interactions raise all behavioral elasticities substantially. For example, the uncompensated labor supply elasticity increases with one-half due to life-cycle interactions (to 0.26). We demonstrate that low European labor supply can be fully explained by taxation without relying on unrealistically high labor supply elasticities. Reducing labor market distortions, cutting benefit levels, lowering tax rates, and making (early) retirement actuarially more fair, therefore, boosts labor supply, delays retirement, and stimulates skill formation. In addition, high education subsidies are needed in large welfare states to offset explicit and implicit tax burdens on human capital investment.","Erasmus Univ, Tinbergen Inst, Erasmus Sch Econ, Netspar & CESifo, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Tinbergen Institute; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Jacobs, B (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Tinbergen Inst, Erasmus Sch Econ, Netspar & CESifo, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",bjacobs@few.eur.nl,"Rodriguez Gustá, Ana/A-8083-2011",,,,,,42,8,10,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Estimation and comparison of multiple change-point models. journal of Econometrics 86, 221-241]. By letting the data provide estimates of the dates of the determinacy regimes and allowing the estimates of structural parameters to be the same across regimes, we obtain more precise estimates of the differences in characteristics, such as the impulse responses, across the regimes. The most striking finding about the indeterminacy regime, which is estimated to coincide with the Great Inflation of the 1970s, is that it exhibits the price puzzle, in that the inflation rate rises immediately and in a sustained manner following a positive interest rate shock. Thus, the price puzzle might have been a genuine phenomenon under indeterminacy, rather than a false finding to be excised through specification search and parameter restrictions.

When endowing producers with a learning ability to forecast market prices, individual profit-maximizing production decisions become interdependent in a strategic sense (strategic substitutes). Performing basic comparative statics exercises, we show that competitiveness matters in a precise sense: as foreign producers gain access to the home market, home producers' ability to forecast market prices is undermined, so being their ability to forecast the profit consequences of their production decisions. A standard open economy exercise shows that the efficiency gains triggered by increased competition have to be traded-off against higher uncertainty (a lower likelihood to coordinate upon the welfare enhancing free-trade equilibrium). We interpret it as a new rationale for the existence of barriers to trade targeting coordination, rather than protecting mere inefficient sectors or industries (political economy driven). Finally, we show that classical measures evaluating ex-ante the desirability of economic integration (net welfare gains) do not always advice free trade.","Univ Southampton, Econ Div, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",University of Southampton,"Calvo-Pardo, H (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Econ Div, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",calvo@soton.ac.uk,,"Calvo Pardo, Hector F./0000-0001-6645-4273",,,,,32,4,4,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Competition, policy burdens, and state-owned enterprise reform. American Economic Review 88,422-327] argue that under information asymmetry, SOE managers can use state-imposed policy burdens as excuses of poor performance and make the State accountable for it. The argument implies that turnover-performance sensitivity of SOEs decreases as policy burdens increase and that such impact depends on the extent of information asymmetry. Accordingly, this paper empirically explores how policy burdens affect top management turnover of Chinese listed firms between 2000 and 2005. We find that high surplus labor significantly reduces the sensitivity of chairman turnover to performance for state-controlled firms, while private firms do not exhibit such a pattern. Furthermore, our results show that high surplus labor reduces the turnover-performance sensitivity more for firms with greater information asymmetry. Overall, we find strong evidence supporting the implications of Lin, Cai, and Li [Lin, Y., Cai, F., Li, Z.. 1998. Competition, policy burdens, and state-owned enterprise reform.

First, empirical evidence suggests that a positive permanent technology shock goes together with a persistent increase in the expected growth rate and the RBC-model predicts this increase in the expected growth rate to have a downward effect on hours worked (and can even result in a sizeable negative response first-differencing hours in VARs results in a considerable downward of hours) Second,. bias. Using the estimated parameters for the technology process, I find (i) that the true model response of hours is positive and (ii) that when the VAR methodology is used with finite samples of simulated data then the hours' response is negative (positive) when hours enter the VAR in first differences (levels).

For this purpose, we use a representative three-year panel, the French Labour Force Survey. We develop a model of earnings dynamics that combines a flexible specification of marginal earnings distributions (to fit the large cross-sectional dimension of the data) with a tight parametric representation of the dynamics (adapted to the short time-series dimension). Log earnings are modelled as the sum of a deterministic component, an individual fixed effect and a transitory component which is assumed first-order Markov. The transition probability of the transitory component is modelled as a one-parameter Plackett copula. We estimate this model using a sequential expectation-maximization algorithm. We exploit the estimated model to study employment/earnings inequality in France over the 1990-2002 period. We show that, in phase with business-cycle fluctuations (a recession in 1993 and two peaks in 1990 and 2000), earnings mobility decreases when cross-section inequality and unemployment risk increase. We simulate individual earnings trajectories and compute present values of lifetime earnings for various horizons. Inequality presents a hump-shaped evolution over the period, with a 9% increase between 1990 and 1995 and a decrease afterwards. Accounting for unemployment yields an increase of 11%. Moreover, this increase is persistent, as it translates into a 12% increase in the variance of log present values. The ratio of inequality in present values to inequality in one-year earnings, a natural measure of immobility or of the persistence of inequality, remains remarkably constant over the business cycle.","[Robin, Jean-Marc] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Robin, Jean-Marc] Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, F-75231 Paris 05, France",University of London; University College London; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Paris School of Economics,,,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F015879/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/F015879/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,35,48,53,0,22,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

A recursive framework for education, income and infections is employed, based on two autoregressive equations that allow us to obtain dynamic estimates of effectiveness. We find that the indirect effect working through changes in income outweighs the direct positive effect of education on infections, implying that female education can be effective as an intervention to lower the disease in Tanzania. The estimates of effectiveness are then utilized to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of the education expenditures. The human capital approach is used to measure the benefits. Irrespective of the timing of the benefits and costs, and the discount rate alternatives we consider, our best estimates result in positive net-benefits, with benefit-cost ratios in the range 1.3-2.9.","Fordham Univ, Dept Econ, Bronx, NY 10458 USA",Fordham University,"Brent, RJ (通讯作者)，Fordham Univ, Dept Econ, Bronx, NY 10458 USA.",Brent@fordham.edu,,,,,,,25,18,18,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This paper focuses on the cost of limiting radiative forcing and the role that industrial leakage plays in scenarios of delayed accession. We find that delayed participation shifts the cost burden toward regions that take early action and away from regions that undertake mitigation later. However, the inefficiencies introduced by delay are so great that present discounted costs are higher in the delayed scenario for regions that delay as well as for regions taking early actions. An important element of these inefficiencies is industrial emissions leakage, that is non-participating regions increase then-emissions relative to the reference case. In aggregate, industrial leakage rates are less than 10% if all regions of the world begin emissions mitigation by 2050-higher in carbon-intensive sectors and lower in low-carbon-intensity sectors. Additionally, we consider the implication of technology on carbon prices, the feasibility of limiting radiative forcing to low levels, and the incentives to overshoot the radiative forcing limit.

Data were collected using a telephone survey of an Italian households sample. Discrete choice approach is used to elicit the purchase intentions of the respondents. Four separate probit models are estimated to examine the effect of various factors on choices. Results suggest that majority of Italians are not willing to buy GM food products even if they are nutritionally enhanced. However, more consumers are willing to buy a nutritionally enhanced plant based GM product than a traditional plant based GM (with input trait benefit). Willingness to buy for a nutritionally enhanced animal based GM product and for a traditional animal based GM product with input trait benefit are similar. Consumers unwilling to buy GM food would not buy it even if it is nutritionally enhanced and has lower price. However, there is a niche of consumers who are willing to buy nutritionally enhanced GM food products even at a premium. Knowledge of science and trust in scientists consistently affect Italian consumers' willingness to buy the GM products.","[Canavari, Maurizio] Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dept Agr Econ & Agr Engn, Bologna, Italy; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",University of Bologna; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Canavari, M (通讯作者)，Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dept Agr Econ & Agr Engn, Bologna, Italy.",maurizio.canavari@unibo.it,"Canavari, Maurizio/A-7247-2008","Canavari, Maurizio/0000-0003-0573-7880",,,,,64,38,42,2,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The analysis is pursued in the vector auto-regression (VAR) framework taking into account the results of variance decomposition analysis and the impulse response function. The findings suggest that some of the activities are growing independent of the manufacturing sector. Nevertheless manufacturing, construction and community, social and personal services are the most important drivers. Finally, the paper predicts the informal sector employment based on the magnitude of employment in different components of the organized or formal sector. Given the narrow margin of error of forecast the paper argues that in the absence of time series information on total employment, the time series on organized sector employment can be used for necessary predictions and planning required for employment and poverty.

Two politicians compete in terms of targeted redistributive promises financed through distortionary taxes. We solve for the case of both targetable and non-targetable taxes. We prove that there is an imperfect efficiency-targetability trade off on the tax side. Politicians prefer targetable taxes over non-targetable ones, especially when the latter are less efficient. Yet, targetable taxation is always used even when it is very inefficient compared to non-targetable taxes. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We illustrate the usefulness of our approach by considering the case of HIV/AIDS experience in India. Using our approach, we find that while there are no significant differences in per capita consumption and schooling between HIV and NON HIV families, the welfare loss from HIV/AIDS are still considerably large due to the inclusion of mental health.

We introduce a consistency postulate for a stochastic supply function that may be satisfied even if no underlying deterministic supply function is rationalizable in terms of profit maximization. Our consistency postulate is nonetheless equivalent to a stochastic expansion of supply inequality, which summarizes the predictive content of the traditional theory of competitive supply. A number of key results in the deterministic theory follow as special cases from this equivalence. In particular, it yields a probabilistic version of the law of supply, which implies the traditional specification. Our analysis thus provides a necessary and sufficient axiomatic foundation for a de-coupling of the predictive content of the classical theory of competitive firm behavior from its a priori roots in profit maximization, while subsuming the traditional theory as a special case.","Univ Durham, Durham DH1 3HP, England",Durham University,"Dasgupta, I (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Durham DH1 3HP, England.",indraneel.dasgupta@durham.ac.uk,,"Dasgupta, Indraneel/0000-0002-3212-0782",,,,,18,4,4,9,17,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

Accurate measurement of profits from microenterprises is therefore critical for studying poverty and inequality, measuring the returns to education, and evaluating the success of microfinance programs. However, a myriad of problems plague the measurement of profits. This paper reports on a variety of different experiments conducted to better understand the importance of some of these problems, and to draw recommendations for collecting profit data. In particular, we (i) examine how far we can reconcile self-reported profits and reports of revenue minus expenses through more detailed questions; (ii) examine recall errors in sales, and report on the results of experiments which randomly allocated account books to firms: and (iii) asked firms how much firms like theirs underreport sales in surveys like ours, and had research assistants observe the firms at random times 15-16 times during a month to provide measures for comparison. We conclude that firms underreport revenues by about 30%, that account diaries have significant impacts on both revenues and expenses, but not on profits, and that simply asking profits provides a more accurate measure of firm profits that detailed questions on revenues and expenses.

Two indicators of poverty, infant mortality rates and the human development index (HDI), are utilized, and the effects of the IMF's concessionary and nonconcessionary programs are investigated, as well as economic and institutional factors. The results show that the IMF's programs have no significant direct impact on poverty. Growth and good institutions, however, both have significant impacts, lowering infant mortality and increasing the HDI. The Fund's concessionary programs increase the impact of growth on lowering infant mortality, while the nonconcessionary programs lower the impact of growth on the HDI. Where a great proportion of the people are suffered to languish in helpless misery, that country must be ill policed, and wretchedly governed; a decent provision for the poor is the true test of civilization. -Samuel Johnson, 1791 once a country was in crisis, IMF funds and programs not only failed to stabilize the situation but in many cases actually made things worse, especially for the poor. -Joseph Stiglitz, 2002.","[Hajro, Zlata; Joyce, Joseph P.] Wellesley Coll, Dept Econ, Wellesley, MA 02481 USA",Wellesley College,"Joyce, JP (通讯作者)，Wellesley Coll, Dept Econ, Wellesley, MA 02481 USA.",jjoyce@wellesley.edu,,,,,,,37,17,20,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We ask what it implies for the updating of more general preferences. In this paper, we characterize dynamically consistent update rules for preference models satisfying ambiguity aversion. This characterization extends to regret-based models as well. As applications of our general result, we characterize dynamically consistent updating for two important models of ambiguity averse preferences: the ambiguity averse smooth ambiguity preferences (Klibanoff, Marinacci and Mukerji [Econometrica 73 2005, pp. 1849-1892]) and the variational preferences (Maccheroni, Marinacci and Rustichini [Econometrica 74 2006, pp. 1447-1498]). The latter includes max-min expected utility (Gilboa and Schmeidler [Journal of Mathematical Economics 18 1989, pp. 141-153]) and the multiplier preferences of Hansen and Sargent [American Economic Review 91(2) 2001, pp. 60-66] as special cases. For smooth ambiguity preferences, we also identify a simple rule that is shown to be the unique dynamically consistent rule among a large class of rules that may be expressed as reweightings of the Bayes' rule.","[Hanany, Eran] Tel Aviv Univ, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Klibanoff, Peter] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Tel Aviv University; Northwestern University,"Hanany, E (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Tel Aviv, Israel.",hananye@post.tau.ac.il; peterk@kellogg.northwestern.edu,,"Klibanoff, Peter/0000-0001-6948-5649",,,,,59,53,56,0,13,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

We find the evidence of time varying housing price volatility for Canada. Our VAR, Granger causality and variance decomposition (VDC) analyses demonstrate that housing price volatility is affected significantly by gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate, housing price appreciation rate and inflation. On the other hand, volatility affects GDP growth rate, housing price appreciation and volatility itself. The impulse response analysis reveals the asymmetric of the positive and negative shocks. The findings of this article have important implications, particularly for those seeking to develop derivatives for housing market prices.","[Hossain, Belayet; Latif, Ehsan] Thompson Rivers Univ, Dept Econ, Kamloops, BC V2C 5N3, Canada",,"Hossain, B (通讯作者)，Thompson Rivers Univ, Dept Econ, Kamloops, BC V2C 5N3, Canada.",bhossain@tru.ca,"Latif, Ehsan/AAH-8494-2019",,,,,,21,41,45,4,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This article surveys the range of issues, international and national, that will need to be tackled if Papua New Guinea is to participate successfully in an international effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. Getting the international and domestic building blocks in place will take time: reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation is often cheap, but that does not mean it will be easy. Better and more regular estimation of these emissions will be a critical first step.

The authors employ various least squares estimations, which pick up the conditional average effect. However, there is wide inflation variability in the authors' sample. Thus, formal targets could have very different effects in high-and low-inflation countries. Accordingly, we utilize the technique of quantile regression, a method frequently used in labour economics. We find, in a sample of low-and moderate-inflation countries, that formal targets exert no significant impact on low-inflation nations. This result is important for debates over formal targets, such as whether the United States should adopt an inflation target. There are costs and benefits in having formal targets, and finding that targets do not decrease inflation, when it is already moderate, is an important piece of information to consider.","[Miles, William] Wichita State Univ, Dept Econ, Wichita, KS 67260 USA; [Jackson, Aaron L.] Bentley Coll, Dept Econ, Waltham, MA 02452 USA",Wichita State University; Bentley University,"Miles, W (通讯作者)，Wichita State Univ, Dept Econ, Wichita, KS 67260 USA.",william.miles@wichita.edu,,,,,,,15,1,1,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This paper uncovers evidence of an additional barrier - high time discounting by renters. Results from cumulative logistic and ordinary least squares models of 4228 households participating in the 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances indicate that renters self-report a significantly shorter financial planning time-horizon than owners do. Additionally, a tobit analysis reveals that renters tend to choose short-term, low-return investments when they save. A probit analysis of 14 743 household observations in the 2003-2004 Consumer Expenditure Survey reveals a significantly higher probability for consumption of tobacco by renters-a choice frequently associated with high time discounting due to negative long-term health effects. Each of these results is consistent with high time discounting by renters. Such discounting of future consequences can impede the transition to homeownership, which often requires delaying current consumption in exchange for future benefit.","Univ Georgia, Dept Consumer Econ & Housing, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"James, RN (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Dept Consumer Econ & Housing, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",rjames@uga.edu,,"James, Russell/0000-0002-1887-8183",,,,,14,7,8,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

This paper examines whether there was any evidence of a structural change in the terrorism data at or after February 1998 but prior to June 2001, controlling for the possibility of other breaks in earlier periods. In doing so, we use the standard Bai-Perron procedure and our sequential importance sampling (SIS) Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for identifying an unknown number of breaks at unknown dates.

We study the optimal settlement system design, and find that a trade-off arises endogenously within the model. A higher frequency of settlement and more costly intra-day borrowing policies limit the banks' accumulation of liabilities and promote conservative reserve management, hence limiting the risk of default should a bank fail for any reason. However, such policies also imply higher banking costs, less interest paid on deposits, and less capital allocated by banks to productive investments.

Our empirical findings are consistent with the following notions. First, both US and UK markets appear to overreact to the drastic events in the 1990s. Second, the impacts of the 1-week-ahead foreign market returns were marked during the 1980s, especially when the home market returns were both volatile and negative. In contrast, the impacts were insignificant during the 1990s. Third, in the 1990s, the UK (US) investors' behaviour during the bust appears to be consistent (inconsistent) with the leverage effects.","[Li, Ming-Yuan Leon] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Accountancy, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; [Li, Ming-Yuan Leon] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Grad Inst Finance & Banking, Tainan 70101, Taiwan",National Cheng Kung University; National Cheng Kung University,"Li, MYL (通讯作者)，Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Accountancy, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.",lmyleon@mail.ncku.edu.tw,"Li, Leon/H-9013-2016","Li, Leon/0000-0002-2865-6568",,,,,27,1,1,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

In contrast to prior studies focusing on examining the effects of arbitrage threshold on stock return means, this study not only analyse the dynamics of return means but also return volatilities. Moreover, this article adopts two representative ADR issuers: UK VOD and Brazil CVDO and compares the differences between them. The empirical findings of this study are consistent with the following notions. First, for both of the case of UK VOD and Brazil CVDO, once the price relationship of ADRs and UNDs deviates away from the long-run cointegrated equilibrium, the re-establishing equilibrium process is more/less remarkable when the price deviations do (do not) exceed a critical threshold. However, for the case of UK VOD (Brazil CVDO), the tendency to adjust to correct a disequilibrium situation mostly depends on the UND (ADR) markets. Furthermore, this article denotes the threshold estimate in the case of UK VOD (Brazil CVDO) as an unusual (extreme) condition. Last, the arbitrage behaviours between the ADR and UND markets will increase the volatility in these two markets and reduce the correlation between them.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Grad Inst Finance & Banking, Tainan 701, Taiwan",National Cheng Kung University,"Li, MYL (通讯作者)，Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Grad Inst Finance & Banking, 1 Ta Hsuch Rd, Tainan 701, Taiwan.",lmyleon@mail.ncku.edu.tw,"Li, Leon/H-9013-2016","Li, Leon/0000-0002-2865-6568",,,,,27,1,1,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

In both surveys respondents are asked to state their certainty of choice after each single choice set. We evaluate three different recoding-of-answers methods adapted from the Contingent Valuation literature. Furthermore, we evaluate two models which directly capture the effect of respondent uncertainty by parameterization of a scale function. In one model the scale parameter is a function of respondents' stated uncertainty level. In the other it is a function of respondent and choice set characteristics found to be significant determinants of stated uncertainty. All approaches are compared to a benchmark utility model. While some of the recoding approaches apparently reduce noise in the data, they generally have no significant effect on attribute Willingness-To-Pay (WTP) estimates, and standard errors on WTP estimates tend to increase. The explicit modelling of the scale parameter using stated uncertainty reveals that unobserved variation decreases as certainty of choice increases. While the model performance does not improve much, this approach offers a structurally and intuitively much more appealing way of accounting for uncertainty in choices in CE.","[Lundhede, Thomas Hedemark; Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl; Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark] Univ Copenhagen, Div Econ Policy & Management Planning, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Olsen, Soren Boye] Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Environm Econ & Rural Dev Div, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen,"Lundhede, TH (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Div Econ Policy & Management Planning, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",thlu@life.ku.dk; sobo@life.ku.dk; jbj@life.ku.dk; bjt@life.ku.dk,"Olsen, Søren B/M-2949-2014; Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark/K-8770-2014; Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl/C-9354-2015","Olsen, Søren B/0000-0002-1278-3749; Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark/0000-0002-3305-8343; Lundhede, Thomas/0000-0003-3226-8338; Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl/0000-0002-1313-6228",Ministry of Environment; Danish Research Councils,"Ministry of Environment(Ministry of Environment (ME), Republic of Korea); Danish Research Councils(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF))","We acknowledge the helpful comments of two anonymous reviewers on an earlier version of the paper, and we thank Riccardo Scarpa for suggesting the use of scale modelling.

In this paper we assume that regional integration at European level is the European countries' way to reach global competitiveness. We also try to emphasize that countries' competitiveness is based on technology, innovation, and the degree of globalization. At macroeconomic level, competitiveness can be seen as ability to efficiently use the resources, so in an extended view is the same thing with productivity. Competitiveness and productivity are based on the ability of a country to create and to use technology and knowledge. To measure these tendencies and facts, we use in this paper two aggregate indexes: Global Competitiveness Index and its components to measure competitiveness and KOF globalization index to measure the degree of openness of the studied countries.

Thus, nonwage contract issues should be recognized as another important vehicle for public employee unions to affect the budgets for their services.","Bradley Univ, Dept Econ, Peoria, IL 61625 USA",Bradley University,"O'Brien, KM (通讯作者)，Bradley Univ, Dept Econ, Peoria, IL 61625 USA.",KMO@BRADLEY.EDU,,,,,,,23,0,3,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The three policy scenarios involve allowance allocations that through 2050 are: (1) constant at present emissions levels, (2) linearly reduced to 50% below present, (3) linearly reduce emissions to 80% below present. The cumulative allowance allocations over the horizon of the policy are 287, 203 and 167 Gt of CO2 equivalent, respectively. We compare the results to previous analysis of these same policy scenarios to evaluate how the changed growth and technology prospects affect the results. We focus on 203 and 167 Gt scenarios because current proposals envision deep cuts in emissions from present. The 167 Gt scenario is closest to proposals currently being considered by Congress and supported by the US Administration however we do not attempt to model specific details of actual proposals. We test results to alternative assumptions about program coverage and banking behavior. Measured in terms of changes in economic welfare, the economic cost of 203 and 167 Gt cases is in the range of 2 to 3% by 2050, with CO2 prices between $48 and $67 in 2015 rising to between $190 and $266 by 2050. Implementation details matter: when an idealized economy-wide cap-and-trade is replaced by coverage omitting some sectors, or if the credibility of long-term target is weak (limiting banking behavior) prices and welfare costs change substantially.

I explore this possibility by using legal origin as a proxy for financial frictions that may hold back financial development. The empirical analysis yields two main results. First, legal origin-driven differences in financial frictions are an important determinant of social security; in particular, common law countries exhibit significantly smaller public pension programs. Second, two-stage estimates suggest that legal origin impacts on social security through financial market development.","Bank Italy, Res Dept, I-00184 Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Pinotti, P (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Res Dept, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",paolo.pinotti@bancaditalia.it,,,,,,,42,2,2,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

I find that imposing no law is socially optimal when individual actions have no significant externalities, while bans become socially optimal as the externalities increase. Prescriptions are generally the worst choice, except when the externalities involved are very high. However, in the political arena support is rarely won for non intervention or for a ban, since an alternative majority will generally be found in favor of some prescription. This remains true even when strategic voting is considered, and provides an argument for the idea that a liberal state cannot be liberally enforced by rational voters.","[Richiardi, Matteo G.] Univ Politecn Marche, Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University,"Richiardi, MG (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Ancona, Italy.",m.g.richiardi@univpm.it,,"Richiardi, Matteo/0000-0002-3749-7386",,,,,32,0,0,0,0,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We conducted a test of our hypotheses on how return policy and endowment effect influence purchasing tendency and return rate. This experiment proved that endowment effect did affect the returning behavior of consumers. It showed that lenient return policies significantly increased initial purchasing tendency but did not increase return rate. This suggests a potential to increase consumption by adopting lenient return policies.","Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Wang, XH (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, 59 Zhong Guan Cun Ave, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",shwang06g@gmail.com,,,,,,,26,10,10,1,18,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Even though the crisis was not a complete surprise for many economists, almost no one expected that the Swedish economy would be prospering with booming productivity growth only a few years later. Economists have presented three explanations for the fast recovery and productivity growth in 19952006: market reforms, crisis recovery, and the impact of ICT. This paper offers an alternative view, emphasizing instead firms' substantial investment in intangible assets such as R&D, design, and advertising. Based on the growth accounting framework, intangible capital accounted for more than 30 percent of the labor productivity growth in the Swedish business sector from 1995 to 2006. Thus, Swedish TFP growth, one of the highest among OECD countries, is reduced substantially when investment in intangibles is included in the growth accounting analysis.","[Edquist, Harald] Res Inst Ind Econ, Stockholm, Sweden",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Edquist, H (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Box 55665, SE-10215 Stockholm, Sweden.",Harald.Edquist@ifn.se,,"Edquist, Harald/0000-0001-8659-1494",,,,,39,21,21,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

MORE EVIDENCE FROM A BOOTSTRAP COVARIATE UNIT ROOT TEST,PACIFIC ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TIME-SERIES; EXCHANGE-RATES; GOOD SIZE; STATIONARITY; PERSISTENCE; INFLATION; SELECTION; PARITY,"This paper re-examines the empirical finding that international real interest rates usually have a unit root. This conclusion is put forth in Rapach and Weber (2004), using the Ng and Perron (2001) tests. We use Rudebusch's (1993) approach to construct the small sample distributions of the Ng and Perron tests, and calculate their asymptotic sizes, size-adjusted powers and rejection rates. These numbers show that the lack of power in the Ng and Perron tests might account for the findings of Rapach and Weber (2004): that the unit root null cannot be rejected for most OECD countries. Size distortions are mild in the case of Ng and Perron tests for two series, but are serious for the Phillips and Perron Z-test on inflation rates. We then apply a powerful covariate augmented DickeyFuller unit root test to examine the series for which stationarity cannot be determined with the Ng and Perron tests. The bootstrap technique is also used to control possible size distortions. In contrast to the results of Rapach and Weber (2004), the bootstrap covariate augmented DickeyFuller test yields striking evidence that real interest rates are stationary for 14 of 16 OECD countries, because nominal interest rates are stationary for the 14 countries, while inflation rates are stationary for all countries.","[Lee, Cheng-Feng] Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci, Dept Business Adm, Kaohsiung 80778, Taiwan; [Tsong, Ching-Chuan] Natl Chi Nan Univ, Puli, Taiwan",National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology; National Chi Nan University,"Lee, CF (通讯作者)，Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci, Dept Business Adm, 415 Jiangong Rd, Kaohsiung 80778, Taiwan.",jflee@cc.kuas.edu.tw,,,,,,,38,2,2,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

These results are analytically shown under a Maximin objective when the elasticity of participation is decreasing in the skill level and are numerically confirmed under a more general objective.

This twofold defense strategy has worked to perfection because almost everyone who has studied the crisis is convinced that it is the banks and not the hedge funds that were chiefly responsible for causing it. This article puts forward a different interpretation of events. Its central argument is that had it not been for the hedge funds' intermediary position between the investors seeking yield on the one hand and the banks that created the high yield bearing securities on the other the supply of these securities would never have reached the proportions that were critical in precipitating the near collapse of the whole financial system. Take away hedge funds and a general financial crisis could still have occurred in 2007-8, but it is only because of the hedge funds that the crisis that actually occurred initially took on the form of a subprime crisis. The policy implication of this analysis is that regulatory controls on hedge fund activities must be far tighter than those currently proposed.","London Metropolitan Business Sch, London, England",London Metropolitan University,"Lysandrou, P (通讯作者)，London Metropolitan Business Sch, London, England.",,,,,,,,24,25,25,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

As a small country, and member of the Ell and Eurozone, Slovenia provides an ideal setting for the study of the impact of the 2008 financial and economic crisis on the capital structures of SMEs: especially given the dominance of the banking sector, as the prime financing vehicle for companies. In this context we employ a novel power analysis estimation approach in the literature, employing Cohen's d and McGraw-Wong's common language (CL) effect size statistics. We analyzed the capital structures of Slovenian SMEs between 2006 and 2009. Our study shows that SMEs were unable to tap into soft budget constraints made available by the banking sector to large companies, and have been correspondingly harder hit by the crisis.","[Moerec, Barbara; Raskovic, Matevz] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Mörec, B (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",barbara.moerec@ef.uni-lj.si; matevz.raskovic@ef.uni-lj.si,"Raskovic, Matevz/AFV-3565-2022; Morec, Barbara/J-1820-2017","Raskovic, Matevz/0000-0001-5311-4050; Morec, Barbara/0000-0003-4764-8122",,,,,87,5,5,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We construct upper and lower bounds for the limit average vote that depend on the limit average taste. If the average taste is central enough, the range of possible values for the average voting outcome is narrower than the corresponding range for majority voting.

An allocation rule is consistent if for each problem in its domain of definition and each alternative that it chooses for it, then for the reduced problem obtained by imagining the departure of an arbitrary subgroup of the agents with their components of the alternative and reassessing the options open to the remaining agents, it chooses the restriction of the alternative to that subgroup. Converse consistency pertains to the opposite operation. It allows us to deduce that a rule chooses an alternative for a problem from the knowledge that for each two-agent subgroup, it chooses its restriction to the subgroup for the associated reduced problem this subgroup faces. We present two lemmas that have played a critical role in helping understand the implications of these properties in a great variety of models, the Elevator Lemma and the Bracing Lemma. We describe several applications. Finally, we illustrate the versatility of consistency and of its converse by means of a sample of characterizations based on them.","Univ Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",University of Rochester,"Thomson, W (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",wth2@troi.cc.rochester.edu,,"Thomson, William/0000-0002-8081-7816",,,,,66,55,58,0,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,1434-4750,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

The framework is based on the integration of Bowley's linear model of aggregate demand of product differentiation with Porter's Diamond model. It focuses on the number of containers handled, prices charged, and profits earned to analyze a variety of strategies that could be employed by container terminal operators to enhance their competitive position. The findings suggest that strategies to build complementary relationships and stimulate greater demand are more desirable than alternatives because they generate benefits that accrue to the entire container port cluster. Conversely, strategies that are intended to raise entry barriers, employ strategic pricing mechanisms, and/or involve collusion are found to lead to the formation of insular clusters and retard competitive advantage in the long-run.","[Cullinane, Kevin] Edinburgh Napier Univ, TRi, Edinburgh EH10 5DT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Yap, Wei Yim] Univ Antwerp, ITMMA, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Lam, Jasmine Siu Lee] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Div Infrastruct Syst & Maritime Studies, Singapore 639798, Singapore",Edinburgh Napier University; University of Antwerp; Nanyang Technological University,"Cullinane, K (通讯作者)，Edinburgh Napier Univ, TRi, Merchiston Campus, Edinburgh EH10 5DT, Midlothian, Scotland.",yapweiyim@gmail.com; sllam@ntu.edu.sg; k.cullinane@napier.ac.uk,"Lam, Jasmine Siu Lee/A-3757-2011","Lam, Jasmine Siu Lee/0000-0001-7920-2665; Cullinane, Kevin/0000-0002-4031-3453",,,,,82,10,11,1,21,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

However, what was not known is that an accumulation of small problems interacting with each other can be equally damaging. Using a new technique, a combination of Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Logit regression, this paper re-examines the causes of the Asian currency crisis in 1997-98. The results indicate that although weak fundamentals were at the root of the crisis, only self-fulfilling panic and herd behaviour can explain the severity of the crisis. Contrary to previous empirical research, our results indicate that the Asian crisis was caused by the accumulation of small fragilities rather than large deficiencies in the macroeconomic fundamentals. An important policy implication of such findings is the need for governments not to underestimate small problems, which, when they interact, can create chaos. Another novelty of this paper is the interpretation of the crisis in terms of the concepts of trigger and vulnerability, using an empirical model that captures the magnitude of the self-fulfilling panic and its contribution to capital reversal and eventually to the collapse of the currencies.","[Ait-Saadi, Ismail] Swinburne Univ Technol, Sch Business & Design, Sarawak, Malaysia; [Jusoh, Mansor] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Econ & Business, Bangi, Malaysia",Swinburne University of Technology; Swinburne University of Technology Sarawak; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Ait-Saadi, I (通讯作者)，Swinburne Univ Technol, Sch Business & Design, Sarawak Campus, Sarawak, Malaysia.",,,,,,,,38,1,1,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

Ex ante mismatch occurs when revelation of this information would have changed the student's choice of school. This necessary condition for mismatch provides the basis for a new test. The test is implemented using data from the Campus Life and Learning Project at Duke University. Evidence shows that Duke does possess private information that is a statistically significant predictor of students' post-enrollment academic performance. Further, this private information is shown to affect the subjective measures of students' satisfaction as well as their persistence in more difficult majors. We also propose strategies to evaluate more conclusively whether the presence of Duke private information has generated mismatch.","[Arcidiacono, Peter; Aucejo, Esteban M.] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Arcidiacono, Peter; Fang, Hanming] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Fang, Hanming] Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Spenner, Kenneth I.] Duke Univ, Dept Sociol, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Pennsylvania; Duke University,"Arcidiacono, P (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",psarcidi@econ.duke.edu; esteban.aucejo@duke.edu; hanming.fang@econ.upenn.edu; kspen@soc.duke.edu,,,,,,,40,30,40,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

The evolution dynamics of the value of European patents in pharmaceutical and electronics industries are examined. Estimation results indicate that pharmaceutical patents are endowed with higher initial returns, thus their owners tend to seek patent protection in more countries than electronics patent holders. However, pharmaceutical patents become obsolete at a much faster pace than electronics patents, and consequently they have lower renewal rates and shorter lives. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The study also examines the conditions surrounding the role of real estate as collateral for bank loans in the countries.

The appropriate means of introducing energy to production functions has been a source of debate for a number of years. However, while modellers often subject results to parametric sensitivy analysis regarding the values associated with elasticities of substitution between inputs, it is rarely the case that the structure of the production function is subjected to testing. However, the chosen structure reflects the modeller's view about elasticity between different inputs and will have implications for model results wherever there are changes in relative prices. We illustrate our argument by introducing a simple demand shock to a CGE model of the Scottish economy (targeted at the energy supply sector) under different assumptions regarding the structure of the KLEM production function and separability assumptions therein.

As a consequence, in the case of indirect investments, the role of corporate taxation in destination countries may change. This paper investigates the effects of corporate taxation on foreign investment decisions of German multinationals, taking explicitly into account that firms choose in a first stage the investment regime (direct vs. indirect).

It is argued that, while the choice (a) often necessitates strong mathematical assumptions, choice (b) may lead to only partial identification and may require using less familiar mathematical techniques. This is discussed in the context of the problem of defining a probability density: existence may fail in function spaces; even after imposing assumptions that ensure existence, the problem is not well posed. A density function may not exist for economic variables as a consequence of institutional rigidity such as an income supplement. The apparatus of generalized functions provides the general solution to identification and well-posedness of density, but at the cost of less sharp results and greater mathematical complexity.","[Zinde-Walsh, Victoria] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada",McGill University,"Zinde-Walsh, V (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada.",victoria.zinde-wash@mcgill.ca,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0008-4085,,,CAN J ECON,Can.

We study fishermen whose main, and often only, source of income stems from the use of fishing grounds with open access. The exploitation of a CPR involves a negative interpersonal and inter-temporal externality because individuals who exploit the CPR reduce the current and the future yield both for others and for themselves. Economic theory - which assumes the existence of general across-situational traits - thus predicts that fishermen who exhibit more cooperative and less impatient behavior in the laboratory should be less likely to exploit the CPR, which our findings confirm. We thus corroborate the economic theory and extend the scope of other-regarding preference theories to crucial economic decisions with lasting consequences for the people involved. In addition, we establish cooperativeness and impatience as two distinct traits related to resource conservation in the field and validate laboratory preference measures. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

If reputation is one-sided and bidders are patient, then the bidder without reputation does not challenge the other bidder often. Consequently, the bidder with reputation obtains most of the surplus, the other bidder and the seller get very little. If reputation is two-sided, then the bidders engage in a game akin to War of Attrition. The resulting payoff is very low for the bidders and very high for the seller. In any case, the Folk Theorem fails: collusion in the second price auctions is impossible. The predictions of the model are that prices in early auctions should reach levels that are higher than the value of the object, then declining towards the reserve price; a set of strong bidders emerges. A recent series of auctions of spectrum for UMTS services in Europe seems to be consistent with the predictions of the model.

Free allocation of permits will become an exception for the third phase (2013-2020) and most firms will have to buy all their permits on the market or via auctions. The ability of bidders to collude is a key concern about the design of the auction format. To counter collusion, the auction can be open to bidders without compliance obligations (speculators). This paper aims at studying experimentally speculation as a collusion-breaking device in two different auction mechanisms: the uniform-price sealed-bid auction and the ascending clock auction. Our results suggest that a uniform sealed-bid auction open to speculators should be chosen from a revenue maximization point of view. In this mechanism, compliance agents adopt an aggressive strategy toward speculators. This strategy significantly increases the seller's revenue, compared to the more collusive clock auction. In the latter, on the contrary, bidders accommodate speculators, letting them buy permits in the auction and buying their necessary permits on the secondary market. However, as opening the auction to speculators deteriorates efficiency, the regulator faces a trade-off between these two objectives.","[Mougeot, Michel; Naegelen, Florence] Univ Franche Comte, CRESE, F-25030 Besancon, France; [Pelloux, Benjamin; Rulliere, Jean-Louis] CNRS, GATE, F-69130 Ecully, France; [Pelloux, Benjamin; Rulliere, Jean-Louis] Univ Lyon, F-69130 Ecully, France; [Pelloux, Benjamin] Univ Amsterdam, CREED, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands",Universite de Franche-Comte; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; University of Amsterdam,"Mougeot, M (通讯作者)，Univ Franche Comte, CRESE, Ave Observ Besancon, F-25030 Besancon, France.",michel.mougeot@univ-fcomte.fr; florence.naegelen@univ-fcomte.fr; pel-loux@gate.cnrs.fr; rulliere@gate.cnrs.fr,,"mougeot, michel/0000-0003-1969-2353",,,,,22,9,9,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Travelers' preferences depend on their observable characteristics, on the endogenous amount of congestion anticipated, on their marginal utility (MU) of income and on some unobserved factors. Using a French household survey, we estimate the demand models to simulate different pricing mechanisms. We find that unobserved determinants of transportation demand are significant and are used to measure the anticipated time spent in traffic and the comfort of traveling: diverging from these expectations is felt as more discomfort than if no expectations were formed a priori. However, some of this discomfort is derived from travelers' marginal utility of income: the lost time in traffic is clearly unpleasant because of its opportunity cost. When the regulator and the transportation provider share common objectives, we show that a great welfare improvement can be achieved when implementing a homogenous pricing that accurately accounts for travelers VOT.

The first one assumes that the poverty line remains constant in real terms over time. The second perspective examines the case where the poverty line is equal to half the median of the income distribution but assumes that such a poverty line is determined exogenously. Finally we also propose a third type of decomposition of the change in poverty, one which is obtained when the poverty line is assumed to be endogenous. In addition, whatever the assumption made concerning the poverty line, we take both a relative and an absolute approach to inequality measurement when defining pro-poor growth. With a relative approach to pro-poor growth it is assumed that inequality does not to vary when all incomes are multiplied by a constant whereas, with an absolute approach to pro-poor growth, inequality is supposed not to vary when an equal sum is added to all incomes. The empirical illustration covers the period 1990-2006 in Israel and the analysis is based on the use of the FGT poverty index. It turns out that the assumptions made concerning the way the poverty line is defined and the choice between a relative and an absolute approach to pro-poor growth greatly affect the results. As a whole however growth was pro-rich in Israel during the 1990-2006 period.","[Silber, Jacques] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel",Bar Ilan University,"Silber, J (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel.",jsilber_2000@yahoo.com,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,3,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,SEP 9,2011,5.0,,,,,,,,201113,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2011-13,0.0,,,58,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,865BY,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298287000001,0

Earlier literature has examined residential energy consumption at the state level using annual or monthly data, focusing on the variation in price elasticities of demand across states or regions, but has failed to recognize or address two major issues. The first is that, when fitting dynamic panel models, the lagged consumption term in the right-hand side of the demand equation is endogenous. This has resulted in potentially inconsistent estimates of the long-run price elasticity of demand. The second is that energy price is likely mismeasured. To address these issues, we estimate a dynamic partial adjustment model using the Kiviet corrected Least Square Dummy Variables (LSDV) (1995) and the Blundell-Bond (1998) estimators. We find that the long-term elasticities produced by the Blundell-Bond system GMM methods are largest, and that from the bias-corrected LSDV are greater than that from the conventional LSDV. From an energy policy point of view, the results obtained using the Blundell-Bond estimator where we instrument for price imply that a carbon tax or other price-based policy may be effective in discouraging residential electricity consumption and hence curbing greenhouse gas emissions in an electricity system mainly based on coal and gas power plants.

We consider balanced-budget fiscal policies where authorities use distortionary taxes on labor and capital together with monetary policy using the nominal interest rate. First, as long as a symmetric equilibrium is considered, the steady state in an open economy is isomorphic to that of a closed economy. Second, sticky prices' allocations are almost indistinguishable from flexible prices allocations both in open and closed economies. Third, the open economy dimension delivers results that are qualitatively similar to those of a closed economy but with significant quantitative changes.

It revisits the theory of bank governance and suggests a multi-constituency approach that emphasizes the role of weak creditors. The empirical evidence suggests that, on average, banks with stronger risk officers, less independent boards, and executives with less variable remuneration incurred fewer losses. There is no evidence that institutional shareholders opposed aggressive risk-taking. The Financial Stability Board published Principles for Sound Compensation Practices in 2009, and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued principles for enhancing corporate governance in 1999, 2006, and 2010. The reports have in common that shareholders retain residual control and executive pay continues to be aligned with shareholder interests.

This paper argues that Bernanke is wrong and that standard macroeconomics has not recognized, and still does not recognize, the limits of science and of formal modeling when studying something as complex as the macro economy. This failure to recognize, and adequately convey to policy makers, the limits of our scientific understanding of the macro economy, has led standard macroeconomics to combine fundamental science and policy applications in ways that undermine both. This paper advocates a classical methodological approach, which Keynes followed as well, that strictly separates fundamental science from policy analysis. Policy does not directly follow from models; it follows from reasoned analysis which uses models, but which combines models with institutional knowledge, intuition, and common sense.","Middlebury Coll, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA",,"Colander, D (通讯作者)，Middlebury Coll, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA.",colander@middlebury.edu,,,,,,,13,11,11,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

We consider the optimal progressivity of earnings taxation and whether capital income should be taxed. We critically discuss the academic research on these topics and when and how the results can be used for policy recommendations. We argue that a result from basic research is relevant for policy only if 1) it is based on economic mechanisms that are empirically relevant and first order to the problem, 2) it is reasonably robust to changes in the modeling assumptions, and 3) the policy prescription is implementable (i.e, is socially acceptable and not too complex). We obtain three policy recommendations from basic research that satisfy these criteria reasonably well. First, very high earners should be subject to high and rising marginal tax rates on earnings. Second, low-income families should be encouraged to work with earnings subsidies, which should then be phased-out with high implicit marginal tax rates. Third, capital income should be taxed. We explain why the famous zero marginal tax rate result for the top earner in the Mirrlees model and the zero capital income tax rate results of Chamley and Judd, and Atkinson and Stiglitz are not policy relevant in our view.",OPTIMAL TAXATION; INCOME TAXATION; CAPITAL INCOME; COMMODITY TAXATION; ELASTICITY; INSURANCE; SYSTEM; LABOR,,"[Diamond, Peter] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Saez, Emmanuel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Diamond, P (通讯作者)，MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",pdiamond@mit.edu; saez@econ.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,62,211,243,2,48,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Government can set rules for economic processes and actors that are (1) too specific, (2) too broad, (3) that are arbitrary, or (4) that conflict with other rules it has set out to address other, related issues (possibly primarily noneconomic). Government failure is illustrated in the context of Intellectual Property Right (IPR) law as it relates to Anti-Trust law.","Univ Groningen, Sch Business & Econ, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Dolfsma, W (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Sch Business & Econ, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,51,13,16,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

We find that the lackluster labor market recovery can be traced in large part to weakness in aggregate demand; only a small part seems attributable to increases in labor market frictions. This continued labor market weakness has led to the highest level of long-term unemployment in the postwar period and a blurring of the distinction between unemployment and nonparticipation in the labor force. We show that flows from nonparticipation to unemployment are important for understanding recent changes in the duration distribution of unemployment. Simulations that account for these flows suggest that the labor market is unlikely to be subject to high levels of structural long-term unemployment after aggregate demand recovers.","[Elsby, Michael W.

We extend the traditional moral-hazard benchmark model with multi-tasking and linear incentive contracts by letting the principal choose the amount of monitoring allocated across tasks. In our model, more attention allocated to a task improves the task contractibility and consequently increases the effort provided by the agent. Our findings show that, even under symmetry, in the presence of increasing returns to scale in either production or monitoring the principal may optimally offer an unbalanced incentive contract while allocating different amounts of attention across tasks.

In particular, it challenges misuses of the doctrine of mutual gains from trade and instead argues that comparative advantage does not guarantee increases in benefits to both trading partners-especially when one partner seeks to distort the market mechanism in its favor. In the face of such mercantilist or protectionist practices, efforts to advance innovation, without retaining manufacturing jobs, will not ensure continued prosperity, as the number of jobs entailed in the invention process is small compared with the number of jobs associated with manufacturing an innovative product for mass consumption. These matters call for the urgent rethinking of trade policy by the United States and other developed nations, if they are to balance their imports and exports and ensure continued economic growth.

Vertical spillovers from foreign direct investment and the origin of investors,JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Spillovers; Foreign direct investment; Technology transfer; Backward linkages,DOMESTIC FIRMS; TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER; PANEL-DATA; PRODUCTIVITY; BENEFIT,"This study uses firm-level panel data from Romania to examine whether the origin of foreign investors affects the degree of vertical spillovers from FDI. Investors' origin may matter for spillovers to domestic producers supplying intermediate inputs in two ways. First, the share of intermediates sourced locally by multinationals is likely to increase with the distance between the host and the source economy. Second, the sourcing pattern is likely to be affected by preferential trade agreements. In this case, the Association Agreement between Romania and the European Union (EU) implies that inputs sourced from the EU are subject to a lower tariff than inputs sourced from the United States or Canada. This means that on average American investors may have a greater incentive than EU investors to source from Romania and hence present a greater potential for vertical spillovers. The empirical analysis produces evidence consistent with this hypothesis. The results show a positive association between the presence of American companies in downstream sectors and the productivity of Romanian firms in the supplying industries and no significant relationship in the case of European affiliates. The results also indicate that Romanian firms in sectors whose products are expensive to transport benefit more from downstream presence of American affiliates than Romanian firms in sectors with low shipping costs. No such pattern is found for European affiliates. (C) 2010 Elsevier By.

Preterm infants are more likely to be of low birth weight and face increased risk of health problems later in life, implying large long run societal costs. While some of the causes of low birth weight are known, the exact mechanisms leading to prematurity are not well understood. Results confirm that maternal exposure to plausibly exogenous weather events decreases gestational age and birth weight. The negative effects of exposure are particularly strong in the second and early third trimesters of pregnancy, which coincides with the period identified by medical studies as most susceptible to external negative influences.

Conditions in both countries clearly called for policy easing. The Federal Reserve maintained a minimum policy rate, soon started to communicate possible future easing, and in the fall launched QE2. In contrast, the Riksbank started a period of rapid tightening. I find the arguments against the Federal Reserve's easing and the arguments for the Riksbank's tightening unconvincing. Although the Swedish economy subsequently performed better than expected, probably an important reason was that the market implemented much easier financial conditions than were consistent with the Riksbank's policy rate path. Without the policy tightening, performance would have been even better. The U.S. economy meanwhile performed worse than expected because of factors other than monetary policy. Without the policy easing, performance would have been even worse. In short, the Riksbank did the wrong thing but was lucky, whereas the Federal Reserve did the right thing but was unlucky.","[Svensson, Lars E.

The method presented in this paper is an enhancement of self-organizing polynomial Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) with several specific improved features - coefficient rounding and thresholding schemes and semi-randomized selection approach to pruning. The experiments carried out include exchange rate prediction and hedging case study where the predictions were used for financial management decision simulation of a virtual company. The results indicate, that the method shows promising potential of self-organizing network methodology.

The results confirm a special long-run equilibrium relationship between Turkey/North Cyprus and Greece/South Cyprus. Thus, per capita tourist arrivals from Greece to South Cyprus and those from Turkey to North Cyprus are statistically significant with cost of living and per capita income variables.

Introducing several measures of uncertainty, we observe that after the reform of the housing distribution system, unemployment uncertainty negatively affects the housing tenure choices of high-income families, whereas educational expenditure uncertainty has a negative effect on the homeownership rates of low-income families. We also find that unemployment uncertainty negatively affects the housing choices of local families and that medical expenditure uncertainty has a negative effect on housing choice for migrant families. Finally, an increase in unemployment uncertainty decreases the homeownership rate among families in which the head of household did not experience the change in enterprise ownership.

We show what conditions on reciprocity are sufficient for a unique perfect equilibrium, in which contributions are decreasing. Under these conditions, selfish players have enough future benefits to induce subsequent contributions by reciprocal players, and this incentive diminishes as the end of the game approaches. The model explains the puzzling restart effect and is consistent with various other empirical findings. We also report the results of a series of experiments, using a probabilistic continuation design in which after each set of 10-period games, the group is restarted with low probability. We find specific support for the theory in our data, including that selfish players (identified exogenously) stop contributing earlier than reciprocal players, as directly implied by the model.

Most of the rents come from the European Union (EU) in clothing and textiles, while the USA and Canada offer few rents and charge significant tariffs to LDCs. We develop a dual economy labor market model that generates an income distribution and simulates the distributional effects of preferences. We find that the benefits of the preferences outweigh any adverse distributional effects. Relative inequality may increase with preferences in some cases, but absolute incomes increase in every case. We conclude that in the absence of multilateral liberalization, preferences are beneficial to some LDCs and expansion of preferences is desirable. In the event of multilateral liberalization, an import subsidy scheme that maintains the rents is the most desirable outcome.","[de Gorter, Harry] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Green, Alan] Lander Univ, Greenwood, SC 29649 USA",Cornell University,"de Gorter, H (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, 447 Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",agreen@lander.edu; hd15@cornell.edu,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

These results suggest that the level of firms' engagement in offshoring is more important for productivity than whether or not firms engage in offshoring.","[Ito, Banri] Senshu Univ, Tama Ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 2148580, Japan; [Tomiura, Eiichi] Yokohama Natl Univ, Hodogaya Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan; [Wakasugi, Ryuhei] Kyoto Univ, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan",Yokohama National University; Kyoto University,"Ito, B (通讯作者)，Senshu Univ, Tama Ku, 2-1-1 Higashimita, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 2148580, Japan.",ito-banri@isc.senshu-u.ac.jp; tomiura@ynu.ac.jp; wakasugi@kier.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Tomiura, Eichi/AAT-8223-2021; Tomiura, Eiichi/F-4658-2011","Ito, Banri/0000-0003-3912-9947; Tomiura, Eiichi/0000-0002-7409-6741; Wakasugi, Ryuhei/0000-0002-9767-1470","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [20330046, 21530212] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,32,11,14,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

In this context, we examine the relationship between trading activity, volatility and transaction cost for five most traded commodities in India. Results suggest that there exists a negative relationship between transaction cost and liquidity and a positive relationship between transaction cost and volatility. Further, the results of structural model support the results of VAR analysis. Therefore, if the government imposes CTT, it would lead to higher volatility and lower trading activity affecting market efficiency and liquidity.","[Sahoo, Pravakar] Univ Delhi, IEG, New Delhi, India; [Kumar, Rajiv] India Habitat Ctr, ICRIER, New Delhi, India",University of Delhi,"Sahoo, P (通讯作者)，Univ Delhi, IEG, New Delhi, India.",pravakar@iegindia.org,,,,,,,47,0,0,0,11,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

These differences also have previously unrecognized effects on the optimal level of effort by potential hate crime victims to avoid being victimized, thus affecting the efficiency of government policies that encourage or discourage such effort.

Given the higher power of these tests compared to the Zivot and Andrews (1992) and Lumsdaine and Papell (1997) tests, rejection of the null can be considered as genuine evidence of stationarity. The main findings of this paper are that eleven out of twenty-four commodity prices are found to be difference stationary implying that shocks to these commodities tend to be permanent in nature. The remaining thirteen prices are found to exhibit trend stationary behavior with either one or two structural breaks.

As a result, assessing the volatility of capital movements, and distinguishing between stable and transitory flows, is particularly important. This study looks at nine transition and six Latin American countries individually, modelling Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), portfolio and other inflows separately as functions of macroeconomic variables that include economic openness. Cointegration analysis shows that Latin American flows seem to experience more of a reduction in volatility due to increased openness, suggesting that this region enjoys more risk-sharing as a result of financial integration than do transition economies.","Canisius Coll, Dept Econ & Finance, Buffalo, NY 14208 USA",,"Hegerty, SW (通讯作者)，Canisius Coll, Dept Econ & Finance, Buffalo, NY 14208 USA.",hegertys@canisius.edu,"Hegerty, Scott/AAF-5659-2020","Hegerty, Scott William/0000-0002-0999-561X",,,,,4,7,7,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Observed instances of market entry, or product introduction, are viewed as outcomes of profit maximizing decisions based on comparison of market entry costs, expected future returns, and the value of managerial flexibility. The process is estimated using simulated maximum likelihood. The estimates suggest that, in the developing countries, the downward volatility of the returns is higher resulting in lower adoption rates, whereas the environment in the top four industrialized GMO adopting countries appears to be costlier but much more optimistic. Commercial success of GM soybean and maize in Argentina, Brazil, and the U.S. is explained mostly by a combination of high upward return volatility and moderate entry costs.

A potential firm-entrepreneur needs outside financing to start up one potentially productive project. This agent has some initial illiquid endowment and is assumed to choose the amount of collateral to secure the financial debt. The model shows that, in the case of a monopolistic moneylender, only the minimum part of the endowment is offered as collateral and so invested in the productive sector. This occurs despite the fact that the loan received and, as a consequence, the final product will be the lowest possible. With perfectly competitive banks, instead, it is shown that it is possible to reach the first-best outcome.","Univ Catania, Fac Econ, I-95100 Catania, Italy",University of Catania,"Reito, F (通讯作者)，Univ Catania, Fac Econ, Corso Italia 55, I-95100 Catania, Italy.",reito@unict.it,,,,,,,14,4,4,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

That month, the government promised that four or five years later it would compensate people for the fall in the value of their bank shares. We reason that the public believed that promise, that it understood that the public debt must jump, and further that the public anticipated that the government would finance that debt via an eventual monetary expansion.

It is shown that due to the 'Walters critique' effect, the country's adjustment paths are slow and cyclical if there is a significant backward-looking element in the inflation dynamics and the exchange rate is fixed. It is also shown that such cyclical adjustment paths are moderated if there is a high proportion of forward-looking price setters in the economy, so that when the Phillips curve becomes completely forward-looking cyclicality in adjustment paths disappears and the response of the real exchange rate becomes hump-shaped. In contrast, with an independent monetary policy, irrespective of the degree of inflation persistence, flexible exchange rate allows to escape severe cycles, which results in a smooth response of the real exchange rate.

Hume left his mark on the economic thought of the physiocrats, the classical economists, and the American Federalists. Adam Smith, who met Hume circa 1750, was his closest friend and interlocutor for some 25 years. Among modern economists, Hume's essays on money and trade have informed theorists of both Keynesian and Monetarist persuasions. In this essay, we begin by discussing Hume's monetary economics, and then spell out his theory of economic development, noting his qualified enthusiasm for the modern commercial system.

This paper reviews what we know and don't know about illiquidity and all its friends: market freezes, fire sales, contagion, and ultimately insolvencies and bailouts. It first explains why liquidity cannot easily be apprehended through a single statistic, and asks whether liquidity should be regulated given that a capital adequacy requirement is already in place. The paper then analyzes market breakdowns due to either adverse selection or shortages of financial muscle, and explains why such breakdowns are endogenous to balance sheet choices and to information acquisition. It then looks at what economics can contribute to the debate on systemic risk and its containment. Finally, the paper takes a macroeconomic perspective, discusses shortages of aggregate liquidity, and analyzes how market value accounting and capital adequacy should react to asset prices. It concludes with a topical form of liquidity provision, monetary bailouts and recapitalizations, and analyzes optimal combinations thereof; it stresses the need for macro-prudential policies.

Co-ownership of assets is widespread in many countries due to inheritance. Central and Eastern Europe offers an interesting natural experiment to assess the effects of this type of property rights imperfection because of the asset restitution process in the 1990s. In Bulgaria, where co-ownership is very prominent and land is strongly fragmented, the land reform and inheritance legislation allows identifying the impact of co-ownership by taking advantage of a discontinuity created by a minimum plot size law. We find that land in co-ownership is more likely to be used by less efficient farm organizations or to be left abandoned, and that it is related to significant welfare losses. The paper hence provides evidence of sub-optimal land allocation following a privatization that established formal but imperfect property rights.

We identify greater liberalization with increases competition as measured by reductions in industrial concentration and privatization with deceases in state equity-ownership in firms. With a new panel dataset of thirty-one Chinese provinces from 1998 through 2007, we examine the effects of reforms on prices and subscription levels of both of mobile and fixed line telecommunications operators within both the mobile and fixed line platforms. We find large gains in market performance from decreased concentration among mobile providers not for fixed-line service. The evidence on the effects of state-ownership is similarly mixed.

In this paper, we analyze how existing diasporas (the stock of people born in a country and living in another one) affect the size and human-capital structure of current bilateral migration flows. Our analysis exploits a bilateral data set on international migration by educational attainment from 195 countries to 30 OECD countries in 1990 and 2000. Based on simple micro-foundations and controlling for various determinants of migration, we found that diasporas increase migration flows and lower their average educational level. Interestingly, diasporas explain majority of the variability of migration flows and selection. This suggests that, without changing the generosity of family reunion programs, education-based selection rules are likely to have moderate impact. Our results are highly robust to the econometric techniques, accounting for the large proportion of zeros and endogeneity problems. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Each agent is described by a two-dimensional type that reflects his capacity requirement and his willingness to pay per unit of capacity. Types are private information. We first characterize implementable policies. Then we solve the revenue maximization problem for the special case where there is private information about per-unit values, but capacity needs are observable. After that we derive two sets of additional conditions on the joint distribution of values and weights under which the revenue maximizing policy for the case with observable weights is implementable, and thus optimal also for the case with two-dimensional private information. In particular, we investigate the role of concave continuation revenues for implementation. We also construct a simple policy for which per-unit prices vary with requested weight but not with time, and we prove that it is asymptotically revenue maximizing when available capacity and time to the deadline both go to infinity. This highlights the importance of nonlinear as opposed to dynamic pricing.","[Dizdar, Deniz; Moldovanu, Benny] Univ Bonn, Dept Econ, D-5300 Bonn, Germany; [Gershkov, Alex] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Econ, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",University of Bonn; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Dizdar, D (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Dept Econ, D-5300 Bonn, Germany.",ddizdar@uni-bonn.de; alexg@huji.ac.il; mold@uni-bonn.de,,,,,,,21,15,20,0,9,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

The conventional wisdom, the quantity theory of money, may not be adequate to capture the relationship between price changes and money supply growth, as the economic system evolves and people's income and wealth grow. An examination of China's GDP deflator and broad money supply relative to nominal GDP shows that the relationship between the two series is relatively weak. A further examination of China's monthly CPI series over the period 2001-2010 reveals that the autoregressive models are a better fit than the moving average models, which suggests that the role of CPI expectations has been significant and important. Because of the importance of inflation expectations in CPI movement, we believe the Central Bank's monetary policy that targets CPI inflation should emphasize the use of policy instruments that have direct and strong communication links with the public. Quantitative measures would have their own use, but their effectiveness would be unlikely to match that of interest rate measures, especially from a short-term perspective.","[He, Liping] Beijing Normal Univ, Dept Finance, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"He, LP (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Dept Finance, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",lphe@bnu.edu.cn; thegreatestpb@163.com,,,,,,,8,3,3,3,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAY-JUN,2011,19.0,3,,,,,18,32,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2011.01240.x,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,772IJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291227300002,0

The same is true if we replace the core by the core without majority dissatisfaction, obtained by deleting from the agenda all the alternatives that are non-maximal for all players in a winning coalition. Unlike the core, the core without majority dissatisfaction depends only on the players' sets of maximal elements and is included in the union of such sets.

(2005): this method allows impulse response functions to be generated for all the variables in the dataset and provides a description of the domestic and international transmission mechanisms of United States movements in the personal income tax rate. A distinguishing feature of our model is the disaggregation of traded goods sector where imports and exports are disaggregated into 12 and 13 industries, respectively.

We examine the role of information sharing in trade credit allocation using a sample of publicly traded firms in Thailand over the 1994-2005 period. Taking the establishment of a private credit bureau in 1999 as signalling improvement in information sharing among lenders, we obtain three main results in the improved information sharing period: (1) Thai firms have become less dependent on supplier credit; (2) financially constrained firms redistribute more funds via trade credit; and (3) the relationships between the use of trade credit and firm-specific factors such as liquidity, free cash flow, tangible assets, interest cost ratio, and firm size weaken as information sharing improves. Our results are consistent with the view that better information sharing facilitates credit allocation. Hence, policies aiming at facilitating information exchange among financial intermediaries should be supported. We also find support for the view that bank credit substitutes for trade credit. This substitution lowers firms' cost of capital, given that trade credit is assumed to be more costly than bank loans.","Georgia So Univ, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Southern University,"Zhang, RR (通讯作者)，Georgia So Univ, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA.",,,,,,,,26,8,8,1,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0818-9935,,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

To answer this question, the article departs from a critique of firm contract theory that usually focuses on moral personification to propose some theoretical foundations of the firm as a real entity. This provides crucial insights for the analysis of modern complex organizations. Then, this paper applies the real entity paradigm to the case of the network firm: is the network firm merely a collection of distinct legal entities or a single real entity? The integrating and unifying role of intra-network power relationships is emphasized, and some legal and economic aspects of the network firm are discussed to clarify the argument that the network firm is a singular real entity composed from distinct legal entities. Considering the network firm as a single real entity has strong policy implications in terms of employment protection rights and politico-legal responsibilities.","[Chassagnon, Virgile] Catholic Univ Lyon, ESDES Business Sch, Lyon, France; [Chassagnon, Virgile] Univ Lyon, LEFI, Lyon, France",,"Chassagnon, V (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Lyon, ESDES Business Sch, Lyon, France.",,,,,,,,103,18,18,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Such a role is robust to the inclusion of controls for the quality of institutions in a country. Further, our results imply a plausible link between stages of development and returns to different levels of education.

We use a partial equilibrium model-focusing on the demand side-at the HS6 level (covering 5,113 HS6 products). Two lists of sensitive products are constructed: focusing on the agricultural sectors and tariff revenue preservation. For the European Union (EU), EPAs must translate into 90% fully liberalised bilateral trade to be World Trade Organisation compatible. We use this criterion to simulate EPAs for each negotiating regional block. ACP exports to the EU are forecast to be 10% higher with EPAs, than under the generalised system of preference 'Everything But Arms' option. ACP countries, especially African ones, are forecast to lose an average of 71% of tariff revenues on EU imports in the long run. Imports from other regions of the world will continue to provide tariff revenues. Thus, if we compute tariff revenue losses on total ACP imports, losses are only 25% on average over the long run and as low as 19% if the product lists are optimised. The final impact depends on the importance of tariffs in government revenue and on potential compensatory effects. However, this long-term and less visible effect will depend mainly on the capacity of each ACP country to reorganise its fiscal base.","[Laborde, David] IFPRI, Washington, DC USA; [Fontagne, Lionel] Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Fontagne, Lionel; Mitaritonna, Cristina] CEPII, Paris, France",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Paris School of Economics,"Laborde, D (通讯作者)，IFPRI, Washington, DC USA.",d.laborde@cgiar.org,,,,,,,25,19,21,0,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Under such a threat of demand change, the supply does not reflect the current resource scarcity but it compensates the buyer for delaying the transition to the substitute. The analysis suggests a perspective on costs of oil dependence. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We emphasize the role of consumers' expectations formation. When expectations are not influenced by prices, the market may be shared but shares must be equal unless product qualities differ or one firm, possibly even the low-quality one, may capture the entire market. When expectations are influenced by prices, which would be the case when there is commitment, competition becomes more intense and the high-quality firm tends to capture a larger market share. Under strong network effects there is a continuum of equilibria and the higher the prices, the smaller the difference between those prices can be. Requiring continuity of expectations, however, delivers a unique equilibrium where one firm captures the entire market. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This paper will fill this gap and deal with the permanent migration choice made by rural migrants with the China General Social Survey (CGSS) data. Our results show that compared with their circular counterparts, permanent migrants tend to stay within the home provinces and are more likely to have stable jobs and earn high incomes and thus are more adapted to urban lives. We also find that more educated and more experienced migrants tend to be permanent urban residents, while the relationship of age and the probability of permanent migration is inverse U-shaped. Due to the restrictions of the current hukou system and the lack of rural land rental market, those people with more children and more land at home are more likely to migrate circularly rather than permanently.

This paper examines the implications of the Australian means tested age pension for incentives of individuals to save and work, for government financial commitments and for the welfare of individuals. To this end, we develop an overlapping generations model of the Australian economy that incorporates the essential features of the Australian pension, superannuation and taxation policy settings and use it to explore the implications of several hypothetical policy changes that relax the means test of the age pension.

A relatively lax environmental policy, whereby carbon emissions remain high, can be advantageous for such countries as it leaves them with a higher than otherwise scope for future emissions reductions through CDM and other offset projects. In this paper, the potential to affect the availability of future CDM projects is shown to distort environmental and energy policies of CDM host countries, in two ways. First, policies to reduce the use of fossil energy are weakened. This in turn weakens private sector incentives to switch to lower-carbon technology through CDM projects. CDM host governments then also find it attractive to subsidize this switch, in order to maximize the country's advantage from the CDM. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that fiscal policy in China has a significantly nonlinear effect. In years 1978-1980 and 1984-1997, the effect of government consumption on private consumption is non-Keynesian. During the same periods, the effect of taxes is also non-Keynesian, but the effect is not significant. The effect of government investment is linear but asymmetric. After retesting the reasons for the existence of nonlinear effects, we find that in China initial fiscal conditions and the magnitude of fiscal consolidations are not related to the nonlinear effects of fiscal policy.

Our estimation indicates that real GDP and resource use are cointegrated and there is only unidirectional long-run Granger causality running from resource use to real GDP, but not vice versa.

We construct non-collusive Markovian equilibria where the firms' decisions depend on the current capacity stock only. The firms maintain small reserve margins and high market prices, and extract large rents. In some equilibria, rationing occurs with positive probability, so the market mechanism does not ensure 'security of supply'. Usually, the price cap reflects the value of lost energy or lost load (VOLL) that consumers place on severely reducing consumption on short notice. Our analysis identifies a minimum price cap, unrelated to the VOLL, that allows the firms to recoup their investment and production costs in equilibrium. However, raising the price cap above this minimum increases market prices and reduces consumer surplus, without affecting the level of investment.","[Garcia, Alfredo] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Stacchetti, Ennio] NYU, New York, NY USA",University of Virginia; New York University,"Garcia, A (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",agarcia@virginia.edu; ennio@nyu.edu,,"Garcia, Alfredo/0000-0002-2761-7479",,,,,25,5,5,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

We first present the laissez-faire and the first best. Like Becker and Philipson (J. Polit. Econ. 106(3):551-573, 1998), we find that the laissez-faire level of effort is too high compared with the first best, because individuals do not internalize the impact of survival on the return of their savings. We also claim that because of its non-monetary form, effort is not contractible. That is why we modify our framework and assume, for the rest of the paper, that effort is determined by the individual while the social planner only allocates consumptions. It turns out that, under full information, a tax on the return of annuitized savings is desirable for both types. This tax is higher for the low-survival individual. Under asymmetric information, the low-survival individual still faces a tax while the high-survival individual might now face a positive or negative tax on annuities. Interestingly, our results depend on the value of life.","UCL, CORE, B-1348 Louvaine La Neuve, Belgium",,"Leroux, ML (通讯作者)，UCL, CORE, Voie Roman Pays 34, B-1348 Louvaine La Neuve, Belgium.",marie-louise.leroux@uclouvain.be,,,,,,,20,3,3,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

We derive both net and gross efficiency estimates, thereby demonstrating that differences in operating characteristics explain much of the difference in costs between Malaysian banks. We also decompose productivity change into efficiency, technical, and scale change using a generalized Malmquist productivity index. On average, Malaysian banks experience moderate scale economies and annual productivity change of 2.68%, with the latter driven primarily by Technical Change (TC), which has declined over time. Our gross efficiency estimates suggest that Islamic banking is associated with higher input requirements. However, our productivity estimates indicate that full-fledged Islamic banks have overcome some of these cost disadvantages with rapid TC, although this is not the case for conventional banks operating Islamic windows. Merged banks are found to have higher input usage and lower productivity change, suggesting that bank mergers have not contributed positively to bank performance. Finally, our results suggest that while the East Asian financial crisis had a short-term cost-reducing effect in 1998, the crisis triggered a long-lasting negative impact by increasing the volume of nonperforming loans.","[Saal, David S.] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Ctr Performance Measurement & Management, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England; [Abdul-Majid, Mariani] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Sch Econ, Fac Econ & Business, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Battisti, Giuliana] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Ind Econ Div, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England",Aston University; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; University of Nottingham,"Saal, DS (通讯作者)，Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Ctr Performance Measurement & Management, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England.",D.S.Saal@aston.ac.uk,"Abdul-Majid, Mariani/AAE-3801-2020","Abdul-Majid, Mariani/0000-0002-4730-332X; Saal, David/0000-0002-9542-9496",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F03895X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/F03895X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,89,35,36,0,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This literature always presumes that firms differ only by their productivity levels and have the same fixed cost. The two basic ideas in this paper are that both firms' productivity levels and fixed costs are heterogeneous. Moreover, exit of firms leads to a partial loss of knowledge which causes a further loss in productivity. Consequently, we show that exit of firms reduces the aggregate productivity growth both in the short and the long run. As a result, a decease in public subsidies which stimulates exit can be harmful for productivity growth.","[Asma, Raies] Univ Paris 01, FSEG SFAX, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Asma, Raies] Univ Paris 01, CED TEAM, F-75231 Paris 05, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Asma, R (通讯作者)，Rue Habib Thameur, Sahline 5012, Tunisia.",Asma.Raies@malix.univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,4,DE BOECK UNIVERSITE,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

Annual statements are frequently used as a data source, because they are considered to be one of the most important means of the company to communicate with various stakeholders. The document is signed by the management of the company, ensuring that the information in the statement is accurate, and because the statements are audited by an independent third party. The research was intended to solve the problem of the lack of information about the content of Lithuanian companies' annual statements from the perspective of corporate sustainability assessment. Thus, two studies were executed, first analysing annual statements of 15 companies, the second analysing the remaining annual statements of 23 companies, to build understanding of what information is available for further studies of business sustainability assessment. The studies encompassed 38 Lithuanian companies, listed in the Baltic main and secondary lists in Vilnius market in NASDAQ OMX, which constituted 100% of companies. As the studies were done in the beginning of 2010, annual statements for 2008 were used. The methods of the research were logical literature analysis, computer assisted quantitative content analysis, comparative analysis. The first part of the paper reviews the research of Lithuanian scientists in the field of sustainable development, and more specifically, various business and industry sectors. The literature review also includes various business sustainability evaluation models, focussing on the structure of the models, the quantity of companies analysed and the sources of data, used in the evaluations. In the second parts of the paper, the model of business sustainability evaluation is briefly described to create the basic structure for the research of annual statements of the companies. The third part describes the methodology of the research: what data was analysed, how it was analysed, the structure of the research. In the fourth part of the article, the results of the study are presented, explaining what information was most often found in the annual statements and how frequently it was found. Eventually, the findings are discussed from the perspective of whether the availability of information is satisfactory to execute corporate sustainability assessment. The model for business sustainability assessment, used in this study, is based on the idea, that companies have an impact on the environment. But it is not always possible to state in advance weather an impact is positive or negative, as it depends on a specific company case analysed. Thus, the model is created grouping the company impacts into positive, negative and situational. Positive impacts cover employee training, employing disabled, employing people with no work experience and elderly ones, workplace safety, family friendly workplace, lab or union existence, taxes paid, salaries paid, profit and donations to charity. Negative impacts cover pollution, product end-of-life pollution, discrimination, corruption, resource depletion, wasted materials, child lab or and fines paid to the government. Situational impacts cover product/service itself, and the delivery of this product or service to the society. The study showed, that the information, present in all the 39 annual statements, is the information about profit, paid taxes, paid salaries, and the product or service the company produces. 82% of the annual statements had the information about employee training, 79% had the information about the materials and resources used, 72% of statements had the information about donations to charities, 69% of statements had information about fines paid, and 67% of annual statements had the information about labour unions. Among the information, that was not found at all in the annual statements is child labour and employing inexperienced, with 0% occurrence, 5% (2 annual statements out of 39) had some information about employing the disabled and corruption. The terms renewable and unrenewable (Lithuanian equivalents) were found mentioned once each, showing, that the information about renewable resources cannot be found in the statements. From the sustainability perspective, this lack of information greatly limits the possibilities to include renewable resources, as one of the indicators, in business sustainability evaluation. The results show, that because of the lack of some information in the annual statements, either the business sustainability assessment model should be simplified and data, that is not available, should be removed or substituted, or other sources of information (such as corporate websites, press releases or interviews) should be employed to gather the data needed for the evaluation of corporate sustainability. The third possibility is executing empirical business sustainability evaluation studies explicitly stating the limitations-what necessary information was not available during the research.","[Bartkus, Edverdas Vaclovas] Kaunas Technol Univ, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Grunda, Rokas] Vilnius Univ, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology; Vilnius University,"Bartkus, EV (通讯作者)，Kaunas Technol Univ, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",edvardas.bartkus@ktu.lt; rokas.grunda@vukhf.lt,"Grunda, Rokas/C-1301-2011",,,,,,38,8,8,4,43,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The initial group of program participants was split randomly in a control group and a treatment group. The actual treatment (mainly being job related counseling) only takes place conditional on finding a job and not having been arrested for those selected in the treatment group. We use interval-censored proportional hazard models for job search and recidivism time, where the latter model incorporates the conditional treatment effect, depending on covariates. We find that the effect of the program depends on location and age. The ESEO program reduces the risk of recidivism only for ex-inmates over the age of 27 in San Diego and Chicago and over the age of 36 in Boston, but increases the risk of recidivism for the other ex-inmates in the treatment group.","[Bierens, Herman J.] Penn State Univ, Dept Econ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Carvalho, Jose R.] Univ Fed Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Universidade Federal do Ceara,"Bierens, HJ (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Dept Econ, 608 Kern Grad Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",hbierens@psu.edu; josecarv@ufc.br,,,,,,,39,6,10,1,37,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6108,1935-1682,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The choice of the objectives is even more non-subjective if the opinion of all stakeholders interested in the issue is involved by the use of the Ameliorated Nominal Group and Delphi Techniques.

This enables us to consider labor market rigidities, which are prevalent in Europe. We find that the elasticity of the wage-setting curve is particularly high for young workers. Moreover, natives and foreigners are imperfect substitutes. The wage and employment effects of immigration depend on the skill structure of the immigrant workforce. Because the foreign labor supply shift has mainly affected the high-skilled labor market segment, the 4 percent increase of the workforce through immigration has not increased either aggregate or foreign unemployment.","[Bruecker, Herbert] Inst Employment Res, DE-90478 Nurnberg, Germany; [Jahn, Elke J.] Aarhus Univ, DK-8230 Abyhoj, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Brücker, H (通讯作者)，Inst Employment Res, DE-90478 Nurnberg, Germany.",herbert.bruecker@iab.de; elja@asb.dk,,,,,,,53,56,60,0,26,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0347-0520,,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

There have been two such episodes since the Korean War. The first event peaked in 1974 and the second in 2008, 34 years apart. Both created major economic and political shocks, including fallen governments and human suffering due to high food prices. Each occurrence raised serious concerns over food and energy security and led to more government intervention in the commodity markets. Although there is no simple explanation for what causes such complex events, they do share similar characteristics. We find at the core of these cycles a set of contemporaneous supply and demand surprises that coincided with low inventories and that were magnified by macroeconomic shocks and policy responses. In the next few decades, the world faces the prospect of continued increases in the demand for commodities and greater uncertainty about supply. However, because market participants are likely to respond by increasing inventory holdings and investing in new technologies, we see no reason to expect an increase in the frequency of dramatic commodity booms and busts.","[Carter, Colin A.; Smith, Aaron] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Carter, Colin A.; Rausser, Gordon C.; Smith, Aaron] Univ Calif Davis, Giannini Fdn Agr Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Rausser, Gordon C.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Carter, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",cacarter@ucdavis.edu; rausser@berkeley.edu; adsmith@ucdavis.edu,,"Rausser, Gordon/0000-0002-0647-128X",,,,,134,78,88,1,52,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4703-1,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

The subsequent considerable appreciation of its currency and increasing labor cost has stimulated many Taiwanese firms to actively undertake outward foreign direct investment (FDI). The possibility of the industrial hollowing-out induced by the FDI has been a great concern in Taiwan. The purpose of this paper is to establish a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to investigate the impact of outward FDI by Taiwanese firms on its domestic economy. The efficiency wage theory is incorporated into the analytical framework. This paper first employs regression analysis to show that there exists severe wage rigidity in the labor market of Taiwan. Its simulation analysis then indicates that the outward FDI from Taiwan might reduce its income and employment to some extent. These results reveal that the outward FDI might hurt a distortion-ridden economy, which is consistent with the theoretical findings of Brecher and Choudhri (1987) and Basu (1998). However, it seems that the outward FDI could account for only a very small part of the recent increase in Taiwan's unemployment level.","Natl Chengchi Univ, Taipei 11623, Taiwan",National Chengchi University,"Chen, KM (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, 64 Sect 2,Zhi Nan Rd, Taipei 11623, Taiwan.",kchen@nccu.edu.tw,,,,,,,15,2,2,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The data support the role of the wage norm on the position of the perceived labour demand curve and the role of the tax rate on its slope.","[de Crombrugghe, Alain] Univ Namur, Dept Econ, B-5000 Namur, Belgium; [de Walque, Gregory] Natl Bank Belgium, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [de Walque, Gregory] Univ Namur, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium",University of Namur; European Central Bank; National Bank of Belgium; University of Namur,"de Crombrugghe, A (通讯作者)，Univ Namur, Dept Econ, Rempart Vierge 8, B-5000 Namur, Belgium.",alain.decrombrugghe@fundp.ac.be; gregory.dewalque@nbb.be,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0967-0750,,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

The main findings of the simulation of the scenarios are: 0 The presence of speculators leave long lasting effects which do not die out with the decrease in the number of speculators; it) In the presence of high speculations the intervention of the state can act as an anchor to the market helping to lower the prices; fit) The market forces have a more lasting effect than the state regulation mechanisms.","Romanian Acad, NIER, CMM, CEIS, Bucharest, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Dospinescu, AS (通讯作者)，Romanian Acad, NIER, CMM, CEIS, Bucharest, Romania.",andrei@ince.ro,,"Dospinescu, Andrei Silviu/0000-0002-1653-7190",,,,,27,1,1,0,7,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

These paradoxes can be traced, in part, to the impact of the truce that followed the Keynesian-Monetarist controversy on economists' ideas about policy activism. This implicit truce has removed activist macro policy from discussion, and shifted attention toward institutions as mechanisms for solving game-theoretic coordination problems. Policy activism then centers on how the agents (nations) can achieve optimal use of their available resources (or optimal access to resources) at the global level; and this involves creating and fine-tuning compacts - neoliberal mechanism designs that can capture rents and attract globally mobile capital. This approach leads economists to see the key problem in the current global crisis as fixing broken neoliberal mechanisms.

The typical Russian corporation is characterised by inseparability of ownership and management due to largely informal control of big insiders over enterprises.

Academics have appointed different causes as the possible sources of these biases. A negative correlation between timing and stock-picking abilities arises as a consequence of the biases in traditional timing models. This article provides evidence for one bias commonly found in traditional timing models, which is related with options. We focus on this bias in view of the scant attention it has so far received in the literature. We believe one possible cause for this bias is the failure to include the cost of the option implicit in timing activities in the timing models, and on this basis, we opt for a corrected version of the Merton and Henriksson model (1981). This study therefore is a pioneer in the assessment of the magnitude of this bias and in the measurement of the impact of its correction on fund managers' results. Our results confirm both the existence of the bias and the correction of the problem when the cost of the option is included in timing models. The modified version of the Merton and Henriksson model, unlike the traditional model, reports positive timing and stock-picking coefficients, supporting the good performance by managers.","[Ferruz, Luis; Munoz, Fernando; Vargas, Maria] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Finance & Accounting, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Vargas, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Dept Finance & Accounting, Gran Via 2, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain.",mvargas@unizar.es,"Ferruz, Luis/AAF-7886-2019; Muñoz Tenería, Fernando Alberto/HTP-8480-2023; Muñoz, Fernando/JGC-9950-2023; Muñoz, Fernando/KBC-0235-2024","Muñoz Tenería, Fernando Alberto/0000-0002-2338-3804; Muñoz, Fernando/0000-0002-9481-1466; Vargas Magallon, Maria Sagrario/0000-0002-8638-2665",,,,,22,0,0,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This article focuses on business demography of Italian firms, using an original database, obtained by matching and merging to gain the intersection of three firm level datasets. This database allows us to simultaneously consider the effect of size, technology, trade, FDIs and innovation on firms' survival probability. We show that size and technological level positively affect the likelihood of survival. Internationalized firms show higher failure risk: on average competition is stronger in international markets, forcing firms to be more efficient. However, large internationalized firms are more likely to 'survive'. An Italian internationalized firm to be successful and to survive, should be high-tech, large and innovative.","[Ricchiuti, Giorgio] Univ Florence, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Fac Econ, I-50127 Florence, Italy; [Giovannetti, Giorgia] Fdn Masi, I-50127 Florence, Italy; [Velucchi, Margherita] Univ Florence, Dipartimento Stat G Parenti, I-50134 Florence, Italy",University of Florence; University of Florence,"Ricchiuti, G (通讯作者)，Univ Florence, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Fac Econ, Via Pandette 9, I-50127 Florence, Italy.",giorgio.ricchiuti@unifi.it,"Ricchiuti, Giorgio/AHE-1031-2022","Ricchiuti, Giorgio/0000-0003-1309-3165; giovannetti, giorgia/0000-0001-6322-2696; VELUCCHI, Margherita/0000-0002-1841-0484",,,,,39,68,76,3,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

First, I apply the instrumental-variables approach developed by Gruber and Yelowitz (1999) to a different dataset, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979 (NLSY79), while at the same time examining an alternative instrument. The results turn out to differ depending on the instrument and, for one of the instruments, to be sensitive to assumptions needed to identify Medicaid's effects. Second, I make use of the SIPP data employed by Gruber and Yelowitz themselves, and examine the sensitivity of their conclusions to omitted factors that may be related to both Medicaid eligibility and to wealth accumulation. While more robust than the results using the NLSY79, the SIPP estimates are found to depend both on the sample used and on certain specification restrictions.

One composite goods firm competes with two components producers, each providing a complementary component of a differentiated composite good. Although the joint profits from a parallel alliance between the composite goods firm and a components producer are always larger than those from a complementary alliance between components producers, through Nash bargaining, a components producer prefers the complementary (parallel) alliance when the degree of product differentiation is sufficiently large (small).

We find that deficits have a significant but small effect on long-term rates, but that this result depends on the fiscal concept used.

The paper presents an overview of inflation targeting, reviews the justification for the regime and summarises some major critiques. Monetary policy responses to inflation depend on the source of inflationary pressures. Therefore, the determinants of inflation in African countries are investigated, using dynamic panel data, and the implications for inflation targeting are discussed. These issues are examined in greater detail for the two African countries which have formally adopted inflation targeting, South Africa and Ghana. The analysis is placed in the context of the global economic crisis. The paper concludes with a discussion of alternative approaches to monetary policies and the institutional constraints that would need to be addressed to allow central banks to play a stronger developmental role in Sub-Saharan African countries.","[Heintz, James] Univ Massachusetts, PERI, Amherst, MA 01002 USA; [Ndikumana, Leonce] African Dev Bank, Tunis, Tunisia",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; African Development Bank Group (AfDB),"Heintz, J (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, PERI, Amherst, MA 01002 USA.",jheintz@peri.umass.edu,,,,,,,46,17,18,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

We take recently developed panel unit-root tests, heterogeneous panel cointegration tests, and panel causality techniques and conclude that there is fairly strong evidence favoring the hypothesis of a long-run equilibrium relationship between real GDP and insurance markets' activities after allowing for the heterogeneous country effect. The results of the long-run panel regression parameter indicate a significantly positive relationship between real GDP and the activities within the insurance market, while a development from the non-life insurance market has a greater impact on real GDP than the activities in the life insurance market do.

This article investigates the effect of FDI on regional productivity in China. Specifically, we adopt a newly developed measure of total factor productivity (TFP) to deal with the endogenous inputs choice accompanied with various measures of FDI, enabling to provide robust estimates on the TFP effect of FDI. Moreover, we examine the role of absorptive ability on the FDI-TFP nexus and explore the existence of FDI spillover effect on productivity across regions. The potential difference in productivity effect of FDI between coastal and non-coastal regions is also examined. Based on the province-level panel dataset over the period 1997-2006, the various estimates show that the overall productivity effect of FDI is significantly positive, while this effect depends heavily on the host region's absorptive ability. Technological gap is found to associate with a significantly negative coefficient along with the finding that FDI tends to exhibit a higher impact on productivity in coastal regions than their non-coastal counterparts, highlighting a widening income inequality between coastal and non-coastal regions in China.","[Yang, Chih-Hai] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Econ, Jhongli, Taiwan; [Lin, Chun-Hung] Tamkang Univ, Dept Ind Econ, Tamsui, Taiwan; [Lee, Chia-Ming] Int Trade Informat Ctr, Taiwan External Trade Dev Council, Taipei, Taiwan",National Central University; Tamkang University,"Yang, CH (通讯作者)，Natl Cent Univ, Dept Econ, Jhongli, Taiwan.",chyang@mgt.ncu.edu.tw,,,,,,,50,11,12,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Several threads arc taken up with reference to comprehensive professional literature. The most important ones are: the vagueness of distinction between economic growth and economic development (and its influence on the way of understanding and measuring of economic growth), the role of time and space in economic growth theory, the types of language describing economic growth, distinguishing marks of economic growth theory, the separateness of economic growth theory and fluctuations theory, the frontiers of quantitative and qualitative economic growth analysis, the belonging of economics to the group of nomothetic or idiographic sciences, the significance of inductive and deductive methods in economic theory, the existence of economic laws. The main thread of the article is an attempt to justify that the frontiers of economic growth sources and mechanisms recognition are defined by different types of language that constitutes their identification, description and quantification. The vital conclusion derived from the article is the postulate of the unity of sciences, leading to the necessity of creating new systems theory which would be the metalanguage or metatheory of economics.","Poznan Univ Econ, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Malaga, K (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ, Poznan, Poland.",,,"Malaga, Krzyszof/0000-0001-7079-9880",,,,,123,8,8,0,23,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

Specifically, the major objective of this article is to examine whether there is a long-term relationship between retail store density and consumers' ability to transport and store goods; that is, the relative costs of performing distributive tasks, as suggested in previous studies relating to store density. The first conclusion from this article is that a cointegration relationship exists between store density for most types of retail businesses and proxies for consumers' ability to transport and store goods. Second, the estimation results of an error correction model reveal that the density of stores dealing in convenience goods exhibits a slow adjustment speed to recover the long-run equilibrium density level, while the density of stores selling shopping goods shows relatively fast adjustment.","[Matsui, Kenji] Yokohama Natl Univ, Fac Business Adm, Hodogaya Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan",Yokohama National University,"Matsui, K (通讯作者)，Yokohama Natl Univ, Fac Business Adm, Hodogaya Ku, 79-4 Tokiwadai, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan.",kmatsui@ynu.ac.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22730196] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,18,0,0,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

At the beginning of 1990s, the analyzed countries started to transform from centrally planned into market oriented economies and bank restructuring and privatisation has made huge strides during 1990s. We apply the New Empirical Industrial Organization approach, especially the Panzar-Rosse model to estimates the level of competition during the period 2000-2009. We estimate H statistic for a panel of banks, which represent almost 85% of the market in these countries. The paper also measures and compares the degree of banking competition in two sub-periods, 2000-2004 and 2005-2009, in order to investigate development of the competitive structure of the banking industry in countries. While the Czech banking market can be described as perfectly competitive during the period 2000-2004, the intensity of competition decreased in the second sub-period and the market can be characterized as one of monopolistic competition in 2005-2009. The monopolistic competition in the Czech banking market was also revealed in the full sample 2000-2009. The Poland's banking sector can be characterized as a monopolistic competition in the whole period as well as in the first sub-period. By contrast, we revealed a perfect competition in the second sub-period. In Slovakia, banks operated under a monopoly structure in the full sample as well as in the first sub-period; in the second sub-period the banking industry is characterized as a monopolistic competition.

We consider a model with oligopolistic sectors that are exposed to offshoring, as well as a unionised labour force that is entitled to unemployment benefits. We find that deeper economic integration induces wage moderation to the point that wages become independent of workers' outside options. Because the entire incidence of redistribution falls on net wages, the unions' willingness to moderate wages is constrained by the level of redistribution. Beyond an upper limit of redistribution, extending the welfare state compels unions to oppose wage moderation at the cost of losing jobs to offshoring. Below that upper limit, however, redistribution becomes less rather than more distortive.","[Rocha-Akis, Silvia] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, AT-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Schoeb, Ronnie] Free Univ Berlin, DE-14195 Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Rocha-Akis, S (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, AT-1090 Vienna, Austria.",silvia.rocha@wu.ac.at; ronnie.schoeb@fu-berlin.de,"Rocha-Akis, Silvia/JDN-4081-2023","Rocha-Akis, Silvia/0000-0002-7253-2781",,,,,40,0,0,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

It is shown that a simple formula can be used to calculate the long run marginal cost of production each period and that the firm breaks even if prices are set equal to long run marginal cost. Furthermore, the formula for calculating long run marginal cost can be interpreted as a formula for calculating forward looking cost (where the current cost of using assets is based on the current replacement cost of assets). However, through appropriate choice of the accounting depreciation rule, it can also be interpreted as a formula for calculating historic cost (where the current cost of using assets is based on the historic purchase cost of assets). In particular, the results derived in the simple benchmark model of this paper contradict the commonly expressed view that measures of forward looking cost are superior to measures of historic cost in environments with declining asset prices.",,,,,,,,,,,24,17,18,0,8,CONCEPT ECONOMICS,KINGSTON,"CANBERRA OFFICE, 27 JARDINE STREET, PO BOX 5430, KINGSTON, 00000, AUSTRALIA",1446-9022,,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

Fiscal discipline will require cuts in government expenditure, leading to trade-offs between different components of government expenditure. In this article, we explore the relationship between components of government expenditure and government size during the period 1970-2007 for a sample of 25 developed countries to shed light on how fiscal discipline might influence public spending composition in the coming years. Using the Pooled Mean Group estimation we find that fiscal adjustments protect functions that have both a social and productive character, such as education and health spending. In addition, the most productive spending, that related to transport and communications, is also isolated from budgetary cuts. This result shows evidence of governments reacting to the voter's increasing realization that reducing productive expenditures harms long-term economic growth by striking a balance between utility and economic-growth-enhancing expenditure.","[Sanz, Ismael] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Madrid 28032, Spain",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Sanz, I (通讯作者)，Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Campus Vicalvaro,Paseo Artilleros S-N, Madrid 28032, Spain.",Ismael.Sanz@urjc.es,"Sanz, Ismael/JHS-8016-2023","Sanz, Ismael/0000-0003-1286-4124",,,,,60,15,15,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Using Logit estimates we identify the most important determinants of the recent upturn, separately for women and for men. In contrast with findings for the United States, we find that changes in the industrial composition only play a small role. For women, we find that intra-sectoral developments have been important in spurring self-employment. In particular, it has become more common for women to be self-employed in the Trade and Culture sectors. The ageing of society (older people are more often self-employed) is an important cause of the observed increase. This effect is partly compensated by the negative effect of a higher educated labour force. The estimation results imply that both policies to foster self-employment and a socio-cultural trend have been important. We postulate that generic policy effects have been the most important cause of the increase in self-employment. The largest effects were seen just in the last few years of our sample (2004-2006), which appears to be inconsistent with the notion of a longer lasting socio-cultural trend.","[van Es, F.; van Vuuren, D.

The first part of this article focuses on a theoretical concept of corporate social responsibility. The authors analyze different definitions of corporate social responsibility, review chronological development of this concept and reveal similarities between different definitions. Positive and negative positions towards corporate social responsibility are presented and compared. The second part of this article reveals the theoretical concept of corporate image and the constituting factors. After discussing different definitions of corporate image, concluding remarks are made. The authors of this article discuss the topicality of corporate image management subsequently and name the factors that form corporate image, laying out the basis to manage particular factors. The first two parts of this paper provide a theoretical basis for further discussion. The third part of this article outlines insights for causality between corporate social responsibility and corporate image as well as links between the two. Concluding the reviewed literature and the newest empirical data, it is noted that corporate social responsibility has positive impact on corporate image. Positive impact can be seen through various phenomena: positive consumer attitude, positive word of mouth, etc. Theoretical studies lay the basis for creating a structural model of corporate social responsibility impact on corporate image, which presents the impact corporate social responsibility has on corporate image. In addition to previously discussed theoretical concepts, three factors forming corporate image (corporate marketing communications, corporate social responsibility and consumer demographic characteristics) are detailed. Structural model is based on LeBlanc (1995), van Riel, Balmer (1997) and Chattananon, Lawley (2007) models. Newly proposed structural model links earlier models into one single system. The new structural model is thoroughly examined using empirical research and the importance of each constituting factor is defined. The results of the empirical research reveals that corporate social responsibility has positive impact on corporate image though it is not the most important factor. Surprisingly none of demographic characteristics determines consumer attitude towards corporate image. The results of empirical research and literature studies allow to draw the conclusions and raise proposals.","[Virvilaite, Regina; Daubaraite, Ugne] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Virvilaite, R (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Laisves Av 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",regina.virvilaite@ktu.lt; ugne.daubaraite@gmail.com,"Daubaraitė Radikienė, Ugnė/JCD-8170-2023",,,,,,58,27,37,85,446,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Assuming this kind of environment, we study a class of differential games of pollution control with profit functions that are polynomial in the global pollution stock. Given an open-loop emissions strategy satisfying mild regularity conditions, an ambient transfer scheme is exhibited that induces it in Markov-perfect equilibrium (MPE). Proposed transfers are a polynomial function of the difference between actual and desired pollution levels; moreover, they are designed so that in MPE no tax or subsidy is ever levied. Their applicability under stochastic pollution dynamics is studied for a symmetric game of polluting oligopolists with linear demand. We discuss a quadratic scheme that induces agents to adopt Markovian emission strategies that are stationary and linearly decreasing in total pollution. Total expected ambient transfers are non-positive and their magnitude is linearly increasing in physical volatility, the size of the economy, and the absolute value of the slope of the inverse demand function. However, if the regulator is interested in inducing a constant emissions strategy then, in expectation, transfers vanish. The total expected ambient transfer is compared to its point-source equivalent. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, I show that the level of linguistic diversity determined by profit maximizing firms tends to be inefficiently low, except when and where the cost of producing a second linguistic version becomes sufficiently low. Thus, the model provides an efficiency argument supporting policies that protect the presence of minority languages in these markets. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We found that V-shaped triads are network motifs, while feedforward and feedback loop are anti-motifs. By defining roles in the subgraph according to structural equivalence, we also detected the significance profile of roles characterizing the industry sector. The taxonomy of industries obtained from the profiles is economically meaningful.

Seniority rules exist in several countries, but consequences of seniority rules on firms' employment behaviour have not been examined previously. The last-in-first-out principle in Sweden was reformed in January 2001 such that employers with ten or fewer employees were allowed to exempt two workers from the seniority rule. Using an employer-employee unbalanced panel data for the period 1996-2005, we find that both hires and separations increased in small firms relative to large firms by 5%. This also implies that there were no effects on firms' net employment.

Contrariwise, in non-profit sector research, little has been said so far about (intra-organizational) wage dispersion. Scattered findings from previous work indicate that wage dispersion is smaller in non-profit organizations (NPOs) as compared to for-profits (FPOs). Fairness perceptions and high moral ideals of workers within this sector are often cited as reasons for this assumption. Empirically, however, the reasons for inter-sectoral differences remain obscure. In our analysis, we concentrate on specific characteristics of NPOs as compared to FPOs. More specifically, this paper is to address the question if volunteer workers, donations and public subsidies influence the within-firm wage dispersion in NPOs. In order to answer this research question we use Austrian matched employer-employee data collected in 2006. We estimate an instrument variable regression and find that NPOs that employ volunteer workers and NPOs with a more even mix between paid and unpaid staff display smaller wage dispersion.

The mechanism is designed such that Pareto optimality is possible, in contrast to earlier models which make various assumptions such as majority voting. Individuals are taken seriously acknowledging that they are best equipped to find their own solutions. The emphasis is on the practical approach of how individuals discover and implement their subjective preferences and how this discovery and implementation process can be facilitated and corresponding costs lowered. Governmental units are subjected to some of the same market forces as business firms. This brings the interaction between governmental units closer to a market structure, and serves to eliminate or reduce many of the coercive elements of government.","[Hausken, Kjell] Univ Stavanger, Fac Social Sci, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway; [Knutsen, John F.] Knutsen & Didriksen AS, N-4022 Stavanger, Norway",Universitetet i Stavanger,"Hausken, K (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Fac Social Sci, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.",kjell.hausken@uis.no; john.knutsen@alum.mit.edu,,,,,,,53,0,0,0,7,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,NOV 4,2010,4.0,,,,,,,,201032,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2010-32,0.0,,,39,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,865BG,,gold,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298285100001,0

For this reason, forecasting it through a fundamentalist approach is a difficult task. An alternative is to use time series methodologies, with which the price's past behavior is conveniently analyzed, and used to predict future movements. In this paper, we investigate the usefulness of a nonlinear time series model, known as hidden Markov model (HMM), to predict future crude oil price movements. Using an HMM, we develop a forecasting methodology that consists of, basically, three steps. First, we employ wavelet analysis to remove high frequency price movements, which can be assumed as noise. Then, the HMM is used to forecast the probability distribution of the price return accumulated over the next F days. Finally, from this distribution, we infer future price trends. Our results indicate that the proposed methodology might be a useful decision support tool for agents participating in the crude oil market. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In practice, the daily price range constructed from the daily high and low also contains useful information on price volatility and is used frequently in technical analysis. The interaction between the daily high and low and the associated daily range has been examined in several recent studies on stock price and exchange rate forecasts. The present paper adopts a similar approach to analyze the behaviour of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price over a ten-year period. We find that daily highs and lows of the WTI oil price are cointegrated, with the error correction term being closely approximated by the daily price range. Two forecasting models, one based on a vector error correction mechanism and the other based on a transfer function framework with the range taken as a driver variable, are presented for forecasting the daily highs and lows. The results show that both of these models offer significant advantages over the naive random walk and univariate ARIMA models in terms of out-of-sample forecast accuracy. A trading strategy that makes use of the daily high and low forecasts is further developed. It is found that this strategy generally yields very reasonable trading returns over an evaluation period of about two years. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Kwok, Jerry T.

Second, we consider engagement in international transactions, either by means of exports, imports, or a combination of the two. We show that failing to control for importing activities may bias upward export premia.

In this paper we show that an augmented version of the Bank Lending Channel that allows for firm heterogeneity (but without any role for firms' balance sheets) reproduces well the dynamics of firm-level data. Our contribution is to show that it is not clear that the Bank Lending Channel should be rejected in favor of alternative theories on the basis of its inability to reproduce firm-level data.

The production of human capital requires expenditures and time inputs; the relative importance of these inputs determines the predictions of the theory for inequality both within and across countries. We discipline our quantitative assessment with a calibration firmly grounded on US micro evidence. Since in our calibrated model economy human capital production requires a significant amount of expenditures, TFP changes affect disproportionately the benefits and costs of human capital accumulation. Our main finding is that human capital accumulation strongly amplifies TFP differences across countries: to explain a 20-fold difference in the output per worker, the model requires a 5-fold difference in the TFP of the tradable sector, vs. an 18-fold difference if human capital is fixed across countries.","[Erosa, Andres] Madrid Inst Adv Studies IMDEA, Madrid, Spain; [Koreshkova, Tatyana] Concordia Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Restuccia, Diego] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",Concordia University - Canada; University of Toronto,"Erosa, A (通讯作者)，Madrid Inst Adv Studies IMDEA, Madrid, Spain.",,"Erosa, Andrés/H-8516-2015","Erosa, Andrés/0000-0002-1594-4421; Restuccia, Diego/0000-0002-4072-8712",,,,,30,90,121,1,58,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

With the richest set of income controls, income-weighted elasticity estimates range from 0.19 to 0.33, depending on whether responses are measured over one- or three-year intervals. An alternative approach designed to capture delayed and anticipatory responses yields much larger estimates ranging from 0.43 over the short term and from 0.78 to 1.46 over the longer term. A continuing obstacle to identification encountered here is that the income controls most likely to control for mean reversion and divergence within the income distribution are also the most likely to absorb independent variation in tax rates, also needed for identification.","Univ Nebraska, Dept Econ, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Giertz, SH (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Dept Econ, CBA 368,POB 880489, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",sgiertz2@unl.edu,,,,,,,39,17,18,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

The bonus is essentially a decreasing function of average days away from work, excluding claims longer than 15 months. In response, duration is predicted to decrease for claims with moderate injuries and increase for some severe claims so that claimants will miss more than 15 months of work and be excluded from the calculation. I show that contractors increased duration for severe claims but find no evidence that contractors successfully reduced duration for moderate claims. However, contractors received large bonus payments. This is likely because the financial reward to merely excluding a small share of severe claims from the calculation of the bonus payment is large enough to enable TCMs to receive the full bonus. These contractor responses are inconsistent with state intentions, suggesting public entities should anticipate strategic behavior when crafting performance-based incentives. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In a standard overlapping generation model where parental altruism results in transfers that children allocate to consumption and education, the Nash-Cournot equilibrium results in suboptimal levels of parental transfers and does not maximize the average level of utility of currently living agents. A ban on child labor decreases children's income and generates an increase in parental transfers bringing their levels closer to the optimum, raising children's welfare as well as average welfare in the short run and in the long run. Moreover, the inability to work allows children to allocate more time to education, and it leads to an increase in human capital. Besides, to increase transfers, parents decrease savings and hence physical capital accumulation. When prices are flexible, these effects diminish the positive welfare impact of the ban on child labor.

Evidence from modelling OECD aggregate energy demand,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Energy demand; OECD; Asymmetric price responses; Underlying energy demand trend,SAVING TECHNICAL CHANGE; TRANSPORT OIL DEMAND; ECONOMIC-ACTIVITY; CONSUMPTION; INCOME; UK; REVERSIBILITY; SEASONALITY,"A number of energy demand studies have considered the importance of modelling Asymmetric Price Responses (APR), for example, the often-cited work of Gately and Huntington (2002). Griffin and Schulman (2005) questioned the asymmetric approach arguing that this is only capturing energy saving technical progress. Huntington (2006). however, showed that for whole economy aggregate energy and oil demand there is a role statistically for both APR and exogenous energy saving technical change. In a separate strand of the literature the idea of the Underlying Energy Demand Trend (UEDT) has been developed, see for example Hunt et al. (2003a and 2003b) and Dimitropoulos et al. (2005). They argue that it is important, in time series energy demand models, to allow for stochastic trends (or UEDTs) based upon the structural time series/dynamic regression methodology recommended by Harvey (1989, 1997). This paper attempts to bring these strands of the literature together by proposing a testing procedure for the UEDT and APR in energy demand models within both a panel context (consistent with the Huntington. 2006 approach) and the structural time series modelling framework. A set of tests across a range of specifications using time-series and panel data are therefore suggested in order to try and ascertain whether energy saving technical change (or the more general UEDT) and APR are substitutes for each other when modelling energy demand or whether they are actually picking up different influences and are therefore complements. Using annual whole economy data for 17 OECD countries over the period 1960-2006 the results suggest that for most of the countries the UEDT is preferred to APR, whereas for another group the UEDT and APR are complements, and for another group they are substitutes. It is argued therefore that energy demand modellers should not assume at the outset that one method is superior to the other. Moreover, wherever possible, a general model (be it in a time series or panel context) that includes a 'non linear UEDT and APR should be initially estimated, and only if accepted by the data should symmetry and/or a more restrictive UEDT be imposed.

Full compensation for regulatory takings can, however, lead to over-investment and excessive entry in risky industries. An alternative is to 'carve-out' apparently efficient regulation from compensation requirements. We design a carve-out/compensation rule that induces efficient regulation and firm-level investment even when the regulator suffers fiscal illusion and has private information about the social benefit from regulation.

Institutional flexibility and economic growth This paper develops a formal model to investigate the relationship between institutional quality - the current set of property rights - and institutional flexibility - the ability to develop new institutions - and relate these aspects of institutional structure to dynamic economic performance. The model is used to analyze two types of institutional reform. An increase in institutional quality lowers market transaction costs, producing an immediate but short lived increase in the rate of economic growth. In contrast, an increase in institutional flexibility results in a delayed but permanent increase in economic growth. The analysis suggests that the current work on institutions places too much emphasis on property rights and too little on the determinants of institutional change.

On the basis of the Merz (1995) macroeconomic model with labor market frictions and capital accumulation, our paper offers an extension to frictions in capital markets, analogously modeled as a search and matching process. Using the Merz model as limit case, we consider exogenous as well as endogenous borrowing constraints. We also allow the cost of issuing bonds to change endogenously. As we show, capital market frictions exacerbate and accentuate the interaction between the two markets and magnify the effects of shocks on output, consumption, employment, and welfare. This interaction of the frictions in labor and capital markets are also shown to give rise to multiple equilibria. On the basis of numerical solution techniques, instead of relying on first or second order approximations around a (unique) steady state, our paper uses dynamic programming techniques to compute decision variables and the value function directly and assess the local and global dynamics of the model. The steady state solutions are studied by using the Hamiltonian and the dynamics are assessed for various model variants by using dynamic programming techniques. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Much of this is inspired by the WTO and regional trade agreements. However, an increasing number of papers focus on the impacts of unilateral services sector liberalization. The literature touches on important linkages between trade and FDI in services and the general pattern of productivity growth and economic development. This paper surveys the literature on services trade, focusing on contributions that investigate the determinants of international trade and investment in services, the potential gains from greater trade, and efforts to cooperate to achieve such liberalization through trade agreements. There is increasing evidence that services liberalization is a major potential source of gains in economic performance, including productivity in manufacturing and the coordination of activities both between and within firms. The performance of service sectors, and thus services policies, may also be an important determinant of trade volumes, the distributional effects of trade, and overall patterns of economic growth and development. At the same time, services trade is also a source of increasing political unease about the impacts of globalization on labor markets, linked to worries about offshoring and the potential pressure this places on wages in high income countries.","[Francois, Joseph] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Linz, Austria; [Hoekman, Bernard] World Bank, Washington, DC USA",Johannes Kepler University Linz; The World Bank,"Francois, J (通讯作者)，Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Linz, Austria.",,"Francois, Joseph/B-6108-2017","Francois, Joseph/0000-0002-4686-7780",,,,,224,271,292,6,127,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

Globalization can take two forms: international integration of commodity markets (i.e., free trade) and international integration of factor markets (i.e., offshoring). In a two-country, two-good, two-factor model we show that free trade and offshoring have opposite effects on rich-country workers. Free trade hurts rich-country workers, while reducing the volatility of their wages; by contrast, offshoring benefits them, while raising the volatility of their wages.

In the domestic sector, this could, for example, be achieved by improving space heating efficiency and thus decreasing heating expenditure. However, in order to efficiently design and implement such policy measures, a better understanding of the determinants affecting heating expenditure is needed. In this paper we examine the following determinants: socio-economic factors, building characteristics, heating technologies and weather conditions. In contrast to most other studies we use panel data to investigate household demand for heating in Great Britain. Our data sample is the result of an annual set of interviews with more than 5000 households, starting in 1991 and ending in 2005. The sample represents a total of 64,000 observations over the fifteen-year period. Our aim is to derive price and income elasticities both for Britain as a whole and for different types of household. Our results suggest that differences exist between owner-occupied and renter households. These households react differently to changes in income and prices. Our results also imply that a number of socio-economic criteria have a significant influence on heating expenditure, independently of the fuel used for heating. Understanding the impacts of different factors on heating expenditure and impact differences between types of household is helpful in designing target-oriented policy measures. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It explains why some goods (e.g. airline tickets) are sold cheap to early buyers, while others (e.g. theatre tickets) offer discounts to those who buy late. We derive the profit maximising selling strategy for a monopolist when aggregate demand is certain but buyers face uncertainty about their individual demands. When aggregate demand exceeds capacity, both Advance Purchase Discounts as well as Clearance Sales might be optimal. We determine how the comparison of these price discrimination strategies depends on the rationing rule, capacity costs and the availability of temporal capacity limits, price commitment and resale.","[Moeller, Marc; Watanabe, Makoto] Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Möller, M (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",,"Möller, Marc/H-8354-2017","Moller, Marc/0000-0001-5893-2335",,,,,27,48,59,1,43,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0133,,,ECON J,Econ.

It proposes and applies a method of evaluating the nature and size of the inequality bias of price movements. In the process, the study introduces a new demographic demand model that yields sensible and statistically significant estimates of the general equivalence scale and the size economies of scale. The study finds that relative price movements in Australia during the 1990s had an inequality increasing bias and that this bias increased in the late 1990s and the first part of the new millennium. The disaggregated analysis of the inequality movements shows that the regressive nature of relative price changes affected the renters much more than non-renters. The study also provides evidence on the decomposition of overall inequality between demographic groups and compares the decomposition between the nominal and real expenditure inequalities.","[Nicholas, Aaron; Ray, Ranjan; Valenzuela, Ma.

The Bretton Woods agreement in particular seems to have weakened the Feldstein-Horioka puzzle by significantly improving international capital mobility.

Using data from the Current Population Survey, we employ a difference-in-differences strategy to compare the labor market behavior of older veterans and non-veterans before and after the VA health benefits expansion to test the impact of public health insurance on labor supply. We find that older workers are significantly more likely to decrease work both on the extensive and intensive margins after receiving access to non-employer based insurance. Workers with some college education or a college degree are more likely to transition into self-employment, a result consistent with job-lock effects. However, less-educated workers are more likely to leave self-employment, a result suggesting that the positive income effect from receiving public insurance dominates the job-lock effect for these workers. Some relatively disadvantaged sub-populations may also increase their labor supply after gaining greater access to public insurance, consistent with complementary positive health effects of health care access or decreased work disincentives for these groups. We conclude that this reform has affected employment and retirement decisions, and suggest that future moves toward universal coverage or expansions of Medicare are likely to have significant labor market effects.

The results presented in this paper, though, show that this is mainly caused by a subset of high arbitrage risk stocks. In fact, the abnormal return difference between the quintiles of stocks with highest and lowest idiosyncratic risk is in the range of 2.99-4.90% over a 20-day interval. These results are robust even in the context of a joint generalized least squares approach. By developing a simple zero-investment arbitrage trading strategy mimicking insider trades, it turns out that such a trading strategy, in most cases, generates significant positive returns as long as transaction costs are neglected. However, the outperformance disappears in all risk quintiles, if bid/ask spreads are taken into account. We conclude that the market's under-reaction to reported insider trades can mainly be explained by the cost of risky arbitrage and is therefore not exploitable.","[Kaserer, Christoph] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Financial Management & Capital Markets, D-80290 Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Kaserer, C (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Dept Financial Management & Capital Markets, Arcisstr 21, D-80290 Munich, Germany.",christoph.kaserer@wi.tum.de,,,,,,,48,2,2,0,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1465-6485,,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

One consequence of this has been an increase in the extent to which fluctuations in international commodity prices are passed from exporters to domestic traders, and to producers. This paper presents unique data on farmer perceptions of coffee price risk in Uganda's post-liberalised market. Perceived price risk is found to be substantial, as expected. Less expectedly, perceived price risk is found to vary quite substantially across households. An analysis of this variance suggests that differences in coffee prices received in past seasons and the salience of particular prices explain a significant portion of this variation.

We provide a belief-based formulation of money illusion which accounts for the systematic mistakes in evaluating real and nominal quantities. The impact of money illusion on security prices and their dynamics is demonstrated to be considerable even though its welfare cost on investors is small in typical environments. A money-illusioned investor's real consumption is shown to generally depend on the price level, and specifically to decrease in the price level. A general-equilibrium analysis in the presence of money illusion generates implications that are consistent with several empirical regularities. In particular, the real bond yields and dividend price ratios are positively related to expected inflation, the real short rate is negatively correlated with realized inflation, and money illusion may induce predictability and excess volatility in stock returns. The basic analysis is generalized to incorporate heterogeneous investors with differing degrees of illusion.","[Basak, Suleyman] London Business Sch, London, England; [Yan, Hongjun] Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",University of London; London Business School; Yale University,"Basak, S (通讯作者)，London Business Sch, London, England.",,"Basak, Suleyman/E-5104-2013","Basak, Suleyman/0000-0002-4646-9600",,,,,45,24,25,1,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Economic conditions play an important part in explaining both the stock of disability benefit claimants and inflows to and outflows from that stock. Employing a variety of cross-country and country-specific household panel data sets, as well as administrative data, we find strong evidence that local variations in unemployment have an important explanatory role for disability benefit receipt, with higher total enrolments, lower outflows from rolls and, often, higher inflows into disability rolls in regions and periods of above-average unemployment. In understanding the nature of the cyclical fluctuations and trends in disability it is important to distinguish between work disability and health disability. The former is likely to be influenced by economic conditions and welfare programmes while the latter evolves in a slower fashion with medical technology and demographic changes. There is little evidence of health disability being related to the business cycle, so cyclical variations are driven by work disability. The rise in unemployment due to the current global economic crisis is expected to increase the number of disability insurance claimants.","[Benitez-Silva, Hugo] SUNY Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11790 USA; Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; University of Nottingham; Barcelona School of Economics; Pompeu Fabra University,"Benítez-Silva, H (通讯作者)，SUNY Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11790 USA.",,"Benitez-Silva, Hugo/K-9540-2014; Jimenez-Martin, Sergi/D-6744-2013","Jimenez-Martin, Sergi/0000-0002-7393-9612",,,,,79,27,28,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

However, studies also suggest that aid may be more effective in relatively democratic developing countries. By exploring data on income quintiles derived from the World Income Inequality Database for 88 developing countries, a set of results indicate that foreign aid and democracy in conjunction are associated with a higher share of income held by the upper quintile. It thus appears that foreign aid, contrary to popular beliefs, leads to a more skewed income distribution in democratic developing countries while the effects are negligible in autocratic countries.

We generalize previous work by assuming firms have different productivities. Equilibrium implies more productive firms always offer more desirable contracts. Thus workers never quit from more productive firms for less productive firms. Nevertheless turnover is inefficient as employees with long tenures at low productivity firms may reject outside job offers from more productive firms. A worker who quits to a more productive firm may accept a wage cut. Such wage cuts are compensated by faster promotion rates to higher wage levels in the future. We also generalize previous arguments by showing equilibria exist where the distribution of offers contains interior mass points and find equilibrium wage/tenure contracts need not be smooth.

Rather, it must be emphasised that ratings were downgraded in most countries very shortly before the end of the crisis. In some countries, the ratings were even further downgraded after the end of the crisis as countries started to recover.

In our model, demand is inelastic and the ISO allocates production to minimize the system costs while considering the transmission constraints. In a departure from received literature, the model incorporates explicit description of the network details. The analysis shows that losses along transmission lines render the market imperfectly competitive. Indeed, competition among generators is qualitatively similar to the interaction among firms in a monopolistic competition setting. A lower bound for market prices is derived and it is shown that the costumers' cost of oligopolistic pricing is strictly positive.

The provision of piped water in Brazil is highly correlated with other observable and unobservable determinants of IMR the latter leading to an important source of bias. Instruments for piped water provision are not readily available, and fixed effects to control for time-invariant correlated unobservables are invalid in the simple quantile regression framework. Using the quantile panel data procedure in Chen and Khan [Chen, S., Khan, S., Semiparametric estimation of non-stationary censored panel model data models with time-varying factor. Econometric Theory 2007; forthcoming], our estimates indicate that the provision of piped water reduces infant mortality by significantly more at the higher conditional quantiles of the IMR distribution than at the lower conditional quantiles (except for cases of extreme underdevelopment). These results imply that targeting piped water intervention toward areas in the upper quantiles of the conditional IMR distribution, when accompanied by other basic public health inputs, can achieve significantly greater reductions in infant mortality.

Since the early 1990s, a considerable number of empirical studies have been conducted on the EKC and, although there is no conclusive proof, it has been recognized that the EKC emerges as an empirical regularity. However, some recent studies cast doubt on the concept and methodology of empirical results, and evidence of the existence of the EKC has been questioned. In fact, how economic growth affects the environmental quality (i.e. the shape of the EKC) is still controversial. In order to identify the actual relationship between the environmental quality and economic growth, it is essential to develop economic models from various points of view.

The objective of this paper is to establish if there is synchronisation between developed and developing countries with the world cycle. Research results show that business cycles have become less volatile after globalisation, but there is not much consensus on whether business cycles have become less or more synchronised since globalisation. Little research has been done on co-movement between emerging markets, such as South Africa, and the world business cycle. This paper derives common factors for developed and developing countries by applying principal component analysis (PCA) to output, consumption and investment data, which represents the countries' business cycles. The empirical analysis shows co-movement between some countries and the world business cycle (G7 countries as proxy). The results suggest that there are idiosyncratic and globally common shocks, which play different roles over time in different countries. The paper goes on to suggest that there are clear differences in how developed and emerging markets co-move with the world business cycle. A key finding is that the co-movement between developing economies and the world business cycle has increased since globalisation. This research also confirms previous research that most economies follow the world business cycle when large shocks - such as the recent economic downturn - occur. This has implications for forecasting the business cycle, especially in times of economic turmoil.","Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Johannesburg,"Botha, I (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, Johannesburg, South Africa.",ilseb@uj.ac.za,,"Botha, Ilse/0000-0003-3168-1454",,,,,25,4,4,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

With productivity and job-separation-rate shocks, the model fails to produce substantial volatility among unemployment or vacancies, a result similar to Shimer's (2005) findings for the United States. Examining a broader range of shocks significantly increases the magnitude of business cycle fluctuations, but still only explains roughly 25 per cent of labour market volatility. The implied volatility of wages in the model is similar to that in the data and hence excessive wage flexibility is unlikely to be central to the failure of the model as claimed in the literature.","[Chindamo, Phillip; Uren, Lawrence] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Chindamo, P (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",,"Chindamo, Philip/GYD-5344-2022; Villena, Benjamin/D-6996-2012; Uren, Lawrence/O-2750-2015","Villena, Benjamin/0000-0002-2780-0214; Uren, Lawrence/0000-0002-0762-5308; Chindamo, Philip/0000-0002-5111-5188",,,,,27,2,2,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-9018,1467-8462,,AUST ECON REV,Aust.

To evaluate the Minsky hypothesis, we use the same data series that he used in his 1986 analysis and follow in his footsteps. These data clearly show increasing financial stress and fragility by 2005 in the United States. We find that elements of both hypotheses are useful in describing economic conditions and thus guiding policy choices. Current Fed policy in vastly expanding its balance sheet to support the financial sector is just the sort of policy that Minsky might have advocated.","[Chow, Peter C.

It is an extension of the model of Agenor (2008) who does not consider environmental pollution. We analyze properties of optimal fiscal policy in the steady-state growth equilibrium when the level of production of the final good is the source of pollution. Tax revenue of the government is channelized into three expenditure heads-health expenditure, pollution abatement expenditure and public infrastructure expenditure. It is found that the optimum ratio of public infrastructural expenditure to national income in the balanced growth equilibrium is less than the competitive output share of the public input; and it varies inversely with the magnitude of the emission-output coefficient. There is no conflict between the social welfare maximizing solution and the growth rate maximizing solution in the balanced growth equilibrium. There may exist indeterminacy in the transitional growth path converging to the unique steady-state equilibrium point that never satisfies saddle-point stability. The market economy growth rate is not necessarily less than the socially efficient growth rate; and the relationship between these two depends on the magnitude of the emission-output coefficient.

Managers are exposed to idiosyncratic risks due to the dependence of their compensation on investment payoffs which are not spanned by other assets. We show that risk averse managers invest earlier than well-diversified shareholders would prefer, leading to significant agency costs. This effect can be mitigated if the manager is subject to corporate control. Our main finding is that the interaction of idiosyncratic risk and control results in two regimes. When the market is sufficiently close to being complete, control has a strong disciplinary effect and agency costs can be virtually eliminated. However, when idiosyncratic risk is too large, shareholders suffer agency costs and control is ineffective. An implication is that we would expect to see different investment behavior across industries or specific investments as the degree of idiosyncratic risk varied. It would also suggest that both the standard complete-markets real options model and the npv framework can proxy in describing investment timing. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This analysis shows that the increase in consumption taxation raises (reduces) the long-run growth rate when the equilibrium path is locally indeterminate (determinate), provided the desire for social status is not too strong in the relative wealth model. By contrast, in the consumption externalities model, the same result holds, if the Frisch labor supply and labor demand curves have the 'normal' slopes at their intersection point, while the result is reversed if these two curves have the 'wrong' slopes.","[Itaya, Jun-ichi; Kanamori, Naoshige] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Econ & Business Adm, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600809, Japan",Hokkaido University,"Itaya, J (通讯作者)，Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Econ & Business Adm, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600809, Japan.",itaya@econ.hokudai.ac.jp; nao-k@pop.econ.hokudai.ac.jp,"Kanamori, Naoshige/K-8555-2012",,,,,,27,1,1,0,12,SPRINGER WIEN,Vienna,"Prinz-Eugen-Strasse 8-10, A-1040 Vienna, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

Tax progression arises from an exogenously given tax exemption threshold such that the firm pays no corporate income taxes should its earnings be less than this threshold. The firm possesses a perpetual option to liquidate its operation for a deterministic salvage value at any time. We show that the firm optimally exercises the liquidation option at the first instant when its earnings reach an endogenously determined threshold (the liquidation trigger) from above. Using numerical analysis, we show that the liquidation trigger is higher or lower than the exogenously given tax exemption threshold, depending on whether the tax exemption is below or above a unique critical level, respectively. We further show that the liquidation trigger is strictly decreasing for all tax exemption thresholds less than the critical level, and can be hump-shaped for all tax exemption thresholds greater than the critical level, especially when the salvage value is small. Corporate income taxes as such are not neutral when tax schedules are progressive. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A popular way to measure trust at the individual level is the so-called investment game (Berg et al., 1995). It has been widely noted, however, that risk attitudes can also affect decisions in this game, and thus in principle confound inferences about trust. We provide novel evidence shedding light on the role of risk attitudes for trusting decisions. To the best of our knowledge our data are the first rigorous evidence that (i) aggregate investment distributions differ significantly between trust and risk environments, and (ii) risk attitudes predict individual investment decisions in risk games but not in the corresponding trust games. Our results are convergent evidence that trust decisions are not tightly connected to a person's risk attitudes, and they lend support to the trust interpretation of decisions in investment games.

We find parameter values at which qualitative changes occur. Using theoretical results on the bifurcations of the solution structure to infinite horizon optimization problems obtained earlier, we give a fairly complete bifurcation analysis of the shallow lake problem. In particular, we show how the increase of the discount rate affects the parameter regions where an oligotrophic steady state, corresponding to low pollution level, is globally stable or locally stable under optimal dynamics.

Although these estimates differ widely across individuals, the data clearly show that most individuals would like to decrease wage inequality, relative to the level of inequality which they perceive to exist. The empirical analysis also shows that the demand for redistribution is strongly associated not only with variables describing self-interested motives for redistribution, but also with perceptions of and social norms with respect to inequality. Further, the demand for redistribution is a strong predictor for whether an individual is supportive of redistribution by the state. On the other hand, however, I find almost no evidence for an empirical association between the demand for redistribution and individuals' party identification.","[Kuhn, Andreas] Univ Zurich, Inst Empir Res Econ, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland; [Kuhn, Andreas] IZA, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Kuhn, A (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Inst Empir Res Econ, Muhlebachstr 86, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland.",kuhn@iew.uzh.ch,,,,,,,37,5,6,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2010,37.0,2,,,SI,,215,236,,10.1007/s10663-010-9126-3,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,V25OF,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000208486600006,0

This paper aims at checking whether this long-run behavior should be modelled as a deterministic or a stochastic trend or both. We first apply a test for a deterministic trend robust to uncertainty about the stochastic trend. Our results indicate that, for the period 1960-2004, energy intensities of only 8 OECD countries out of 25 include a negative deterministic trend, 3 include a positive one and 14 seem to be better modelled by a stochastic trend only. When considering a sample of 73 non-OECD countries on the period 1971-2004, we show that only 22 exhibit a deterministic trend (negative for 15 countries and positive for 7 countries). A similar analysis for oil intensity leads to reject the hypothesis of an insignificant deterministic trend for 7 OECD countries out of 23 for the period 1965-2004 and 11 non-OECD countries out of 40 for the period 1971-2004. In the next step, we apply standard unit root tests and find that the unit root hypothesis is not very often rejected. We conclude that a main feature of energy intensities is the presence of a stochastic trend. (C) 2009 Elsevier BM.

Our conjecture is that weak protection deters the participation of informed arbitrageurs, leaving those markets dominated by sentiment-prone noise traders whose correlated trading causes stock prices in emerging markets to deviate from the random walk benchmarks for persistent periods of time.","[Lim, Kian-Ping] Univ Malaysia Sabah, Labuan Sch Int Business & Finance, Jalan Sungai Pagar 87000, FT Labuan, Malaysia; [Lim, Kian-Ping; Brooks, Robert D.] Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Universiti Malaysia Sabah; Monash University,"Lim, KP (通讯作者)，Univ Malaysia Sabah, Labuan Sch Int Business & Finance, Jalan Sungai Pagar 87000, FT Labuan, Malaysia.",kianping@ums.edu.my,"Lim, Kian-Ping/C-6528-2011","Lim, Kian-Ping/0000-0003-0471-9752",,,,,104,28,33,0,25,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

It argues that governments face incentives to present upward biased tax projections. In election years, this may help them to increase the chance of reelection. If this chance is low, biased tax projections help governments to bring forward favorable expenditures and to burden their successors. These hypotheses are tested using West German states between 1992 and 2002. While there is only weak support for a general upward bias in tax projection and the importance of elections and partisanship, the degree of overestimation is found to be significantly higher, the less popular the incumbent party is and the poorer the state-specific economic performance.","[Bischoff, Ivo] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Bischoff, Ivo] Univ Giessen, Dept Econ, D-35394 Giessen, Germany; [Gohout, Wolfgang] Hsch Pforzheim, Fak Tech, D-75175 Pforzheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Bischoff, I (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.",ivo.bischoff@wirtschaft.uni-giessen.de; wolfgang.gohout@hs-pforzheim.de,"Bischoff, Ivo/AAQ-3278-2021",,,,,,37,31,32,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

The primary data for this study consist of patients diagnosed with osteoarthritis (N = 18,235) taken from a geographically diverse national research network of 72 primary care practices with 348 physicians in 27 states over the 1999-2002 time period. Brand-specific advertising data were collected for local and network television at the monthly level for the nearest media markets to the practices. Results of duration models of delay to treatment suggest advertising does affect the length of time that patients and physicians wait to initiate therapy. This evidence suggests that these effects may be welfare enhancing in that advertising tends to encourage more rapid adoption among patients who are good clinical candidates for the therapy and leads to less rapid adoption among some patients who are poor clinical candidates.

Shimer (2005) showed that in US data the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio is about 26 times more volatile than the standard model predicts. He identified the flexibility of wages as the key issue and triggered a heated debate on possible improvements of the core model to accommodate these empirical facts. In this paper, we first document Shimer's facts for the UK and find them to be qualitatively similar to US facts. We then develop and calibrate a model based on the Mortensen and Pissarides approach that increases the volatility of the v/u ratio 20-fold compared to the standard framework. The key features of our model relate to the job creation decision by firms and the search options of workers. We allow these to search whilst employed, and firms to re-advertise jobs that have been quit from. This leads us to use a different job creation process, whereby potential vacancies, or job 'ideas', arise at a finite rate per period over a range of idiosyncratic productivities. Calibrating the model to UK data, we show that it delivers volatility in unemployment and vacancies much closer to, though still not as large as, that observed for the UK, whilst retaining the standard wage determination process.

We find that outsourcing promotes the wage dispersion between the high- and low-skilled workers. When the labour union adopts a solidaristic wage policy, it will dampen this tendency. Further, higher outsourcing will increase equilibrium unemployment among the high-skilled workers, whereas it will reduce it among the low-skilled workers. Overall, outsourcing will reduce economy-wide equilibrium unemployment under the reasonable condition that the proportion of high-skilled workers is sufficiently low. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

As poverty measures they have the intuitive appeal of reflecting the degree to which poor and non-poor societies are polarized. (The measures would also have considerable application in studying multivariate convergence issues in economic growth models.) The measures are exemplified in a poor-non-poor country study over the period 1990-2005, based upon the joint distribution of per capita GNP and Life Expectancy.

It is shown that when firms' managers adopt abnormal behaviors due to pressures from shareholders regarding the propensity to invest, the system exhibits persistent cycles and chaotic trajectories. The analysis emphasizes that, even in the short run, shareholders may generate instability, which represents a serious threat that should not be underestimated for a capitalist economy.","Univ Paris 08, Dept Econ, LED, F-93526 St Denis 02, France",Universite Paris-VIII,"Charles, S (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 08, Dept Econ, LED, F-93526 St Denis 02, France.",,,"Charles, Sebastien/0009-0000-4104-135X",,,,,23,2,2,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Our conjecture was that the original protocol may not have made the size of the forgone outside option salient to second movers. Therefore, we change two features of the Dufwenberg and Gneezy protocol: (i) instead of the strategy method we implement a direct response method (sequential play) for the decision of the second mover; and (ii) we use paper money certificates that are passed between the subjects rather than having subjects write down numbers representing their decisions.

We argue that such locations are associated with low place utility. Our partial equilibrium search model with simultaneous job and residential location search predicts that the reservation wage for local jobs decreases with place utility. We test the theoretical prediction by estimating the effects of characteristics of the location of assignment on the transition rate into the first job. Our sample is male refugees aged 30-59 who were subjected to the Danish spatial dispersal policy carried out in the period 1986-1998. We find little empirical support for the theoretical prediction.

The purported objective of such measures is to reduce the incidence of child-labor in developing countries and thereby improve children's welfare. In this paper, we examine the effects of such policies from a political-economy perspective. We show that these types of international action on child-labor tend to lower domestic political support within developing countries for banning child-labor. Hence, international labor standards and product boycotts may delay the ultimate eradication of child-labor.","[Doepke, Matthias] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Zilibotti, Fabrizio] Univ Zurich, Inst Empir Wirtschaftsforsch, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland",Northwestern University; University of Zurich,"Doepke, M (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,,,,,,,34,13,14,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

The crisis that began in 2007 (hereafter, the 2007 crisis) has been different: it has been more profound and resistant to policy interventions. This paper examines why. Our approach is to expand Minsky's balance-sheet approach in several ways. First, we incorporate two factors Minsky missed because he built his model in the 1970s: the impact of racial exclusion and U.S. cross-border imbalances on U.S. financial dynamics. In addition, we draw out the analytical implications of the systematic differences between banks' and non-banks' balance-sheets. Minsky didn't do this; but because of the transformation of banking after 1980, these differences have become deeply significant. One key effect of so doing is to see that asset-liability balances as well as cash-flows are crucial in financial dynamics. This paper concludes that the 2007 crisis has been so profound and unresponsive to policy intervention for several reasons: banks no longer bear as well as originate credit risk; banks made exploitative loans to minority borrowers and then generalized these loans as housing prices rose; and subprime homeowners and structured investment vehicles became more leveraged than banks.","[Dymski, Gary A.] Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Dymski, GA (通讯作者)，UCCS, 1130 K St,Suite LL22, Sacramento, CA 95814 USA.",gary.dymski@ucop.edu,"Dymski, Gary/AFQ-4226-2022","Dymski, Gary/0000-0001-9667-2693",,,,,32,60,72,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Threshold autoregression with a unit root. Econometrica 2001: 69; 1555-1596.]. While standard unit root tests suggest that the prices of crude oil of different varieties move closely together such that their price differential is stationary, the TAR results indicate strong evidence of threshold effects in the adjustment process to the long-run equilibrium. These findings suggest that crude oil prices are linked and thus at the very general level, the oil market is 'one great pool' (Adelman, M.A. International oil agreements. The Energy Journal 1984; 5; 1-9.). However, differences in the dynamics of adjustment Suggest that within this one pool, oil markets are not necessarily integrated in every time period and hence the dynamics of crude oil price differentials may not follow a stationary process at all times. Although the development of a liquid futures market around the crude oil benchmarks has helped make some distant markets more unified, arbitrage is not costless or risk-free and temporary breakdowns in the benchmarks can lead to decoupling of crude oil prices.

Testing co-breaking, cointegration and weak exogeneity plays an important role in pursuing the model reduction. It is demonstrated that co-breaking removes a deterministic shift caused by the collapse of the bubble economy in Japan in the early 1990s. Multivariate cointegration analysis then reveals that inflation plays a critical role in accounting for the long-run behaviour of the aggregate consumption. Further analysis finds that inflation and aggregate income are weakly exogenous with respect to a set of parameters of interest. Finally, a parsimonious data-congruent model for the aggregate consumption is estimated conditional on the set of weakly exogenous variables. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The intensity of the crisis and some initial badly designed fiscal stimulus shortened the fiscal space, raising the deficit over the limit established in the Stability and Growth Pact. As a consequence of the enforcement of the rule, the Spanish administration has to apply a restrictive fiscal policy without having left the recession, while keeping one of the lowest indebtedness levels in the euro zone countries.","Univ Basque Country, Dept Appl Econ V, Madrid, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Serrano, F (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, Dept Appl Econ V, Madrid, Spain.",,"Serrano, Felipe/X-9303-2019","Serrano, Felipe/0000-0002-5993-7178",,,,,20,6,6,0,17,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0160-3477,,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Moral rights protection, which was incorporated into U.S. copyright law in 1990, ensures that works cannot be altered in a manner that would negatively impact the reputation of the artist. Using difference-in-differences regression strategies, we compare artists and non-artists in states with moral rights laws to those in states without these laws, before and after the laws are enacted. This enables us to test the impact of the laws on the behavior of artists, consumers, and policy makers. Our analysis reveals that the average artist's income falls by around $4000 per year as a result of moral rights legislation, but we find no impact of the laws on artists' choices of residence or on state-level public spending on the arts.","[Boyle, Melissa; Nazzaro, Stacy; O'Connor, Debra] Coll Holy Cross, Dept Econ, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",College of the Holy Cross,"Boyle, M (通讯作者)，Coll Holy Cross, Dept Econ, Box 191A, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",mboyle@holycross.edu; smnazz10@holycross.edu; doconnor@holycross.edu,,,,,,,26,3,4,1,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,,,J CULT ECON,J.

The quota regime, in place since 1974, was decided, according to the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, to be gradually eliminated by the year 2005. As a result, prices of cotton-yarn in the world markets decreased, affecting producers in all cotton-yarn exporting countries, including Greece. At the same time, the labor cost in western industrialized countries remained high, or even increased, exerting further pressure on yarn producers. The present paper examines these changes for the cotton-yarn industry in Greece. We use a multi-market partial-equilibrium model which allows us to take into account simultaneous input and output price changes, relevant for the industry under study. Findings show that, after the implementation of the program for the gradual elimination of quotas, producers' welfare decreased whereas consumers noted substantial increases in welfare transfers.","[Dadakas, Dimitrios; Katranidis, Stelios D.] Univ Macedonia, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece",University of Macedonia,"Dadakas, D (通讯作者)，Univ Macedonia, 156 Egnatia St,POB 1591, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece.",dimitrios_13@uom.gr; katranid@uorn.gr,"Azevedo, Micheline/JHT-0825-2023; Dadakas, Dimitrios/ISS-7096-2023; Dadakas, Dimitrios/AAN-5462-2021","Dadakas, Dimitrios/0000-0002-8635-340X;",,,,,29,2,5,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We measure sectoral labor productivity across countries using a model of the structural transformation. Productivity differences across countries are large in agriculture and services and smaller in manufacturing. Over time, productivity gaps have been substantially reduced in agriculture and industry but not nearly as much in services. These sectoral productivity patterns generate implications in the model that are broadly consistent with the cross-country data. We find that productivity catch-up in industry explains about 50% of the gains in aggregate productivity across countries, whereas low productivity in services and the lack of catch-up explain all the experiences of slowdown, stagnation, and decline observed across countries.","[Duarte, Margarida; Restuccia, Diego] Univ Toronto, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",University of Toronto,"Duarte, M (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",margarida.duarte@utoronto.ca; diego.restuccia@utoronto.ca,,"Restuccia, Diego/0000-0002-4072-8712",,,,,47,252,314,4,78,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

A model with two regions, two public goods and regional spillovers is developed in which uncertainty over the true preferences of candidates makes strategic delegation impossible. The political economy argument against centralisation of Besley and Coate (J Public Econ 87:2611-2637, 2003) does therefore not apply. Instead, it is shown that the existence of rent extraction by delegates alone suffices to make cooperative centralisation more likely through representative democracy under reasonable assumptions. In the case of non-cooperative centralisation, the more extensive possibilities for institutional design under representative democracy increase the likelihood of centralisation. Direct democracy may thus be interpreted as a federalism-preserving institution.","[Schnellenbach, Jan; Feld, Lars P.] Univ Heidelberg, Alfred Weber Inst Wirtschaftswissensch, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany; [Schaltegger, Christoph] Economiesuisse, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Feld, LP (通讯作者)，Univ Heidelberg, Alfred Weber Inst Wirtschaftswissensch, Bergheimer Str 58, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany.",jan.schnellenbach@awi.uni-heidelberg.de; feld@uni-hd.de; christoph.schaltegger@economiesuisse.ch,"Schnellenbach, Jan/A-1291-2015","Schnellenbach, Jan/0000-0003-1775-5744",,,,,25,15,15,0,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,,,ECON GOV,Econ.

In order to evaluate the nature of the relationship between the two variables, we have estimated cubic B spline, natural cubic B-spline and smoothing models. Using an F-test, we compare the smoothing spline to a global linear fit and the results indicate a sufficiently linear relationship. Finally, we have compared the local polynomial models with the spline model; the smoothing spline model closely matches the linearity between the size of the shadow economy and the unemployment rate.","[Alexandru, Adriana AnaMaria] Acad Econ Studies, Dept Stat & Econometr, Bucharest, Romania; [Dobre, Ion] Univ Econ, Dept Econ Cybernet, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Alexandru, AA (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Dept Stat & Econometr, Bucharest, Romania.",adrianaalexandru@yahoo.com; dobrerio@ase.ro,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,5,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-987-8,,,,2010,,,,,,,3,12,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI7KE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000414298300001,0

Multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) has been often applied for complex decisions in construction when a lot of criteria were involved. Traditional MCDM methods, however, operate with independent and conflicting criteria. While in every day problems a decision maker often faces interactive and interrelated criteria. Accordingly, the need of improving and supplementing the methodology of compromise decisions arose. It was proposed to supplement TOPSIS (Technique for the Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method and integrate the Mahalanobis distance in the usual algorythm of TOPSIS. Mahalanobis distance measure offered an option to take the correlations between the criteria into considerations while making the decision. A case study of building redevelopment in Lithuanian rural areas was presented that demonstrated the application of the proposed methodology. The case study proved that the proposed TOPSIS-M (TOPSIS applying Mahalanobis distance measure) method could have substantial influence in carrying the proper decision.","[Antucheviciene, Jurgita; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras; Zakarevicius, Algimantas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Antucheviciene, J (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",jurgita.antucheviciene@vgtu.lt; edmundas.zavadskas@vgtu.lt; algimantas.zakarevicius@vgtu.lt,"Antucheviciene, Jurgita/W-6112-2018; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018","Antucheviciene, Jurgita/0000-0002-1734-3216; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X",,,,,48,87,89,1,27,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Principal-agent matches are remade every period, but a principal can acquire some information on the past behavior of her current agent. I consider two different reputation mechanisms-one in which an agent's past record of defections makes no reference to the kind of task (Integrated Reputation), and another in which information about past defections is available separately for each task (Fragmented Reputation). The two kinds of reputation can be interpreted as personal honor and performance record (e. g. credit history) respectively. I first characterize the equilibria under the two mechanisms and make some welfare comparisons, showing that IR strictly welfare dominates FR over a significant range of parameter values. I then show that, when both mechanisms are available, integrated reputation will not be used in equilibrium by principals. Thus if the economy is in equilibrium using only the IR mechanism, and the FR mechanism becomes subsequently available, then IR will become obsolete. In the appropriate ranges of parameter values, this change reduces welfare.","Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Bose, G (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",g.bose@unsw.edu.au,,"Bose, Gautam/0000-0002-5573-3055",,,,,15,0,0,0,7,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

We find evidence that these phenomena are present and test how the level of investment is affected by these motivations; at the same time, we investigate whether participants are willing to explicitly pay a small sum of money to indulge preferences for less ambiguity, more control, or more frequent feedback/opportunities to choose the investment level. First, the observed preference for control did not affect investment behavior and in fact disappeared when participants were asked to actually pay to gain more control. Second, while people were indeed willing to pay for less ambiguity, the level of ambiguity did not influence investment levels. Finally, participants were willing to pay to have more frequent feedback opportunities to change their portfolio, even though prior research has shown that people invest less in risky assets (and earn less) in this case.

One of the problems with this kind of schemes concerns the lack of investment's incentives of the incumbent at the end of the contract. The goal of this article is twofold. First, we explain why the French water industry is rather characterized by investment incentives problems of incumbents toward the end of the contract. Second, using a database collected on a sample of 5000 municipalities in France in 2001, we propose some econometric tests emphasizing that in the French water sector, private firms have less and less incentives to invest as the end of the contract arrives. More precisely, we show using our data that a solution adopted by local authorities to face this problem is to substitute for private firms for the specific investments that must be made at the end of the contract. Our results therefore confirm the proposition generally admitted by contract theory of under-investment risks of incumbents at the end of the franchise bidding agreement.","[Huet, Freddy] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GREDEG, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Chong, Eshien] ADIS GRJM, Fac Jean Monnet, F-92331 Sceaux, France",Universite Cote d'Azur,"Huet, F (通讯作者)，Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GREDEG, 250 Rue Albert Einstein,Batiment 2, F-06560 Valbonne, France.",chong.eshien@online.fr; huetfreddy@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,44,0,0,0,19,DE BOECK UNIV,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

In contrast to some earlier studies using aggregate data, we find a negative relationship between debt and consumption growth.

Our results show the majority of people support farm subsidies, but voting outcomes are sensitive to the costs of the policy and the magnitude of the payouts to farmers. We find people act altruistically toward small farmers and that people are averse to inequality. Furthermore, we found the public's attitude toward maintaining a secure food supply is a significant determinant of support for farm programs. Finally, we found that information about farmers' average incomes and average production levels across different farm sizes had little effect on people's willingness to subsidize small or large farmers.","[Ellison, Brenna; Lusk, Jayson L.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Briggeman, Brian] Fed Reserve Bank Kansas City, Kansas City, KS USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Kansas City,"Lusk, JL (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 411 Ag Hall, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",brenna.ellison@okstate.edu; jayson.lusk@okstate.edu; brian.briggeman@kc.frb.org,,"Ellison, Brenna/0000-0002-4042-0056",,,,,27,8,11,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

As a result, the five largest studios (MGM, Paramount, 20th Century Fox, Warner Brothers and RKO) were forced to vertically disintegrate and separate production and distribution from exhibition. The Supreme Court also banned these and three other studios (Columbia, Universal and United Artists) from using block booking as contractual practice.

Theoretical background is based on assumptions that changing environment of organizational performance has a direct impact on changes in performance measurement, which, in its turn, are realized in close connection with projects on re-organizing internal management systems. The main feature of modern performance measurement system is putting the theoretical descriptive method into practices, incorporating it to decision making process, and improving the system according to changing external conditions and internal potential of an organization. Those processes mean organizational changes based on relations with the environment (Alas, Sharifi, & Sun, 2009; Ginevicius & Podvezko, 2009; Gudas, 2009). The dimensions that lead to the deeper analysis of relations between performance measurement system and environment of organization were disclosed in this article. In order to disclose those relations changes of the organizational system could be analyzed in the context of different theoretical assumptions - contingency and complexity theories. According to this aspect, changes of performance measurement system could be analyzed according to contingency theory, which will answer the question - what external environment is surrounding organization and influencing its internal environment. Complexity theory will answer the question how organization reacts to its external environment. Combining the main presumptions of complexity and contingency theories it could be maintained that the level of environmental uncertainty and organizations reactions to it could be dimensions according to which features and content of PMS in different organizations could be researched. Those two dimensions in different size organizations form different internal organization's environment peculiarities of which performance measurement system should be reflected. In order to point out performance measurement changes according to environment of the organization, quantitative research (survey) was performed Survey was performed in Lithuanian organizations, which were chosen by handily selection method The purpose of the research is to analyze the usage of performance measurement system in Lithuanian organizations: what factors (internal, external) influence the changing process and frequency of performance measurement system according to different aspects of an organization.","[Gimzauskiene, Edita; Kloviene, Lina] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Gimzauskiene, E (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio Str 73, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",edita.gimzauskiene@ktu.lt; lina.kloviene@stud.ktu.lt,,,,,,,32,10,10,0,13,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Overall, the results show that a positive shock to the growth rate of the real defense spending translates to a positive short-run effect on the growth rate of real GNP lasting up to ten quarters, but the effect is significant only for two quarters. Beyond the tenth quarter, the effect becomes negative and shows signs of slow reversal at around the 17th quarter. Our results tend to indicate that the mixed empirical evidence, based on small-scale Vector Autoregressive (VAR) and Vector Error Correction (VEC) models, could be a result of a small information set not capturing the true theoretical relationships between the two variables of interest.","[Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Kabundi, Alain] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Ziramba, Emmanuel] Univ S Africa, Dept Econ, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria; University of Johannesburg; University of South Africa,"Gupta, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",Rangan.Gupta@up.ac.za,,,,,,,30,7,8,0,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

We examine the trade-off between child quality (in the form of health outcomes) and the number of children in the family. We find that birth order and family size have negative effects on the heights of children, but not on their BMI. Household income per capita positively influences height but, even after accounting for this, the number of children in the family has a negative effect on height. This latter effect is closely associated with overcrowding and with the degree of cleanliness or hygiene in the household, which conditions exposure to factors predisposing to disease. We also analyse follow-up data, which indicates that the effects of family size on height persisted into adulthood.","[Hatton, Timothy J.] Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Hatton, Timothy J.] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Martin, Richard M.] Univ Bristol, Dept Social Med, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England",University of Essex; Australian National University; University of Bristol,"Hatton, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",hatton@essex.ac.uk,,"Martin, Richard/0000-0002-7992-7719",,,,,37,48,54,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Data from a national survey of functional foods and nutraceutical firms in Canada, conducted by Statistics Canada in 2003, is used for this analysis. Firm size, being privately held and engaging in contractual arrangements have negative impacts on the likelihood of a firm seeking external funding, while firms which are intensively involved in the functional food and nutraceutical sector, with greater prospects for business expansion and/or involved in partnerships are more likely to seek external financing. Larger firms and those involved in functional food and nutraceutical research and development receive a greater amount of capital when they decide to raise capital. However, firms focused on functional foods and nutraceuticals, as opposed to more diversified firms, and those involved in product development and concept scale-up, receive less capital. Our findings highlight the importance of public support in addressing the capital requirements of functional food and nutraceutical firms and underscore the considerable burden borne by smaller firms in this respect.","[Herath, Deepananda; Cranfield, John; Henson, Spencer] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph,"Herath, D (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",dherath@uoguelph.ca,,"Cranfield, John/0000-0002-3475-6709",,,,,39,3,3,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In a symmetric Bertrand oligopoly where products may differ only in their quality and each firm's product quality is private information (unknown to consumers and to other firms), there exist symmetric fully revealing perfect Bayesian equilibria where low quality firms randomize over an interval of prices and high quality firms charge high prices. Signaling requires that the market power and rent of low quality firms be large enough and often this requires that high quality firms exercise sufficient market power. There is a unique symmetric fully revealing equilibrium satisfying the D1 criterion; in this equilibrium too, both low and high quality firms may exhibit considerable market power. Market power of high quality firms may persist even as the number of firms becomes arbitrarily large. Every D1 equilibrium involves some revelation of information. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

International trade volume as proxied by exports of goods and services plus imports of goods and services has inelastic but statistically significant coefficient for real income both in the long and short terms. Results reveal that real income of Hong Kong converges to its long term level by 16.1% every year. A final finding of the present study is that conditional Granger causality tests suggest undirectional causation that runs from international trade volume to real income; thus, the trade-led growth hypothesis is confirmed in the case of Hong Kong according to the results of the present study.","[Katircioglu, Salih Turan] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Famagusta, Turkey; [Fethi, Sami] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Business Adm, Famagusta, Turkey; [Aga, Mehmet] Near East Univ, Dept Int Business, Mersin, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University; Eastern Mediterranean University; Near East University,"Katircioglu, ST (通讯作者)，Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Famagusta, Turkey.",,"Katircioglu, Salih T./H-3494-2016",,,,,,24,2,2,0,10,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

All three countries are heavily dependent on foreign workers and have government-mediated migration policies for their continued economic growth and prosperity. Managing migration is a major problem facing these countries, and the guest worker programme is increasingly seen as the optimal solution to fill labour market gaps. Migration policies often provide incentives for skilled workers, boost circular migration flows among low-skilled guest workers and include stringent border-control regimes to exclude unauthorised migration. The guest worker programme is also reliant on networks and intermediaries, and brokerage fees contribute to less-skilled migrant workers' marginalisation and exploitation. Changes in global migration governance, the inclusion of migrant labour exploitation under the banner of trafficking and the threat of economic sanctions are increasingly resulting in interstate cooperation and more humane border regimes.","Univ New England, Sch Business Econ & Publ Policy, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia",University of New England,"Kaur, A (通讯作者)，Univ New England, Sch Business Econ & Publ Policy, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia.",akaur@une.edu.au,,,,,,,37,61,66,6,71,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

This article applies a stochastic frontier approach to address this issue using data from 141 countries for the period 1993 to 1997. From the perspective of productivity change, our results suggest that gains in population health will be greater provided that more resources are allocated to investment in human capital. We also show that the scale component accounts for 65-70% of the productivity change. That is, omitting the scale component in our case will result in a significant underestimation of the decline in the productivity of world health production. We do not find evidence supporting the hypothesis that production frontiers differ between Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and non-OECD countries. However, the change in productivity and scale elasticity do vary significantly between these countries.","[Li, Yang] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Inst Business & Management, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan; [Keng, Shao-Hsun] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Appl Econ, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan",National University Kaohsiung; National University Kaohsiung,"Li, Y (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Inst Business & Management, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan.",yangli@nuk.edu.tw,"Keng, Shao-Hsun/W-6172-2019","Keng, Shao-Hsun/0000-0002-7153-5892",,,,,40,5,6,3,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

When only partial information about risk attitude of decision maker is known one can not find an optimal solution of maximizing expected utility problem, because the utility function is not exactly given. However, there exist several criteria that allow partial ordering of investment possibilities. For example, mean and variance of portfolio returns are distinguished criteria for portfolio comparisons (mean-variance relation). Stochastic dominance relations offer an approach where the set of considered utility functions is described by derivative conditions. The most popular is the first-order and the second-order stochastic dominance. In this paper, we choose almost 250 000 pairs of portfolios and we observe the incidence of the mean-variance relation and SD relations for different orders of SD (first, second, third, fourth, infinite). Moreover, we consider two data sets, the first one contains the returns of stock market indexes before crisis, while the second one during crisis. We compare the results for pre-crisis data with that for during crisis.","[Kopa, Milos] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Prague 18675, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,,kopa@karlin.mff.cuni.cz,"Kopa, Miloš/H-4481-2014","Kopa, Miloš/0000-0002-9438-4484",,,,,4,0,0,0,0,"UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,CESKE BUDEJOVICE, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZ-370 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-218-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,353,358,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS47,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287979900060,0

Each system has advantages and disadvantages. This paper investigates to what degree Japan should maintain a DB public pension system which offers the benefit of sharing risk and to what degree Japan must adopt a DC pension system to eliminate intergenerational imbalance. The risks of longevity and volatility of return on assets are incorporated into the simulation model. As a result of the simulation analysis, a replacement rate of 20-30% would be adequate for future generations if the expected return on assets and the wage growth rate are at the same level. Meanwhile, if the former is 2% points larger than the latter, a replacement rate of 0% or full-scale privatization would be desirable. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Anecdotal evidence points to low returns to education in Africa. Unfortunately, there is limited econometric evidence to support these claims at the micro level. In this study, I focus on Nigeria, a country that holds 1/5 of Africa's population. I use instruments based on the exogenous timing of the implementation and withdrawal of free primary education across regions in this country to consistently estimate the returns to education in the late 1990s. The results show the average returns to education are particularly low in the 90s, in contrast to conventional wisdom for developing countries (2.8% for every extra year of schooling between 1997 and 1999). Surprisingly, I find no significant differences between OLS and IV estimates of returns to education when necessary controls are included in the wage equation. The low returns to education results shed new light on both the changes in demand for education in Nigeria and the increased emigration rates from African countries that characterized the 90s.

The basic subject of economics as a scientific theory is a human being. Homo sapiens is a creator of econosphere the global economic system consisting of billions of people and organizations which are multiplying achievements of our civilization. Therefore, at the core of any economic theory must be a theory of human behavior. The presented comparative analysis demonstrates an amazing convergence between A.Smith's theory and contemporary behavioral economics. Thus, the article supports opinion that present economics is returning to the roots of eighteen century classical economics.

Over 5900 houses, of which 1600 totally destroyed, and more than 21000 people were reported by local authorities to have been affected by the floods. The most affected areas were situated in Maramures, in Moldova, along the Prut and Siret rivers. These areas include critical infrastructure elements (town halls, border police offices, roads, dams, civil protection facilities) and had a negative impact on the economic activity. The assessment of the effects of the disaster, conducted by the Operational Centre for Emergency Situations (OCES) under the Romanian Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, has demonstrated the increase of the risk level with implications as systemic risk. Considering the multiple effects and the serious micro and macroeconomic implications, the intervention of the governmental institutions must be prompt and efficient. The lack of experience in the case of these extreme risk events, but also the budgetary restrictions, require, on the one hand, the reassessment of the insurance solutions through the introduction of a new financing scheme based on PPP, or the use of the microfinance products specifically created for natural hazards risk management, on the other hand. Microfinance institutions could be efficient both in disasters, and also in events that correspond to the disaster response and the recovery process. Microfinance institutions could be easily informed on the potential consequences of natural hazards at different levels: clients, institutions, sectors. Microfinance products and services could be robust solutions, because they respond more directly to clients needs in the aftermath of extreme events. Identifying the optimal lending program is a difficult task and it is closely related to the global recovery process. The design of these specific products represents an important contribution in order to develop an efficient recovery process, as the funds will be used more efficiently and promptly, and we consider that innovative solutions should be used for Romania and for other emerging countries.","[Prelipcean, Gabriela] Univ Stefan Cel Mare Suceava, Fac Econ Sci & Publ Adm, Suceava, Romania; [Boscoianu, Mircea] Air Force Acad Brasov, Brasov, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava; Henri Coanda Air Force Academy,,gprelipcean@yahoo.com; mircea_boscoianu@yahoo.co.uk,"Prelipcean, Gabriela/AAQ-1424-2020; Boscoianu, Mircea/AAA-8654-2019; ALINA, CALUSERU/HPD-4030-2023; BOSCOIANU, Mircea/HKV-9799-2023","Prelipcean, Gabriela/0000-0002-2584-1733; BOSCOIANU, Mircea/0000-0003-2650-7144",,,,,30,0,0,1,6,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-987-8,,,,2010,,,,,,,266,273,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8PE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000392590700040,0

Weber's described ideal, legislative and rational bureaucracy and increasing the effectiveness of public institutions and their activity. According to the theorists of these reforms (Osborne, Gaebler, 1992; Hughes, 1998; Pollitt, Bouckaert, 2003), inflexible, centralized bureaucracies developed during industrial periods have become ineffective and unproductive; moreover, they cannot function effectively and successfully in a rapidly changing knowledge society and economy. Thus, they should be changed into more flexible, result oriented, modern management models developing the partnership of public and private sectors (Skietrys, Raipa, Bartkus, 2008). This aspiration is the main stimulus to turn to a business sector under the market conditions and to base on New Public Management (NPM) modernizing the structures of administration culture taking into account the challenges of the time under consideration. NPM ideas and their introduction are directly linked with human resources (HR) of public institutions. HR is the main and most valuable asset that is managed by the institutions of a public sector. Activity effectiveness depends on it. According to M. Armstrong (2006), human resource management (HRM) is a strategic, complex approach to the most important aspect of an organization, i.e. to people who individually and collectively support the realization of organizational objectives. This approach explains the fact that HR is the main factor of any changes having its culture and aspirations that can stimulate or hinder changes related to the change from public administration (PA) to NPM. In order to achieve a consecutive turn, the system of HRM is of the utmost importance as well as its conformity to NPM requirements that witness the change of principles (Storey, 2001). Thus, this change is a process that requires objective and full assessment of the present HRM that would help to reveal the obstacles of the change and would offer development directions. NPM is a new way, however, some of public sector models have already been tried. Their analysis is closely related with some researches (Pollitt, 1993, 2003; Osborne, Gaebler, 1992; Wilson, 2004, Boston, 1991; Hughes, 1998; Hood, 1991; Kettl, 2000; Massey, 1993; Peters, Waterman, 1982; Peters, 2003; and others). Much attention is devoted to Weber's ideal bureaucracy model and its criticism that has been aimed at opposing public choice and managerialism theories (Aucoin, 1990; Reichard, 1992; Schedler, 1995; Bud us, Gruning, 1998). However, both management practice and theory hold that there exists some succession between the new and the old, and this aspect should be taken into account. Lithuanian researchers also stress this fact (Puskorius, 2002; Raipa, 2001; Domarkas, 2004). Mention is made about an intermediate case of a public sector reform (Domarkas, 2004), the necessity of political changes (Zidonis, Sudnickas, 2005), the models of effective activity development (Christauskas, Marcinkeviciute, Petrauskiene, 2007). There are research works that deal with public sector institutions, different aspects of HRM and their changes (Thom, Ritz, 2004; Manning, Parison, 2002; Fleming, 2000; Larsen, Brewster, 2003; Rabin, 2003, Renwick, 2003; OECD, 2005). Lithuanian researchers of a public sector base their approaches on western theories and models while analyzing HRM (Barsauskiene, 2002; Vienazindiene, 2009; Siugzdiniene, 2008; Chlivickas, 2005; Domarkas, 2002; Raipa, 2003; Velicka, Minkevicius, 2005; Juraleviciene, 2003; Ciarniene et al., 2007; Tijunaitiene, Neverauskas, Balciunas, 2009; Gustas, 2003, Cesnuleviciene, Lakis, 2002 and others) They emphasize Lithuanian peculiarities. In spite of a wide range of researches, HRM change from public administration (PA) to NPM is analized rather fragmentary; they lack the system approach that could reveal the cognition of this phenomenon, i.e. its research methodology showing HR change from PA to NPM. This article is aimed at presenting a research methodology and its application in practice, and the use of the results obtained is clearly demonstrated in the field of HRM development.","[Sakalas, Algimantas; Vienazindiene, Milita] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Sakalas, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Laisves Av 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",algimantas.sakalas@ktu.lt; milita.vienazindiene@ktu.lt,"Vienažindienė, Milita/ABA-1817-2022","Vienažindienė, Milita/0000-0001-9894-6811",,,,,59,4,5,1,35,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In order to compete effectively, firms have to improve their performance (Chang, Huang, 2005). Because performance stands out as one major organizational goal, many of human resource management (HRM) research efforts have been directed to understand the HRM-Performance linkage (Gardner, Moynihan, Park, Wright, 2001). Much of empirical research on the added value of HRM demonstrate evidence that HRM does matter (Arthur, 1994; Huselid, 1995;), however contrary approach also exists: evidence for HRM-Performance link should be treated with caution (Wall, Wood, 2005). By supporting the HRM-Performance link it is not clear why this link exists. In order to provide a convincing explanation of HRM-Performance link, according Guest (1997), it is necessary to improve theoretical and analytical frameworks in three key areas: the nature of HRM, the nature of performance and the linkage between HRM and performance. The paper provides an insight into HRM drawing a conclusion that there is no single agreed or fixed list of human resource (HR)practices which are used to define human resource management. To better disclose performance, the paper looks into four levels of performance outcomes which makes HRM-Performance link more evident. Assuming that there is a little understanding of the mechanisms through which HRM influence performance, the paper defines the black box problem. The paper provides an overview of a number of conceptual models (Becker, Huselid, Pickus, Sprat, 1997; Guest, 1997; Purcel, Kinnie, Hutchinson, Rayton, Swart 2003; Wright, Nishii, 2006) that attempt to depict the processes through which HR practices ultimately impact organization financial performance. Assuming that the similarity among all of these models is that they all have their basis in a linear causal process, the paper looks into two additional aspects: first, the number of boxes in the black box; second, the content of each box. Finally the comparison and summing-up of four models is presented in this paper. This brings to conclusion that the identification of the specific mechanisms that mediate between HRM practices and organizational performance should be considered as a central issue in HRM literature.","[Savaneviciene, Asta; Stankeviciute, Zivile] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Savaneviciene, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",asta.savaneviciene@ktu.lt; zivile.stankeviciute@stud.ktu.lt,"Savanevičienė, Asta/I-8581-2019; Stankevičiūtė, Živilė/I-6551-2018","Savanevičienė, Asta/0000-0003-3132-860X; Stankevičiūtė, Živilė/0000-0002-5578-4645",,,,,44,14,17,1,39,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Besides, we find different causality patterns in sample countries, which depart from those found in the existing literature, highlighting that it might be unreliable to apply only conventional unit-root test and inappropriate to take the first difference of the series to achieve stationarity, all of which might result in model misspecification. Our analysis also provides some evidence on the source of the mixed results on finance-growth nexus as they may differ due to the length of data span and the different econometric procedure.

I consider both the effect of disease on conventionally measured GDP and also the monetary equivalent of the utility benefits from lower mortality. Regarding the effects on conventional GDP, I evaluate a number of approaches including cross-country regression (with and without instruments for disease) and simulation based on microeconomic studies. I also discuss theoretically and empirically the different channels that link disease and economic outcomes, including effects that run through labour productivity, education and population growth. Different approaches yield somewhat different results, but the overall finding is that there is at best weak support for the claims that the disease burden in Africa significantly lowers GDP or that improving health would provide a big impetus to economic growth. In contrast, the monetary equivalent of the utility benefits from better health can be extremely large. For example, reduced mortality in many developing countries has made a contribution to utility of roughly the same value as the growth of conventional GDP over the last several decades.","[Weil, David N.] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Weil, David N.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Brown University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Weil, DN (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",david_weil@brown.edu,,,NICHD NIH HHS [R24 HD041020] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,23,13,14,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Accordingly, this study employs a seemingly unrelated bivariate probit model to jointly estimate the factors that influence both further education and re-enlistment decisions. Empirical analysis indicates that there is a correlation between the re-enlistment and further education decisions, revealing that previous single equation models might be misspecified. Moreover the geographical background, education level of the conscript, intention of further education and previous unemployment duration are influential in the re-enlistment decision.

This paper develops a production function which allows for this structure in the elasticity of substitution. The case of a falling real interest rate and capital deepening in the developed countries in the presence of FDI flows is analyzed. It is shown that this structure in the elasticity of substitution can be responsible for different types of relationships between the capital intensity of the developed country and the relative capital intensity of the developing country. They carry over to an first increasing and later eventually decreasing relationship between the capital intensity of the developed country and FDI profitability. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The vast body of academic research demonstrates that most mergers add no value or reduce shareholder value for the acquiring firm. Given the failure of so many mergers, the question of why mergers continue to occur in large numbers remains. Overconfidence and optimism have come to the forefront as the most common behavioral explanations for the continued prevalence of ill-advised mergers. This paper investigates a different type of behavioral bias that also may influence merger and acquisition decisions-confirmation bias. Using a unique experimental data set, we provide evidence in support of the existence of confirmation bias in merger decision making behavior, particularly with respect to the behavior of actual corporate executives.

By promoting the use of the Instrumental Valuation Principle, it is argued here that institutionalises can offer a framework for policy analysis that ensures that the debate on stem cell research is informed by the instrumental use of knowledge and that it is not controlled by upper-level hegemonic powers. Our contention is that the first decade following the initial harvesting of human embryonic stem cells (1998-2008) in the United States was characterized by institutional and policy responses that created a non-deliberative environment that hindered the process of instrumental valuation of stem cell research. This paper concludes that the current conditions of limited corporate involvement are favorable toward a democratic discussion of the legitimacy of stem cell research, but this will require overt challenges to political elites' attempts to control the creation and flow of instrumental knowledge on stem cell research.","Denison Univ, Granville, OH 43023 USA",University System of Ohio; Denison University,"Duroy, Q (通讯作者)，Denison Univ, Granville, OH 43023 USA.",,,,,,,,31,1,1,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Privatised pension system coincides with investment risks, higher administrative costs, and inability of private markets to provide retirees with affordable, indexed and certain annuities. Namely, private sector may not provide enough investment projects to efficiently absorb mandated pension savings and the expected pension income is subject to a number of risks: poor and volatile investment returns, longevity, and inflation eroding the purchasing power of pensions.

O41, O43, B23) The literature of structural economic dynamics emerged from the attempt to extend Keynes-type macroeconomics to the analysis of the long run. After Roy Harrod's exploration of capital accumulation requirements in a macro economy subject to technical progress and population growth, economists broadly associated with the Cambridge tradition attempted the identification of consistency conditions for a disaggregate, multi-sectoral economy undergoing changes in relative proportions. Moving from the criticism of the aggregate methodology and from the implementation of inter-industry analysis in empirical research, a first set of theoretical principles for the explanation of long-run structural changes were developed. The paper discusses the analytical core and developments of the structural dynamics tradition starting from the early discussion of the relationship between technical progress and Engel's law, and of the structural interdependence between growth, resource utilization and capital accumulation. It is argued that the original research programme gave way to contributions along two main lines of inquiry. On the one hand, the relationship between economic theory and economic history became a central concern; on the other hand, the analytical representation of economic structure became an important focus of research. The paper emphasizes that a distinctive feature of the structural dynamics tradition is its emphasis upon the differentiated evolution of the various components of any given economic system, and the prominence assigned to relatively permanent structures in shaping historical evolution, or in constraining the achievement of long-run policy objectives.","Univ Bologna, Fac Econ, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Scazzieri, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Fac Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",ro-berto.scazzieri@unibo.it,,"SCAZZIERI, ROBERTO/0000-0003-4652-8807",,,,,86,9,9,0,8,SOC ED IL MULINO,BOLOGNA,"STRADA MAGGIORE 37, 40125 BOLOGNA, ITALY",1120-2890,,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

In contrast to previous counterfactual exercises, we apply a more disaggregated methodology for the trade weights, a larger number of trade partners and ARCH/GARCH techniques to capture the time-varying characteristics of volatility. Our findings confirm that Singapore's managed floating exchange rate system has delivered relatively low currency volatility. Although there are gains in volatility reduction for all countries in the sample from the adoption of either a unilateral or a common basket peg, particularly post-Asian crisis, these gains are relatively low for Singapore, largely because of low actual volatility. There are additional gains for non-dollar peggers from stabilizing intra-east Asian exchange rates against the dollar if they were to adopt a basket peg, especially post-crisis, but the gains for Singapore are again relatively modest. Finally, the conclusion from previous counterfactual studies that there is little difference between a unilateral basket peg and a common basket peg in terms of stability reduction is confirmed.","[Wilson, Peter; Ren, Henry Ng Shang] Singapore Management Univ, Singapore, Singapore",Singapore Management University,"Wilson, P (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Singapore, Singapore.",peterwilson@smu.edu.sg,,,,,,,46,1,1,0,3,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

This study applies various regime switching GJR-GARCH models to analyze the effects of macroeconomic variables (interest rate, dividend yield, and default premium) on stock return movements (including conditional mean, conditional variance, and transition probabilities) in the U.S. stock market, so as to clearly compare the predictive validity of stable and volatile states, as well as compare the in-sample and out-of-sample portfolio performance of regime switching models. The empirical results show that macro factors can affect the stock return dynamics through two different channels, and that the magnitude of their influences on returns and volatility is not constant. The effects of the three economic variables on returns are not time-invariant, but are closely related to stock market fluctuations, and the strength of predictability in a volatile regime is far greater than that in a stable regime. It is found that interest rate and dividend yield seem to play an important role in predicting conditional variance, and out-of-sample performance is largely eroded when the effects of these two factors on volatility are ignored. In addition, the three macro factors do not play any role in predicting transition probabilities. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Considering the serious criticism against the dispute settlement body's interpretation of the scientific principles and risk analysis so far and the well-recognized assumption in WTO societies that the WTO is, the best tool to treat both free trade and the environment, a more flexible and reasonable attitude of the dispute settlement body to treat the scientific issues is required under the condition that the body is well equipped with the capacity to read the health-related scientific aspects of international trade.","Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Int Trade, Pusan, South Korea",Pusan National University,"Lee, ES (通讯作者)，Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Int Trade, Pusan, South Korea.",lieunsup@pusan.ac.kr,,,,,,,44,1,1,0,2,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

This is done through a critical appraisal of the work of Thorstein Veblen. Even though Veblen's account of the evolution of humankind makes the notion of natural selection practically redundant, his remaining attachment to Darwinism created two other serious tensions for him. First, his attachment to the Darwinian scheme of 'descent with modification' kept him from devising a systematic theory of the different socio-economic systems he studied. This shortcoming is more evident in his analysis of capitalism, which not only lacks an elaborated theory but also contradicts his initial evolutionary programme. Second, by postulating that human history is a question of cultural change, Veblen was tempted to conflate social structures, institutions and habits of thought.","[Liagouras, George] Univ Aegean, Aegean, Greece",University of Aegean,"Liagouras, G (通讯作者)，27 Ventouri St, Holargos 15561, Greece.",g.liagouras@fme.aegean.gr,,"Liagouras, George/0000-0002-4410-2741",,,,,50,11,11,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Although non-rival borrowing is emergent in agent interaction, it is typically not included in agent heuristics. Properties such as non-rival borrowing are best studied in networks. Computational studies of both regular networks and small world networks indicate the clustering that these networks tend to. In spite of its cited welfare relevance to distributional inequality, clustering in small world networks has only been examined in terms of the remoteness parameter of the network. We extend a network model of the stock of information to more explicitly represent efficiency-reducing effects that clustering can have through content duplication or overlap and demonstrate the significance these effects can have in computational results. These studies also show the efficiency-increasing effects of non-rival borrowing that continue to be evidenced and the overlap reducing effects that increasing network remoteness can have.","[Silver, Steven] Calif State Univ, Lucas Grad Sch Business, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; [Cowans, Phillip] Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England",University of Cambridge,"Silver, S (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ, Lucas Grad Sch Business, 1 Washington Sq, San Jose, CA 95192 USA.",sds001@calmail.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,35,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

We formally examine an ad-based monopolist's incentives to introduce this option. When deciding whether or not to introduce the option to pay, the monopolist compares the potential direct revenues from consumers who pay, with the lost advertising revenues resulting from the subsequent ad removal. If the pay alternative is introduced, the media firm increases advertising quantity to make the option to pay more attractive. This outcome hurts consumers but benefits the media firm and the advertisers. Total welfare may increase or decrease. Perhaps surprisingly, more annoying advertisements may lead to an increase in advertising quantity. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The paper begins by using U.S. data to document skilled and unskilled labor trends within industry sector classifications as well as industry sector output trends. Using Current Population Survey data from 1968 to 2004, it is shown that the ratio of skilled workers to unskilled workers employed has risen in all industries. The absolute increase in this ratio was larger in the more skilled industries, while the growth rate was larger in the less skilled industries. Furthermore, using national income account data, it is shown that relatively high-skilled industries have accounted for an increasing share of output over time. A version of the neoclassical growth model is then constructed to match these observations. One important feature of this model is a structure that introduces new goods into the economy at each moment of time. The model is able to capture a rich set of labor market movements between sectors and between skill levels as well as changes in the relative output shares across industries, yet preserves many nice features of the neoclassical growth model.(JEL E13, J20, 030).","[Blankenau, William F.; Cassou, Steven P.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Kansas State University,"Blankenau, WF (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Econ, 327 Waters Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",blankenw@ksu.edu; scassou@ksu.edu,,,,,,,37,2,2,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

First, using a regression discontinuity design that exploits Florida's system of imposing sanction threats on the basis of a cutoff level of performance, I estimate medium-run effects on student test scores from having attended a threatened elementary school. Threat-induced math improvements from elementary school largely persist at least through the first 1 to 2 years of middle school, while evidence for persistence of reading improvements is less consistent. Second, I analyze the effects of sanction threats on various features of educational production, and I find that sanction threats raise school spending on instructional technology, Curricular development, and teacher training. Both strands of evidence are consistent with a predominant role for educational reforms in generating test score gains by threatened schools. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We also assess the role for macroeconomic determinants of the crisis that serve to explain the bubble in U.S. asset prices, most notably low global interest rates attributed to either loose monetary policy or excess global saving. Although low global interest rates may have contributed to the boom in housing markets and speculative excesses, we believe that the financial innovations and microeconomic distortions played a more fundamental role. Finally, a recovery marked by higher private saving, weak domestic investment, and a large public deficit appears to be unsustainable.

It employs a large panel of German municipalities in order to investigate the dynamic fiscal policy adjustment using a vector-error-correction model that explicitly takes account of the intertemporal budget constraint. The results confirm that a substantial part of fiscal adjustment to revenue shocks takes place by offsetting changes in intergovernmental transfers: in present-value terms about 34 cents of a permanent I E decrease in own revenues are compensated by subsequent changes in fiscal-equalization transfers. Hence, the contribution of intergovernmental transfers in maintaining fiscal balance is found to be two to three times larger than in the case of US municipalities investigated by Buettner and Wildasin [Buettner, T., Wildasin, D.E., 2006.

With a discrete-state solution approach, I find a striking contrast: while the imperfect information model successfully generates the liquidity effect and the positive term premium seen in the data; the adjustment cost model replicates only the liquidity effect. This is because the adjustment cost that drives the liquidity effect in the adjustment cost model also creates an adjustment cost effect, which leads to a negative term premium.

This paper develops an economic model of this relationship, where the state's objective is to maximize net tax revenue. Religious goods benefit the state in two ways: first, they provide utility to citizens, thus allowing the state to extract more taxes before running up against citizens' reservation utility (the point at which they would revolt), and second, they potentially provide legitimacy to the state, thereby lowering the costs of tax collection. If the latter effect is strong enough, the state may find it optimal to take control of religion, either to enhance its legitimizing effect, or to suppress its de-legitimizing effect. Greater competition in the religion market and democratic polity make it less likely for the state to control religion. To evaluate the model's implications, we use recent cross-country data on the relationship between religion and state, including variables from the Religion and State Project and measures coded from the 2001, 2003, and 2005 International Religious Freedom reports. We also examine in more detail some of the paradigmatic cases indicated by the model, presenting various types of evidence from current and historical examples of each case.

J,"Dynan, KE",,,,"Dynan, Karen E.",,,Changing Household Financial Opportunities and Economic Security,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Households have experienced an expansion of financial opportunities over the past several decades. Expanded financial opportunities, such as the democratization of credit and new lending approaches, can yield benefits in terms of household economic security. However, the financial crisis that began in 2007 has powerfully illustrated that expanded financial opportunities can also pose dangers for households. By increasing the scope for investment in risky assets, people may end up with larger swings in wealth than they had anticipated. Households may borrow too much and then face obligations that are unsustainable given their resources. To explore these issues, I examine household data on wealth, assets, and liabilities going back 25 years and, in some cases, 45 years. I argue that changes in household finances in the decades leading up to the mid-1990s - including the gradual rise in indebtedness - likely increased household well-being, on balance, and contributed to a decline in aggregate economic volatility. However, changes in finances since the mid-1990s - in particular, a much sharper rate of increase in household debt - appear to have been destabilizing for many individual households and ultimately for the economy as a whole. I consider how the lessons learned in the current crisis might change household financial opportunities and choices going forward.","Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Brookings Institution,"Dynan, KE (通讯作者)，Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",kdynan@brookings.edu,,"Dynan, Karen/0000-0001-5504-4025",,,,,22,41,52,0,15,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

For ex post incentive compatibility, the communication protocol must reveal enough information to calculate monetary transfers to the agents to motivate them to be truthful (agents' payoffs are assumed to be quasilinear in such transfers). For Bayesian incentive compatibility, the protocol may need to hide some information from the agents to prevent deviations contingent on the information. In both settings with selfish agents, the communication cost can be higher than in the case in which the agents are honest and can be relied upon to report truthfully. The increase is the communication cost of selfishness. We provide an exponential upper bound on the increase. We show that the bound is tight in the Bayesian setting, but we do not know this in the ex post setting. We describe some cases where the communication cost of selfishness proves to be very low.

It is less open to trade and has been unable to attain and sustain high rates of growth. Today, globalization and participation in the global economy primarily means the export of labor rather than goods. The Philippines' reliance on remittances from its cadre of overseas Filipino workers has become the main pillar of its growth and development strategy. Going into the period of the global crisis, the Philippines had robust growth relative to its historical average and a strengthened banking system. The effects on the real sector intensified in the last quarter of 2008. While there are continuing attempts to use expansionary monetary and fiscal policy to spur the economy, the ability of the Philippines to pursue such expansionary policies may be limited by the still relatively high inflation and the government's historically weak fiscal position. Although it appears that the Philippines will muddle through and survive the current global crisis, it will continue to face the daunting task of effectively leveraging for long-term growth and development.","Univ Philippines, Sch Econ, Quezon City 1101, Philippines",University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman,"Gochoco-Bautista, MS (通讯作者)，Univ Philippines, Sch Econ, Quezon City 1101, Philippines.",msgb@up.edu.ph,,,,,,,1,1,1,0,9,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

What is loyalty and how can it be measured? Is there a general model, or are there various factors influencing customer behaviour and attachment? In which factors does the measurement of loyalty have validity and is it worth to apply these for organisations enjoying a monopolistic market position? The paper seeks to find answers to these questions, and besides exploring the theoretical background it also presents the findings of an empirical study of the loyalty of customers in the energy sector in Hungary. This study shows that this particular market consists of customers of various attitudes, which means that in order to study their loyalty different marketing methods are needed.","Univ Szeged, Fac Econ & Business Adm, H-6722 Szeged, Hungary",Szeged University,"Hetesi, E (通讯作者)，Univ Szeged, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Kalvaria Sgt 1, H-6722 Szeged, Hungary.",hetesi@gmail.com,,,,,,,47,0,0,0,11,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Weather derivatives can play a key role in hedging and diversifying such risk because the uncertainty in a company's profit function can be correlated to weather condition which affects diverse industry sectors differently. Unfortunately the weather derivatives market is a classical example of an incomplete market that is not amenable to standard methodologies used for derivative pricing in complete markets. In this paper, we develop an equilibrium pricing model for weather derivatives in a multi-commodity setting. The model is constructed in the context of a stylized economy where agents optimize their hedging portfolios which include weather derivatives that are issued in a fixed quantity by a financial underwriter. The supply and demand resulting from hedging activities and the supply by the underwriter are combined in an equilibrium pricing model under the assumption that all agents maximize some risk averse utility function. We analyze the gains due to the inclusion of weather derivatives in hedging portfolios and examine the components of that gain attributable to hedging and to risk sharing. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We show that state ownership is positively associated with leverage and firms' access to long-term debt, while foreign ownership is negatively associated with all measures of leverage. Surprisingly, firms in better developed regions are associated with reduced access to long-term debt, Suggesting the availability of alternative financing channels and the tightening of the lending standards under the on-going banking reform. The combination of ownership structures and institutions explains up to 6% of the total variation in firms' leverage decisions, while firm characteristics alone explain no more than 8% of the variation. Further, we show that non-state-owned firms tend to have lower total and short-term debt than their state-owned counterparts in less developed regions. Finally, we show that state-owned firms' easy access to long-term debt is positively associated with long-term investment and negatively associated with firm performance.

As the more powerful power, however, the sanctioner could take the lead rather than react to the action of the target. Borrowing from contract theory, I present a new approach to the sanctioning of a target of unknown type in which the sanctioner explicitly structures the target's options before the target moves. The theory shows that in a situation in which a sanctioning state is ignorant of the target's willingness to comply, it may be able to elicit the revelation of that information through a careful mix of incentives.

The present study offers a new perspective to the debate by drawing upon the rich international experience embodied in World Bank's World Development Indicators database. We find that the price levels of China and the United States are both low relative to the world's average. Therefore, the discrepancy between the price levels of China and the United States has been, in fact, close to zero since 2002. The difference in per capita income can fully account for the price difference between China and the United States. However, the Balassa-Samuelson effect is not a reliable guide for projecting the trend of real appreciation. According to the experience of those economies that have experienced real currency appreciation against the US dollar in 1985-2005. the mode of faster wage growth and inflation is as common as nominal appreciation, far more common for economies with a low initial price level. We do not find empirical evidence to substantiate the claim that low price levels tend to cause external surpluses. But real appreciation has a powerful effect in boosting job creation in the service sector. Therefore, the real appreciation of the Chinese yuan would contribute to restructuring the Chinese economy towards a domestic demand-based growth track. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

That is, fiscal convergence (in the form of persistently similar ratios of government surplus/deficit to GDP) is systematically associated with smoother business cycles.

We evaluate the importance of political-economic factors implicit in the choice of GM food labeling regulations. Using an analytical model, we show that production and trade-related interests play a prominent role in labeling decision-making. This conclusion is validated by an empirical analysis of GM food labeling policy choices. We find that countries producing GM crops are more likely to have less stringent labeling policies. Food and feed exporters to the European Union (EU) and Japan are more likely to have adopted stricter labeling policies. Labeling regulations in Asia and Europe are similar to those of Japan and the EU.

We do this for each time series so that heterogeneous break models are allowed for in the panel. Our results suggest, overwhelmingly, that if we account for a structural break, cross-sectional dependence and choose the break models to be congruent with the data, then the null of stationarity cannot be rejected for all the 14 macroeconomic variables examined in this article.

Our model incorporates the diversity of consumers such that some can purchase the good via the Internet while others cannot. Our main result is as follows. The appearance of e-commerce enhances retail competition and always increases consumer surplus. However, total surplus does not necessarily improve. This is because the equilibrium market division between conventional stores and e-commerce is not socially optimal and efficiency loss of distribution accrues if the population of Internet shoppers is small and/or the cost of e-commerce is high.

By comparing the sign restrictions method to the long-run restriction approach of Gali (Quaterly Journal of Economics (1992) 709-38), we show that the results do not depend on the stochastic specification of the hours worked series or the data sample but only on the identification scheme.","[Straub, Roland] European Cent Bank, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany; Univ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium",European Central Bank; Ghent University,"Straub, R (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Kaiserstr 29, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany.",roland.straub@ecb.int,,,,,,,38,55,61,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,1468-2354,,INT ECON REV,Int.

After a technological improvement, the South still prefers that North does FDI, however longer patent protection may be required to induce FDI which can result in an overall decrease of Southern welfare.

We assume that individual price consumption data is observed for all consumers. It is known that the general consumption model with externalities imposes few restrictions on the observed data, where the consistency requirement is Nash rationalizability. We motivate potential games as an important sub class of games where the family of concave potential games is refutable and imposes stronger restrictions on observed data. We use this framework to extend the analysis of Brown and Matzkin [D. Brown, R. Matzkin, Testable restrictions on the equilibrium manifold, Econometrica 64 (1996) 1249-1262] on refutable pure exchange economies to pure exchange economics with externalities.

However, the results of empirical studies that have sought to document these spillovers have been mixed. One explanation for this variation is that the capacity of domestic firms to absorb spillovers might vary. In the present paper, we explore these issues in the case of China. Aside from being one of the world's leading hosts of foreign direct investment, China makes for an interesting case study because its provinces vary greatly with respect to those factors most commonly held to influence absorptive capacity, such as the initial level of technology in domestic firms. This paper begins by empirically establishing that the spillovers from foreign direct investment do indeed vary across provinces. Threshold values for various factors that influence absorptive capacity factors are then estimated and it is found that conditions in many provinces presently fall short of these values. This provides an obvious focus of attention for China's policy-makers.","[Qi, Jianhong; Zheng, Yingmei; Li, Hong] Shandong Univ, Sch Econ, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China; [Laurenceson, James] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",Shandong University; University of Queensland,"Qi, JH (通讯作者)，Shandong Univ, Sch Econ, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China.",qijianhong@sdu.edu.cn; ymzheng@sdu.edu.cn; j.laurenceson@uq.edu.au; susan0536@163.com,,"Laurenceson, James/0000-0002-3991-0082",,,,,27,16,17,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2009,17.0,4,,,,,18,35,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2009.01156.x,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,472XY,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268167800002,0

Our main result is that the mobility of young adults crucially depends on the presence of a sibling. Siblings compete in location and employment decisions to direct parental care decisions towards their preferred outcome. Only children are not exposed to this kind of competition. This causes an equilibrium in which siblings exhibit higher mobility than only children, and also have better labour market outcomes.

Continuing increases in average grades have been widely documented in many universities over the last several decades. Also widely documented, and often associated with grade inflation, are systematic differences in grade levels by field of study, with a common belief that the sciences and math grade harder than the social sciences, which in turn grade harder than the humanities - and that economics behaves more like the natural sciences than like the social sciences. The general persistence of these relative differences in grades seem to us to be more interesting and more difficult to explain than the persistence of modest grade inflation in general, and they are the principal focus of this paper. Why, for example, should average grades in English be much higher than average grades in chemistry? And what is going on when relative grades change, when a department's grading practices change markedly relative to other departments?

However, there is no evidence of positive spillover when employment share is used as a proxy for foreign presence. Furthermore, significant negative spillover effects are related to higher employment shares of wholly foreign-owned establishments.

Nonetheless, we should not downplay the differences between the two kinds of optimization. Otherwise, we would fail to capture the role of rationality in the development of the organism and possibly its implication for evolution.","Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University,"Khalil, E (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",elias.khalil@buseco.monash.edu.au,"Khalil, Elias/ABA-3606-2021; Khalil, Elias L/I-7075-2012","Khalil, Elias/0000-0002-0510-447X;",,,,,98,8,11,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

The time varying risk premia in Singapore dollar is modeled using non-Gaussian signal plus noise models that encompass non-normality and time varying volatility. The results from signal plus noise models show statistically significant evidence of time varying risk premium in Singapore forward exchange rates although we failed to reject the hypotheses of no risk premium in the series. The results from Gaussian versions of these models are not much different and are in line with Wolff (1987) who also used the same methodology in Gaussian settings. Our results show statistically significant evidence of volatility clustering in Singapore forward exchange rates. The results from Gaussian signal plus noise models also show statistically significant evidence of volatility clustering and non-normality in Singapore forward foreign exchange rates. Additional tests on the series show that exclusion of conditional heteroskedasticity from the signal plus noise models leads to false statistical inferences.","Univ W Indies, Dept Econ, Kingston 7, Jamaica",University West Indies Mona Jamaica,"Kiani, KM (通讯作者)，Univ W Indies, Dept Econ, Kingston 7, Jamaica.",mkkiani@yahoo.com,,,,,,,37,1,1,0,7,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

This paper extends this knowledge by providing evidence on the Vietnamese experience of food security, undernourishment and poverty from the late 1990s to the early part of the new millennium. The results suggest that poor households did not experience increases in food consumption, calorie intake and dietary diversity of the same magnitude as non-poor households. Nevertheless, Vietnam experienced impressive reductions in both calorie deprivation and expenditure poverty at the turn of the century. Non-poor households, in particular, experienced spectacular increases in calorie intake and dietary diversity during the period 1997/1998-2004. This paper also reports regression results which point to the role of urbanization and improvement in education levels in promoting dietary diversity and nutrient intake. The present study finds evidence of sharp regional differences in calorie intake and calorie costs, which suggests that the authorities should set provincial poverty lines, contrary to the current practice adopted by Vietnam's General Statistical Office.","[Mishra, Vinod] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Berwick, Vic 3806, Australia; [Ray, Ranjan] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University; Monash University,"Mishra, V (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Berwick Campus, Berwick, Vic 3806, Australia.",Vinod.Mishra@buseco.monash.edu.au; Ranjan.Ray@buseco.monash.edu.au,"Mishra, Vinod/D-1221-2011","Mishra, Vinod/0000-0002-4686-5195; Ray, Ranjan/0000-0002-0411-6268",,,,,19,31,31,1,17,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1351-3958,,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

So rather than taking an 'explicit microfoundations' approach, in which individuals are represented as 'white-box' sources of fully-specified optimizing behavior ('rational agents'), we instead represent individuals as 'black box' sources of unpredictable noise subject to objective constraints ('zero-intelligence agents'). To illustrate the potential of the approach we examine a parsimonious, agent-based macroeconomic model with implicit microfoundations.

First, when the cost is low, the economy is characterized by high levels of upward mobility and inequality, and a low tax burden supported by the poor with prospects for upward mobility. Second, when the cost is high, there are multiple equilibria with various patterns of upward mobility, inequality and redistribution.

(1987). Cointegration and tests of present value models. Journal of Political Economy, 95(5):1062-1088.), empirical analysis of interest rates has been conducted in the framework of cointegration. However, parts of this approach have been questioned recently, as the adjustment mechanism may not follow a simple linear rule: another line of criticism points out that stationarity of the spreads is difficult to maintain empirically. In this paper, we analyse data on US bond yields by means of an augmented VAR specification which approximates a generic nonlinear adjustment model. We argue that nonlinearity captures macro information via the shape of the yield curve and thus provides an alternative explanation for some findings that recently appeared in the literature. Moreover, we show how conditional heteroskedasticity can be taken into account via GARCH specifications for the conditional variance, either univariate or multivariate. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Consumption levels obviously increased due to substantially higher incomes, but it is less clear how the shares of different types of goods purchased have changed or whether Ireland's consumption mix has converged with that of other high-income countries. Rankings based on a simple distance measure of consumption similarity suggest that Ireland moved from a low-income pattern similar to Portugal or Greece to a high-income pattern like that of Canada between 1995 and 2003. Using static and dynamic Almost Ideal Demand System models, we first estimate long- and short-run Irish price and income elasticities for nine categories of commodities between 1976 and 2003. These results provide evidence of substantial habit formation in aggregate consumption. We then estimate a long-run cross-country model covering six aggregate commodity groups between 1975 and 2003. The analysis shows that Ireland's demand parameters remain more similar to those of Greece than to higher-income OECD countries in the sample. Although Ireland has overtaken most other OECD countries in per capita income, it is still converging to a higher-income consumption pattern. We foresee further convergence of Irish expenditure patterns towards a pattern typical of high-income countries. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We show that these paradoxes are specific examples of more general classes of network change properties that we term the least congestible route and size principles, respectively. We find that technical improvements to networks induce adjustments in traffic flows. In the case of network changes based on the Pigou-Knight-Downs Paradox, these adjustments undermine short-term payoff improvements. In the case of network changes based on the Braess Paradox, these adjustments reinforce the counter-intuitive, but theoretically predicted, effect of reducing payoffs to network users. Although aggregate traffic flows are close to equilibrium levels, we see some systematic deviations from equilibrium. We show that the qualitative features of these discrepancies can be accounted for by a simple reinforcement learning model. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Communication between competing teams may lead to collusion, thereby reducing efforts.

The neoconservative agenda of promoting democratization in resource-rich Countries thus offers the hopeful prospect of a better rise of their economic Opportunities. This paper examines whether the effect of democracy on economic performance is distinctive in resource-rich societies. We show that a priori the sign of the effect is ambiguous: Resource rents could either enhance or undermine the economic consequences of democracy. We therefore investigate the issue empirically. We first build a new dataset on country-specific resource rents, annually for the period 1970-2001. Using a global panel dataset, we find that in developing countries the combination of high natural resource rents and open democratic systems has been growth-reducing. Checks and balances offset this adverse effect. Thus, resource-rich economies need a distinctive form of democracy with particularly Strong checks and balances. Unfortunately, this is rare: Checks and balances are public goods and so are liable to be undersupplied in new democracies. Over time they are eroded by resource rents. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This is a weaker condition than the restriction of equal consumption imposed by Radner (Econometrica 36(1), 31-58, 1968), therefore, some no trade situations are avoided and the efficiency of trade increases.","[Correia-da-Silva, Joao] Univ Porto, CEMPRE, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal; [Correia-da-Silva, Joao] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal; [Herves-Beloso, Carlos] Univ Vigo, RGEA, Fac Econ, Vigo 36310, Spain",Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto; Universidade de Vigo,"Correia-Da-Silva, J (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, CEMPRE, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal.",joao@fep.up.pt; cherves@uvigo.es,"Correia-da-Silva, Joao/B-5940-2009; Herves-Beloso, Carlos/H-8410-2015","Correia-da-Silva, Joao/0000-0001-6040-2384; Herves-Beloso, Carlos/0000-0002-4849-4033",,,,,28,22,24,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Each member chooses an action, bears its cost, and receives a share of the revenue which the members' actions generate. A (pure-strategy) equilibrium of the game may be inefficient: surplus (revenue minus the sum of costs) may be less than maximal. In a previous paper, we found that for a wide class of reward functions, no one squanders at an inefficient equilibrium (spends more than at an efficient profile) if the revenue function has a complementarity property. In the present paper, we examine the opposite of the complementarity property (Substitutes) and we study a class of finite games where squandering equilibria indeed occur if Substitutes holds strongly enough. Squandering equilibria play a key role when one traces the effect of technological improvement on a sharing game's surplus shortfall. We then turn to the question of choice among reward functions in a principal/agents setting. We find that if we again assume complementarity then strong conclusions can be reached about the reward functions preferred by society, by the players (agents), and by the principal.","[Marschak, Thomas] Univ Calif Berkeley, Walter A Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Courtney, Dennis] Univ Iowa, Dept Math, Iowa City, IA USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Iowa,"Marschak, T (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Walter A Haas Sch Business, 350 Barrows Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",marschak@haas.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,1434-4750,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

In the model to be developed here, we will do some modifications to the basic structure of the standard Kaldorian cumulative causation model. First of all, as suggested by Palley (2002), we will add two new equations to the standard model with the purpose to analyze the dynamics of the economy's productive capacity. Second, we will suppose that the rate of change of nominal wages is not uniform in the world economy, but that it is country-specific. In this setting, we will suppose that domestic Labor Unions can manage to fix the rate of change in nominal wages at a rate equal to the inflation rate of the last period plus all the productivity gains occurred in the last period. Third, we will suppose an economy that operates under a floating exchange-rate regime in a setting of restricted (imperfect) capital mobility due to the presence of some form of capital controls. Finally, we will suppose that monetary policy is conducted under the institutional framework of an inflation targeting regime, and the Central Bank sets nominal interest rates at each period based on a version of the so-called Taylor rule.","Univ Brasilia, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia,"Oreiro, JLD (通讯作者)，Univ Brasilia, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",jlcoreiro@terra.com.br,"Oreiro, José Luis Da Costa/HRC-2082-2023",,,,,,18,0,1,0,2,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC ECONOMIA",MEXICO,"CIRCUITO INTERIOR S-N EDIFICIO B, PRIMER PISO, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO, DISTRITO FEDERAL 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

Because self-selection is quantitatively important, I further hold constant variables plausibly affected by fraternity membership, such as current alcohol use categorization, ranging from abstainer to heavy drinker, and time spent socializing. Even in the fully saturated model, fraternity membership significantly increases drinking intensity, frequency, and recency, as well as the prevalence of many deleterious drinking consequences that potentially carry negative externalities.

When evaluated on cross-sections of stock returns, the model generates economically large unconditional Euler equation errors. Unlike the equity premium puzzle, these large Euler equation errors cannot be resolved with high values of risk aversion. To explain why the standard model fails, we need to develop alternative models that can rationalize its large pricing errors. We evaluate whether four newer theories at the vanguard of consumption-based asset pricing can explain the large Euler equation errors of the standard consumption-based model. In each case, we find that the alternative theory counterfactually implies that the standard model has negligible Euler equation errors. We show that the models miss on this dimension because they mischaracterize the joint behavior of consumption and asset returns in recessions, when aggregate consumption is falling. By contrast, a simple model in which aggregate consumption growth and stockholder consumption growth are highly correlated most of the time, but have low or negative correlation in severe recessions, produces violations of the standard model's Euler equations and departures from joint lognormality that are remarkably similar to those found in the data.

Econometric analysis shows that this country effect is largely linked to the quality of the countries' national government institutions.

They differ in market design and structure, market governance, margin requirements, position limits, delivery process, and the way in which the settlement price is calculated. Furthermore, with a unique dataset, we show that prior to maturities of government bond futures, traders began to accumulate significant amounts of long positions for several selected contracts without the intention to offset, forcing short position holders to either purchase deliverable bonds or offset futures at highly inflated prices, causing higher market volatility and price disequilibrium in both spot and futures markets. Arbitrage opportunity arises and the market eventually collapses.

This negative correlation has been interpreted as empirical support for the hypothesis that marriage market conditions influence intra-household allocation decisions. Given the similarity of cultures and of labor supply behavior of women in Canada and the United States, and the fact that they both experienced baby-booms at roughly the same time, any explanation for changes in female labor supply would be expected to hold for both countries. We test the prediction that marriage market conditions have explanatory power for Canadian female labor force participation (LFP) rates over the period 1971-2001.

The goal is to strike a good balance between reduced costs and reduced risk. The method of analysis that has been advocated and adopted for such studies is the mean-variance portfolio analysis pioneered by Markowitz (Markowitz, H., 1952. Portfolio selection. journal of Finance 7(1) 77-91). However the standard mean-variance methodology, does not account for the ability of various fuels/technologies to adapt to varying loads. Such analysis often provides results that are easily dismissed by regulators and practitioners as unacceptable, since load cycles play critical roles in fuel selection. To account for such issues and still retain the convenience and elegance of the mean-variance approach, we propose a variant of the mean-variance analysis using the decomposition of the load into various types and utilizing the load factors of each load type. We also illustrate the approach using data for the state of Indiana and demonstrate the ability of the model in providing useful insights. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We use data collected by a marketing firm on all food purchases brought into the home for a large, nationally representative sample of U.K. households in 2006. We are interested in how consumer choice affects the measurement of price changes. In particular, a standard price index based on a fixed basket of goods will overstate the rise in the true cost of living because it does not properly consider sales and bulk purchasing.

Moving beyond previous economic models that treat children as goods consumed by adults, we develop a noncooperative model of parental control of child behavior and child resistance. Using child reports of decision-making and psychological and cognitive measures from the NLSY79 Child Supplement, we examine the determinants of shared and sole decision-making based on indices created from seven domains of child activity. We find that the determinants of sole decision-making by the child and shared decision-making with parents are quite distinct: sharing decisions appears to be a form of parental investment in child development rather than a simple stage in the transfer of authority. In addition, we find that indicators of child capabilities and preferences affect reports of decision-making authority in ways that suggest child demand for autonomy as well as parental discretion in determining these outcomes.","[Lundberg, Shelly] Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Romich, Jennifer L.] Univ Washington, Sch Social Work, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Tsang, Kwok Ping] Virginia Tech, Dept Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Lundberg, S (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",lundberg@u.washington.edu; romich@u.washington.edu; byront@vt.edu,,"Tsang, Kwok Ping/0000-0002-0045-6185",,,,,35,37,42,0,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Here, I show that simultaneous consideration of the two elaborations (generalization and extension) obtains a unique Shapley-type value for games in partition function form. The key requirement is that the Extended, Generalized Shapley Value (EGSV) should be recursive: the EGSV of any game should be the EGSV of itself. This requirement forces us to ignore all but the payoffs to bilateral partitions. The EGSV can be conceptualized as the ex ante value of a process of successive bilateral amalgamations.

Offshoring is associated with reduced feedback from offshored plants to domestic labs as well as coordination problems between the offshored and domestic divisions of firms. Production and transport cost parameters affect the static decision to relocate plants but not R&D. Hence, offshoring may be chosen by firms when it damages the growth rate of their countries of origin. In particular, if offshoring reduces the feedback from plants to labs, it is likely to bring dynamic losses when the countries of origin are large, especially in sectors in which R&D is cheap and product differentiation is strong.

Women, the young, the less skilled, and part-timers are generally most at risk, as are those who work in retail, hotels, catering, and personal services. However, the relative importance of these characteristics can vary from country to country. The incidence of low pay varies considerably across countries, as does its trend. No direct link is found to aggregate employment or to the employment rate of the less skilled. Nor does the industrial structure of employment have much effect. However, differences between the low-wage production of goods and of services are important. 'Inclusive' labour relations are central in containing the incidence of low-pay. By inclusiveness is meant the existence of mechanisms, formal or informal, to extend terms and conditions negotiated by workers with strong bargaining power to workers with less bargaining power. In some countries a national minimum wage is an essential accompaniment. The article considers the extent to which countries can maintain the more benign institutions that limit low pay.","[Salverda, Wiemer] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Adv Labour Studies, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Mayhew, Ken] Univ Oxford, Pembroke Coll, Oxford & SKOPE, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Amsterdam; University of Oxford,"Salverda, W (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Adv Labour Studies, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",w.salverda@uva.nl; ken.mayhew@pmb.ox.ac.uk,"Salverda, Wiemer/E-4364-2013",,ESRC [ES/G020183/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G020183/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,43,35,37,1,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

We argue that since monetary assets began yielding interest, the simple sum monetary aggregates have had no foundations in economic theory and have sequentially produced one source of misunderstanding after another. The bad data produced by simple sum aggregation have contaminated research in monetary economics, have resulted in needless paradoxes, and have produced decades of misunderstandings in international monetary economics research and policy. While better data, based correctly on index number theory and aggregation theory, now exist, the official central bank data most commonly used have not improved in most parts of the world. While aggregation theoretic monetary aggregates exist for internal use at the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and many other central banks throughout the world, the only central banks that currently make aggregation theoretic monetary aggregates available to the public are the Bank of England and the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank. No other area of economics has been so seriously damaged by data unrelated to valid index number and aggregation theory. In this paper we chronologically review the past research in this area and connect the data errors with the resulting policy and inference errors. Future research on monetary aggregation and policy can most advantageously focus on extensions to exchange rate risk and its implications for multilateral aggregation over monetary asset portfolios containing assets denominated in more than one currency. The relevant theory for multilateral aggregation with exchange rate risk has been derived by Barnett (J Econom 136(2):457-482, 2007) and Barnett and Wu (Ann Finance 1:35-50, 2005).","[Barnett, William A.] Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Chauvet, Marcelle] Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University of Kansas; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Barnett, WA (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",Barnett@ku.edu,"Chauvet, Marcelle/AAG-8251-2019; Barnett, William/GWU-7996-2022","Chauvet, Marcelle/0000-0002-2548-5679;",,,,,50,8,8,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

We estimate the effect of the reform using a product level panel dataset, covering the drugs exposed to RP and a large number of drugs still under PC regulation in the time before and after the policy change. Our results show that RP significantly reduces both brand-name and generic prices within the reference group, with the effect being stronger for brand-names. We also identify a negative cross-price effect on therapeutic substitutes not included in the RP system. In terms of policy implications, the results suggest that RP is more effective than PC regulation in lowering drug prices, while the cross-price effect raises a concern about patent protection.

In our model, agents choose to commit crimes if their privately observed utility from doing so is high enough. A crime generates noisy evidence, and defendants are convicted when the realized amount of evidence is sufficiently strong to establish the probability of guilt beyond a fixed threshold. We show that if convicted offenders are incarcerated, poorer individuals face a strong prior prejudice in trials and are therefore convicted with less evidence than richer individuals. At the same time, they commit crimes more frequently. Penalties such as monetary fines can eliminate this bias, but may also reverse it. We fully characterize the penalty schedule that guarantees an unbiased equilbrium. We extend the model such that agents also differ in characteristics such as race or gender. We show biased outcomes (targeted at subgroups of the population) may still exist, even if all members of the population are ex-ante alike in their economic characteristics. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Such investments have facilitated business firms' making greater use of e-trade systems and improving their management performance. The objective of this paper is to review the mechanics of how e-trade practices can affect a firms performance. It is well known that the introduction of e-trade systems can decrease transaction costs at the macro level, because in many cases, data sets, are compiled from a collection of individual transactions. However, this review attempts to determine whether trade transaction costs influence exporting firms' performance at the firm level. A theoretical framework is suggested for determining the usage and performance of global e-trade. An empirical analysis of South Korean exporting firms has been undertaken. This paper concludes that e-trade has yet to overcome the barriers resulting from transaction costs, and that it is therefore very important to increase both organizational information and global capabilities.

To this end, we study whether this set of countries is characterized by business cycle synchronization with the occurrence of common shocks, a strong similarity in the adjustment process and the convergence of policy responses. We focus especially our attention on two points. First, we try to determine to what extent international disturbances influence the domestic business cycles through trade and/or financial channels.

Rapid growth in both the number and the proportion of all elderly minority populations are expected. By 2050, one-third of the elderly population will be other than a non-Hispanic White. While existing literature primarily focuses on the demographics and living arrangements of the White elderly population, this study attempts to show the diversity and differences in economic and cultural patterns among the minority elderly population and the implications of such diversity on the living arrangements of the elderly. The data show variations in elderly living arrangements in minority population groups by gender, and across and within the groups themselves. Such differences in living arrangements have important policy implications on both macro and micro level.","[Mitra, Aparna] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Bicket, Mark C.] Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Medicine,"Mitra, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, 729 Elm Ave,329 Hester Hall, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",amitra@ou.edu,,"Bicket, Mark/0000-0001-9406-5953",,,,,13,3,9,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Several African countries have introduced reforms in the cotton sector to improve its quality and competitiveness. The impact of these reforms has been virtually nullified because the WTO members continue to apply support measures and subsidies that distort global market prices. These are the arguments behind the African Cotton Initiative (ACI) proposed in 2003 and 2006 WTO Ministerial meetings. Specifically, the ACI proposed (a) phasing out the rich countries' cotton domestic supports; (b) duty and quota free access for African countries' cotton to developed countries' markets; and (c) removal of rich countries' cotton export subsidies. In contrast, the Doha Round Reductions agreed upon in 2005 WTO Ministerial meetings in Hong Kong are (a) all forms of export subsidies for cotton will be eliminated by developed countries; and (b) developed countries will give duty and quota free access for cotton exports from the least-developed countries (LDCs). This paper uses a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Zambian economy to study the impact of the Doha Round (DR) agreement and the ACI proposal on the cotton sector in Zambia and to contribute to the analysis of further agricultural trade liberalization and its implications for poor countries. The results show that Zambian cotton export price and exports rise, respectively, by 4.23% and 11.12% in the DR scenario and 15.65% and 43.2% in the ACI scenario. The labor employment in the cotton sector increases by 12.52% and 52.06% in the DR and ACI scenarios, respectively, which is highly beneficial as Zambia is enduring 50% unemployment rate. Liberalization in the cotton world market also increases the GDP and rural household welfare.","[Blasco, Lorea; Devadoss, Stephen; Stodick, Leroy] Univ Idaho, Dept Agr Econ, Moscow, ID 83843 USA",Idaho; University of Idaho,"Devadoss, S (通讯作者)，Univ Idaho, Dept Agr Econ, Moscow, ID 83843 USA.",devadoss@uidaho.edu,,,,,,,34,3,3,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.
