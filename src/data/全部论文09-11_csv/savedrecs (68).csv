The aim of this work is to highlight the interactions that may take place among siblings when deciding whether or not to become a caregiver. We look at families with two children using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe; our sample contains 314 dependent elderly and their 628 adult children. In order to identify the interactions between siblings, we have specified a two-person discrete game model. To estimate this model, without invoking the 'coherency' condition, we have added an endogenous selection rule to solve the incompleteness problem arising from multiplicity or absence of equilibrium. Our empirical results suggest that the three classical effects identified by Manski could potentially explain the observed correlation between the siblings' caregiving behaviour. Correlated effects alone appear to be weak. Contextual interactions and endogenous interactions reveal cross-effects. The asymmetric character of the endogenous interactions is Our most striking result. The Younger child's involvement appears to increase the net benefit of caregiving for the elder one, whereas the elder child's involvement decreases the net benefit of caregiving for the younger child.

Some alternative methods of deriving this property are considered, working from the alternate definition in terms of a fractional pole in the spectrum at the origin. The methods considered involve the use of (i) Fourier transforms of generalized functions, (ii) asymptotic expansions of Fourier integrals with singularities, (iii) direct evaluation using hypergeometric function algebra. and (iv) conversion to a simple gamma integral. The paper is largely pedagogical but some novel methods and results involving complete asymptotic series representations are presented. The formulae are useful in many ways, including the calculation of long run variation matrices for multivariate time series with long memory and the econometric estimation of such models.

The approximation is based on higher-order asymptotic theory under double asymptotics. While first-order theory under double asymptotics provides information about the bias, it does not provide enough information about the variance of the estimator. Higher-order theory enables us to obtain information about the variance. From this result, a procedure for choosing the number of instruments is proposed. The simulations confirm that the proposed procedure improves the precision of the estimator. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

There is a moderate and steady decline in mean health until the age of 70 or so and a steep acceleration in the rate of deterioration thereafter. In southern Europe and Ireland, where development has been most rapid, the average health of generations born in more recent decades is significantly better than that of older generations. This is not observed in the northern European countries. In almost all countries, health is more dispersed among older generations indicating that Europe has experienced a reduction in overall health inequality over time. Although there is no consistent evidence that health inequality increases as a given cohort ages, this is true in the three largest countries-UK, France and Germany. In the former two countries and the Netherlands, at least for males, the income gradient in health peaks around retirement age, as in the US. In most European countries, unlike the US, there is no evidence that income-related health inequality is greater among younger than older generations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Ill most Studies technical change is measured by a proxy, namely a time trend. In practice however, innovations slowly spread over all hospitals and so different hospitals are operating under different technologies at the same point in time. In this study we explicitly inventory specific and well-known innovations in the Dutch hospital industry ill the past tell years. These innovations are aggregated into a limited number of homogenous innovation clusters, which are measured by a set of technology index numbers. The index numbers are included in the cost function specification and estimation. The results indicate that technical change is non-neutral and output-biased and that some technologies affect cost in beneficial ways. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[Blank, Jos L.

Translating Research into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD), a multi-site study of managed care patients with diabetes, is among the first to assess self-care time. Objective: To examine associations between socioeconomic position and extra time patients spend on foot care, shopping/cooking, and exercise due to diabetes. Data: Eleven thousand nine hundred and twenty-seven patient surveys from 2000 to 2001. Methods: Bayesian two-part models were used to estimate associations of self-reported extra time spent on self-care with race/ethnicity, education, and income, controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics. Results: Proportions of patients spending no extra time on foot care, shopping/cooking, and exercise were, respectively, 37, 52, and 31%. Extra time spent on foot care and shopping/cooking was greater among racial/ethnic minorities, less-educated and lower-income patients. For example, African-Americans were about 10 percentage points more likely to report spending extra time on foot care than whites and extra time spent was about 3 min more per day. Discussion: Extra time spent on self-care was greater for socioeconomically disadvantaged patients than for advantaged patients, perhaps because their perceived opportunity cost of time is lower or they cannot afford Substitutes. Our findings suggest that poorly controlled diabetes risk factors among disadvantaged populations may not be attributable to self-care practices.

The index theta of an EVaR is the relative cost of the expected margin shortfall and hence reflects the level of prudentiality. It is also shown that a given expectile corresponds to the quantiles with distinct tail probabilities under different distributions. Thus, an EVaR may be interpreted as a flexible QVaR, in the sense that its tail probability is determined by the underlying distribution, We further consider conditional EVaR and propose various Conditional AutoRegressive Expectile models that can accommodate some stylized facts in financial time series. For model estimation, we employ the method of asymmetric least squares proposed by Newey and Powell [Newey, W.K., Powell, J.L, 1987. Asymmetric least squares estimation and testing. Econometrica 55, 819-847] and extend their asymptotic results to allow for stationary and weakly dependent data. We also derive an encompassing test for non-nested expectile models. As an illustration, we apply the proposed modeling approach to evaluate the EVaR of stock Market indices. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

To test the sensitivity of statistical results to common research methods in retrospective database analyses. Comparisons of time to all-cause discontinuation (TTAD) across antipsychotic drug therapies are used to illustrate these effects. Data from the California Medicaid Program were used to identify 231,635 episodes of antipsychotic drug therapy. Four sequential analyses of TTAD were performed on all patients, patients with 1 year of post-treatment data, and patients with schizophrenia and using models that included variables documenting drug treatment history. Patients using atypical antipsychotics consistently achieve longer TTAD than patients treated with conventional antipsychotics. Nevertheless, estimated differences narrowed when analyses included only patients with schizophrenia. Risperidone performed better than olanzapine when diagnosis was not limited to schizophrenia, and quetiapine outperformed olanzapine and risperidone when the analysis did not control for treatment history. This latter result reflects the disproportionate use of quetiapine in long-duration augmentation episodes. There were no statistical differences across alternative atypical antipsychotics once the analysis excluded patients without a diagnosis of schizophrenia and included patient treatment history in the analysis. Comparative effectiveness analyses of alternative drug therapies are sensitive to diagnosis and patient drug treatment history. Data on these factors can be derived from paid claims data and should be used to provide more accurate comparisons of effectiveness across drugs and to provide results that cover the full range of clinical scenarios that clinicians face.","[Marshall, Thomas S.] Univ So Calif, Sch Pharm Clin Pharm & Pharmaceut Econ & Policy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Marshall, Thomas S.] Astellas Pharma US Inc, Hlth Econ Outcomes Res, Deerfield, IL USA",University of Southern California; Astellas Pharmaceuticals,"Marshall, TS (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Sch Pharm Clin Pharm & Pharmaceut Econ & Policy, 1540 E Alcazar St, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",jmccombs@usc.edu,,,,,,,20,3,3,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2009,12.0,4,,,,,473,480,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00458.x,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,451JZ,18798808.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000266467800013,0

An approximation is derived for the estimator by which it is expressed as a sum of IID random variables. This approximation allows us to develop a reliable standard error that is simple to compute. A simple but effective bias correction is also derived. The quality of inference based on the approximation is checked in a number of simulation experiments, and is found to be very good unless the tail of the underlying distribution is heavy. Bootstrap methods are presented which alleviate this problem except in cases in which the variance is very large or fails to exist. Similar methods can be used to find reliable standard errors of other indices which are not simply linear functionals of the distribution function, such as Sen's poverty index and its modification known as the Sen-Shorrocks-Thon index.

We improve oil this work by allowing the marginal effect of non-linear BMI groups to vary by gender, age, and type of interpersonal relationships required in each occupation. We use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (1982-1998). We find that the often-reported negative relationship between the BMI and wages is larger in occupations requiring interpersonal skills with presumably more social interactions. Also, the wage penalty increases as the respondents get older beyond their mid-twenties. We show that being overweight and obese penalizes the probability of employment across all race-gender Subgroups except black women and men. Our results for the obesity-wage association can be explained by either consumers or employers having distaste for obese workers.

We introduce a family of representation languages for such orders, parameterized by a scale and an aggregation function. We show how interval orders can be represented by elements of those languages, called weighted bases. We identify the complexity of the main decision problems to be considered for exploiting such representations of interval orders (including the comparison problems and the non-dominance problem). We also show that our representation of interval orders based on weighted bases encompasses the penalty-based representation of complete preorders as a specific case. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A reference coalition of each agent t at a price system p is the subset C(t, p) subset of T consisting of those agents whose income falls into a certain income range associated with t. The interdependence of the taste of agent t operates through a reference consumption vector eta, which represents the aggregated effect on t's taste of the various consumption choices made by all agents in C(t, p). We choose eta = 1/(mu[C(t, p)]) integral(C(t,p)) x(s)d mu(s), the mean consumption bundle of all agents in C(t, p), where x(s) denotes the assignment of a commodity bundle to agent s and where the measure (1/(mu[C(t, p)]))mu may be interpreted as the relative frequencies of contact that t makes with other members in C(t, p).

A baseline survey of 558 cancer patients in Singapore using the FACT-G and EQ-5D was conducted (308 English and 250 Chinese questionnaires). Regression models were used to predict the EQ-5D utility index values based on the FACT-G scores and thus derive a mapping equation. Data from a follow-up survey of the patients were used to validate the results. The FACT-G Social/Family scale was not associated with the EQ-5D utility index (P = 0.701). There was no interaction between language version and the predictors (each P > 0.1). An equation that maps the FACT-G Physical, Emotional, and Functional well-being scales to the EQ-5D utility index was derived. In the validation sample, the mean observed utility values was larger than the mapped by only 0.005 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.006 to 0.016), but the mean absolute difference was 0.083 (95% CI 0.076 to 0.090).

A sample of 120 HIV/AIDS patients was identified at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Disease Institute, Thailand, during September to December, 2004. Face-to-face interviews included VAS, SG, and EQ-5D, HRQOL assessment using the Thai abbreviated version of the World Health Organization quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF THAI) and HIV-related symptom instruments, questions about ease of understanding HU approaches and sociodemographic items. Data were analyzed with repeated-measures ANOVA, followed by Dunn-Bonferroni t-test, intraclass coefficients (ICC), Spearman's rank correlation, and multiple linear regressions. The mean (95% confidence interval) HUs were as follows: VAS, 0.79 (0.76-0.82); EQ-5D, 0.80 (0.77-0.84); and SG, 0.65 (0.60-0.70). A significant difference in HU by method was found (P < 0.001). Agreement by ICC was 0.71 for VAS versus EQ-5D, 0.41 for VAS versus SG, and 0.38 for EQ-5D and SG. The regression models showed that WHOQOL-BREF THAI, frequency of HIV symptoms, and patient characteristics could explain approximately 50% of the variation in the VAS and the EQ-5D and 20% in the SG(2). Among these three HU methods, the SG was the most difficult task. VAS, EQ-5D and SG yielded different HUs for this sample. VAS and EQ-5D showed stronger construct validity with other health measures than SG. From a feasibility perspective, the SG was the least satisfactory of the three approaches.","[Sakthong, Phantipa; Sakulbumrungsil, Rungpetch] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Schommer, Jon C.; Gross, Cynthia R.] Univ Minnesota, Coll Pharm, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Prasithsirikul, Wisit] Bamrasnaradura Infect Dis Inst, Nonthaburi, Thailand",Chulalongkorn University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Sakthong, P (通讯作者)，Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Prayathai Rd, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.",phantipa_sakthong@yahoo.com,"Prasithsirikul, Wisit/AAH-6284-2020; Sakulbumrungsil, Rungpetch/ABH-7008-2020",,University of Minnesota Melendy Scholarship program; University of Minnesota Managed Care Pharmaceutical Outcomes Fellowship program; Thai Government Scholar program,University of Minnesota Melendy Scholarship program(University of Minnesota System); University of Minnesota Managed Care Pharmaceutical Outcomes Fellowship program(University of Minnesota System); Thai Government Scholar program,"During her graduate studies, Dr. Sakthong was funded through the University of Minnesota Melendy Scholarship program, the University of Minnesota Managed Care Pharmaceutical Outcomes Fellowship program, and the Thai Government Scholar program.",,49,17,19,0,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2009,12.0,2,,,,,377,384,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00440.x,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,408WY,20667064.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000263467500026,0

The procedure is based on a novel lack-of-fit criterion, namely, the simulated mean squared error of predictions (SMSEP), taking into account the complexity of structural econometric models. It is asymptotically valid for any fixed number of simulations, and allows for any estimator which has a root n asymptotic normality or is n(alpha) -consistent for alpha > 1/2. The test is bi-directional and applicable to non-nested models which are both possibly misspecified. The asymptotic distribution of the test statistic is derived. The proposed test is general, regardless of whether the optimization criteria for estimation of competing models are the same as the SMSEP criterion used for model selection. A Monte Carlo study demonstrates good power and size properties of the test. An empirical application using timber auction data from Oregon illustrates the usefulness and generality of the proposed testing procedure. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, we provide a realistic model of financial distress: firstly, we model Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 bankruptcies as different possible outcomes of financial distress. Secondly, we take into consideration that, in practice, default is not the end, but the beginning of financial distress, eventually leading to a reorganization or a liquidation of a distressed firm. Thirdly and most importantly, we are able to analyze the impact of contagion on an investor's demand for corporate bonds. Contagion is an important phenomenon, as it reduces the investor's ability to diversify his portfolio, and we show that the bond demand can change by more than 50%. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Their empirical strategy usually relied on changes in compulsory schooling laws. Using a French longitudinal dataset, we focus oil the effect of school leaving age on mortality at later ages. The two identifying shocks are the Zay and Berthoin reforms, which respectively raised the minimum school leaving age to 14 and 16 years. We implement a non-parametric regression discontinuity design, comparing cohorts born immediately before or after the reforms, and a parametric two-stage approach using information from a larger part Of our sample. None of these approaches reveals a significant causality of education on health. Despite the fact that these reforms increased education levels, and that subsequent declines in mortality are observed, none of these declines appears to be significant. We conclude with a discussion on possible limitations of these two reforms as identifying devices. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The NETT compared lung-volume-reduction surgery plus medical therapy with medical therapy alone in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to emphysema. One thousand sixty-six patients were followed for up to 3 years after randomization. The cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained was obtained, computing costs from a societal perspective and using the self-administered Quality of Well Being questionnaire to measure quality of life. Different methods of imputation resulted in substantial differences in ICERs as well as differences in estimates of the uncertainty in the point estimates as reflected in the CEA acceptability curves.

This study reviews the current understanding of the burden of migraine in the U.S., the history of economic understanding of migraine treatment and identifies emergent trends for future studies evaluating clinical and economic outcomes of migraine treatment. This study traced the history of economic articles published on migraine by performing a literature search using PubMed MEDLINE database and ancestral searches of relevant articles. The intention was not to provide an exhaustive review of every article or adjudicate between studies with different findings. Migraine affects millions of individuals worldwide, generally during the most productive years of a person's life. Studies show that migraineurs are underdiagnosed, undertreated, and experience substantial decreases in functioning and productivity, which in turn translates into diminished quality of life for individuals, and financial burdens to both health-care systems and employers. Economic evaluations of migraine therapies have evolved with new clinical developments beginning with cognitive-behavioral therapy, introduction of triptans, concern over medication overuse, and emergence of migraine prophylaxis. Now recent clinical studies suggest that migraine may be a progressive disease with cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and long-term neurologic effects. Migraine imposes a substantial burden on patients, families, employers and societies. The economic standards by which migraine and treatment are evaluated have evolved in response to clinical developments. Emerging evidence suggests that migraine is a chronic and progressive disease. If confirmed, approaches to acute and prophylactic treatments and economic evaluations of migraine treatment may require major reconsideration.","[Hazard, Elisabeth; Munakata, Julie] IMS Consulting, Falls Church, VA 22046 USA; [Bigal, Marcelo E.; Lipton, Richard B.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Neurol, Bronx, NY 10467 USA; [Bigal, Marcelo E.; Lipton, Richard B.] Montefiore Headache Ctr, Bronx, NY USA; [Rupnow, Marcia F.

In 1993, the concept of E-commerce was introduced by government. From 1995, e-business has been developed very rapidly in Mainland China and the first online transaction in China was done in 1996. In 1998, the E-commerce demonstration project between enterprises aiming to promote informatics of the national economy was initiated. The transfer of E-commerce from concept to practice started in 1999. The E-commerce models were expanded from B2C to C2C (auction online) and B2B (emerged at the end of 1999). The development of E-commerce showed a sound momentum in China. However, the fracture of the Internet bubble of 2000 seriously impacted the development of E-commerce. While with the rising of value-added service and the maturation of operating environment, E-commerce developed rapidly since 2002. China's international trade, fuelled by the activities of multinational enterprises in the country, has grown incessantly. Consequently, the need for effective technological innovation, including e-commerce solutions, has also grown. With China's entry into WTO, electronic commerce becomes an indispensable premise for China to build a modem, competitive, knowledge-driven economy, and integrate its national economy into an increasingly networked, knowledge-based global economy. From the percentage of netizen living in Mainland China, China's e-business starts to enter in to a new stage of development. According to the Survey Report on Internet Development in Mainland China released by CNNIC on July 2008, 63.29 million and 25.0% of global netizen in China favor online shopping. So, online shopping has risen to one of the top ten net applications. Even, with the improvement of the overall online shopping environment in China, the online shopping market especially for recent or future online customers need some improvement. According to CNNIC, the online shopping penetration rate of economically developed cities is even higher. In June 2007, the using rate of Shanghai netizen of online shopping reached 45.2%, and Shanghai became the city with the highest penetration rate of online shopping. The second city is Beijing, in which netizen using rate of online shopping is 38.9%. This research will focus on E-Business trends and development of Chinese electronics business to promote online customers satisfaction, also examines the current status of Internet, finds the factors that lead to the current situation in terms of government policy orientation, identifies the major barriers to E-commerce adoption in China, and proposes strategies toward greater success of E-commerce in China, especially for internet users. Nowadays, China starts to enter in to a new stage, otherwise it will be necessary to maintain, develop, and respond to the need of online customers, because there still some local constraint. We need to be aware that ecommerce is influenced by the environmental restraints, such as the government regulation, the payment system, and the logistics systems. Many organizations believe that e-business can provide opportunities to improve customer service operations by enabling them to get closer to the customer and enhance the organization-to-customer contact experience in the future.","[Joma, Sam Igor] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology,,jomasamigor@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,8,0,0,1,33,ALFRED UNIV,ALFRED,"ONE SAXON DR, ALFRED, NY 14802 USA",,,978-0-9800510-2-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,94,99,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science,BJZ06,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267479300014,0

It is established that the samples, which are made of forming mass with 7% absolute humidity, are being formed at 16 MPa and higher formation pressure. Heat conductivity and bending strength of the samples formed at 16 + 35 MPa pressure increases enhancing formation pressure. Heat conductivity and bending strength of the samples formed at pressure over 35 MPa reduces enhancing formation pressure. When absolute humidity of a sample increases, heat conductivity also increases and increases the most to the samples formed at 35 MPa pressure.

(1996), which has been suggested as a solution to the finite sample bias problems of the two-step GMM estimator. We show that the estimator should be expected to perform poorly in finite samples under weak identification, in particular, the estimator is not guaranteed to have finite moments of any order. We propose the Regularized CUE (RCUE) as a solution to this problem. The RCUE solves a modification of the first-order conditions for the CUE estimator and is shown to be asymptotically equivalent to CUE under many weak moment asymptotics. Our theoretical findings are confirmed by extensive Monte Carlo studies.

We introduce the concepts of admissible error function and generalized certainty equivalent, which allow us to analyze two different criteria, a cardinal and an ordinal one, when defining suitable approximations to expected utility values. Contrary to the standard literature requirements for irrational preferences, adjustment errors arise in a natural way within our setting, their existence following directly from the disconnectedness of the range of the utility functions. Conditions for the existence of minimal errors are also studied. Our results imply that neither the cardinal nor the ordinal criterion do necessarily provide the same evaluation for two or more different prospects with the same expected utility value. As a consequence, a rational decision maker may define two different generalized certainty equivalents when presented with the same prospect in two different occasions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We assume the set of actions to be an interval. Each player has an inclination to choose one of the actions. Due to the influence among players, the final decision of a player, i.e., his choice of one action, may be different from his original inclination. In particular, a coalition of players with the same inclination may influence another player with different inclination, and as a result of this influence, the decision of the player is closer to the inclination of the influencing coalition than his inclination was. We introduce a measure of such a positive influence of a coalition on a player. Several unanimous influence functions in this generalized framework are considered. Also the set of fixed points under a given influence function is analyzed. Furthermore, we study linear influence functions and discuss their convergence. For a linear unanimous function, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the positive influence of a coalition on a player, and we calculate the value of the influence index. We also introduce a measure of a negative influence of a coalition on a player. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Using data from the 1993 and 1995 waves of the AHEAD, we estimate instrumental variables models and find that a positive permanent income shock lowers nursing home use but increases the utilization of paid home care services. We find some suggestive evidence that the effects are due to substitution of home care for nursing home utilization. The magnitude of these estimates suggests that moderate reductions in post-retirement income would significantly alter long-term utilization patterns among elderly individuals. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We introduce a controlled laboratory experiment to analyse the influence of incentives from fee-for-service and capitation payments on physicians' supply of medical services. In our experiment, physicians choose quantities of medical services for patients with different states of health. We find that physicians provide significantly more services under fee-for-service than under capitation. Patients are overserved under fee-for-service and underserved under capitation. However, payment incentives are not the only motivation for physicians' quantity choices, as patients' health benefits are of considerable importance as well. We find that patients in need of a high (low) level of medical services receive larger health benefits under fee-for-service (capitation). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

(ii) What level of care should be provided in the different arrangements? (iii) How do the answers relate to the severity of dependence? (iv) How can financial strain be mitigated for families with severely dependent members? (v) What is the role of information constraints for the nature and scope of optimal long-term care policy? We consider a theoretical model of long-term care provision under adverse selection to address these challenges. Our main - and remarkably robust - result is that nursing home care facilitates self selection and mitigates and possibly eliminates distortions in caring levels and transfers. Informational asymmetries may thus lead to care being provided too often within institutions rather than within a family context. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A model was constructed based on analysis of an observational dataset. Data were included from four Latin American countries. Responder-level data were analysed according to four categories of symptom severity: Category 1 comprised Daily Record of Severity of Problems score 21 to 41.9, Category 2 score was 42 to 62.9, Category 3 score was 63 to 83.9, and Category 4 was a score of 84 or higher. Burden was estimated in terms of impact on job and activities using the modified work productivity and impairment questionnaire and affect on quality of life using the SF-12 questionnaire. Costs were estimated in Brazilian reals from a Brazilian private health care and societal perspective. The outputs of the analysis were estimates of burden, meanannual cost and affect on quality of life (as measured by quality adjusted life years) by symptom severity. Confidence intervals around key outcomes were generated through nonparametric bootstrapping. Results: Analysis suggests a significant cost burden associated with moderate/severe PMS and PMDD with mean per patient annual costs estimated at 1618 BRL (95% confidence interval 957-2,481). Although the relationship between cost, quality of life, and severity was not clear, analysis showed a consistent relationship between disease severity and measures of disease burden (job and daily activity). Burden on activities increased with disease severity. Conclusions: Our analysis, conducted from a Latin American perspective, suggests a significant burden and an increasing","[Lowin, Julia; Patel, Renu] IMS Hlth, London NW1 6JB, England; [Schiola, Alexandre] Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceut, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Lindemann, Marion] Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceut, Berlin, Germany; [Endicott, Jean] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, New York, NY 10032 USA",Bayer AG; Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals; Bayer AG; Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals; Columbia University,"Lowin, J (通讯作者)，IMS Hlth, 7 Harewood Ave, London NW1 6JB, England.",jlowin@uk.imshealth.com,,,"New York State Departement of Mental Health, New York, NY, USA","New York State Departement of Mental Health, New York, NY, USA","Marion Lindemann and Alexandre Schiola are employees of Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals.

A non-parametric analysis shows clearly that most cataract patients report improved eye-sight after surgery and a parametric analysis provides further information: it shows that the beneficial effect is larger the worse was self-reported eye-sight preceding surgery so that those with very good or excellent eye-sight do not derive immediate benefit. Nevertheless, the long-run effect is suggested to be beneficial. Calibrating the results to existing studies of the effect of imperfect eye-sight on quality of life, the impact of cataract operations on Quality Adjusted Life Years is found to be similar to that established in previous studies and well above the costs of cataract operations in most circumstances.

We show this new consistent estimator is guaranteed to be positive semi-definite and is robust to measurement error of certain types and can also handle non-synchronous trading. It is the first estimator which has these three properties which are all essential for empirical work in this area. We derive the large sample asymptotics of this estimator and assess its accuracy using a Monte Carlo study. We implement the estimator on some US equity data, comparing our results to previous work which has used returns measured over 5 or 10 min intervals.

In 2007 and 2008, state-level smoking bans were gradually introduced in all of Germany's federal states. We exploit this variation to identify the effect that smoke-free policies had on individuals smoking propensity and smoking intensity. Using rich longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study, our difference-in-differences estimates show that the introduction of smoke-free legislation in Germany did not change average smoking behavior within the population. However, our estimates point to important heterogeneous effects. Individuals who go out more often to bars and restaurants did adjust their smoking behavior. Following the ban, they became less likely to smoke and also smoked less. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Our analysis of migration extends previous research by: (i) exploiting the distance-based measures of migration in the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth 1979 (NLSY79); (ii) allowing the effect of migration to differ by schooling level and (iii) using propensity score matching to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATET) for movers and (iv) using local average treatment effect (LATE) estimators with covariates to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) and ATET for compliers. We believe the Conditional Independence Assumption (CIA) is reasonable for our matching estimators since the NLSY79 provides a relatively rich array of variables on which to match. Our matching methods are based on local linear, local cubic, and local linear ridge regressions. Local linear and local ridge regression matching produce relatively similar point estimates and standard errors, while local cubic regression matching badly over-fits the data and provides very noisy estimates. We use the bootstrap to calculate standard errors. Since the validity of the bootstrap has not been investigated for the matching estimators we use, and has been shown to be invalid for nearest neighbor matching estimators, we conduct a Monte Carlo study on the appropriateness of using the bootstrap to calculate standard errors for local linear regression matching. The data generating processes in our Monte Carlo study are relatively rich and calibrated to match our empirical models or to test the sensitivity of our results to the choice of parameter values. The estimated standard errors from the bootstrap are very close to those from the Monte Carlo experiments, which lends support to our using the bootstrap to calculate standard errors in our setting. From the matching estimators we find a significant positive effect of migration on the wage growth of college graduates, and a marginally significant negative effect for high school dropouts. We do not find any significant effects for other educational groups or for the overall sample. Our results are generally robust to changes in the model specification and changes in our distance-based measure of migration. We find that better data matters; if we use a measure of migration based on moving across county lines, we overstate the number of moves, while if we use a measure based on moving across state lines, we understate the number of moves. Further, using either the county or state measures leads to much less precise estimates. We also consider semi-parametric LATE estimators with covariates (Frolich 2007), using two sets of instrumental variables. We precisely estimate the proportion of compliers in our data, but because we have a small number of compliers, we cannot obtain precise LATE estimates. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

I provide conditions under which the relative accuracy of competing estimators can be consistently estimated (as T -> infinity), and show that forecast evaluation tests may be adapted to the problem of ranking these estimators. The proposed methods avoid making specific assumptions about microstructure noise, and facilitate comparisons of estimators that would be difficult using methods from the extant literature, such as those based on different sampling schemes.

In the second stage, doctors and managers interact within either a bargaining or a contracting scenario. In the contracting scenario, managers offer a contract that determines the payment to doctors, and doctors decide how many patients to treat. In the bargaining scenario, doctors and managers strategically negotiate on both the payment to doctors and the number of patients to treat. We derive the equilibrium doctors' payments and number of treated patients under both scenarios. We then derive the optimal contract offered by the government to the hospital in the first stage. Results show that when the cost of capital is sufficiently low, the informational rent is lower, and the social welfare is higher, in the contracting scenario. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Data were analyzed from the Abatacept in Inadequate responders to Methotrexate (AIM) and Abatacept Trial in Treatment of Anti-TNF INadequate responders (ATTAIN) clinical trials of abatacept in patients with RA. Activity participation was evaluated by the validated Activity Participation Questionnaire (APaQ), along with measures of clinical response and health-related quality of life. Changes in the APaQ during the two study periods were compared between treatment groups. Multiple regression analyses were performed to investigate the determinants of change in activity participation. The relationship between clinical efficacy measures (including low disease activity state [LDAS], Disease Activity Score 28-defined remission, and European League Against Rheumatism [EULAR] responses) and changes in activity participation were investigated. Results: Statistically significant, substantive improvements in activity participation were observed over the entire study period in patients treated with abatacept. Abatacept-treated patients showed improvements from baseline of 8.4 and 7.3 days in activity participation, compared with 4.5 and 1.4 days in the placebo group (P < 0.005 vs. placebo in both trials), at the end of AIM and ATTAIN, respectively. The Short Form-36 physical and mental component scores, patient global assessment, and the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index score were found to be the strongest determinants of changes in activity participation. Patients who achieved LDAS, disease remission and good EULAR responses experienced greater improvements in activity participation measures. Conclusions: Abatacept treatment substantively and significantly improved patients' ability to participate in their usual activities. The gain in activity was closely related to improvements in clinical status, physical function and quality of life.

This study investigates the impact of state mental health and SA parity legislation on treatment admission flows and cost-sharing. Fixed effects specifications indicate that mandating comprehensive parity for mental health and SA disorders raises the probability that a treatment admission is privately insured, lowering costs for the individual. Despite some crowd-out of charity care for private insurance, mandates reduce the uninsured probability by a net 2.4 percentage points. States mandating comprehensive parity also see an increase in treatment admissions. Thus, increasing cost-sharing and reducing financial barriers may aid the at-risk population in obtaining adequate SA treatment. Supply constraints mute effect sizes, suggesting that demand-focused interventions need to be complemented with policies supporting treatment providers. These results have implications for the effectiveness of the 2008 Federal Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act in increasing SA treatment admissions and promoting cost-sharing.

Methods: Two clinical studies were pooled. Principal components analyses (Varimax) were conducted on baseline data from each country and from all combined. Factorial structures were compared between countries, and Cronbach alpha values were used to identify item clusters. Four groups of patients were created according to visual acuity (VA) in the best eye (BE < 10/20; BE >= 10/20) and worst eye (WE < 10/100; WE >= 10/100). These groups were used to investigate (analysis of variance) the sensitivity of MacDQoL to VA impairment and to compare it with the NEI-VFQ-25 generic visual function questionnaire. Results: A total of 797 patients (mean age 76.8 years; 55.8% women) had wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Strong correlations between the MacDQoL items (r > 0.48) and factor loadings > 0.49 on a forced one-factor analysis supported the use of an average weighted impact score. Four constructs (Cronbach alpha > 0.8) were derived, represented by the labels: Essential tasks, Family/social life, Activities/capabilities, and Embarrassment. The structure did not differ among the four countries involved, except one item (Finance), which has been excluded. Patients with BE VA < 10/20 and WE VA < 10/100 produced significantly worse overall scores than those with BE VA > 10/20 and WE VA > 10/100 (MacDQoL P > 0.0001; NEI-VFQ-25 P < 0.0001). Conclusions: The analysis confirmed the metric properties of the MacDQoL. The MacDQoL offers a broad individualized measure of the impact of MD on quality of life.

There is a broad agreement to include health-care costs and to measure the effects as Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs). However, a hot topic has been how to handle survivor consumption and leisure foregone. It is well established that the costs for these aspects should be included only if their associated benefits are also included. The key question is, then, if these benefits are included in QALYs. In a recent paper by Nyman (Health Econ., in press) it was argued that these benefits are not generally included in the empirical assessment of QALYs and that these costs therefore should be excluded. Even if this recommendation is correct, the reasons for it can be questioned. It is here instead argued that this decision should be based on theoretical - and not empirical considerations. Thus, these costs should be excluded because QALYs are unlikely to be consistent with a utility function also including consumption and leisure. If so, then it becomes more important to instruct individuals not to include these benefits in their QALY assessments than to consider to what extent they may or may not be implicitly included. It is also demonstrated that these results have bearings on non-medical costs for the case when survival is not affected.

We will consider only single odds, i.e. either a win for the home team, a draw, or a win for the away team. No double chances or multiple odds etc. The result of a particular match is a random variable and the probability of its result is inverse in proportion to the odd given by a bookmaker. Further, the odds of the home team and the odds of the away team are not independent variables - they are also inversely proportional. Thus the odds of a draw are only a transformed probability, which is a complement of two other probabilities to get one as their sum. Therefore the bettor chooses the matches and the events only according to the home odds and does not take into account the position on the table, the latest results etc. The optimal strategy should identify the odds and the result which the bettor should bet on. For this optimization we use historical data. For every match we have three odds (home win, draw, away win). We keep only the odds which correspond to the right result. The other ones we substitute with zeros. The modified triples of odds are sorted by the odds for home wins and then they are smoothed by moving averages. If we find a contiguous segment of smoothed values greater than one, it means that there are intervals of odds (home win) where the odds for home wins bring a profit. We also use the same method for the odds for draws and also for away wins. The data was evaluated on an annul basis from 2001 till 2010. Specifically, we analysed the top european soccer leagues, the English Premier League, German 1st Bundesliga, Italian Serie A etc.","[Rozkovec, Jiri] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Stat, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,,jiri.rozkovec@tul.cz,"Rozkovec, Jiri/AFP-2672-2022","Rozkovec, Jiri/0000-0001-8870-5467",,,,,1,0,0,0,7,PROFESSIONAL PUBLISHING,PRAHA 4,"MIKULOVA 1572 13,, PRAHA 4, 149 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7431-058-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,599,604,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BBZ07,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000309074600099,0

The empirical results indicate that for US residents, who were foreign-born, education is associated with a greater beneficial effect on every health outcome compared to those born in the United States. More education is related to an even greater positive effect on health for immigrants from Mexico, the origin of most immigrants, than from other countries. These results provide additional support for the portions of the 2007 Immigration Reform Act rejected by the US Congress, which placed a higher priority on education and job skills than current law. Since increased education and improved health are associated, such policy reform would help reduce the demands on the US health-care system.

The motility was determined using the Sperm Vision CASA system. After the semen dilution with physiological solution and subsequent culture at laboratory temperature and at cool condition a significant decrease of spermatozoa motility at laboratory temperature was detected from Time 0 (94.15%) till the 180 minutes of culture (53.91%). At the cool milieu this difference was lower (95.41 and 78.86%, respectively) and the differences were significant from the 30 minutes of culture till 180 minutes. Similar tendency were found for progressive spermatozoa motility, velocity curved line, amplitude of lateral head displacement, beat cross frequency, where significantly higher rates were measured after 30 minutes of culture at lower temperature. The spermatozoa motility between samples cultured in physiological solution and commercial diluent was in both groups very balanced for 90 minutes of culture. Subsequently, significantly higher spermatozoa motility was detected at time periods 120, 150 and 180 minutes of culture in commercial diluent. Also after 24 hours the motility was higher in this group. Progressive spermatozoa motility replicates the tendency of total spermatozoa motility. Significant decrease in the parameters - velocity curved line and amplitude of lateral head displacement; were detected between samples after 90 minutes of cultivation in physiological solution. Any significantly differences were detected - in beat cross frequency, after 24 hours this parameter was significant higher in sample with commercial diluent.","[Slanina, T.; Petrovicova, L.; Massanyi, P.] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Biotechnol & Food Sci, Dept Anim Physiol, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak Agricultural Research Center; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Slanina, T (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Biotechnol & Food Sci, Dept Anim Physiol, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",slaninatomas@atlas.sk,"Massanyi, Peter/ABC-3626-2021","Massanyi, Peter/0000-0002-4216-0948",,,,,10,1,1,0,1,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-563-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,793,801,,,,,,9,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2HX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341783400099,0

The model captures the leverage effect, allows the volatility to be arbitrarily close to zero and to reach its minimum for non-zero innovations, and is appropriate for long memory modeling when infinite orders are allowed. However, the (quasi-)maximum likelihood estimator is, in general, inconsistent. A self-weighted least-squares estimator is proposed and is shown to be asymptotically normal. A score test for conditional homoscedasticity and diagnostic portmanteau tests are developed. Their performance is illustrated via simulation experiments. It is also investigated whether stock market returns exhibit some of the characteristic features of the linear ARCH model. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we analyse vector autoregressions with non-stationary (unconditional) volatility of a very general form, which includes single and multiple volatility breaks as special cases. We show that the conventional rank statistics computed as in Johansen (1988, 1991) are potentially unreliable. In particular, their large sample distributions depend on the integrated covariation of the underlying multivariate volatility process which impacts on both the size and power of the associated co-integration tests, as we demonstrate numerically. A solution to the identified inference problem is provided by considering wild bootstrap-based implementations of the rank tests. These do not require the practitioner to specify a parametric model for volatility, or to assume that the pattern of volatility is common to, or independent across, the vector of series under analysis. The bootstrap is shown to perform very well in practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: We conducted a population-based cohort study using Quebec Health Insurance Board data. Patients aged 18 years or more newly dispensed an OAD between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2003 were included in the study (n = 98,940). Persistence was defined as consistently refilling a prescription for the initial OAD within three times the days' supply of the preceding claim. For nonpersistent patients, a second course of therapy was defined as treatment initiation with any OAD after a first discontinuation. Patients were followed from treatment initiation up to December 31, 2004, ineligibility for the drug plan or death, whichever came first, and treatment discontinuation or second course of treatment. Cox regression models were used to compute adjusted hazards ratios (AHR) of persistence and initiation of second courses of therapy. Results: The probability of persisting with the initial OAD over a 12-month period was 65% and 56% for patients initiated on metformin and sylfonylurea, respectively. Compared to metformin, the likelihood of discontinuing the initial OAD over the study period was significantly higher for patients on sulphonylureas (AHR: 1.32; 95% CI 1.29-1.34). Patients started on sulphonylureas were also less likely to start a second course of therapy after a first treatment discontinuation (AHR: 0.91; 95% CI 0.89-0.93). Conclusions: Compared to diabetic patients initiated on metformin, those initiated on sulphonylureas displayed poorer persistence patterns.","[Gregoire, Jean-Pierre; Sirois, Caroline; Blanc, Guillaume; Poirier, Paul; Moisan, Jocelyne] Univ Laval, Fac Pharm, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Gregoire, Jean-Pierre; Sirois, Caroline; Blanc, Guillaume; Moisan, Jocelyne] CHA Univ Quebec, URESP, Ctr Rech FRSQ, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Poirier, Paul] Quebec Heart & Lungs Univ Inst, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",Laval University; Quebec Heart & Lung Institute,"Grégoire, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Fac Pharm, Ferdinand Vandry Bldg,Room 2684, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",jean-pierre.gregoire@pha.ulaval.ca,"Sirois, Caroline/I-1829-2019","Sirois, Caroline/0000-0003-3294-7883; Gregoire, Jean-Pierre/0000-0002-1467-9750",Merck Frosst Canada Ltd; Fonds de la Recherche en Sante du Quebec (FRSQ),Merck Frosst Canada Ltd; Fonds de la Recherche en Sante du Quebec (FRSQ)(Fonds de recherche du Quebec (FRQ)Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Sante (FRQS)),This study was funded by an unrestricted grant from Merck Frosst Canada Ltd to Jean-Pierre Gregoire.

This includes in particular the smooth transition models. A general representation theorem is given which establishes the dynamic properties of the process in terms of stochastic and deterministic trends as well as stationary components. In particular, the behavior of the cointegrating relations is described in terms of geometric ergodicity. Despite the fact that no deterministic terms are included, the process will have both stochastic trends and a linear trend in general. Gaussian likelihood-based estimators are considered for the long-run cointegration parameters, and the short-run parameters. Asymptotic theory is provided for these and it is discussed to what extend asymptotic normality and mixed normality can be found. A simulation study reveals that cointegration vectors and the shape of the adjustment are quite accurately estimated by maximum likelihood. At the same time, there is very little information in data about some of the individual parameters entering the adjustment function if care is not taken in choosing a suitable specification.

This study evaluates an important aspect of its promise in the context of the Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5 which deal with the health of women and children. We use Propensity Score Matching techniques to balance the relevant background characteristics in our survey data and compare health indicators of recent mothers who are enrolled in the NHIS with those who are not. Our findings suggest that NHIS women are more likely to receive prenatal care, deliver at a hospital, have their deliveries attended by trained health professionals, and experience less birth complications. We conclude that NHIS is an effective tool for improving health outcomes among those who are covered, which should encourage the Ghanaian government to promote further enrolment, in particular among the poor.

However, in multicentre cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) a fundamental issue of how best to measure and analyse unit costs has been neglected. Multicentre CEA commonly take the mean unit cost from a national database, such as NHS reference costs. This approach does not recognise that unit costs vary across centres and are unavailable in some centres. This paper proposes the use of multiple imputation (MI) to predict those centre-specific unit costs that are not available, while recognising the statistical uncertainty surrounding this imputation. We illustrate MI with a CEA of a multicentre randomised trial (1014 patients, 60 centres), implemented using multilevel modelling. We use MI to derive centre-specific unit costs, based on centre characteristics including average casemix, and compare this to using mean NHS reference costs. in this case study, using MI unit costs rather than mean reference costs led to less heterogeneity across centres, more precise estimates of incremental cost, but similar estimates of incremental cost-effectiveness. We conclude that using MI to predict unit costs can preserve correlations, maximise the use of available data, and, when combined with multilevel modelling is an appropriate method for recognising the statistical uncertainty in multicentre CEA.

We propose and study a dynamic binary choice model with social interactions in which heterogeneity of peer group effects is modeled introducing diversity in individual characteristics and linking pairwise influences to a social distance between individuals. Our framework allows for mimetic as well as anti-mimetic interactions and a heterogeneous structure of peer groups across individuals. Dynamic equilibria are studied in the limit when the number of agents is large. We show that the model exhibits multiple equilibria resulting from conflicts between various group pressures the individuals are subjected to. We study in particular the correlation in the population at equilibrium between the characteristics of the agents and their decisions: this quantity has an interesting empirical interpretation and solves a simple analytical equation when the number of agents is large. Finally we discuss the empirical content of the model and present a consistent estimator for the parameter describing which is consistent for any typical population regardless of the structure of individual characteristics.

Economic results generated using baselines of perfect health are not comparable with those generated using baselines adjusted to reflect the HSUVs associated with the health condition. Despite this, there is no guidance on the preferred techniques and little research describing the effect on cost per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) results when using the different methods. Methods: Using a cardiovascular disease (CVD) model and cost per QALY thresholds, we assess the consequence of using different baseline health-state utility profiles (perfect health, no history of CVD, general population) in conjunction with models (minimum, additive, multiplicative) frequently used to approximate scores for health states with multiple health conditions. HSUVs are calculated using the EQ-5D UK preference-based algorithm. Results: Assuming a baseline of perfect health ignores the natural decline in quality of life associated with age, overestimating the benefits of treatment. The results generated using baselines from the general population are comparable to those obtained using baselines from individuals with no history of CVD. The minimum model biases results in favor of younger-aged cohorts. The additive and multiplicative models give similar results. Conclusion: Although further research in additional health conditions is required to support our findings, our results highlight the need for analysts to conform to an agreed reference case. We demonstrate that in CVD, if data are not available from individuals without the health condition, HSUVs from the general population provide a reasonable approximation.","[Ara, Roberta] Univ Sheffield, ScHARR, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Ara, R (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, ScHARR, 30 Regent Court, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",r.m.ara@sheffield.ac.uk,"brazier, john e/B-1936-2008","Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780",Department of Health; UK Data Archive,Department of Health; UK Data Archive,"We are grateful to Health Survey for England for allowing us access to the data used in this study.

We investigated three well-known concerns regarding contingent valuation (CV): (1) the item non-response of CV values, (2) the sensitivity of CV values to the individual circumstances of caring. and (3) the choice of valuation method by comparing willingness-to-pay (WTP) and willingness-to-accept (WTA) values for a hypothetical marginal change in hours of informal care currently provided. The study sample consisted of 1453 caregivers and 787 care recipients. Of the caregivers, 603 caregivers (41.5%) provided both WTP and WTA values, 983 (67.7%) provided at least one. Determinants of non-response were dependent on the valuation method; primary determinants were education and satisfaction with amount of informal care provided. Caregivers' mean WTP (WTA) for reducing (increasing) informal care by 1 h was (sic)9.13 (10.52). Care recipients' mean WTA (WTP) for reducing (increasing) informal care by 1 h was (sic)8.88 ((sic)6.85). Values were associated with a variety of characteristics of the caregiving situation; explanatory variables differed between WTP and WTA valuations. The differences between WTP and WTA valuations were small. Based on sensitivity CV appears to be a useful method to value informal care for use in economic evalations, non-response, however, remains a matter or concern.

Methods: Observational, cross-sectional study in Spanish patients awaiting liver transplantation (LT). Feasibility was assessed by analyzing administration times and missing responses. Ceiling and floor effects were calculated and reliability was tested by examining internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha). Convergent validity was tested by examining correlations between LDQOL disease-specific and Short Form health survey with 36 questions (SF-36) dimensions. Known groups' validity was tested by examining the LDQOL's capacity to discriminate between groups defined by etiology and Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) scores. Results: A total of 200 patients were included for analysis. Mean age (SD) was 52.6 (9.8) years and 73% of the sample were male. The most common indication for LT was liver cancer (34%). Mean (SD) time to complete the questionnaire was 35.8 minutes (21.2 minutes). Missing responses were highest on the dimensions of sexual functioning and symptoms of liver disease. Ceiling effects were over 20% on 7 of the LDQOL's 12 disease-specific scales. Cronbach's alpha coefficients were over 0.70 on all but 2 dimensions. Correlations between SF-36 and LDQOL disease-specific dimensions generally fulfilled the hypotheses, with 35 of the 40 highest and lowest correlations (87.5%) being in the expected direction. The LDQOL discriminated well between patients in CTP class A and C, and as hypothesized, hepatocarcinoma and alcoholic cirrhosis patients scored better on most dimensions than patients with hepatitis C virus or other etiologies. Conclusions: The Spanish version of the LDQOL 1.0 has shown satisfactory reliability and validity.","[Casanovas, Teresa; Jane, Laia; Garcia, Beatriz; Prat, Bibiana; Fabregat, Joan] Univ Hosp, Liver Transplant Unit, Inst Investigat Bellvitge, Barcelona, Spain; [Herdman, Michael] Insight Consulting & Res, Mataro, Spain; [Herdman, Michael] CIBER Epidemiol & Publ Hlth CIBERESP, Barcelona, Spain; [Herdman, Michael] IMIM Hosp del Mar, Hlth Serv Res Unit, Barcelona, Spain; [Casado, Alfonso] Dynam Solut, Madrid, Spain",University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERESP; Hospital del Mar Research Institute; Hospital del Mar,"Casanovas, T (通讯作者)，Hosp Univ Bellvitge, Liver Transplant Unit, Ctra Feixa Llarga S-N, Barcelona 08907, Spain.",teresacasanovas@bellvitgehospital.cat,"Herdman, Michael/AAI-7280-2020",,"Fond de Investigaciones Sanitarias; Ministerio de Sanidad y Consumo, Spain [FIS 03-0079]; Red Tematica de Investigacion en Trasplante [RETIC FIS C 03/03]","Fond de Investigaciones Sanitarias; Ministerio de Sanidad y Consumo, Spain(Spanish Government); Red Tematica de Investigacion en Trasplante","The study was supported by grants from the Fond de Investigaciones Sanitarias, Ministerio de Sanidad y Consumo, Spain (FIS 03-0079) and from the Red Tematica de Investigacion en Trasplante RETIC FIS C 03/03.",,37,8,11,0,29,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN-JUL,2010,13.0,4,,,,,455,462,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00688.x,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,625DD,20102557.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279872300018,0

The objective of this study is to evaluate the incremental net benefit (INB) framework for undertaking quantitative benefit risk assessment by performing a quantitative benefit risk analysis of alosetron for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome from the patients' perspective. Methods: A discrete event simulation model was developed to determine the INB of alosetron relative to placebo, calculated as relative value-adjusted life-years (RVALYs). Results: In the base case analysis, alosetron resulted in a mean INB of 34.1 RVALYs per 1000 patients treated relative to placebo over 52 weeks of treatment. Incorporating parameter uncertainty into the model, probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed a mean INB of 30.4 (95% confidence interval 15.9-45.4) RVALYs per 1000 patients treated relative to placebo over 52 weeks of treatment. Overall, there was >99% chance that both the incremental benefit and incremental risk associated with alosetron are greater than placebo. As hypothesized, the INB of alosetron was greatest in patients with the worst quality of life experienced at baseline. The mean INB associated with alosetron in patients with mild, moderate, and severe symptoms at baseline was 17.97 (-0.55 to 36.23), 29.98 (17.05-43.37), and 35.98 (23.49-48.77) RVALYs per 1000 patients treated, respectively. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential utility of applying the INB framework to real-life decision-making, and the ability to use simulation modeling incorporating outcomes data from different sources as a benefit-risk decision aid.","[Lynd, Larry D.; Najafzadeh, Mehdi; Colley, Lindsey] Univ British Columbia, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Byrne, Michael F.] Univ British Columbia, Fac Med, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Willan, Andrew R.] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Sculpher, Mark J.] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Johnson, F.

This is the first study to attempt to isolate the effect of regional PCOs on primary-care performance. We examine Divisions of General Practice in Australia, which were established in 1992. A unique Division-level panel data set is used to examine the effect of Divisions, and their activities, on various aspects of primary-care performance. Dynamic panel estimation is used to account for state dependence and the endogeneity of Divisions' activities. The results show that Divisions were more likely to have influenced general practice infrastructure than clinical performance in diabetes, asthma and cervical screening. The effect of specific Division activities, such as providing support for practice nurses and IT support, was not directly related to changes in the level of general practice performance. Specific support in the areas of diabetes and asthma was associated with general practice performance, but this was due to reverse causality and the effect of unobservable factors, rather than the direct effect of Divisions.

A sequential decision model explicitly considers that the level of education is the result of previous schooling choices and so, the variation of supply-side instruments over time will emerge as a source of identification of the desired parameters. A test for heterogeneity in returns from sequential schooling decisions is developed and expressions for Marginal Treatment Effects are obtained in this context. Returns are estimated and tested from cross-sectional data from a Spanish household survey that contains rich family background information and useful instruments. This methodology is used to analyze possible effects of the 1970 reform of the Spanish education system. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Improvements in medical technology are believed to be partly responsible for rapidly rising health expenditures. Even if the technological progress in medicine improves health outcomes and life quality, it can also increase the expenditure on health care. Our findings suggest that newer drugs increase the spending on prescription drugs since they are usually more expensive than their predecessors. However, they lower the demand for other types of medical services, which causes the total spending to decline. We estimate that a 1-year decrease in the average age of prescribed drugs causes per capita health expenditures to decrease by $45.43. The biggest decline occurs in spending on hospital care due to newer drugs.

We find that training has a significant impact on the mean offered wage in white-collar occupations, but not in blue-collar occupations. Training substantially increases the job-offer rates in both occupations. Counterfactual policy simulations show a substantial social gain from increasing the access to training programs, and the estimated model provides a good fit for within-sample, out-of-sample and aggregate trends using cross-sectional survey data.

We quantify the value of recent gains in cancer survival, and analyze the distribution of value among various stakeholders. Between 1988 and 2000, life expectancy for cancer patients increased by roughly four years, and the average willingness-to-pay for these survival gains was roughly $322,000. Improvements in cancer survival during this period created 23 million additional life-years and roughly $1.9 trillion of additional social value, implying that the average life-year was worth approximately $82,000 to its recipient. Health care providers and pharmaceutical companies appropriated 5-19% of this total, with the rest accruing to patients. The share of value flowing to patients has been rising over time. In terms of economic rates of return, R&D investments against cancer have been a success, particularly from the patient's point of view.

Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify health technology economic evaluations conducted from a Canadian perspective published in peer-reviewed journals between 2001 and 2006. To investigate the impact of the 1997 Canadian Coordinating Office of Health Technology Assessment guidelines, each included study was assessed against 17 of the 25 recommendations. Results: Of the 153 included studies, a base set of 9 methodological standards, as outlined by the 1997 guidelines, were followed by over 50% of the studies including: indications, outcomes for cost utility analysis, outcomes for cost benefit analysis, discounting future cost and outcomes, cost identification and valuation, evaluating uncertainty and disclosing funding relationships. Main divergences from the guidelines were found for analytic technique (38%), study perspective (23%), source of preferences (8%), equity (7%), and cost measurement (24%). Conclusion: The current assessment has shown that the 1997 Canadian guidelines have set a minimum methodological standard within the community of doers conducting economic analyses from a Canadian perspective. Although there was divergence from some of the recommendations, the majority were reflected as changes in the 2006 Canadian guidelines.","[Lim, Morgan E.; Bowen, James M.; O'Reilly, Daria; McCarron, C.

Study: Reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha coefficients and intra-class correlation coefficients. Item-to-scale correlation was assessed using Spearman's rank correlations (rho) between scale scores and their constituent items. Convergent and divergent construct validities were tested in three and two a priori hypotheses, respectively, and the correlations were assessed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. Results: When tested in 134 HBV patients, the test-retest reliability was supported with all scales showing acceptable correlation coefficients (i.e., alpha > 0.7). Item-to-scale correlations were good with most items highly correlated with their hypothesized scales. Convergent and divergent construct validities were supported by the hypothesized correlations between the HQLQ and the EQ-5D domains.

Validation of these models is recommended as an indicator of reliability, but is not commonly reported. Furthermore, models derived from different data and employing different assumptions may produce a variety of results. A Markov model for evaluating the long-term cost-effectiveness of screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm is described. Internal, prospective and external validations are carried out using individual participant data from two randomised trials. Validation is assessed in terms of total numbers and timings of key events, and total costs and life-years. Since the initial model validates well only internally, two further models are developed that better fit the prospective and external validation data. All three models are then extrapolated to a life-time horizon, producing cost-effectiveness estimates ranging from 1600 pound to 4200 pound per life-year gained. Parameter uncertainty is now commonly addressed in health economic decision modelling. However, the derivation of models from different data sources adds another level Of uncertainty. This extra uncertainty should be recognised in practical decision-making and, where possible, specifically investigated through independent model validation.

This is also a call for political engagement by heritage practitioners. We argue that in the struggle against climate change heritage practitioners can make a worthwhile contribution by arguing for a de-commodified form of heritage practice emphasizing the involvement of local communities and recognition of their cultural resources; that resists being coopted into economic growth strategies unless they supplant other forms of unsustainable development; that focuses on heritage as an alternative way of viewing resources and their use.","[Long, C.] Deakin Univ, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Smith, A.] La Trobe Univ, Bundoora, Vic, Australia",Deakin University; La Trobe University,"Long, C (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Geelong, Vic, Australia.",,,,,,,,31,8,8,0,5,GREEN LINES INST SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,BARCELOS,"AV ALCAIDES DE FARIA 377 S 12, BARCELOS, 00000, PORTUGAL",,,978-989-95671-3-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,173,+,,,,,,4,Cultural Studies; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Cultural Studies; Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BVJ43,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291664400020,0

However, there are many domains where this assumption can be challenged. One of these is where individuals learn about new products. This paper aims to test how attribute preferences as measured in an experimental choice task shift when respondents are exposed to new product information. The paper presents results from a study investigating consumer preferences for a new consumer electronics product conducted among 400 respondents from a large consumer panel. All respondents received several choice tasks and were then able to read additional information about the new product. After this they completed an additional set of choice tasks. All choices were from pairs of new product alternatives that varied across eight attributes designed according to an orthogonal plan. Using heteroscedastic logit modeling, the paper analyses the shifts in attribute utilities and scale variances that result from the exposure to product information. Results show that as respondents become better informed about a new attribute the attribute has a greater influence on their choices. In addition a significant shift in scale variance is observed, suggesting an increase in preference heterogeneity after information exposure.","[Oppewal, Harmen] Monash Univ, Dept Mkt, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Morrison, Mark] Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, Bathurst, NSW 2795, Australia; [Morrison, Mark] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Business, Bathurst, NSW 2795, Australia; [Wang, Paul; Waller, David] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Mkt, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",Monash University; Charles Sturt University; Charles Sturt University; University of Technology Sydney,"Oppewal, H (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Mkt, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia.",,"Oppewal, Harmen/C-1457-2013; Waller, David/V-8298-2019","Oppewal, Harmen/0000-0002-5221-2043; Waller, David/0000-0002-4016-4275; Morrison, Mark/0000-0002-8761-0682",,,,,39,8,8,0,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84950-772-1,,,,2010,,,,,,,499,516,,,,,,18,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Psychology, Mathematical; Transportation",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Psychology; Transportation,BE0JU,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000366173200024,0

An empirical application is provided investigating the effect of the GP fundholding reform on equity in English NHS. The results show that the most equitable GP practices self-selected into the scheme in 1991; evidence of an inequity-reducing treatment effect as well as a self-selection effect are found in 1992 and 1993; the self-selection process reduces and no evidence of a treatment effect is present thereafter.

Methods: The data for this paper came from a South Korean EQ-5D valuation study where 1307 representative respondents were invited to participate and a total of 101 health states defined by the EQ-5D descriptive system were directly valued. Both aggregate and individual level modeling were conducted to generate values for all 243 health states defined by EQ-5D. Various regression techniques and model specifications were also examined in order to produce the best fit model. Final model selection was based on minimizing the difference between the observed and estimated value for each health state. Results: The N3 model yielded the best fit for the observed TTO value at the aggregate level. It had a mean absolute error of 0.029 and only 15 predictions out of 101 had errors exceeding 0.05 in absolute magnitude. Conclusions: The study successfully establishes South Korean population-based preference weights for the EQ-5D. The value set derived here is based on a representative population sample, limiting the interpolation space and possessing better model performance. Thus, this EQ-5D value set should be given preference for use with the South Korean population.","[Nam, Hae-Sung; Yang, Hae-Kyung; Kwon, In-Sun] Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Prevent Med, Coll Med, Res Inst Med Sci, Taejon 301130, South Korea; [Lee, Yeon-Kyeng; Kim, Young-Tack] Korea Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Chron Dis Surveillance, Seoul, South Korea; [Chuang, Ling-Hsiang; Kind, Paul] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Kim, Keon-Yeop] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Dept Prevent Med, Sch Med, Taegu, South Korea; [Kweon, Sun-Seog] Chonnam Natl Univ, Hwasun Hosp, Jeonnam Reg Canc Ctr, Jeonnam, South Korea",Chungnam National University; Korea Disease Control & Prevention Agency (KDCA); University of York - UK; Kyungpook National University; Chonnam National University,"Nam, HS (通讯作者)，Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Prevent Med, Coll Med, Res Inst Med Sci, 6 Munhwa Dong, Taejon 301130, South Korea.",hsnam@cnu.ac.kr,"Kweon, Sun-Seog/AAZ-4732-2021; Kind, Paul/E-9715-2015","Kweon, Sun-Seog/0000-0003-2378-8550; Kind, Paul/0000-0003-2377-1652; Nam, Hae-Sung/0000-0003-0911-4576",Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC),Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC),This study was prepared by financial support of Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) in the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare.,,17,301,308,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,NOV-DEC,2009,12.0,8,,,,,1187,1193,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00579.x,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,515TH,19659703.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271495300021,0

Approval: In all countries, the Ministries of Health are generally responsible for approval of health technologies through various agencies like the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation in India, Bureau of Food and Drugs for medicines and Bureau of Health Devices and Technology for medical devices in the Philippines, the National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau, Health Technology Assessment Unit and Medical Device Bureau in Malaysia, and the Drug Control Organization in Pakistan. Product dossiers are evaluated while taking decisions. Pricing Control: India has a strong price control mechanism through the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority. In the Philippines, the Essential Drug Price Monitoring System monitors prices of 37 essential drugs monthly from all drugstore outlets nationwide. In Malaysia and Pakistan registration pricing of new drugs is negotiated/fixed by the government with the vendor. Reimbursement: A mix of social, voluntary private and community-based health insurance plans are available in India while the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation is responsible for reimbursement of drugs and medical devices in the Philippines. In Malaysia no formal reimbursement system is being practiced, and in Pakistan the government reimburses medical claims of its employees. Financing: In both India and the Philippines the bulk of health expenditure is out of pocket while the government pays for 20% and 28% respectively in both countries. The public health care services in Malaysia are heavily subsidized by the government with minimum fee being charged to the public. The government of Pakistan gives free medicines to its citizens at the public health facilities. Conclusions: In the region under discussion, one of the priority areas that the different regulatory agencies would benefit from is human resource development to facilitate the process of evidence based assessment of health technologies. Higher budgetary allocation and stronger legislation is also needed along with interagency and international coordination and cooperation to harmonize.","[Thatte, Urmila] Seth GS Med Coll, Dept Clin Pharmacol, Bombay 400012, Maharashtra, India; [Thatte, Urmila] King Edward Mem Hosp, Bombay, Maharashtra, India; [Hussain, Samsinah] Univ Malaya, Fac Med, Dept Pharm, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [de Rosas-Valera, Madeleine] Philippine Hlth Insurance Corp, Pasig, Philippines; [Malik, Muhammad Ashar] Aga Khan Univ, Karachi, Pakistan",Seth Gordhandas Sunderdas Medical College & King Edward Memorial Hospital; Seth Gordhandas Sunderdas Medical College & King Edward Memorial Hospital; Universiti Malaya; Aga Khan University,"Thatte, U (通讯作者)，Seth GS Med Coll, Dept Clin Pharmacol, Bombay 400012, Maharashtra, India.",urmilathatte@kem.edu,,,,,,,20,21,23,1,20,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,NOV-DEC,2009,12.0,,,,,,S18,S25,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00622.x,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,524KG,20586975.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272141600005,0

A Monte Carlo Study shows that under the average squared error criterion, the Bayesian bandwidth selector is comparable to the cross-validation method and clearly outperforms the bootstrapping and rule-of-thumb bandwidth selectors. The Bayesian bandwidth selector is applied to a multivariate kernel regression model that is often used to estimate the state-price density of Arrow-Debreu securities with the S&P 500 index options data and the DAX index options data. The proposed Bayesian bandwidth selector represents a data-driven solution to the problem of choosing bandwidths for the multivariate kernel regression involved in the nonparametric estimation of the state-price density pioneered by Ait-Sahalia and Lo [Ait-Sahalia, Y., Lo, A.W., 1998.

Our key element is to employ the (feasible) bias-corrected average forecast. Using panel-data sequential asymptotics we show that it is potentially Superior to other techniques in several contexts. In particular, it is asymptotically equivalent to the conditional expectation, i.e., has an optimal limiting mean-squared error. We also develop a zero-mean test for the average bias and discuss the forecast-combination puzzle in small and large samples. Monte-Carlo Simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the feasible bias-corrected average forecast in finite samples. An empirical exercise, based upon data from a well known Survey is also presented. Overall, these results show promise for the feasible bias-corrected average forecast. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Two parametric families of link functions are investigated: the Gosset link based on the Student t latent variable model with the degrees of freedom parameter controlling the tail behavior, and the Pregibon link based on the (generalized) Tukey lambda family, with two shape parameters controlling skewness and tail behavior. Both Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods for estimation and inference are explored, compared and contrasted. In applications, like the propensity score matching problem discussed below, where it is critical to have accurate estimates of the conditional probabilities, we find that misspecification of the link function can create serious bias. Bayesian point estimation via MCMC performs quite competitively with MLE methods; however nominal coverage of Bayes credible regions is somewhat more problematic. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The results can be divided into the limited-information and full-information categories. in the limited-information model, it is possible to characterize the entire class of similar tests in a model with only one endogenous explanatory variable. In the full-information framework, this paper proposes a family of similar tests for subsets of endogenous variables' coefficients. For both limited- and full-information models, there exist power upper bounds for unbiased tests. When the model is just-identified, the Anderson-Rubin, score, and (pseudo) conditional likelihood ratio tests are optimal. When the model is over-identified, the (pseudo) conditional likelihood ratio test has power close to the power envelope when identification is strong. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A multi-linear regression method was used to analyze hospitalization expense for insured and uninsured patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis, cholecystitis, benign uterine tumors, and normal delivery. Results: Hospitalization cost is higher among insured than uninsured patients due to longer hospitalization lengths of stay. type of disease (highest among cholecystitis patients). type of gender - females, old-aged people, and type of marital status - singles. as well as drugs expenses, surgical expenses, and other medical acts. Conclusion: Require a better government's supervision system over medical insurance expenses such as reforming methods of payments, building up new cost compensation mechanism. and unifying and stabilizing prices for each category of medicines.

A method to predict SF-6D scores from information in previous reports would facilitate backwards comparisons and the use of these reports in cost-effectiveness analyses. Methods: This report uses data from the 2001-2003 Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS), the Beaver Dam Health Outcomes Survey, and the National Health Measurement Study. SF-6D scores were modeled using age, sex, mental component summary (MCS) score, and physical component summary (PCS) score from the 2002 MEPS. The resulting SF-6D prediction equation was tested with the other datasets for groups of different sizes and groups stratified by age, MCS score, PCS score, sum of MCS and PCS scores, and SF-6D score. Results: The equation can be used to predict an average SF-6D score using average age, proportion female, average MCS score, and average PCS score. Mean differences between actual and predicted average SF-6D scores in out-of-sample tests was -0.001 (SF-12 version 1), -0.013 (SF-12 version 2), -0.007 (SF-36 version 1), and -0.010 (SF-36 version 2). Ninety-five percent credible intervals around these point estimates range from +/- 0.045 for groups with 10 subjects to +/- 0.008 for groups with more than 300 subjects. These results were consistent for a wide range of ages, MCS scores, PCS scores, sum of MCS and PCS scores, and SF-6D scores. SF-6D scores from the SF-36 and SF-12 from the same data set were found to be substantially different. Conclusions: Simple equation predicts an average SF-6D preference-based score from widely published information.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Madison, WI 53726 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Hanmer, J (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, 610 N Walnut St,Room 644, Madison, WI 53726 USA.",jehanmer@wisc.edu,,,National Institute on Aging [AG020679]; AHRQ dissertation grant [1 R36 HS016574],National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); AHRQ dissertation grant(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality),"This work was supported by a P01 grant (AG020679) from the National Institute on Aging and an AHRQ dissertation grant (1 R36 HS016574).

We assessed theoretical and construct validity, as well as internal consistency, to investigate whether HII can be used to investigate complex multi-faceted health-care decisions (objective 1). In addition, we incorporated recent advances in mixed logit modelling (objective 2). Finally, we determined the response rate and predictive ability to Study the feasibility of HII to support health-care management (objective 3). The clinical subject was the implementation of the guideline for breast cancer Surgery in day care, which is a complex process that involves changes at the organizational and management levels.. as well as the level of health-care professionals and that of patients. We found good theoretical and construct validity and satisfactory internal consistency. The proposed mixed logit model, which included repeated measures corrections and subexperiment error scale variations, also performed well. We found a poor response, but the model had satisfactory predictive ability. Therefore, we conclude that Hit can be used successfully to study complex multi-faceted health-care decisions (objectives I and 2), but that the feasibility of Hit to support health-care management, in particular in challenging implementation projects, seems less favourable (objective 3).

Methods: The Nationwide Survey of Female Sexual Health, a random-digit telephone survey of US households, collected information on female sexual function, demographic characteristics, HRQOL, and the presence of specific medical disorders from 1189 naturally or surgically postmenopausal women in stable relationships of >= 3 months duration. HSDD was defined as < 40 on the Profile of Female Sexual Function((C)) scale and < 60 on the Personal Distress Scale((C)). Short Form-12 Health Survey (SF-12) summary and domain scores, and EuroQol (EQ-5D) index score and dimensions were compared with population-based norms for healthy individuals and selected chronic conditions. Results: HSDD was associated with significant HRQOL decrements, with the largest SF-12 score differences in mental health (HSDD: 45.4 [standard error 1.9] vs. no HSDD: 51.0 [0.6], P < 0.01), vitality (HSDD: 47.7 [1.3] vs. no HSDD: 52.0 [0.7], P < 0.01), social function (HSDD: 47.3 [1.4] vs. no HSDD: 50.9 [0.7], P < 0.05), and bodily pain (HSDD: 41.4 [2.2] vs. no HSDD: 46.7 [0.9], P < 0.05).

HSDD was associated with a 0.1-point decrement in naturally menopausal women (HSDD: 0.78 [0.03] vs. no HSDD 0.88 [0.01], P < 0.01). Women with HSDD showed more HRQOL impairment than healthy population norms but were similar to adults with other chronic conditions such as diabetes and back pain. Conclusions: Women with HSDD showed substantial impairment in HRQOL. Given a prevalence of 6.6% to 12.5% among US women, HSDD represents an important burden on quality of life.","[Biddle, Andrea K.; Wheeler, Stephanie B.] Univ N Carolina, Sch Global Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [West, Suzanne L.; D'Aloisio, Aimee A.] Univ N Carolina, Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [West, Suzanne L.; D'Aloisio, Aimee A.; Thorp, John] Univ N Carolina, Cecil G Sheps Ctr Hlth Serv Res, Ctr Womens Hlth Res, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Borisov, Natalie N.] Procter & Gamble Pharmaceut Inc, Epidemiol & Pharmacoecon, Mason, OH USA; [Thorp, John] Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Procter & Gamble; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Biddle, AK (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Sch Global Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, CB 7411, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",Andrea.Biddle@unc.edu,,"Biddle, Andrea/0000-0003-0273-7439; /0000-0001-7956-5917","Procter & Gamble Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Mason, OH","Procter & Gamble Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Mason, OH(Procter & Gamble)","Source of financial support: This study was funded by contract from Procter & Gamble Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Mason, OH.",,55,81,84,1,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2009,12.0,5,,,,,763,772,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00483.x,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,459SR,19192259.0,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267130200018,0

Maximum likelihood estimation using price data of the derivative contract. Mathematical Finance 4, 155-167] is extended to account for the fact that observed equity prices may have been contaminated by trading noises. With the presence of trading noises, the likelihood function based on the observed equity prices can only be evaluated via some nonlinear filtering scheme. We devise a particle filtering algorithm that is practical for conducting the MLE estimation of the structural credit risk model of Merton [Merton, R.C., 1974. On the pricing of corporate debt: The risk structure of interest rates. journal of Finance 29, 449-470]. We implement the method on the Dow Jones 30 firms and on 100 randomly selected firms, and find that ignoring trading noises can lead to significantly overestimating the firm's asset volatility. The estimated magnitude of trading noise is in line with the direction that a firm's liquidity will predict based on three common liquidity proxies.

Study patients included individuals aged 65 years and older who received a diagnosis of stage IIIB/IV non-small-cell lung cancer in a Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results cancer registry between 1997 and 2002 and who received first-line treatment with commonly used doublet regimens. Patients were followed retrospectively in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare database to evaluate lifetime medical-care costs and costs while on first-line chemotherapy treatment. Pairwise comparisons of treatment costs were estimated by using nonparametric bootstrap methods. Lifetime medical-care costs totaled approximately $70,000 and on-treatment costs for first-line chemotherapy totaled approximately $30,000 among study patients and were dominated by hospitalization and physician costs. Lifetime costs were significantly higher among patients treated with first-line cisplatin/carboplatin (platinum) plus a taxane compared with those who received platinum plus gemcitabine [difference: $4781 ($1558-$8039)] or other doublet therapy [difference: $5961 ($2333-$9614)]. Total on-treatment costs for first-line chemotherapy were significantly higher among patients treated with platinum plus a taxane compared with those who received platinum plus gemcitabine [difference: $5825 ($3872-$7770)], platinum plus another agent [difference: $5968 ($3995-$7975)], or another doublet therapy [difference: $3663 ($1620-$5740)]. There is a cost differential between first-line doublet regimens in terms of lifetime and on-treatment costs. Although doublet therapy with platinum and a taxane was the most frequently utilized regimen, it was associated with the highest lifetime and on-treatment costs.","[Marciniak, Martin D.] Eli Lilly & Co, Lilly Corp Ctr, Global Hlth Outcomes Res US, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA; [Lang, Kathleen; Stokes, Michael; Morissette, Nathalie; Thompson, David] I3 Innovus, Medford, MA USA; [Earle, Craig] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Eli Lilly; i3 Innovus; Harvard University; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,"Marciniak, MD (通讯作者)，Eli Lilly & Co, Lilly Corp Ctr, Global Hlth Outcomes Res US, DC 6831, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA.",marciniak_martin@lilly.com,,,,,,,20,19,19,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2009,12.0,4,,,,,481,488,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00472.x,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,451JZ,18980633.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000266467800014,0

California Medicaid data (1995-2003) were used to identify hypertensive patients with prescriptions for both AH and LL medications. Proportion of days covered (PDC) was used to define three adherence classifications: fully adherent (FA, PDC >= 0.8), partially adherent (PA, 0.2 <= PDC < 0.8), and nonadherent (NA, PDC < 0.2). Annual transition matrices documented the probability of adherence status changes. Only 13% of the 5943 patients were FA to both drugs at baseline. Patients who were FA (60%) or NA (84%) to both drugs had high probability of maintaining status at year two (Y2). Significant variables associated with a transition from adherent to NA at Y2 included African American race (odds ratio [OR] 1.5), other race groups (OR 1.2), lack of Medicare eligibility (OR 1.3), and initiating LL therapy of fibric acid derivatives (OR 1.3) or niacin (OR 1.8). Patients FA or NA with both drugs at baseline were more likely to maintain their adherence status. Race, insurance coverage, and type of LL medication were significantly associated with transitioning from any adherence status to nonadherence. These findings may be useful in guiding cost-effectiveness analyses incorporating adherence estimates.","[Nichol, Michael B.; Knight, Tara K.; Wu, Joanne] Univ So Calif, Sch Pharm, Dept Clin Pharm & Pharmaceut Econ & Policy, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Tang, Simon S.

Although guidelines for good practices in translation and linguistic validation are available, the ISPOR Patient-Reported Outcomes Translation and Linguistic Validation Task Force identified a number of areas where they felt that further discussion around methods and best practices would be beneficial. The areas identified by the team were as follows: 1) the selection of the languages required for multinational trials; 2) the approaches suggested when the same language is required across two or more countries; and 3) the assessment of measurement equivalence to support the aggregation of data from different countries. The task force addressed these three areas, reviewed the available literature, and had multiple discussions to develop this report. Decision aid tools have also been developed and presented for the selection of languages and the approaches suggested for the use of the same language in different countries. It is hoped that this report and the decision tools proposed will assist those involved with multinational trials to 1) decide on the translations required for each country; 2) choose the approach to use when the same language is spoken in more than one country; and 3) choose methods to gather evidence to support the pooling of data collected using different language versions of the same tool.","[Wild, Diane; Houchin, Caroline; von Maltzahn, Robyn] Oxford Outcomes Ltd, Oxford OX2 0JJ, England; [Eremenco, Sonya] United BioSource Corp, Bethesda, MD USA; [Mear, Isabelle] Mapi Res Inst, Lyon, France; [Martin, Mona] Hlth Res Associates Inc, Mountlake Terrace, WA USA; [Gawlicki, Mary] Corp Translat Inc, Hartford, CT USA; [Hareendran, Asha] Pfizer Ltd, Global Outcomes Res, Sandwich CT13 9NJ, Kent, England; [Wiklund, Ingela] GlaxoSmithKline Inc, Global Hlth Outcomes, Middlesex, England; [Chong, Lee Yee] AHP Res Ltd, Middlesex, England; [Cohen, Lawrence] Washington State Univ, Spokane, WA USA; [Molsen, Elizabeth] ISPOR, Lawrenceville, NJ USA",United Biosource Corporation; Pfizer; GlaxoSmithKline; Washington State University,"Wild, D (通讯作者)，Oxford Outcomes Ltd, Seacourt Tower,W Way, Oxford OX2 0JJ, England.",diane.wild@oxfordoutcomes.com,,,,,,,27,189,203,2,19,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2009,12.0,4,,,,,430,440,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00471.x,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,451JZ,19138309.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000266467800008,0

AN APPLICATION TO SETTING PRIORITIES FOR ORTHOPAEDIC WAITING LISTS,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,discrete choice experiment; data pooling; orthopaedic waiting lists,PREFERENCES; HIP; REPLACEMENT; CRITERIA; MODELS,"The aim of this paper is to undertake a discrete choice experiment using a 'blocked attribute' design. To date in the health economics literature, most discrete choice experiments have used only a relatively small number of attributes due to concerns about task complexity, non-compensatory decision rules, simplicity of experimental designs, and the costs of surveys. This may lead to omitted variable bias and reduced explanatory power when attributes have been pre-selected from a longer list. There may be situations where it is desirable to include a longer list of attributes, Such as attaching weights to quality-of-life instruments to obtain single index scores. We examine this issue in the context of attaching weights to a disease-specific quality-of-life instrument used to prioritise patients on orthopaedic waiting lists in Victorian hospitals. Eleven attributes are allocated across three separate experimental designs and the data pooled for analysis. Pooling is justified given the specific context of the study, including attempts to minimise the effect Of unobserved heterogeneity across the three models when designing the study and collecting data. Blocked attribute designs may offer flexibility to researchers when it is not possible or desirable to reduce the number of attributes.

The present study employed confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to examine the factorial invariance of the ChPSQ-9 between and within samples of Chinese patients with breast or lung cancer. Longitudinal data were analyzed from Chinese breast and lung cancer patients who had completed the ChPSQ-9 during their first outpatient visit, at 3 months, and at 6 months after baseline. CFAs tested the fit of a one-factor model, a hierarchical model that comprised a general latent factor and two first-order factors, and a correlated model that comprised two correlated first-order factors to the data. The factorial invariance of the ChPSQ-9 between six independent samples across time was investigated using multigroup CFAs. The CFA's results demonstrated a better fit of the correlated model over the one-factor model and the hierarchical model in the breast and lung cancer samples. The correlated model showed evidence of cross-sample and longitudinal factorial invariance. Patients were generally satisfied with services provided by doctors and nurses. Internal consistency of the scale was also good for both cancer samples across time. The ChPSQ-9 is a valid and reliable instrument to be employed among breast and lung cancer patients, in clinical settings or intervention research, to evaluate group differences in patient satisfaction and its association with intervention effectiveness.","[Wong, Wing Sze; Fielding, Richard; Hedley, Anthony] Univ Hong Kong, Hlth Behav Res Grp, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wong, Wing Sze] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Appl Social Studies, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wong, Wing Sze; Fielding, Richard; Wong, Chit; Hedley, Anthony] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Community Med, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong; City University of Hong Kong; University of Hong Kong,"Fielding, R (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Hlth Behav Res Grp, 5-F William MW Mong Bldg,Fac Med Bldg,21 Sassoon, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",Fielding@hkusua.hku.hk,,,,,,,36,7,7,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2009,12.0,4,,,,,597,605,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00480.x,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,451JZ,19159414.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000266467800028,0

In this paper we adapt the theory for investment under uncertainty for a public referendum setting and perform the first empirical test to show that estimates of the value of a statistical lite (VSL) from stated preference surveys are highly dependent on the inclusion of the option value. Our results indicate an option value of a major economic magnitude. This implies that previously reported VSL estimates, used in societal benefit-cost analysis of health investments, are exaggerated.

In recent years there has been growing controversy about whether one of the best-selling anti-depressants - selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) - increases or decreases the risk of completed suicide. Randomized clinical trials are not informative in this application because of small samples and other problems. We present what we believe are the roost scientifically credible estimates to date on how SSRI sales affect suicide mortality using data from 26 countries for up to 25 years. We exploit just variation in SSRI sales that can be explained by institutional differences in how drugs are regulated, priced, and distributed, as reflected by the sales growth of new drugs more generally. We find an increase in SSRI sales of 1 pill per capita (12% of 2000 sales levels) reduces suicide by 5%. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This article first summarizes the time patterns in economic research oil diseases and health in developing countries for 1990-2005. It then compares those time patterns with the distribution or disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for diseases and health conditions in developing countries estimated for 2005 and for 2030. These comparisons suggest relatively overemphasis on HIV/AIDS and underemphasis on noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). This opens the possibility for individuals or organizations initiating, re-evaluating, or increasing their economic research on health and development to make a significant contribution by focusing particularly on the analysis of behaviour and policy choices related to NCDs. Careful consideration must, of course, be given to other demands, but on the basis of these two criteria, potential contributions are likely to be greatest from research with such a focus.

The objective here was to compare the direct medical costs of kidney, liver, heart, and lung transplantations in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Using data from a province-wide population-based registry, resource utilization data were collated for 1333 patients who underwent solid organ transplantation between 1995 and 2003. Resource categories included hospital stays, physician fees, laboratory and diagnostic testing, and immunosuppressants. Mean costs (2003 $CDN) were derived for the index hospitalization and each of the 2 years after hospital discharge. To enable valid comparisons, the same costing methodology was applied to all four programs. The mean costs of transplantation varied from $27,695 for kidney recipients to $89,942 for lung recipients, with inpatient hospital stays comprising the largest component. Mean costs for the first and second follow-up years ranged from $27,592 and $11,424 for lung recipients to $21,144 and $8086 for liver recipients. Immunosuppressants accounted for between two-thirds and three-fourths of costs by the second year. Within each program, variations in costs could not be accounted for by demographic factors. We observed in BC a threefold variation in mean costs of organ transplantation procedures, with the variations between programs diminishing during follow-up. Policymakers and decision-makers seeking to better understand the deployment of resources for transplantation may focus on clinical factors at the time of hospitalization and factors that influence use and costs of immunosuppressants during the induction and maintenance phases.","[Levy, Adrian R.; James, Douglas] St Pauls Hosp, Ctr Hlth Evaluat & Outcome Sci, Vancouver, BC V6Z 1Y6, Canada; [Levy, Adrian R.; Barrable, William; Clarke-Richardson, Penny; Chung, Stephen; Levy, Robert D.] British Columbia Transplant Soc, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Levy, Adrian R.; Sobolev, Boris; Keown, Paul A.; Chung, Stephen; Straatman, Lyn; Levy, Robert D.] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Sullivan, Sean D.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",St. Paul's Hospital; University of British Columbia; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Levy, AR (通讯作者)，St Pauls Hosp, Ctr Hlth Evaluat & Outcome Sci, 620-1081 Burrard St, Vancouver, BC V6Z 1Y6, Canada.",alevy@interchange.ubc.ca,"Keown, Paul Anthony/JNE-2511-2023","Keown, Paul/0000-0001-6466-8251",,,,,42,18,20,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2009,12.0,2,,,,,282,292,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00445.x,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,408WY,18783395.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000263467500014,0

Thus, such a social ordering function is quite similar to the Walrasian correspondence, which can be regarded as the social ordering function whose associated indifference classes are the set of Walrasian allocations and the set of other allocations.

In the proposed approach, both the producer and the user of a product are treated as the customers of a QFD matrix, and thus customer voices (qualitative) are translated into sampling plan specifications (quantitative) directed at customer satisfaction. During the translating, benefit conflicts between the user and the producer are solved through a cooperative game process.

Using four all-employee surveys conducted by the Veterans Health Administration in the United States between 1997 and 2006, we examine the strength of these relationships and their changes over time. Exposure and outcome measures are employee-assessed in all the surveys. Because it can accommodate both latent and measured variables into the model, Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) is used to capture and quantify the relationship structure. The aim of the project is to identify possible intervention foci. The analyses revealed that employee-related outcomes are improved by increases in Leadership and Support, and, not surprisingly, the outcome variable of employee satisfaction reduced turnover intention. The employee assessed patient-related outcomes of satisfaction and quality of care were most improved by increases in Resources. Results also indicate that the three organizational constructs and the web of associations characterized by SEM underwent changes over the study period, perhaps in relation to changes in VHA policy emphases, changes in survey wording and other possible unmeasured factors.

Content validity is the extent to which an instrument measures the important aspects of concepts developers or users purport it to assess. A PRO instrument measures the concepts most relevant and important to a patient's condition and its treatment. For PRO instruments, items and domains as reflected in the scores of an instrument should be important to the target population and comprehensive with respect to patient concerns. Documentation of target population input in item generation, as well as evaluation of patient understanding through cognitive interviewing, can provide the evidence for content validity. Part 1 of this task force report covers elicitation of key concepts using qualitative focus groups and/or interviews to inform content and structure of a new PRO instrument. Building on qualitative interviews and focus groups used to elicit concepts, cognitive interviews help developers craft items that can be understood by respondents in the target population and can ultimately confirm that the final instrument is appropriate, comprehensive, and understandable in the target population. Part 2 details: 1) the methods for conducting cognitive interviews that address patient understanding of items, instructions, and response options; and 2) the methods for tracking item development through the various stages of research and preparing this tracking for submission to regulatory agencies. The task force report's two parts are meant to be read together. They are intended to offer suggestions for good practice in planning, executing, and documenting qualitative studies that are used to support the content validity of PRO instruments to be used in medical product evaluation.","[Patrick, Donald L.] Univ Washington, Dept Hlth Serv, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Burke, Laurie B.] Food & Drug Adm, Ctr Drug Evaluat Res, Off New Drugs, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Gwaltney, Chad J.] Brown Univ, Dept Community Hlth, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Gwaltney, Chad J.] PRO Consulting, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Leidy, Nancy Kline] United BioSource Corp, Bethesda, MD USA; [Martin, Mona L.] Hlth Res Associates Inc, Seattle, WA USA; [Molsen, Elizabeth] Int Soc Pharmacoecon & Outcomes Res, Lawrenceville, NJ USA; [Ring, Lena] AstraZeneca, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res Div, Sodertalje, Sweden; [Ring, Lena] Uppsala Univ, Dept Pharm, Uppsala, Sweden",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; US Food & Drug Administration (FDA); Brown University; United Biosource Corporation; AstraZeneca; Uppsala University,"Patrick, DL (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Hlth Serv, POB 359455,SeaQoL Grp, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",donald@u.washington.edu,"Patrick, Donald/Y-2460-2019","Patrick, Donald/0000-0003-0756-0492",,,,,27,700,743,1,30,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2011,14.0,8,,,,,978,988,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.06.013,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BM,22152166.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299081900003,0

In the course of the investigation, the NA risk profiles resulting from the combination of the various causes were identified. Methods: Two cross-sectional surveys with a total of 1517 patients (comprising 1177 patients contacted by telephone and forming survey 1 and a different set of 340 patients interviewed in-depth and face-to-face forming survey 2) were conducted. Self-reported NA was measured by the generic Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS). Survey 1 used a four-item MMAS and Survey 2 an eight-item MMAS. Results: Approximately 35% to 40% of the patients can be described as nonadherent. In survey 1, a few causes explain the NA (chronic disease, younger age, and fewer medications required to be taken). The more detailed survey 2 shows that the existence of intentional NA has considerably more influence than any other causal factors. Positive medication beliefs, a positive mood, and a good patient-doctor relationship reduce the NA risk. Furthermore, patients who are easily able to recognize the correct medication, as evidenced by ability to correctly identify the packaging, have a reduced NA probability. Concerning additive risk, patients who are chronically ill but display no other causes of risk have an NA probability of 10.4%. By contrast, in patients displaying all the identified causes of risk, the rate increases to 93.9%. Conclusions: About one-third of patients can be classified as nonadherent. Intentional/medication-based NA causal factors explain the NA considerably better than do socioeconomics. The existence of more than one cause of risk considerably increases the NA risk of a patient.","[Wilke, Thomas] Univ Appl Sci, Univ Wismar, Inst Pharmakookon & Arzneimittellogist, D-23952 Wismar, Germany; [Morisky, Donald E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Wilke, T (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci, Univ Wismar, Inst Pharmakookon & Arzneimittellogist, PF 1210, D-23952 Wismar, Germany.",thomas.wilke@hs-wismar.de,"Morisky, Donald/AAU-4679-2021; Morisky, Donald E./HLW-3036-2023",,"AXEA Pharma GmbH, Lindau, Germany; Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH Co.

The Medical Insurance Program for the Poor in the republic of Georgia provides a free and extensive benefit package and operates through a publicly funded voucher program, enabling beneficiaries to choose their own private insurance company. Eligibility is determined by a proxy means test administered to applicant households. The objective of this study is to evaluate the program's impact on key outcomes including utilization, financial risk protection, and health behavior and management. A dedicated survey of approximately 3500 households around the thresholds was designed to minimize unobserved heterogeneity by sampling clusters with both beneficiary and non-beneficiary households. The research design exploits the sharp discontinuities at two regional eligibility thresholds to estimate local average treatment effects. Results suggest that the program did not affect utilization of health services but decreased mean out-of-pocket expenditures for some groups and reduced the risk of high inpatient expenditures. There are no systematic impacts on health behavior, management of chronic illnesses, and patient satisfaction.

We model such problems as a superset of the standard domain of Nash (1950). We first show that this domain extension creates a very large number of new rules. In particular, decomposable rules (which are extensions of rules from the Nash domain) constitute a nowhere dense subset of all possible rules. For them, we analyze the process through which good properties of rules on the Nash domain extend to ours. We then enquire whether the counterparts of some well-known results on the Nash (1950) domain continue to hold for decomposable rules on our extended domain. We first show that an extension of the Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining rule uniquely satisfies the Kalai and Smorodinsky (1975) properties. This uniqueness result, however, turns out to be an exception. We characterize the uncountably large classes of decomposable rules that survive the Nash (1950), Kalai (1977), and Thomson (1981) properties. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This study explores whether similar gender differences in the effect of body weight exist in what Cawley et al. (2006) labeled 'the adolescent sex market'. Drawing on data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we use fixed effects and instrumental variables identification strategies to estimate the relationship between body weight and sexual activity. We find evidence that increased body weight lowers the probability that female adolescents become sexually active. In contrast, there is little evidence of a causal relationship between body weight and sexual activity for male adolescents.

The deterministic trend is subject to a change in the intercept, slope or both, and the break date is common for all equations. The estimation method is simply minimizing the sum of squared residuals for all possible break dates. Both serial and cross sectional correlations are important factors that decide the rate of convergence and the limiting distribution of the break date estimate. The rate of convergence is faster when the errors are stationary than when they have a unit root. When there is no cross sectional dependence among the errors, the rate of convergence depends on the number of equations and thus is faster than the univariate case. When the errors have a common factor structure with factor loadings correlated with the intercept and slope change parameters, the rate of convergence does not depend on the number of equations and thus reduces to the univariate case. The limiting distribution of the break date estimate is also provided. Some Monte Carlo experiments are performed to assess the adequacy of the asymptotic results. A brief empirical example using the US GDP price index is offered. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We find significant causal effects of mandates upon vaccination rates among preschool children aged 19-35 months: these effects appear in the year of mandate adoption, peak two years after adoption, and show a minimal difference from the aggregate trend about six years after adoption. For a mandate enacted in 2000, the model and estimates imply that roughly 20% of the short-run increase in state-level immunization rates was caused by the mandate introduction. We find no evidence of differential effects for different socioeconomic groups. Combined with previous cost-benefit analyses of the varicella vaccine, the estimates suggest that state-level mandates have been effective from an economic standpoint. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We find that marginal gross revenues do not generally behave monotonically in total information release. In the two bidder case, essentially, any asymmetric allocation of information dominates the symmetric information allocation. Even the bidder who gets less information is willing to pay a higher entry fee for asymmetric information allocations than for the symmetric one. His entry fee coincides with that of the better informed bidder. Losses from allocating an amount of information non-optimally can be substantial. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this analysis was to examine the association between insurance status and pharmacologic treatment for depression. Methods: Patients referred to a memory clinic of a public hospital in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and identified with any of four types of depression (subsyndromal, dysthymia, major, and due to dementia) were included. Age, years of education, insurance status, Beck Depression Inventory score, and number of comorbidities were considered. Associations between these factors and not receiving pharmacologic treatment for depression were examined with logistic regression. Use of prescription neuroleptics, hypnotics, and anticholinesterase inhibitors was also explored. Results: Out of 100 patients, 92 with insurance status data were used. Sixty-one patients (66%) had formal insurance and 31 patients (34%) lacked insurance. Twenty-seven (44%) insured patients and 23 (74%) uninsured patients did not receive antidepressants (P = 0.001). Controlling for other factors, uninsured patients had 7.12 higher odds of not receiving treatment compared to insured patients (95% confidence interval 1.88-28.86). Older patients and those with more comorbidities had higher odds of not receiving treatment. More educated patients, those with higher Beck Depression Inventory score, and those without subsyndromal depression had lower odds of not receiving treatment. None of those associations were statistically significant. Conclusions: These results suggest a potential negative effect of the lack of formal insurance regarding pharmacologic treatment for depression. These findings should be confirmed with larger samples, and for other diseases.","[Allegri, Ricardo F.] Inst Invest Neurol Raul Carrea, Dept Cognit Neurol, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Machnicki, Gerardo; Dillon, Carol; Allegri, Ricardo F.] Zubizarreta Gen Hosp, Memory Res Ctr, Dept Neurol, Gcba Buenos Aires, Argentina",,"Allegri, RF (通讯作者)，Inst Invest Neurol Raul Carrea, Dept Cognit Neurol, Montaneses 2325,C1428AQK, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",rallegri@fleni.org.ar,"ALLEGRI, RICARDO FRANCISCO/AAY-4898-2021; Dillon, Carol/I-6659-2019","Dillon, Carol/0000-0001-9401-0821; Allegri, Ricardo Francisco/0000-0001-7166-1234",,,,,29,5,5,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2011,14.0,5,,S,,,S13,S15,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.05.014,0.0,,,3,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BE,21839885.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299081000004,0

Sample consumers with characteristics X are asked whether they favor (with Y = 1 if yes and zero otherwise) a referendum that would provide the good at a cost V specified by experimental design.

Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted. Economic evaluations that included QALYs as an outcome measure, conducted in Spain and published between January 1990 and December 2009 were identified. Primary and gray literature sources were reviewed. Results: A total of 60 articles and 4 health technology assessment reports were included. Key findings were 1) the vast majority of articles (77.1%) referred to therapeutic interventions; 2) 63.2% dealt with pharmaceutical products and much fewer with preventive strategies, medical devices, or diagnostic interventions; 3) most evaluations referred to cardiovascular( 19.8%), respiratory-(16.3%), and cancer-(13.0%) related processes; 4) 80.3% were based on a theoretical model, most commonly Markov models (71.4%); 5) 67.3% adopted the National Health System perspective; 6) information on the methods used to describe the health states was given in 45.1% of studies; 7) 40.3% used the EuroQoL-5D to elicit preferences, whereas 66.1% gave no details on the methods applied to determine patients' choices; 8) it was possible to state who completed the questionnaires in only 17.7% of studies; 9) 77.1% of the interventions assessed were below the (sic)30,000/QALY suggested affordable threshold in Spain. Conclusions: An increasing number of economic evaluations using QALYs had been conducted. Most of them relied on theoretical models. Several methodological issues remain unsolved.

For example, many have suggested that decoupled farm subsidy payments may increase production as they decrease farmers' risk aversion. This paper develops a new calibration technique designed to measure the minimum change in concavity of a utility of wealth function necessary to describe a particular change in production behavior for some discrete change in wealth. I conclude that measurable changes in production levels should not be produced by changing levels of risk aversion except when wealth changes are a substantial portion of wealth. This tool draws into question the usefulness of Arrow's hypotheses in many current applications. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We develop a cross-country measurement model for health, in which functional limitations, self-reports of health, and a physical measure are interrelated to construct health indices. To establish comparability across countries, we define the measurement scales by the physical measure while other parameters vary by country to reflect cultural and linguistic differences in response patterns. We find significant cross-country variation in response styles of health reports along with variability in genuine health that is related to differences in national income. Our health indices achieve satisfactory reliability of about 80% and their gradients by age, income, and wealth for the most part show the expected patterns. Moreover, the health indices correlate much more strongly with income and net worth than self-reported health measures.

Although several patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exist, none were developed using patient-driven concept development. We developed an item bank for dyspnea severity and related functional limitations on the basis of a PRO conceptual framework derived from patient input. Methods: We identified a large pool of existing items based on a conceptual framework and literature review. Using patient and expert review panels and an item refinement/modification process, we developed an item bank aligned with the conceptual framework, which subsequently underwent psychometric testing via an online Internet panel of dyspnea patients (N = 608). Results: Exploratory factor analysis suggested a dominant first factor accounting for about 78% of the total variance. Confirmatory factor analysis supported a unidimensional model. Item response theory analysis demonstrated good model fit, and differential item functioning analyses indicated that the 33-item scale showed potential for measurement equivalence across sex. A 10-item short form produced comparable scores (r = 0.98) and a computerized adaptive-testing simulation indicated efficient measurement with fewer items (mean 4.65 items). Conclusions: An efficient patient-reported measure of dyspnea severity and related functional limitations, based on a patient-driven PRO conceptual framework, is now available for further validation and use.

Conventional approaches to TTO, as used in the UK's 'MVH' value set, are problematic because they require fundamentally different trade-offs tasks for the valuation of states better and worse than dead. This study aims to refine and test the feasibility of a new approach described by Robinson and Spencer (2006. Health Economics 15: 393-402), and to explore the characteristics of the valuation data it generates. The approach introduces a 'lead time' into the TTO, producing a uniform procedure for generating values either >0 or <0. We used this lead time TTO to value 10 moderate to severe EQ-5D states using a sample of the general public (n = 109). We conclude that the approach is feasible for use in valuation studies and appears to overcome the discontinuity in values around 0 evident in conventional methods. However, further research is required to resolve the issue of how to handle participants who 'use up' all lead time; to develop ways of controlling for individual time preferences; and to better understand the implications for valuations of states better than dead.

There is a structural equation of interest that contains an explanatory variable that theory predicts is endogenous. There are one or more instrumental variables that credibly are exogenous with regard to this structural equation, but which have limited explanatory power for the endogenous variable. Further, there is one or more potentially 'strong' instruments, which has much more explanatory power but which may not be exogenous. Hausman (1978) provided a test for the exogeneity of the second instrument when none of the instruments are weak. Here, we focus on how the standard Hausman test does in the presence of weak instruments using the Staiger-Stock asymptotics. It is natural to conjecture that the standard version of the Hausman test would be invalid in the weak instrument case, which we confirm. However, we provide a version of the Hausman test that is valid even in the presence of weak IV and illustrate how to implement the test in the presence of heteroskedasticity. We show that the situation we analyze occurs in several important economic examples. Our Monte Carlo experiments show that our procedure works relatively well in finite samples. We should note that our test is not consistent, although we believe that it is impossible to construct a consistent test with weak instruments. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We address the limited research on the topic of entrepreneurship lock by using recent panel data from matched Current Population Surveys. We use difference-in-difference models to estimate the interaction between having a spouse with employer-based health insurance and potential demand for health care. We find evidence of a larger negative effect of health insurance demand on business creation for those without spousal coverage than for those with spousal coverage. We also take a new approach in the literature to examine the question of whether employer-based health insurance discourages business creation by exploiting the discontinuity created at age 65 through the qualification for Medicare. Using a novel procedure of identifying age in months from matched monthly CPS data, we compare the probability of business ownership among male workers in the months just before turning age 65 and in the months just after turning age 65. We find that business ownership rates increase from just under age 65 to just over age 65, whereas we find no change in business ownership rates from just before to just after for other ages 55-75. We also do not find evidence from the previous literature and additional estimates that other confounding factors such as retirement, partial retirement, social security and pension eligibility are responsible for the increase in business ownership in the month individuals turn 65. Our estimates provide some evidence that entrepreneurship lock exists, which raises concerns that the bundling of health insurance and employment may create an inefficient level of business creation.

Methods: A retrospective cohort study using a Medicaid claims database was conducted. Patients hospitalized for an AMI and subsequently filling a prescription for an ACE inhibitor were followed longitudinally for the occurrence of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations and all-cause mortality. A subanalysis was also conducted to account for switching/discontinuation of ACE inhibitor therapy. Stepwise (forward conditional) Cox-proportional hazards models were used to analyze the effect of tissue selectivity on study outcomes. Results: The final study sample consisted of 689 AMI and the results indicated that tissue-selective ACE inhibitors had a protective effect against hospitalization due to stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) (hazard ratio [HR] - 0.265; 95% confidence interval [CI] - 0.101-0.698). A similar lower rate in hospitalizations due to heart failure was observed in the group using tissue-selective ACE inhibitors; however, the results were not statistically significant (HR = 0.681; 95% CI = 0.436-1.063). A protective effect was also observed on the combined outcome of hospitalization due to any cardiovascular condition (HR = 0.712; 95% CI = 0.536-0.945). Hospitalizations due to recurrent AMI, need for coronary revascularization procedures, and mortality were not significantly different between patients using tissue-selective and non-tissue-selective ACE inhibitors. The completer subanalysis provided similar findings regarding the impact of tissue selectivity on study outcomes. Conclusion: Tissue-selective ACE inhibitors may have a protective effect against hospitalization due to stroke/TIA or heart failure when compared to non-tissue-selective ACE inhibitors for patients following AMI.

More specifically, it explains why some types of shops are more dominant in the center, some in the inner city, and some in the periphery of the city. In the model, consumers spend their incomes in different types of shops located randomly in a square city. The types of products sold in the shops differ in the transportation costs and in the proportion of the income spent on them. The consumers buy each type of product in the shops with the lowest price plus the per-unit transportation cost. The price of each good is determined by the profit margin assigned randomly to each shop. In each period, new shops of all types enter the market and locate randomly in the city, and some of the shops in loss exit the market. This way the urban retail market evolves toward an optimal structure; i.e. toward the optimal prices, sizes, and locations of shops. The model is calibrated using the data from the Brno retail market in 2009, and for a realistic setting of the model, it generates patterns consistent with the stylized facts.","[Krcal, Ondrej] Masaryk Univ, FEA, Dept Econ, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,,krcalo@mail.muni.cz,,,,,,,8,2,2,1,6,PROFESSIONAL PUBLISHING,PRAHA 4,"MIKULOVA 1572 13,, PRAHA 4, 149 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7431-058-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,369,374,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BBZ07,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000309074600062,0

Large instances of this problem can be often met when a real public service system is designed and the discomfort of its customers is minimized. If a large instance of the problem is described by a location-allocation model then the model size often exceeds any acceptable limit for available software tools. Presented approximate approach enables us to take the advantage of the set covering problem to solve large p-median instances using common decision support tools. The covering approach is based on specific model reformulation where the distance between a customer and the nearest located service center is estimated by some upper and lower bound. To get the bounds it is necessary to partition the range of values from the distance matrix into several zones. The zone adjustment depends on the value of the model parameter. The main goal of this paper is to present the algorithm suggested for finding the optimal value of the parameter to improve the accuracy of the distance estimation.,"[Kvet, Marek] Univ Zilina, Fac Management Sci & Informat, Dept Transportat Networks, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,,Marek.Kvet@fri.uniza.sk,,,,,,,10,1,1,0,1,PROFESSIONAL PUBLISHING,PRAHA 4,"MIKULOVA 1572 13,, PRAHA 4, 149 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7431-058-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,437,442,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BBZ07,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000309074600072,0

In this paper I present a new approach for analysis of asymmetric shocks and structural differences between two countries, using historical shock decomposition. An advantage of this method is that it jointly examines the impacts of asymmetric shocks and structural differences. This method covers adjustment processes to asymmetric shocks as well as the frequency with which the shocks occur. I demonstrate this method using a New Keynesian DSGE model of two economies, presented in Kolasa [14], which I estimate on the data of the Czech economy and Euro Area 12. The model is estimated with Bayesian techniques using seven key macro economic variables in both economies: GDP, consumption, investment, prices, real wages, nominal interest rate and internal ex change rate defined as prices of non-tradable goods relative to prices of tradable goods. The behavior of the model is driven by seven structural shocks in both economies:tradable and non-tradable productivity shocks, labor supply shocks, investment efficiency shocks, consumption preference shocks, governments pending shocks and monetary policy shocks. The model allows for structural parameters to differ between economies and for correlations between corresponding shocks in both economies. Results suggest that impacts of structural shocks are more correlated than it seems from estimated correlations between shocks alone. The largest correlations are between impacts of shocks on inflations and interest rates. I also find that an evolution of variables in the Czech economy is relatively more influenced by shocks in productivity while the evolution of variables in Euro Area 12 is relatively more influenced by investment efficiency shocks. It also seems that the monetary policy of the ECB is relatively more discretionary than the monetary policy of the CNB, nevertheless it seems that the CNB follows the ECB in their discretionary policy.","[Slanicay, Martin] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,,slanicay@mail.muni.cz,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,2,PROFESSIONAL PUBLISHING,PRUHONICE,"NA SIDLISTI 152, PRUHONICE, PRAGUE 252 43, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7431-058-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,635,640,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BBZ07,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000309074600105,0

Roughly speaking, these operations can be divided into manufacturing and logistical ones. The traditional OR approaches analyze the two types separately: the wide class of vehicle routing problems deals with the logistical issues, while the scheduling theory focuses on the tasks carried out by manufacturing machines. However, in many today's manufacturing systems, especially those using automatically guided vehicles (AGVs) to transport work-in-progress to manufacturing machines, the logistical and manufacturing processes are tightly interconnected, and thus have to be coordinated simultaneously. In the paper, we focus on simultaneous scheduling of material handling and manufacturing tasks in production systems with multiple AGVs and parallel manufacturing machines. First, we present a classification of these systems and provide a measure of their complexity in terms of the number of feasible schedules. Next, we provide a mixed-integer program to minimize the total makespan, and suggest a computationally tractable heuristic.","[Zouhar, Jan] Univ Econ, Dept Econometr, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,zouharj@vse.cz,"Zouhar, Jan/E-9659-2013","Zouhar, Jan/0000-0002-1164-7948",,,,,8,0,0,0,7,PROFESSIONAL PUBLISHING,PRAHA 4,"MIKULOVA 1572 13,, PRAHA 4, 149 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7431-058-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,780,785,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BBZ07,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000309074600130,0

Methods: A review of existing national pharmacoeconomic guidelines was conducted to assess recommendations on the transferability of clinical and economic data, whether there are important differences between countries, and whether common methodologies have been suggested to address key transferability issues. Pharmacoeconomic guidelines were initially identified through the ISPOR Web site. In addition, those national guidelines not included in the ISPOR Web site, but known to us, were also considered. Results: Across 27 sets of guidelines, baseline risk and unit costs were uniformly considered to be of low transferability, while treatment effect was classified as highly transferable. Results were more variable for resource use and utilities, which were considered to have low transferability in 63% and 45% of cases, respectively. There were some differences between older and more recent guidelines in the treatment of transferability issues. Conclusions: A growing number of jurisdictions are using guidelines for the economic evaluation of pharmaceuticals. The recommendations in existing guidelines regarding the transferability of clinical and economic data are quite diverse. There is a case for standardization in dealing with transferability issues. One important step would be to update guidelines more frequently.","[Drummond, Michael] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Barbieri, Marco; Sculpher, Mark] i3 Innovus, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Rutten, Frans] Erasmus Univ, Med Ctr, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Cook, John] Merck & Co Inc, N Wales, PA USA; [Glick, Henry A.] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Lis, Joanna] Sanofi Aventis Grp Poland, Warsaw, Poland; [Reed, Shelby D.] Duke Clin Res Inst, Durham, NC USA; [Severens, Johan L.] Maastricht Univ, Med Ctr, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Severens, Johan L.] CAPHRI Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands",University of York - UK; i3 Innovus; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC; Merck & Company; University of Pennsylvania; Sanofi-Aventis; Duke University; Maastricht University; Maastricht University,"Drummond, M (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Alcuin A Block, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",md18@york.ac.uk,,"Sculpher, Mark/0000-0003-3746-9913",International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR),International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR),This research was carried out under the auspices of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) Good Research Practices Task Force on Transferability of Economic Data.

The need for monitoring workers generates a hierarchical structure in an organization, which can be represented as a rooted tree. The value of an organization is determined by the wage cost, the total number of productive tasks carried out, and the length of the chain of supervision in the organizational hierarchy. In this setting, we construct and characterize an efficient structure of hierarchy which maximizes the value of the organization. In addition, we show that a hierarchy with an optimal size has the form of a balanced rooted tree. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We examined differences in child versus parent report of the child's health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in a large prospective, community-based study of newly diagnosed childhood epilepsy that included children with epilepsy (case) and sibling controls. Methods: HRQOL was assessed 8 to 9 years after initial diagnosis of epilepsy in a subset of 143 case-control matched pairs using the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ), a generic HRQOL measure with child (CHQ-CF87), and parent (CHQ-PF50) versions. Results: There were no significant differences between self-reported case and sibling control HRQOL scores on 9 of 11 scales or 2 global items. Nevertheless, parent ratings were significantly better (higher HRQOL) for sibling controls compared with epilepsy cases on 10 of 12 scales, global behavior and general health items, and the physical and psychosocial summary scores (P < 0.05). Parent-child agreement was low for cases and controls (kappa 0.27-0.33) for three single-item questions with the same wording on parent and child versions. Parent ratings of the case's HRQOL were often significantly associated with 5-year remission status and current antiepileptic drug use, but the case's self-reported HRQOL scores were not. In contrast, current pharmacoresistance was often associated with the child and parent ratings of the child's HRQOL. Conclusion: Children with epilepsy report HRQOL that is comparable to that of sibling controls, while parents rate children with epilepsy as having lower HRQOL than sibling controls. Measuring outcomes in studies of this population should incorporate both perspectives.","[Baca, Christine Bower] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Neurol, Robert Wood Johnson Fdn, Clin Scholars Program, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Hays, Ron D.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Med, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Berg, Anne T.] No Illinois Univ, Dept Biol Sci, De Kalb, IL USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF); University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Northern Illinois University,"Baca, CB (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Neurol, Robert Wood Johnson Fdn, Clin Scholars Program, 911 Broxton Ave,3rd Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",cbower@mednet.ucla.edu,"Hays, Ron D./D-5629-2013","Hays, Ron D./0000-0001-6697-907X","National Institutes of Health, NINDS [R01-NS31146]; Robert Wood Johnson Foundation [59982]; UCLA Resource Center for Minority Aging Research/Center for Health Improvement in Minority Elderly (RCMAR/CHIME); NIH/NIA [P30AG021684]; NCMHD [2P20MD000182]","National Institutes of Health, NINDS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); Robert Wood Johnson Foundation(Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)); UCLA Resource Center for Minority Aging Research/Center for Health Improvement in Minority Elderly (RCMAR/CHIME); NIH/NIA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); NCMHD(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Minority Health & Health Disparities (NIMHD))","Supported by grant from National Institutes of Health, NINDS R01-NS31146 (PI-Dr. Berg).

Recently, the addition of rituximab to CHOP (CHOP-R) has been found to improve survival and trial-based results have suggested that it is a cost-effective alternative to CHOP. Objectives: The objective in this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of CHOP-R relative to CHOP in first-line treatment of DLBCL in a population-based setting in British Columbia, Canada. Methods: We created a patient-level simulation model describing potential pathways for DLBCL patients initiating treatment with either CHOP or CHOP-R. Model parameters were populated with statistical analyses of individual-level treatment and effectiveness data and published cost estimates. All results were stratified by age at treatment initiation (< 60 years vs. >= 60 years). The base-case scenario was based on a 15-year time horizon and a 3% discount rate. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed. All costs are reported as 2006 $CDN. Results: For the base-case scenario, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for younger individuals ranged from $11,965 per disease-free life-year gained to $19,144 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. For older individuals, estimated ICERs for all health outcomes were below $10,000 per unit outcome gained for a 15-year time horizon. Conclusions: Using population-based data, CHOP-R was found to be a cost-effective alternative to CHOP, particularly for individuals aged 60 years and older. Results from this Canadian observational data source were consistent with international clinical trial-based studies. The use of CHOP-R as a first-line treatment for DLBCL is recommended, with respect to both clinical and cost-effectiveness.","[Johnston, Karissa M.; Peacock, Stuart J.] British Columbia Canc Agcy, Res Ctr, Canadian Ctr Appl Res Canc Control ARCC, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada; [Johnston, Karissa M.; Peacock, Stuart J.] Univ British Columbia, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Marra, Carlo A.; Najafzadeh, Mehdi] Univ British Columbia, CORE, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Connors, Joseph M.; Sehn, Laurie] Univ British Columbia, Div Med Oncol, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Connors, Joseph M.; Sehn, Laurie] British Columbia Canc Agcy, Ctr Lymphoid Canc, Vancouver, BC V5Z 4E6, Canada",British Columbia Cancer Agency; University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia; British Columbia Cancer Agency,"Peacock, SJ (通讯作者)，British Columbia Canc Agcy, Res Ctr, Canadian Ctr Appl Res Canc Control ARCC, 675 W 10th Ave, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada.",speacock@bccrc.ca,"Marra, Carlo/AAE-4904-2021; Connors, Joseph/AAF-5284-2019; Peacock, Stuart/P-2437-2018","Marra, Carlo/0000-0002-2625-2121; Connors, Joseph/0000-0002-1361-7531; Peacock, Stuart/0000-0002-8243-8721",Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research; Canada Research Chair; Turner Family Lymphoma Outcome Fund; Mary Toye Memorial Fund; Terry Fox Foundation [019001]; Roche Canada; Canada Institute for Health Research; Genome Canada/Genome BC,Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research(Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research); Canada Research Chair(Natural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest ServiceCanada Research Chairs); Turner Family Lymphoma Outcome Fund; Mary Toye Memorial Fund; Terry Fox Foundation; Roche Canada(Roche Holding); Canada Institute for Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Genome Canada/Genome BC(Genome Canada),KMJ is supported by a Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research Trainee Award.

Methods: Lifetime treatment costs and benefits were computed using a Markov model. Model inputs included each patient's cardiovascular risk factor profile and actual lipid values at baseline and 12 weeks (endpoint). Cardiovascular event and drug costs were discounted at 3.5%. Age-specific utilities were based on UK literature values and non-coronary heart disease mortality rates on the Office of National Statistics data. In the INFORCE study, 384 patients taking statins at stable doses for >= 6 weeks before hospital admission were stratified by statin dose/potency (low, medium, and high) and then randomized to doubling the statin dose or switching to Eze/Simva 10/40 mg for 12 weeks. Results: The Eze/Simva group (n = 195) had a higher mean baseline total cholesterol than the double-statin group (n = 189). Analyses were adjusted for baseline characteristics. In the INFORCE study, Eze/Simva reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by similar to 30% (vs. 4% with doubling statin doses) and significantly enhanced LDL-C goal attainment. In the cost-effectiveness analysis, Eze/Simva conferred 0.218 incremental discounted quality-adjusted life year (QALY) at a discounted incremental cost of 2524 pound, for an ICER of 11,571 pound/QALY (95% confidence interval = 8181- pound 18,600 pound/QALY). The ICER was 13,552 pound/QALY, 11,930 pound/QALY, and 10,148 pound/QALY in the low-, medium-, and high-potency strata, respectively. Conclusions: Switching to Eze/Simva 10/40 mg is projected to be a cost-effective treatment (vs. double-statin) in UK patients with ACS.","[Brudi, Philippe] Merck & Co Inc, Med Affairs, Whitehouse Stn, NJ 08889 USA; [Reckless, John] Royal United Hosp, Bath BA1 3NG, Avon, England; [Reckless, John] Royal United Hosp, Bath BA1 3NG, Avon, England; [Davies, Glenn] Merck Res Labs, N Wales, PA USA; [Tunceli, Kaan; Hu, X.

We show that regression and nonparametric deconvolution methods, based on the empirical characteristic function, can be used for inference.

Methods: General practice-level monthly dispensing data were compared before/after abolition between Wales and North East (NE) England where the charge was retained. Data for 14 medicines that had most items dispensed subject to charge before abolition were similarly compared with NE England. For those with over-the-counter substitutes, wholesale sales to pharmacies were examined. A survey examined local initiatives, which might differentially affect dispensing between the two areas. Results: Total dispensing rates (items/1000 patients) increased significantly in both areas but significantly less so in Wales (difference = -19.7, P = 0.024, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -36.7 to -2.6). For the 14 selected medicines, combined dispensing rates increased significantly in both areas but significantly more in Wales (difference = 27.51, P < 0.0001, 95% CI = 23.66-31.35). There was much variation for individual drugs, but categories tended to show this same trend except for antibiotics, where rates increased in Wales but decreased in NE England. The survey revealed few local initiatives that could explain these differences. Sales of over-the-counter substitutes did not explain the changes in dispensing. Conclusions: The Welsh policy was associated with a modest increase in dispensing rates relative to NE England for the 14 medicines with the highest number of items dispensed subject to charge before abolition. Although factors besides the copayment may have influenced these observations, the smaller relative increase in total dispensing rates in Wales suggests that the overall impact of abolition was minimal.","[Cohen, David; Alam, M.

During the 1990s and early 2000s. many European and Central Asian (ECA) countries shifted from paying hospitals through historical budgets to fee-for-service (FFS) or patient-based payment (PBP) methods (mostly variants of diagnosis-related groups, or DRGs). Using panel data on 28 countries over the period 1990-2004. we exploit the phased shift from historical budgets to explore aggregate impacts on hospital throughput, national health spending, and mortality from causes amenable to medical care. We use a regression version of difference-in-differences (DID) and two variants that relax the DID parallel trends assumption. We find that FFS and PBP both increased national health spending, including private (i.e. out-of-pocket) spending. However, they had different effects on inpatient admissions (FFS increased them; PBP had no effect), and average length of stay (FFS had no effect; PBP reduced it). Of the two methods, only PBP appears to have had any beneficial effect on amenable mortality, but we found significant impacts for only a couple of causes of death, and not in all model specifications.

The rate of convergence of the spatial parameter estimator depends on some general features of the spatial weight matrix of the model. The estimators of other finite-dimensional parameters in the model have the regular root n-rate of convergence and the estimator of the nonparametric component is consistent but with different restrictions on the choice of bandwidth parameter associated with different natures of the spatial weights. Monte Carlo simulations verify our theory and indicate that our estimators perform reasonably well in finite samples. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Decision makers need to estimate the impact of a disease management program (DMP) on long-term costs and cost-effectiveness in order to decide which programs to introduce. This prediction, however, requires formalizing the relations between a variety of variables. The purpose of this paper is to formalize these relations and develop a model that enhances the quality of predictions of the costs and cost-effectiveness of a DMP. The model's cost function is able to portray a reduction both of treatment overuse and underuse by improving both physician and patient compliance. The model's applicability is demonstrated by a simulated DMP for patients with hypertension. The application example shows that implementation costs may have a larger financial impact than downstream costs.

There are several large challenges in addressing this question, including the endogeneity of school (and thus classmates) through residential location choices, 'third factors' such as school-level unobservables that influence individual and classmate choices simultaneously, and the difficulty of the identification of parameters in empirical models of social interactions. In order to address these issues, I use an instrumental variables/fixed effects methodology that compares students in different grades within the same high school who face a different set of classmates and classmates' decisions. Preferred specifications suggest that increasing the proportion of classmates who smoke by 10% will increase the likelihood an individual smokes by approximately 3 percentage points. I compare these results with previous findings that are unable to use school fixed effects and/or use potentially invalid instruments and find that the current results suggest smaller social interactions in adolescent smoking decisions than some previous work.

Exogenous stimulation of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) using recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) avoids hypothyroidism and hastens the clearance of radioiodine from the patient. These advantages are achieved without jeopardizing the success rate of remnant ablation. An economic analysis was performed to place the increased acquisition cost of rhTSH in the context of the health benefits achieved and the earlier discharge from radioprotection. Methods: Markov modeling, using 17 individual weekly cycles, was used to assess the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) associated with exogenous stimulation. Clinical inputs were largely sourced from a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial comparing remnant ablation success after either rhTSH or hypothyroid preparation. The model applied Canadian unit costs, taking a societal perspective. Additional costs associated with rhTSH were considered in the context of the clinical benefits and cost offsets. These included avoidance of hypothyroidism, increased work productivity, earlier administration of ablation after surgery, and earlier discharge from the radio-protective ward because of faster radioiodine clearance following rhTSH preparation. The model duration avoided the need for discounting. Results: The additional benefits of rhTSH (0.0576 QALY) are obtained with an incremental cost of CDN$87, generating an incremental cost per QALY of CDN$1520. Deterministic one-way and two-way sensitivity analyses demonstrated the result to be robust. Conclusions: The use of rhTSH before radioiodine ablation represents a reasonable allocation of costs, with the benefits to patients, hospitals, and society as a whole, obtained at modest cost.","[Mernagh, Paul; Suebwongpat, Arsupol; Weston, Adele] Hlth Technol Analysts, Balmain, NSW 2041, Australia; [Silverberg, Jay] Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Sunnybrook Hlth Sci Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Weston, Adele] Univ Sydney, Fac Hlth Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Toronto; Sunnybrook Research Institute; Sunnybrook Health Science Center; University of Sydney,"Mernagh, P (通讯作者)，Hlth Technol Analysts, POB 133, Balmain, NSW 2041, Australia.",pmernagh@htanalysts.com,,,Genzyme Corporation,Genzyme Corporation(Sanofi-AventisGenzyme Corporation),"Source of financial support: Genzyme Corporation provided funding to Health Technology Analysts for the development of the economic model and the application of this model to the Canadian setting.

However, it has been criticized for being too complex, failing to account for the nonnormal distribution of health state values, and the transformation of preferences for worse-than-death health states before estimation. This research was conducted to develop an improved model for predicting median preferences for EQ-5D health states for the US population. Methods: Probability-weighted least absolute deviations regression was used to fit models to the time trade-off data collected in the US Valuation of the EQ-5D Health States study. No transformation was applied to the values for states considered worse than death. Several model specifications that differed with respect to explanatory variables were evaluated using two-sample cross-validation. Results: The best-fitting model included only fixed effects for moderate or severe problems in each of the 5 EQ-5D dimensions and excluded a constant. This specification yielded rank correlations between observed and predicted values and median observed and predicted values of 0.635 and 0.991, respectively, as well as a median absolute error of 0.026. The predicted median preferences ranged from 1.00 for full health, to -0.81 for the worst possible health state. Conclusions: Due to its simplicity and robustness, a median model is superior to other models for predicting US population preferences for EQ-5D health states. The predictions of this model are suggested for use in applications that require US societal health state values.","[Shaw, James W.] Univ Illinois, Coll Pharm, Dept Pharm Adm, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Shaw, James W.; Pickard, A.

(J. Health Econ. 2003; 22: 151-185; Drug Inf. J. 2004; 38: 211-223) estimates of expenditure on new drug development using publicly available data. The paper estimates that average expenditure on drugs in human clinical trials is around $27m per year, with $17m per year on drugs in Phase I, $34m on drugs in Phase II and $27m per year on drugs in Phase III of the human clinical trials. The paper's estimated expenditure on new drug development is somewhat greater than suggested by the survey results presented in DiMasi et al. (J. Health Econ. 2003; 22: 151-185; Drug Inf. J. 2004; 38: 211-223). The paper combines a 12-year panel of research and development expenditure for 183 publicly traded firms in the pharmaceutical industry with panel of drugs in human clinical trials for each firm over the same period.

Despite its unsatisfactory performance, the asymptotic normal distribution is often used to approximate the distribution of the sample autocorrelation coefficients. This is mainly due to the lack of an efficient approach in obtaining the exact distribution of sample autocorrelation coefficients. In this paper, we provide an efficient algorithm for evaluating the exact distribution of the sample autocorrelation coefficients. Under the multivariate elliptical distribution assumption, the exact distribution as well as exact moments and joint moments of sample autocorrelation coefficients are presented. In addition, the exact mean and variance of various autocorrelation-based tests are provided. Actual size properties of the Box-Pierce and Ljung-Box tests are investigated, and they are shown to be poor when the number of lags is moderately large relative to the sample size. Using the exact mean and variance of the Box-Pierce test statistic, we propose an adjusted Box-Pierce test that has a far superior size property than the traditional Box-Pierce and Ljung-Box tests.

Concerning this topic we dealed with four issues: Aspects of collecting freely living insect from nature for entomophagy purposes; acceptability of insect as food for Czech people; nutrition value of insect and possibilities of using insect as functional food; and legislative conditions for breeding and distribution of edible insect in the Czech Republic. Up to now observations, interviews and analyses led into following conclusions: It is not possible to collect freely living insect under the conditions of Czech Republic. Environmental indexes, such as biodiversity index, tended to disvalue. Interview respondents are in general agreeable with the idea of eating insect, but they would prefer food, in which the insect is not visible. Insect has the potential to be used as functional food, while its nutritional value is highly affected by feeding ration. It is not possible to breed and sell insect as food or feedstock for food production, because of the lack of necessary laws. However, legislative frame is prepared in cooperation with EU.

Today, it is a prime example of the Valencian Cultural Heritage. To date, there have been very few interventions aimed toward the conservation and maintenance of this building. That is why it was decided to carry out a diagnostic study, involving an analysis of the building's history, architecture, construction and structure; to quantify and assess the extent of damages, as well as to identify possible ways of intervention according to the building's condition. The data-gathering techniques used include, non-destructive tests, digitized planimetric surveys, laboratory analysis of samples, thermal imaging, etc. And the data obtained allows us to conclude that the building's mortar surfaces are in good structural condition.

Furthermore, the task of producing a museum has been currently assumed as the task of making the building; as a consequence, there are a significant number of museums made by architects with no (or vary scarce) expertise in museum programming. The result is a long list of adaptations and of internal incoherences the museums professionals have to deal with, after receiving the pre-made building. Poor quality in museums exhibitions and in museums services is, not rarely, the direct result of such practice. In fact museum making is a far more complex process than designing and constructing a building, no matter how attractive and spectacular it may be. Museums, as all heritage institutions, may seek for sustainability in the long run if and only a conceptual and integrated process of planning and programming applies. In this paper we intend to present the main conceptual issues concerning the planning and programming of a museum, having the sustainability of its heritage as the main concern.

Typically, medical cost data are right-skewed, involve a substantial proportion of zero values, and may exhibit heteroscedasticity. In many cases, Such data are also obtained in hierarchical form, e.g., on patients served by the same physician. The proposed model specification therefore consists of two generalized linear mixed models (GLMM), linked together by correlated random effects. Respectively, and conditionally on the random effects and covariates, we model the odds of cost being positive (Part I) using a GLMM with a logistic link and the mean cost (Part II) given that costs were actually incurred using a generalized gamma regression model with random effects and a scale parameter that is allowed to depend on covariates (cf., Manning et al., 2005). The class of generalized gamma distributions is very flexible and includes the lognormal, gamma, inverse gamma and Weibull distributions as special cases.

The highest health risk for costumers is that these toxins can survive during food processing and thus they pass into final products, such as beer. The aim of the presented study was to evaluate the transfer of Fusarium mycotoxins, namely deoxynivalenol (DON), deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside (D3G) and enniatins (ENNs), into malt, beer, and their intermediate products. Concerning the fate of DON a D3G during malting, their levels are decreased during the steeping stage, however, rapid increase of their levels was observed within the germination process. Final malt contained approx. 80% of DON and 260% of D3G levels compared to the initial barley. Further increase of DON and D3G levels was proven during mashing of malt, their levels increased up to 600 and 800%, respectively, when comparing with starting malt.. This phenomenon can be attributed to releasing of mycotoxins from their masked forms. Worth to notice, that spent grains contained undetectable concentration of both DON and D3G. As regards enniatins, during the malting technology their levels significantly decreased. Further decline was observed during the brewing technology. Due to their low solubility in water, they do not pass almost into beer and thus stay in spent grains.","[Malachova, A.; Hajslova, J.] Inst Chem Technol, Dept Food Chem & Anal, Fac Food & Biochem Technol, CR-16628 Prague 6, Czech Republic; [Malachova, A.; Cerkal, R.; Ehrenbergerova, J.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Crop Sci Breeding & Plant Med, CS-61300 Brno, Czech Republic","University of Chemistry & Technology, Prague; Mendel University in Brno","Malachová, A (通讯作者)，Inst Chem Technol, Dept Food Chem & Anal, Fac Food & Biochem Technol, CR-16628 Prague 6, Czech Republic.",alexandra.malachova@vscht.cz,"Hajslova, Jana/C-1279-2019; Cerkal, Radim/C-2530-2009",,"Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [MSM 6046137305, NPV II 2B08049, VC 1M0570]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","This research was carried out within the scope of three projects (MSM 6046137305, NPV II 2B08049, and VC 1M0570) financed by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic.",,5,1,1,0,7,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-453-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,708,715,,,,,,8,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2IA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341786800089,0

There are obvious concentrated socio-cultural activities along its existing and former path, which form an urban edge between both sides. This paper proposes a preliminary classification framework to analyse the spatial configuration of Arab historical walled cities in general and Alexandria city in particularly. The analysis focuses on the defensive wall's footprint and its relation to the adjacent urban fabric. A greater understanding of historic city walls impact on urban patterns would inform the regeneration plans of these sites to improve and sustain their relationship with the surrounding context.","[Mohareb, N.] United Arab Emirates Univ, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [Kronenburg, R.] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",United Arab Emirates University; University of Liverpool,"Mohareb, N (通讯作者)，United Arab Emirates Univ, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates.",,"Mohareb, Nabil/ABC-8651-2021; Mohareb, Nabil/C-3752-2009","Mohareb, Nabil/0000-0001-9036-0381",,,,,18,0,0,0,1,GREEN LINES INST SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,BARCELOS,"AV ALCAIDES DE FARIA 377 S 12, BARCELOS, 00000, PORTUGAL",,,978-989-95671-3-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,1051,+,,,,,,3,Cultural Studies; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Cultural Studies; Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BVJ43,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291664400116,0

The sensory quality of food is a subject of constant and active producer's interest. As a unique source of product information, sensory analysis has also important marketing consequences because it provides direct, low cost, fast and actionable information. When a consumer buys a food product, they can buy nutrition, convenience, and image. Therefore, sensory evaluation should be an integral part in defining and controlling product quality. The measurements were done with 15 cultivars of Vaccinium corymbosum L. The samples were stored in the fridge at 8 degrees C for 1 or 2 days before aromatic volatile and sensory quality analyses. On unstructured scales labelled on both ends, panellists rated in for the acceptability of appearance, colour, skin toughness, flavour, taste, fruit size, size uniformity of berries and texture quality during eating. For each sample, the consumer was asked to taste it, and then asked to indicate which statement best described how they felt about the sample on a 9-point hedonic scale (dislike extremely to like extremely). Values from Sensory analysis which are liking were analyzed with analysis of variance (multifactor ANOVA). For testing of normal distribution we had used Shapiro - Wilk test with the software Panelcheck. Factor Analysis was conducted on the sensory data to identify variability shared in common among the sensory descriptors (i.e., Dim 1 and Dim 2) for the 15 cultivars examined. The cultivars Sierra and Sunrise had most of the significant differences with each cultivars. Cultivars varied in sensory quality characteristics with trained panellist and of preference map. The cultivars Spartan and Bluecrop having the best and Berkeley and Patriot having the lowest, but still acceptable, sensory quality. Flavour quality characteristics best predicted overall eating quality of blueberries. Various textural and visual quality characteristics also influenced consumer assessment of overall eating quality of blueberries. It is therefore necessary to evaluate sensory blueberries and meet the requirements of consumers.","[Priatkova, L.; Hlavacova, Z.; Kertesz, A.; Vietoris, V.; Sedlackova-Horcinova, V] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Biotechnol & Food Sci, Dept Phys, Fac Engn, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Priatková, L (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Biotechnol & Food Sci, Dept Phys, Fac Engn, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",lenka.priatkova@uniag.sk; Zuzana.Hlavacova@uniag.sk,"Vietoris, Vladimir/AAB-2737-2020; Hlaváčová, Zuzana/AAC-8053-2019","Vietoris, Vladimir/0000-0001-8873-0187; Hlaváčová, Zuzana/0000-0003-3480-1079",,,,,8,0,0,0,10,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-453-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,756,763,,,,,,8,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2IA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341786800096,0

The problem is a narrow notion of rationality that disregards fear. This article extends the notion of rationality with new axioms of choice under uncertainty and the decision criteria they imply (Chichilnisky, G., 1996a. An axiomatic approach to Sustainable development. Social Choice andWelfare 13, 257-321; Chichilnisky, G., 2000. An axiomatic approach to choice under uncertainty with Catastrophic risks. Resource and Energy Economics; Chichilnisky, G., 2002. Catastrophical Risk. Encyclopedia of Environmetrics, vol. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., Chicester). In the absence of catastrophes, the old and the new approach coincide, and both lead to standard expected utility. A sharp difference emerges when facing rare events with important consequences, or catastrophes. Theorem I establishes that a classic axiom of choice under uncertainty - Arrow's Monotone Continuity axiom, or its relatives introduced by DeGroot, Villegas, Hernstein and Milnor - postulate rational behavior that is 'insensitive' to rare events as defined in (Chichilnisky, G., 1996a. An axiomatic approach to sustainable development. Social Choice andWelfare 13, 257-321; Chichilnisky, G., 2000. An axiomatic approach to choice under uncertainty with Catastrophic risks. Resource and Energy Economics; Chichilnisky. G., 2002. Catastrophical Risk. Encyclopedia of Environmetrics, vol. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., Chicester). Theorem 2 replaces this axiom with another that allows extreme responses to extreme events, and characterizes the implied decision criteria as a combination of expected utility with extremal responses. Theorems I and 2 offer a new understanding of rationality consistent with previously unexplained observations about decisions involving rare and catastrophic events, decisions involving fear, the Equity Premium Puzzle, 'jump diffusion' processes and 'heavy tails', and it agrees with (Debreu, G., 1953.

Methods: Depending on the methods for measuring time-cost and convenience associated with the mode of administration, either cost-utility analysis or cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken. The difference in compliance rate between DSX and DFO was applied. Results: Although the drug cost of DSX was US$124,070 higher than that of DFO (US$96,039 vs. US$220,199), all other costs were lower in patients with DSX than in patients with DFO. In the cost-utility analysis, DSX resulted in US$3197 savings with a gain of 2.63 quality-adjusted life-years per patient. The result of the cost-effectiveness analysis also showed that DSX dominated DFO.

Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study. All patients who were admitted for the first time to one of the three public hospitals in the National Healthcare Group in Singapore from January 2005 to June 2007 with a primary diagnosis of acute stroke were included and were followed tip for 1 year after the index hospitalization. The study population was divided into two groups: with DM and without DM. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were applied to compare the hospital length of stay (LOS), hospitalization costs, mortality, as well as the 1-year hospital readmissions between the DM and non-DM groups. Results: There were 9766 study patients, and 38.5% of them had DM. DM patients with ischemic stroke (IS) and transient ischemic attack (TIA) stayed 1-day and 0.6-day longer, and incurred 10% and 26% higher hospital cost during index admission, respectively, compared with their counterparts in the non-DM group. They also had more hospital readmission within I year. The mortality rate in IS patients with diabetes was 24% higher. After risk adjustment, subarachnoid hemorrhage patients with diabetes had more hospitalizations. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and IS patients in the DM group had all worse Outcomes but the I-year stroke recurrence; TIA patients with DM incurred longer LOS and hospital costs. Conclusion: DM predicts worse clinical outcomes and higher health-care expenditures in the 1-year poststroke especially for the IS, ICH, and TIA stroke subtypes.","[Sun, Yan; Toh, Matthias Paul Han Sim] Natl Healthcare Grp, Dept Hlth Serv & Outcomes Res, Singapore 149547, Singapore",,"Sun, Y (通讯作者)，Natl Healthcare Grp, Dept Hlth Serv & Outcomes Res, 6 CommonWealth Lane 04-01-02, Singapore 149547, Singapore.",Yan_Sun@nhg.com.sg,,,,,,,14,27,27,0,10,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,NOV-DEC,2009,12.0,,,,,,S101,S105,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00639.x,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,524KG,20586969.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272141600022,0

Methods: To enable long-term projection of the trial results, a discrete event simulation of the course of clinical care after a recent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) was developed. It generates pairs of identical patients; both receive usual care, one receives atorvastatin in addition. Their clinical course is simulated based on their risk of stroke, cardiovascular events, and case fatality rates taken from SPARCL, life expectancy from Saskatchewan Health data, and utility weights from literature. Costs, from a US health-care payer perspective in 2005 US dollars, were estimated for a within-trial 5-year period; survival and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were extrapolated over a patient's lifetime; all discounted at 3%/year. Results: The prevention of stroke, coronary, and other cardiovascular events expected with atorvastatin translates to mean gains of 0.155 life-years gained and 0.172 QALYs per patient over their lifetime. Reducing associated medical costs ($8405 vs. $11,237) but increasing drug costs ($13,984 vs. $8752) results in net $2400/patient, or $13,916/QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicates no simulations yield ratios above $50,000/QALY. Conclusion: Prescribing atorvastatin for patients with prior stroke or TIA is expected to provide health benefits at an acceptable cost in the United States.","[Kongnakorn, Thitima; Ward, Alexandra; Proskorovsky, Irina; Caro, J.

We compared VAS, TTO, and DCE in terms of feasibility, reliability, and validity using vignettes depicting moderate-risk pregnancy at term. Methods: People from the community (n = 97) participated in both a panel session and an individual home assignment. Each participant valuated 46 vignettes with VAS, TTO, and DCE. Each vignette consisted of five attributes: maternal health antepartum, time between diagnosis and delivery, process of delivery, maternal outcome, and neonatal outcome. The questionnaire included Feasibility, which we evaluated by questionnaire. Test-retest reliability and interobserver consistency were assessed by intraclass correlation (ICC), and variance consistency by generalization theory. Convergent validity was determined with ICC and Cohen's kappa; construct validity was determined with linear regression, multinomial logit modeling, and Kendall's Tau-b correlation (tau). Results: The DCE was reported as most feasible (DCE: 87% vs. VAS: 69% vs. TTO: 42%). Test-retest reliability was high overall and equal (VAS: ICC = 0.77; TTO: ICC = 0.79; DCE: kappa = 0.78). The VAS had the highest interobserver reliability (ICC = 0.73). Convergent validity between VAS and DCE was high (kappa = 0.79) and there was sufficient construct validity between VAS and DCE (tau = 0.68). The TTO yielded less optimal results. Generally, neonatal and maternal outcomes weighed most, whereas process outcomes weighed least in moderate-risk pregnancy at term.

ACCOUNTING FOR THE SHRINKING GAP,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,health inequality; infant health,UNITED-STATES; ADULT MORTALITY; LIFE EXPECTANCY; DIFFERENTIALS; EDUCATION; TRENDS,"Given that wealthier people are healthier, the increase in income inequality over the past two decades has led to fears that inequalities in health have also increased. Indeed, some papers have found that health disparities have become more salient among some adult populations. Using the US Vital Statistics 1983-2000, this paper presents a new stylized fact: the infant health disparity.. as measured by Apgar score, neonatal mortality and infant mortality, has been narrowing over the past two decades. This is in sharp contrast to the increasing disparities in health among adults of different educational backgrounds. Using a decomposition method, I find that the most important factor in explaining, the closing gap is an increase in access to medical care. All else being equal, access to proper medical care is the most important factor in explaining the narrowing infant health gap. Demographic shifts and maternal behavior changes are also significant factors, together explaining 42.2% of the closing gap in low Apgar score, 41.4% of the closing gap in neonatal death, and 45.6% of the closing gap in infant death.

In empirical applications, researchers almost always impose a parametric model for the propensity score. This practice raises the possibility that the model for the propensity score is misspecified and therefore the propensity score matching estimator of the average treatment effect may be inconsistent. We show that the common practice of calculating estimates of the densities of the propensity score conditional on the participation decision provides a means for examining whether the propensity score is misspecified. In particular, we derive a restriction between the density of the propensity score among participants and the density among nonparticipants. We show that this restriction between the two conditional densities is equivalent to a particular orthogonality restriction and derive a formal test based upon it. The resulting test is shown via a simulation Study to have dramatically greater power than competing tests for many alternatives. The principal disadvantage of this approach is loss of power against some alternatives. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The importance of PRO measures in clinical trials for new drugs, biological agents, and devices was underscored by the release of the US Food and Drug Administration's draft guidance for industry titled Patient-Reported Outcome Measures: Use in Medical Product Development to Support Labeling Claims. The intent of the guidance was to describe how the FDA will evaluate the appropriateness and adequacy of PRO measures used as effectiveness end points in clinical trials. In response to the expressed need of ISPOR members for further clarification of several aspects of the draft guidance, ISPOR's Health Science Policy Council created three task forces, one of which was charged with addressing the implications of the draft guidance for the collection of PRO data using electronic data capture modes of administration (ePRO). The objective of this report is to present recommendations from ISPOR's ePRO Good Research Practices Task Force regarding the evidence necessary to support the comparability, or measurement equivalence, of ePROs to the paper-based PRO measures from which they were adapted. The task force was composed of the leadership team of ISPOR's ePRO Working Group and members of another group (i.e., ePRO Consensus Development Working Group) that had already begun to develop recommendations regarding ePRO good research practices. The resulting task force membership reflected a broad array of backgrounds, perspectives, and expertise that enriched the development of this report. The prior work became the starting point for the Task Force report. A subset of the task force members became the writing team that prepared subsequent iterations of the report that were distributed to the full task force for review and feedback. In addition, review beyond the task force was sought and obtained. Along with a presentation and discussion period at an ISPOR meeting, a draft version of the full report was distributed to roughly 220 members of a reviewer group. The reviewer group comprised individuals who had responded to an emailed invitation to the full membership of ISPOR. This Task Force report reflects the extensive internal and external input received during the 16-month good research practices development process. An ePRO questionnaire that has been adapted from a paper-based questionnaire ought to produce data that are equivalent or superior (e.g., higher reliability) to the data produced from the original paper version. Measurement equivalence is a function of the comparability of the psychometric properties of the data obtained via the original and adapted administration mode. This comparability is driven by the amount of modification to the content and format of the original paper PRO questionnaire required during the migration process. The magnitude of a particular modification is defined with reference to its potential effect on the content, meaning, or interpretation of the measure's items and/or scales. Based on the magnitude of the modification, evidence for measurement equivalence can be generated through combinations of the following: cognitive debriefing/testing, usability testing, equivalence testing, or, if substantial modifications have been made, full psychometric testing. As long as only minor modifications were made to the measure during the migration process, a substantial body of existing evidence suggests that the psychometric properties of the original measure will still hold for the ePRO version. Hence, an evaluation limited to cognitive debriefing and usability testing only may be sufficient. However, where more substantive changes in the migration process has occurred, confirming that the adaptation to the ePRO format did not introduce significant response bias and that the two modes of administration produce essentially equivalent results is necessary. Recommendations regarding the study designs and statistical approaches for assessing measurement equivalence are provided. The electronic administration of PRO measures offers many advantages over paper administration. We provide a general framework for decisions regarding the level of evidence needed to support modifications that are made to PRO measures when they are migrated from paper to ePRO devices. The key issues include: 1) the determination of the extent of modification required to administer the PRO on the ePRO device and 2) the selection and implementation of an effective strategy for testing the measurement equivalence of the two modes of administration. We hope that these good research practice recommendations provide a path forward for researchers interested in migrating PRO measures to electronic data collection platforms.","[Coons, Stephen Joel] Univ Arizona, Coll Pharm, Ctr Hlth Outcomes & PharmacoEcon Res, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Gwaltney, Chad J.] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Gwaltney, Chad J.] PRO Consulting, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Hays, Ron D.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Gen Internal Med & Hlth Serv Res, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Hays, Ron D.] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA USA; [Lundy, J.

A review of the published literature was performed using Medline, to identify studies involving mathematical decision models to evaluate interventions for acute stroke treatment. Articles were analyzed to determine key components of a stroke model and to note areas in which data are lacking. We identified 13 published models of acute stroke treatment. These models typically possessed a short-term treatment module and a long-term post-treatment module. The following aspects of economic modeling were found to be relevant for developing a stroke model: modeling approach and health state; health state transition probabilities; estimation of short-term, long-term, and indirect costs; health state utilities; poststroke mortality; time horizon; model validation; and estimation of parameter uncertainty. Data gaps have limited the development of economic models in stroke to date. In order to more accurately assess the long-term incremental impact of a new treatment of stroke, future research is needed to address these data gaps. We recommend that the complexity of models for examining the cost-effectiveness of an acute stroke treatment be kept to a minimum such that it can incorporate the currently available data without making a large number of assumptions around the data.","[Earnshaw, Stephanie R.; Wilson, Michele; Mauskopf, Josephine] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Joshi, Ashish V.] Novo Nordisk Inc, Princeton, NJ USA",Research Triangle Institute; Novo Nordisk,"Earnshaw, SR (通讯作者)，3040 Cornwallis Rd,Box 12194, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",searnshaw@rti.org,,"Earnshaw, Stephanie/0000-0003-2975-6509; Mauskopf, Josephine/0000-0002-6098-5548",Novo Nordisk Inc.,Novo Nordisk Inc.(Novo Nordisk),"The authors would like to acknowledge Raymond Farkouh, PhD, for his assistance in conducting the review of the literature.; Source of financial support: Funding for this study was provided by Novo Nordisk Inc.

To determine whether hourly rate, inpatient day, and marginal mark-up allocation are reliable alternatives for weighted service allocation. The cost approaches were compared independently for appendectomy, hip replacement, cataract, and stroke in representative general hospitals in The Netherlands for 2005. Hourly rate allocation and inpatient day allocation produce estimates that are not significantly different from weighted service allocation. Hourly rate allocation may be a strong alternative to weighted service allocation for hospital services with a relatively short inpatient stay.

Using data from the National Population Health Survey (1998), it utilizes a recursive bivariate probit approach to take into account the potential endogeneity of diabetes in employment outcomes. The results Suggest that treating diabetes as exogenous yields an over-estimation of its impact on male employment. The Study finds that diabetes has a significant negative impact on female employment probability, but hits no significant impact on that of non-white Canadians. An implication thus is that policy-makers should take endogeneity into account in estimating labor market costs of chronic diseases Such as diabetes.

Objectives: Using microcosting and two gross-costing methods, we (1) compared the cost estimates within and across subjects, and (2) determined the impact on the results of an economic evaluation. Methods: Microcosting estimates were obtained from the local health region and gross-costing estimates were obtained from two government bodies (one provincial and one national). Total inpatient costs were described for each method. Using an economic evaluation of sirolimus-eluting stents, we compared the incremental cost-utility ratios that resulted from applying each method. Results: Microcosting, Case-Mix-Grouper (CMG) gross-costing, and Refined-Diagnosis-Related grouper (rDRG) gross-costing resulted in 4-year mean cost estimates of $16684, $16232, and $10474, respectively. Using Monte Carlo simulation, the cost per QALY gained was $41764 (95% CI: $41 182-$42346), $42538 (95% CI: $42167-$42907), and $36566 (95% CI: $36172-$36960) for microcosting, rDRG-derived and CMG-derived estimates, respectively (P<0.001). Conclusions: Within subject, the three costing methods produced markedly different cost estimates. The difference in cost-utility values produced by each method is modest but of a magnitude that could influence a decision to fund a new intervention.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential cost-utility of implementing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) testing before initiating second-line therapy for advanced refractory non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We developed a decision analytic model to evaluate the cost-utility of EGFR protein expression or gene copy number testing compared to standard care with erlotinib in refractory advanced NSCLC patients. Costs and utilities were obtained from publicly available sources. We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate uncertainty in the results. The quality-adjusted life expectancies for erlotinib, EGFR protein expression testing, and gene copy number testing were: 0.44, 0.48, and 0.50 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); and the costs were: $57,238, $63,512, and $66,447, respectively. The most cost-effective testing option, EGFR gene copy number testing, produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $162,018/QALY compared to no testing (erlotinib). The results were most sensitive to the survival estimates, health state utilities, and cost of disease progression. In the probabilistic sensitivity analyses, erlotinib without testing was the optimal treatment strategy until the $150,000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold, after which gene copy testing was optimal. The discounted expected value of perfect information at a $100,000/QALY threshold in the USA over 5 years was $31.4 million. The study results suggest that EGFR pharmacogenomic testing has the potential to improve quality-adjusted life expectancy in the treatment of refractory NSCLC by a clinically meaningful margin at a value commensurate with the approved therapies in this setting. Additional research in this area is warranted.","[Carlson, Josh J.] Univ Washington, Dept Pharm, Sch Pharm, Pharmaceut Outcomes Res & Policy Program, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Ramsey, Scott D.] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98104 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center,"Carlson, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Pharm, Sch Pharm, Pharmaceut Outcomes Res & Policy Program, Box 357630, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",carlsojj@u.washington.edu,,,PhRMA Foundation,PhRMA Foundation,Source of financial support: Josh Carlson was supported in part by a Pre Doctoral Fellowship in Health Outcomes from the PhRMA Foundation.,,61,61,68,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2009,12.0,1,,,,,20,27,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00415.x,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,397XX,18647257.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000262696800004,0

Electromagnetic features of stator windings of the considered motors were evaluated on the base of harmonic analysis of rotating magnetomotive forces created by them and by calculating electromagnetic efficiency factors on the base of the analysis results. It was determined that the electromagnetic efficiency factor of the single-layer former three-phase winding k(efl) = 0,9139, and for sinusoidal three-phase winding - k(ef2) = 0,9335, i.e. by 2,14% higher than the factor of the first winding. All power indexes of standard dimensioned asynchronous motor with single-layer winding and of motor with stator winding replaced with sinusoidal three-phase winding were calculated after completing no-load and load tests of the motor and by applying the segregated-losses method. It was found that the phase current of the asynchronous motor with stator winding replaced with sinusoidal three phase winding under indicated load decreased by 6,9%, power taken from electric grid decreased by 5,0%, power losses decreased by 11,7%, efficiency factor increased by 2,4% and power factor increased by 3,4% compare to the respective power indexes of the standard dimensioned asynchronous motor under the same load.

The validated CORE Diabetes Model was modified to project long-term clinical and cost outcomes associated with pioglitazone versus placebo, based on results from PROactive. The model retained basic structure and functionality, with interdependent Markov submodels, Monte Carlo simulation and user interface. Adjustments to submodels were made to accommodate the PROactive primary end points. The analysis was from the perspective of a third party US health-care payer perspective, projected over a lifetime horizon using a 3% annual discount. Over a lifetime horizon, addition of pioglitazone was associated with increased life expectancy (0.237 life-years) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) [0.166 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)] versus placebo. Estimated long-term complication rates showed that pioglitazone reduced the number of events versus placebo for most outcomes. Lifetime total direct costs were marginally higher with pioglitazone versus placebo ($272,694 vs. $265,390, difference $7,305). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for pioglitazone versus placebo was $44,105 per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated a 55% likelihood that pioglitazone would be considered cost-effective in the United States, with a willingness to pay of $50,000 per QALY gained. The addition of pioglitazone to existing therapy in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes was projected to improve life expectancy, QALE and complication rates compared with placebo.

An endogenous multivariate probit model is used to account for the potential endogeneity of the incidence of chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and mental illnesses. The cross-equation correlations are significant, rejecting the exogeneity of the chronic illnesses. Marginal effects of exogenous socio-demographic and lifestyle variables are estimated through their direct effects on labour market participation and indirect effects via the chronic diseases. The treatment effects of chronic diseases on labour force participation are estimated via conditional probabilities using five-dimensional normal distributions. The estimated effects differ by gender and age groups. Although computationally more demanding, these treatment effects are compared with results from a univariate model treating the chronic conditions exogenous and the structural effects from the multivariate probit model; both significantly overestimate the effects.

The most common econometric models of physician utilization are parametric count data models, since the most common metric of physician utilization is the number of physician visits. This paper makes two distinct contributions to the literature analyzing GP utilization: (i) it is the first to use a nonparametric kernel conditional density estimator to model GP utilization and compare the predicted utilization with that from a latent class negative binomial model; and (ii) it uses panel data to control for the potential endogeneity between self-reported health status and the number of GP visits. The goodness-of-fit results show the kernel conditional density estimator provides a better fit to the observed distribution of GP visits than the latent class negative binomial model. There are some meaningful differences in how the predicted conditional mean number of GP visits changes with a change in an individual's characteristics, called the incremental effect (IE), between the kernel conditional density estimator and the latent class negative binomial model. The most notable differences are observed in the right tail of the distribution where the IEs from the latent class negative binomial model are up to 190 times the magnitude of the IEs from the kernel conditional density estimator.

Most of them are concerned only with linear causality in mean, or if a series linearly affects the (conditional) mean of the other series. It is no doubt of primary interest, but dependence between series may be nonlinear, and/or not only through the conditional mean. Indeed conditional heteroskedastic models are widely studied recently. The purpose of this paper is to propose a nonparametric test for possibly nonlinear causality. Taking into account that dependence in higher order moments are becoming an important issue especially in financial time series, we also consider a test for causality up to the Kth conditional moment. Statistically, we can also view this test as a nonparametric omitted variable test in time series regression. A desirable property of the test is that it has nontrivial power against T(1/2)-local alternatives, where T is the sample size. Also, we can form a test statistic accordingly if we have some knowledge on the alternative hypothesis. Furthermore, we show that the test statistic includes most of the omitted variable test statistics as special cases asymptotically. The null asymptotic distribution is not normal, but we can easily calculate the critical regions by simulation. Monte Carlo experiments show that the proposed test has good size and power properties.

Compared with the test in Ait-Sahalia and Jacod (2009), our new test enjoys the same asymptotic properties but has smaller variance. These results are justified both theoretically and numerically. We also propose a new procedure to locate the jumps. The jump identification problem reduces to a multiple comparison problem. We employ the false discovery rate approach to control the probability of type I error. Numerical studies further demonstrate the power of our new method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Merging the economists' and developmental psychologists' approaches, it also attempts to identify the main mechanisms through which family economic resources translate into better developmental outcomes for children. The relative and joint relevance of three groups of mediating factors (parental stress, parental investment and other family-related pathways), identified from the recent economic and psychological literature, are examined both in a cross-sectional ('mopping-up' approach) and in a panel data (fixed effects models) context. Results indicate a weak or absent direct effect of family economic resources on child development after controlling for potential mediating mechanisms. The study also identifies key mediating factors (e.g. maternal depression, a cognitively stimulating home environment, parenting practices and length of breastfeeding) that could be targeted by government initiatives in order to effectively improve children's intellectual development and behaviour beyond what income redistribution can achieve.

Methods: Subjects were randomly assigned to: 1) paper then IVR, or 2) IVR then paper and asked to complete the questionnaire two days apart. The analyses tested mean differences (repeated measures analysis of variance) and reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]). Equivalence of the means was established if the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the mean difference was within the minimally important difference interval: -0.035 to 0.035 for the EQ-5D index and -3 to 3 for the visual analog scale (EQ VAS). ICC adequacy was tested by comparing the ICC 95% lower CI with a critical value of 0.70. Results: The analyses included 113 subjects for the index and 109 subjects for the EQ VAS. For the index, the adjusted means of the paper and IVR versions were 0.789 +/- 0.016 and 0.798 +/- 0.017, respectively. The 95% CI of the mean difference was -0.024 to 0.006, within the equivalence interval. The ICC was 0.894 (95% lower CI 0.857), significantly greater than 0.70. For the EQ VAS, the adjusted means were 71.94 +/- 1.87 for paper and 74.63 +/- 1.79 for IVR. The 95% CI of the mean difference was -4.347 to -1.049, partially within the equivalence interval. The ICC was 0.887 (95% lower CI 0.840), significantly greater than 0.70. Conclusions: The results provide evidence that the EQ-5D scores on the IVR version were sufficiently equivalent to those obtained on the paper version.","[Lundy, J.

They often draw on data from explanatory trials and hence are not always applicable to the decision problem. HTAs may therefore not meet the needs of decision makers. Our objective was to develop and apply a checklist to: 1) systematically frame HTAs in a way that they are applicable to the decision problem; and 2) assess if a decision problem can be informed by an available HTA. Methods: We reviewed published literature to identify factors that should be considered when framing HTAs for resource allocation decisions. The checklist was finalized in collaboration with clinicians and policy makers. We applied the checklist to the economic evaluation of trastuzumab in early breast cancer. We defined a reference case and for each study, retrieved through a systematic review, we examined if each factor was explicitly considered. Results: A checklist was developed with 11 factors (e.g., clinical practice, consequences, and patient use). In the case of trastuzumab, most factors were considered by the 11 retrieved economic evaluations. Two factors, being the inclusion of all relevant comparators and professional use, were considered by none of the studies. Conclusions: We developed a comprehensive checklist with 11 factors to frame HTAs and to assess the applicability of HTAs to resource allocation decisions. Economic evaluations on trastuzumab considered some of these factors, but overlooked others. The proposed checklist assists in systematically considering all factors in developing the conceptual model of an HTA, to make HTAs better reflect the decision problem.","[Grutters, Janneke P.

Methods: Data were collected from 2890 adolescents attending 13 secondary schools in the state of Victoria, Australia. The Assessment of Quality of Life 6-Dimension (AQoL-6D) questionnaire was used to measure individual utility. Adolescent's height and weight were measured and weight status categories assigned according to the World Health Organization adolescent growth standards. Multivariate linear regression analyses were undertaken for the whole population and subpopulations of boys and girls to estimate the mean differences in utility scores between 1) overweight and healthy weight and 2) obese and healthy weight adolescents, while controlling for demographic and socioeconomic status variables. Results: The mean age of adolescents was 14.6 years, 56.2% were boys, 22.2% were overweight, and 9.4% were obese. The mean utility of healthy weight adolescents was 0.860. After adjustments, the overweight and obese groups reported significantly lower mean utility scores (differences: -0.018 and -0.059, respectively, relative to the healthy weight group). This can be interpreted as equivalent to a stated willingness to sacrifice 1.8% and 5.9% of a life in perfect health or 2.3% and 6.8% of a life at healthy weight. A significant utility difference associated with overweight was only experienced by girls (-0.039, P = 0.003). Both sexes experienced significant utility differences associated with obesity, but the magnitude was double for girls (-0.084, P < 0.001) relative to boys (-0.041, P = 0.022). Conclusion: Utility is lower among overweight and more so among obese adolescents.","[Richardson, Jeff] Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Swinburn, Boyd A.] Deakin Univ, WHO Collaborating Ctr Obes Prevent, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Monash University; World Health Organization; Deakin University,"Keating, CL (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",catherine.keating@deakin.edu.au,,"Moodie, Marjory/0000-0001-6890-5250; Richardson, Jeff/0000-0002-4248-4280",Australian National Health and Medical Research Council [274320],Australian National Health and Medical Research Council(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),Source of financial support: Australian National Health and Medical Research Council International Collaborative Research Grant no. 274320.,,24,16,17,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2011,14.0,5,,,,,752,758,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.02.1181,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BG,21839415.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299081300018,0

When an intervention affects only a few causes of death accounting for a small fraction of all deaths, this approach may lack precision. We develop a novel technique for cost-effectiveness analysis when life-years gained are estimated from cause-specific mortality, allowing for competing causes of death. In the context of randomised trial data, we adjust for other-cause mortality combined across randomised groups. This method yields a greater precision than analysis based on total mortality, and we show application to life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years gained, incremental costs, and cost effectiveness. In multi-state health economic models, however, mortality from competing causes is commonly derived from national statistics and is assumed to be known and equal across intervention groups. In such models, our method based on cause-specific mortality and standard methods using total mortality give essentially identical estimates and precision. The methods are applied to a randomised trial and a health economic model, both of screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm. A gain in precision for cost-effectiveness estimates is clearly helpful for decision making, but it is important to ensure that 'cause-specific mortality' is defined to include all causes of death potentially affected by the intervention.

Because there are limited high-quality adult influenza Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) measures, the aim was to develop and validate a simple but comprehensive questionnaire for epidemiological research and clinical trials. Methods: Construct and item generation was guided by the literature, concept mapping, focus groups, and interviews with individuals with laboratory-confirmed influenza and expert physicians. Items were administered to 311 people with influenza-like illness (ILI) across 25 US sites. Analyses included classic psychometrics, structural equation modeling (SEM), and Rasch analyses. Results: Concept mapping generated 149 concepts covering the influenza experience and clustered into symptoms and impact on daily activities, emotions, and others. Items were drafted using simplicity and brevity criteria. Eleven symptoms from the literature underwent review by physicians and patients, and two were removed and one added. The symptoms domain factored into systemic and respiratory symptoms, whereas the impact domains were unidimensional. All domains displayed good internal consistency (Cronbach alpha >= 0.8) except the three-item respiratory domain (alpha = 0.48). A five-factor SEM indicated excellent fit where systemic, respiratory, and daily activities domains differentiated patients with ILI or confirmed influenza. All scales were responsive over time. Conclusions: Patient and clinician consultations resulted in an influenza PRO measure with high validity and good overall evidence of reliability and responsiveness. The Influenza Intensity and Impact Questionnaire (FluiiQ (TM)) will improve the evaluation of existing and future agents designed to prevent or control influenza infection by increasing the breadth and depth of measurement in this field.","[Osborne, Richard H.; Elsworth, Gerald R.; Busija, Lucy] Deakin Univ, Populat Hlth Strateg Res Ctr, Fac Hlth, Melbourne, Vic 3125, Australia; [Norquist, Josephine M.; Mehta, Vinay; Herring, Tim; Gupta, Swati B.] Merck Sharpe & Dohme Corp UGID 60, N Wales, PA USA; [Busija, Lucy] Univ Melbourne, Royal Victorian Eye & Ear Hosp, Ctr Eye Res Australia, Populat Hlth Unit, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Busija, Lucy] Univ Melbourne, Royal Victorian Eye & Ear Hosp, Ctr Eye Res Australia, Macular Res Unit, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Deakin University; Royal Victorian Eye & Ear Hospital; Centre for Eye Research Australia; University of Melbourne; Royal Victorian Eye & Ear Hospital; Centre for Eye Research Australia; University of Melbourne,"Osborne, RH (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Populat Hlth Strateg Res Ctr, Fac Hlth, 221 Burwood Highway, Melbourne, Vic 3125, Australia.",richard.osborne@deakin.edu.au,"Osborne, Richard H/A-9447-2010; Busija, Lucy/Y-6064-2019","Osborne, Richard H/0000-0002-9081-2699; Busija, Lucy/0000-0001-7464-9089; Herring, Timothy/0000-0002-3475-8616",Merck Sharpe & Dohme (MSD) Corp.; National Health and Medical Research Council,Merck Sharpe & Dohme (MSD) Corp.; National Health and Medical Research Council(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),"This research was sponsored by Merck Sharpe & Dohme (MSD) Corp.

Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1997 Cohort), we find that granting legal access to alcohol at age 21 leads to an increase in several measures of alcohol consumption, including an up to a 13 percentage point increase in the probability of drinking. Furthermore, this effect is robust under several different parametric and non-parametric models. We also find some evidence that the discrete jump in alcohol consumption at age 21 has negative spillover effects on marijuana use but does not affect the smoking habits of young adults. Our results indicate that although the change in alcohol consumption habits of young adults following their 21st birthday is less severe than previously known, policies that are designed to reduce drinking among young adults may have desirable impacts and can create public health benefits.

Previous studies have assessed the economic impact of such nonpersistence, but differences across antidepressant products remain inadequately explored. Objective: To compare treatment persistence and incremental cost/persistence ratios (ICPRs) across individual new ADs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and atypical ADs) as well as the associated direct health-care costs in the adult population covered by the public drug program of Quebec. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 13,936 adults aged 18 to 64 years who started an AD treatment in 2003. Persistence was defined as treatment duration of at least 6 months regardless of whether a product switch had occurred. Economic impact was assessed over the first year of treatment through drug, medical services, hospitalization, and total health-care costs. Comparisons across products were conducted using the ICPR. Results: Adjusting for confounders, treatment nonpersistence ranged from 60.4% (paroxetine) to 65.1% (citalopram). The product associated with the highest total health-care costs was citalopram (CDN$2653) and the lowest was venlafaxine (CDN$2168). Fluvoxamine had the lowest mean AD costs (CDN$215) and venlafaxine (CDN$309) the highest. Conclusions: Total health-care costs were similar across products except for citalopram, which was more costly. Comparisons based on the ICPR revealed that paroxetine, fluoxetine, and venlafaxine were more favorable than the other AD alternatives.","[Beland, Sarah-Gabrielle; Ducruet, Thierry; Pariente, Antoine; Moride, Yola] Univ Montreal, Fac Pharm, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Tournier, Marie; Pariente, Antoine] Univ Victor Segalen, INSERM, U657, Bordeaux, France; [Tournier, Marie] SMBD Jewish Gen Hosp, Ctr Clin Epidemiol & Community Studies, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Crott, Ralph] York Univ, Ctr Reviews & Disseminat, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Moride, Yola] Univ Montreal, Hosp Ctr CRCHUM, Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universite de Montreal; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite de Bordeaux; University of York - UK; Universite de Montreal,"Moride, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, Fac Pharm, CP 6128,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.",yola.moride@umontreal.ca,"Pariente, Antoine/S-9231-2019; Tournier, Marie/T-6493-2019; Crott, Ralph/AAH-2375-2020","Pariente, Antoine/0000-0002-7873-5483;",Conseil du Medicament/Fonds de la recherche en sante du Quebec (FRSQ),Conseil du Medicament/Fonds de la recherche en sante du Quebec (FRSQ),Study funded by the Conseil du Medicament/Fonds de la recherche en sante du Quebec (FRSQ).,,52,11,13,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2011,14.0,4,,,,,492,498,,10.1016/j.jval.2010.11.015,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BC,21669374.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299080800013,0

By assuming that an individual has preferences concerning different states of the world, and that these preferences can be described by an individual social welfare function, the individuals' preferences for life-saving programs are elicited using a pair-wise choice experiment involving different life-saving programs. In the analyses, we calculate the social marginal rates of substitution between saved lives of people of different ages. We also test whether people have preferences for saving more life-years rather than only saving lives. In particular, we test and compare the two hypotheses that only lives matter and that only life-years matter. The results indicate that the value of a saved life decreases rapidly with age and that people have strong preferences for saving life-years rather than lives per se. Overall, the results clearly show the importance of the number of life-years saved in the valuation of life.

Methods: A Markov model was used to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of zero, four, six, or eight doses of vardenafil per month in hypothetical cohorts of 60-year-old male veterans with erectile dysfunction. Efficacy values for vardenafil were obtained from the literature, and vardenafil costs were obtained from Veterans Affairs pharmacy data. The analysis was conducted from a third-party payer perspective with a lifetime horizon, and the effect of parameter uncertainty was explored in one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: In the base case analysis, the cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained for four doses of vardenafil per month compared with no therapy was $576. Six doses per month compared with four cost $2585/quality-adjusted life-year gained, and eight doses per month compared with six cost $5169/quality-adjusted life-year gained. In one-way sensitivity analyses of six doses per month compared with four, variation of two parameters caused the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to cross a willingness-to-pay threshold of $20,000: when the increased utility associated with giving two additional doses/month was less than 0.001 (baseline 0.01) and when the cost per dose increased to $15.00 (baseline $1.69). Conclusion: Although four doses per month of vardenafil was the most cost-effective strategy, the use of six or eight doses per month also compares favorably with other accepted medical treatments. The results were stable across a range of inputs and help to support the current Veterans Affairs policy on the number of vardenafil doses provided per month for erectile dysfunction.

We call this adverse job turnover, and it implies that a firm's expected health costs will increase when health insurance is first offered. Health insurance premiums may fail to adjust sufficiently fast because state regulations restrict annual premium changes, or insurers are reluctant to change premiums rapidly. Even with premiums set at the long run expected costs, some firms may be charged premiums higher than their current expected costs and choose not to offer insurance. High administrative costs at small firms exacerbate this dynamic selection problem. Using 1998-1999 MEDSTAT MarketScan and 1997 Employer Health Insurance Survey data, we find that expected employee health expenditures at firms that offer insurance have lower within-firm and higher between-firm variance than at firms that do not. Turnover rates are systematically higher in industries in which firms are less likely to offer insurance. Simulations of the offer decision capturing between-firm health-cost heterogeneity and expected turnover rates match the observed pattern across firm sizes well.

MF-HXA is a multivariate generalization of the height-height correlation analysis. We show that long-range cross-correlations can be caused by a mixture of the following - long-range dependence of separate processes and additional scaling of covariances between the processes. Similar separation applies for cross-multifractality - standard separation between distributional properties and correlations is enriched by division of correlations between auto-correlations and cross-correlations.

I test the hypothesis that the current financial turmoil caused no change in the price jump behavior. I employ data on realized trades for 16 stocks and one ETF from the NYSE TAQ database. These data come at 1-minute frequency and span the period from January 2008 to the end of July 2009. The recent financial crisis is generally understood to start with the plunge of Lehman Brothers shares on September 9, 2008, which lies in the middle of the data set. I employ five model-independent and three model-dependent price jump indicators to robustly assess the price jump behavior. Although the results confirm an increase in overall volatility during the recent financial crisis; the results cannot reject the hypothesis that there was no change in price jump behavior in the data during the financial crisis. This implies that the uncertainty during the crisis was scaled up but the structure of the uncertainty seems to be the same.","[Novotny, Jan] Charles Univ Prague, CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague,,jnovotny@cerge-ei.cz,"Novotny, Jan/H-2906-2014",,,,,,14,0,0,0,4,PROFESSIONAL PUBLISHING,PRUHONICE,"NA SIDLISTI 152, PRUHONICE, PRAGUE 252 43, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7431-058-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,517,522,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BBZ07,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000309074600085,0

The objective of this study was to predict the long-term clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of maraviroc in treatment-experienced adults with HIV/AIDS in Mexico. Methods: The AntiRetroviral Analysis by Monte Carlo Individual Simulation (ARAMIS) model was adapted to the Mexican context to predict clinical and economic outcomes of treating with optimized background therapy (OBT) versus testing for viral tropism status and treating with OBT +/- maraviroc accordingly in treatment-experienced adults in Mexico. Baseline characteristics and efficacy were from the MOTIVATE trials' screening cohort. Costs and population mortality data were specific to Mexico. Results were reported from the perspective of health care payers in 2008 Mexican pesos (converted to 2008 US$ in parentheses). Results: Compared to treatment with OBT alone, treatment with OBT +/- maraviroc contingent on tropism test result increased projected undiscounted life expectancy and discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy from 7.54 to 8.71 years and 4.42 to 4.92 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), respectively, at an incremental cost of $228,215 (US$21,329). The resultant incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $453,978 (US$42,429) per QALY gained. The ICER was somewhat lower when maraviroc was modeled in individuals susceptible to < 2 components of OBT ($407,329; US$38,069), while the ICER was higher in individuals susceptible to >= 3 OBT components ($718,718; US$67,171). Conclusion: In treatment-experienced individuals with HIV/AIDS in Mexico, maraviroc may be cost-effective, particularly in individuals with limited options for active antiretroviral therapy (ART).","[Becker, Debbie] i3 Innovus, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Burlington, ON L7L 6B8, Canada; [Contreras-Hernandez, Iris] Social Secur Mexican Inst, Hlth Econ Res Unit, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Chancellor, Jeremy; Kuehne, Felicitas] i3 Innovus, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Mould-Quevedo, Joaquin; Vega, Gabriela] Pfizer Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Marfatia, Shalaka] Pfizer Inc, New York, NY USA; [Kuehne, Felicitas] PharmacoConsult, Uxbridge, Middx, England",i3 Innovus; i3 Innovus; Pfizer; Pfizer,"Becker, D (通讯作者)，i3 Innovus, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, 1016 Sutton Dr, Burlington, ON L7L 6B8, Canada.",Debbie.becker@i3innovus.com,"Mould-Quevedo, Joaquin/AAT-7532-2021","Chancellor, Jeremy/0000-0003-1415-7554",Pfizer Inc.,Pfizer Inc.(Pfizer),This study was sponsored by Pfizer Inc.

The overarching point of the essay is that CM and CCT are often treated as distinct areas of inquiry when at their core they represent a common approach. Some potential bi-directional benefits of recognizing this commonality are discussed. Distinct intellectual traditions probably account for the separate paths of CM and CCT to date, with the former being rooted in behavioral psychology and the latter in microeconomics. It is concluded that the emerging field of behavioral economics, which is informed by and integrates principles of each of those disciplines, may provide the proper conceptual framework for integrating CM and CCT.

This is due to the boundary behavior of the cumulative prospect theory value function, which might cause an infinite short-selling problem. But even when a non-negativity constraint on final wealth is added, non-existence can occur due to the non-convexity of CPT preferences, which might cause discontinuities in the agents' demand functions. This latter observation also implies that concavification arguments which has been used in portfolio allocation problems with CPT preferences do not apply to our general equilibrium setting with finite many agents. Existence of equilibria is established when non-negativity constraints on final wealth are imposed and there is a continuum of agents in the market. However, if the original prospect theory is used instead of cumulative prospect theory, then other discontinuity problems can cause non-existence of market equilibria even in this case.

The prominence of observations with no expenditure for some short periods of observation and the extreme skewness typical of these data raise concerns about the robustness of estimators based on inverse probability weighting (IPW) with the survival from censoring probabilities. These estimators also cannot distinguish between the effects of covariates on survival and intensity of utilization, which jointly determine costs. In this paper, we propose a new estimator that extends the class of two-part models to deal with random right censoring and for continuous death and censoring times. Our model also addresses issues about the time to death in these analyses and separates the survival effects from the intensity effects. Using simulations, we compare our proposed estimator to the inverse probability estimator, which shows bias when censoring is large and covariates affect survival. We find our estimator to be unbiased and also more efficient for these designs. We apply our method and compare it with the IPW method using data from the Medicare SEER files on prostate cancer.

One important aim of the paper is to demonstrate that a structured 1(2) analysis is useful for a better understanding of the empirical regularities underlying the persistent swings in nominal exchange rates, typical in periods of floating exchange rates.

In particular, we address the simultaneous confidence set estimation of a finite number of ratios. Results apply to a wide class of models suitable for estimation by consistent asymptotically normal procedures. Conventional methods (e.g. the delta method) derived by excluding the parameter discontinuity regions entailed by the ratio functions and which typically yield bounded confidence limits, break down even if the sample size is large (Dufour, 1997). One solution to this problem, which we take in this paper, is to use variants of Fieller's (1940, 1954) method. By inverting a joint test that does not require identifying the ratios, Fieller-based confidence regions are formed for the full set of ratios. Simultaneous confidence sets for individual ratios are then derived by applying projection techniques, which allow for possibly unbounded outcomes. In this paper, we provide simple explicit closed-form analytical solutions for projection-based simultaneous confidence sets, in the case of linear transformations of ratios. Our solution further provides a formal proof for the expressions in Zerbe et al. (1982) pertaining to individual ratios. We apply the geometry of quadrics as introduced by Dufour and Taamouti (2005, 2007), in a different although related context. The confidence sets so obtained are exact if the inverted test statistic admits a tractable exact distribution, for instance in the normal linear regression context. The proposed procedures are applied and assessed via illustrative Monte Carlo and empirical examples, with a focus on discrete choice models estimated by exact or simulation-based maximum likelihood. Our results underscore the superiority of Fieller-based methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Making labor supply endogenous leads us to prove the existence of two kinds of steady state: the one where everybody supplies labor, the other where only the most patient agent refrains from working. Going beyond models with inelastic labor supply, we show how preferences of impatient agents affect the saddle-path stability of each type of steady state and the occurrence of endogenous cycles. When their elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption exceeds one, instability and cycles are less likely, requiring lower degrees of capital-labor substitution. Conversely, elasticity values below one promote the emergence of fluctuations. We end the paper by showing the existence of the intertemporal equilibrium under market incompleteness, using a local approach based on the first-order conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

These include the ultimate functionality of the device, the cost of producing it and whether, and at what price, it can be sold to a health-care provider (HCP). Simple assessments of value can be made by estimating such unknowns, but the levels of uncertainty may mean that their operational value for investment decisions is unclear. However, many decisions taken at the concept stage are reversible and will be reconsidered later before the product is brought to market. This flexibility can be exploited to enhance early-stage valuations. Objectives: To develop a framework for valuing a new medical device at the concept stage that balances benefit to the HCP against commercial costs. This is done within a simplified stage-gated model of the development cycle for new products. The approach is intended to complement existing proposals for the evaluation of the commercial headroom available to new medical products. Conclusions: A model based on two decision gates can lead to lower bounds (underestimates) for product value that can serve to support a decision to develop the product. Quantifiable uncertainty that can be resolved before the device is brought to market will generally enhance early-stage valuations of the device, and this remains true even when some components of uncertainty cannot be fully described. Clinical trials and other evidence-gathering activities undertaken as part of the development process can contribute to early-stage estimates of value.","[Girling, Alan] Univ Birmingham, Dept Publ Hlth Epidemiol & Biostat, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Young, Terry] Brunel Univ, London, England",University of Birmingham; Brunel University,"Girling, A (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept Publ Hlth Epidemiol & Biostat, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",A.J.Girling@bham.ac.uk,"Girling, Alan J/A-7843-2012","Young, Terry/0000-0001-9545-2269; Girling, Alan/0000-0003-2022-045X; Brown, Celia/0000-0002-7526-0793",EPSRC [GR/S29874/01]; EPSRC [EP/F063822/1] Funding Source: UKRI; MRC [G0800808] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/F063822/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Medical Research Council [G0800808] Funding Source: researchfish,EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"The authors acknowledge support of this work through the MATCH program (EPSRC Grant GR/S29874/01), although the views expressed are entirely their own.",,26,37,38,0,26,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2010,13.0,5,,,,,585,591,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00726.x,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,635RQ,20412542.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280674200011,0

Methods: A cost-utility analysis performed alongside a pragmatic RCT in a single hospital within Scotland on women undergoing MEA and TBALL. Resource use data collected from all 314 trial participants were combined with study specific and published unit cost data to estimate a cost per patient. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were based on EQ-5D responses at baseline, 2 weeks, 6 and 12 months. The incremental cost per QALY of TBALL versus MEA was calculated and bootstrapping was performed to determine the likelihood that a treatment would be cost-effective at different threshold values for society's willingness to pay for a QALY. Results: The mean cost of TBALL (10 years equipment life, 100 uses annually) of reusable equipment was 181 pound (95% confidence interval [CI] 70-434) pound greater than MEA. There were no statistically significant differences between the total nonhealth costs and health benefits of the two arms. On average, MEA provided more QALYs after adjusting for baseline EQ-5D score (0.017; 95% CI 0.017-0.051). In terms of mean incremental cost per QALY, MEA was, on average, dominant (less costly and at least as effective) and there was over a 90% chance that MEA would be considered cost-effective at a 20,000 pound threshold of a cost per QALY. Conclusions: MEA is likely to be more cost-effective than TBALL at 1 year.

Relative to ordinary least least-squares (OLS), a first difference model shows much lower association between the measures, suggesting that OLS methods may lead to biased estimates of the association, due to unobservable patient characteristics. The novel finding, revealed by quantile regression, is that the strength of association between the instruments is different across different parts of the health distribution, and is dependent on whether health improves or deteriorates. The results suggest that choosing one instrument at the expense of another is difficult without good prior information surrounding the expected magnitude and direction or health improvement related to a health-care intervention.

We sought to determine both financial and nonfinancial factors associated with CRN in a nationally representative sample of older adults. Methods: We used a conceptual model developed by Piette and colleagues that describes financial and nonfinancial factors that could increase someone's risk of CRN, including income, comorbidities, and medication regimen complexity. We used data from the 2004 wave of the Health and Retirement Study and the 2003 HRS Prescription Drug Study to examine the influence of factors within each of these domains on measures of CRN (including not filling, stopping, or skipping doses) in a nationally representative sample of Americans age 65+ in 2005. Results: Of the 3071 respondents who met study criteria, 20% reported some form of CRN in 2005. As in prior studies, indicators of financial stress such as higher out-of-pocket payments for medications and lower net worth were significantly associated with CAN in multivariable analyses. Controlling for these economic pressures, relatively younger respondents (ages 65-74) and depressive symptoms were consistent independent risk factors for CRN. Conclusions: Noncost factors influenced patients' propensity to forego treatment even in the context of cost concerns. Future research encompassing clinician and health system factors should identify additional determinants of CRN beyond patients' cost pressures.","[Zivin, Kara] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Zivin, Kara; Ratliff, Scott; Heisler, Michele M.; Langa, Kenneth M.; Piette, John D.] SMITREC, Ctr Excellence, Dept Vet Affairs, Hlth Serv Res & Dev HSR&D, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Heisler, Michele M.; Langa, Kenneth M.; Piette, John D.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Gen Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA; [Langa, Kenneth M.] Univ Michigan, Inst Social Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Zivin, K (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Rachel Upjohn Bldg,4250 Plymouth Rd,Box 5765, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",kzivin@umich.edu,"; Heisler, Michele/B-5774-2015","Langa, Kenneth/0000-0002-2798-1836; Zivin, Kara/0000-0001-8246-6864; Heisler, Michele/0000-0002-6889-2063","National Institute on Aging (NIA) [U01 AG09740]; Department of Veterans Affairs, Health Services Research and Development Service [CD2 07-206-1]; Michigan Diabetes Research and Training Center (NIH) [5P60-DK020572]; Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research (NIH) [UL1RR024986]","National Institute on Aging (NIA)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); Department of Veterans Affairs, Health Services Research and Development Service(US Department of Veterans Affairs); Michigan Diabetes Research and Training Center (NIH)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research (NIH)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)","The National Institute on Aging (NIA) provided funding for the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) (U01 AG09740), data from which were used for this analysis.

His proof of the existence and uniqueness of the steady-state equilibrium, which can be extended to other overlapping-generations models, relies on the shape of a function that appears in the equation defining the equilibrium. By focusing on the mean age as a function of the stable population growth rate instead of the function used in d'Albis (2007), we provide a simpler proof with more general conditions. We also obtain useful properties about the first and second derivatives of the mean age function that can be applied in future work. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The formulae that determine this distribution reflect populations' health needs and local differences in the prices of inputs. Labour is the most important input and area differences in the price of labour are measured by the Staff Market Forces Factor (MFF). This Staff MFF has been the subject of much debate. Though the Staff MFF has operated for almost 30 years this is the first academic paper to evaluate and test the theory and method that underpin the MFF. The theory underpinning the Staff MFF is the General Labour Market method. The analysis reported here reveals empirical support for this theory in the case of nursing staff employed by NHS hospitals, but fails to identify similar support for its application to medical staff. The paper demonstrates the extent of spatial variation in private sector and NHS wages, considers the choice of comparators and spatial geography, incorporates vacancy modelling and illustrates the effect of spatial smoothing.

Three players compete in two rounds. In the final round, a player who is leading in the race, but not yet beyond the reach of his competitors, is sabotaged more heavily. As a consequence, if all players start off at the same position, they do not work productively or sabotage at all in the first round. Thus sabotage is not only directly destructive, but also depresses incentives to work productively. If players are heterogeneous ex ante, sabotage activities in the first round may be concentrated against an underdog, contrary to findings from static tournaments. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
