We measure the impacts of driving costs on congestion, and two other well-known feedback effects affecting motor-vehicle travel: its responses to aggregate road capacity (induced demand) and to driving costs including those caused by fuel-economy improvements (rebound effect). We measure these effects using cross-sectional time series data at the level of US states for 1966 through 2004. Results show that congestion affects the demand for driving negatively, as expected, and more strongly when incomes are higher. We decompose induced demand into effects from increasing overall accessibility of destinations and those from increasing urban capacity, finding the two elasticities close in magnitude and totaling about 0.16, somewhat smaller than most previous estimates. We confirm previous findings that the magnitude of the rebound effect decreases with income and increases with fuel cost, and find also that it increases with the level of congestion.

Before any such model can be applied in practice we must estimate its parameters and also examine its adequacy. A variety of methods have been developed to do this, but they are typically quite specific to the particular model at hand. In this paper we show that it is possible to develop a unified approach by recognizing that a statistical linear inverse structure arises when attempting to perform inference for any network-based model. This common structure provides the building blocks for the development a coherent theory for Bayesian inference for these models, which has a number of advantages of over more ad hoc methods. While calculation of the Bayesian posterior will typically be intractable, our unified framework allows us to design a generic Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling from this distribution in practice. We illustrate the operation of this algorithm on a section of the road network in the English city of Leicester. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, a number of choices are continuous response variables (e.g., location, departure time, activity duration, and vehicle usage). This paper introduces the continuous cross-nested logit (CCNL) model. The CCNL model results from generalizing the discrete cross-nested logit (CNL) model for a continuous response variable, much like the continuous logit model emerges by generalizing the MNL. The model is formulated and shown to come from the generalized extreme value (GEV) class of models. In addition, the structure of utility correlations is presented. The model's parameters are estimated for a work-tour departure time context using Bayesian estimation techniques and San Francisco Bay Area data. Empirical results suggest model predictions that are very similar to the continuous logit, but it out-performs the continuous logit in terms of out-of-sample prediction with these data. The CCNL also allows a more flexible choice behavior to emerge. Finally, a simple welfare example is illustrated and a number of model extensions are presented. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

It is assumed that when a link fails, another path or another transportation mode is provided to transport passengers between the endpoints of the affected link. The goal is to build a network that optimizes a certain utility function when failures occur. The problem is posed as a non-cooperative two-player zero-sum game with perfect information. The saddle points of the corresponding mixed enlarged game yield robust network designs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that congestion pricing and slot trading/slot auctioning do not lead to the same results. Total traffic is higher under slot auctions than under congestion pricing. Furthermore, if airport profits matter just marginally, then slot auctions will outperform congestion pricing in terms of achieving a higher objective-function value. On the other hand, if airport profits matter sufficiently highly, which mechanism is better is then very much dependent on parameter values. In particular, congestion pricing may be strongly preferred over slot auctions for certain parameter values. The impact of congestion-remedy mechanisms on individual carriers is also examined.

The proposed AMS model is a vehicle-based mesoscopic traffic simulation approach that explicitly considers the anisotropic property of traffic flow into the vehicle state update at each simulation step. The advantage of AMS is its ability to address a variety of uninterrupted flow conditions in a relatively simple, unified and computationally efficient manner. The discussions focus on the key modeling concepts, the analytical properties and numerical analysis, and the calibration process and results. The addressed analytical properties are the overtaking conditions, acceleration and deceleration rate bounds, and shock-waves. The numerical analysis includes both freeway segments as well as merging junctions. Considerable efforts were devoted to employ the Next-Generation Simulation (NGSIM) program datasets to calibrate the AMS model parameters. The high traffic fidelity and satisfactory computational efficiency make AMS a promising simulation approach for large-scale regional dynamic traffic simulation and assignment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper a system dynamics model is established to simulate the housing market. China's housing industry is faced with a great adjustment after the rapid development. Tax policy is one of the most important tools for the government to intervene in economic activities and balance the housing market.

Based on the development process and applied methods of software prototyping major model requirements have been elaborated. Four major requirement fields have been revealed. They can be subsumed into the categories of (1) performance, (2) integration, (3) institution and (4) quality (IIPQ), whereas point (1) is classified (a) spatial scales, (b) sectors and (c) indicator variables, (d) dynamic viability over time, (e) flexible system to select the level of implicit and explicit knowledge; point (2) is classified in (a) model response time (b) diversity of visualization results, (c) advanced technologies and system compatibility; point (3) on reliability information is structured in the three fields of (a) quality criteria on results, (b) assumptions and (c) back tracing. The point (4) on institutional embedment links the institutions; either trough stakeholder participation or expert consultations. The SIAT is finally classified according to the given criteria. The paper concludes on further requirements to maintain the model beyond project lifetime. Mainly funding issues, complementary further institutional embedment, flexibility towards new scopes of analysis, quality assurance and scientific publications have been described as major future challenges.","[Sieber, S.] Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Calle Inca Garcilaso, 3, ES-41092 Seville, Spain; [Mueller, K.; Tscherning, K.; Helming, K.; Pohle, D.; Fricke, K.] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res EV, Muncheberg, Germany; [Verweij, P.] Alterra, Wageningen, Netherlands",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS); Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); Wageningen University & Research,"Sieber, S (通讯作者)，Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Calle Inca Garcilaso, 3, ES-41092 Seville, Spain.",,"katharina, helming/HGC-2714-2022","Sieber, Stefan/0000-0002-4849-7277; Mueller, Klaus/0000-0002-4249-047X; Helming, Katharina/0000-0002-4379-7377",,,,,15,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1863-5520,,978-3-540-88350-0,ENVIRON SCI ENG,Environ.

In particular, some quality-controlled housing price indexes, such as the widely used hedonic price index, require regression models. Without data mining utilities, handling with regression models is the bottleneck of the whole job. This paper introduces a practical method of constructing real estate price indices, using the most common database software Microsoft SQL Server 2005, and gives out a demonstration. The result shows that this method can simplify the constructing process and provide confidential data with better protection. From this paper, it is clear that preparing index with SQL Server has several obvious advantages. First of all, it avoids exporting data outside, so that the security of confidential information will be enhanced. Secondly, by reducing manual operations, it improves the objectiveness of the index.

Attention must be paid to the economical use of construction land in these areas for the purposes of protecting arable land and constructing of resource-saving society. Studying on the standard for economical use of construction land and then applying it to urban and rural planning, land use planning and special planning could be an important way to enhance the level of economical use of construction land and to develop villages and towns healthily. In this paper, the standard framework for economical use, based on the analysis of problems existing in the use of construction land in villages and towns, is built from three levels. They are the total scale control level, the structural control level and the classification control level. It's a basis work for the standard framework to classify the construction land. It is found that construction land can be divided into 6 first class categories, 18 second class categories. The value of the standard must be made for all categories. Construction area per capita, the structure of construction land, each area of homestead, land for industry and warehouse, public administration and public service site are core indicators in the standard framework. Three suggestions are pointed out to implement the standard. It's necessary to determine the standard according to the local conditions in different regions.

These indicators were obtained through comparing and analyzing the selected recent literatures which served to illustrate the fundamental theoretical and empirical issues of environmental impact assessment in land use planning. Secondly, an extension engineering model about comprehensive evaluation of EIA of land use planning was set up according to matter-element model, correlation function and extenics theory. This model can transform the multi-criteria decision of EIA into the single-object decision, and provide a quantitative evaluation result by calculating the relation degree with using the correlation functions. The result can directly and soundly show the specific environmental status potentially produced by carrying out the land use planning. Finally, Zhoushan was chosen as a case study. The possible impacts on environment resulted from the land use planning were meticulously identified and predicted under scenarios of a given program subject to land use planning, and then the model and the indicators were applied to evaluate the environmental impact of land use planning. The results apparently and clearly reflect the level of environmental impact of land use planning in Zhoushan. The short-term program, to some extent, imposes a certain negative impact on the environment; therefore this program needs to be adjusted to decrease environmental impact. Nevertheless, the medium-term or long-term program is completely feasible in terms of environmental impact.

By comparing the immigration time of floating people in Beijing, it can be found that intervals of sequential migration are shortening. The average interval between primary immigrants to their parents is only 8.66 years. Besides, these households are showing typical features of direct-line families, for their years of staying in Beijing is becoming longer; their frequency of migrating again is lower; their settlement tendency is more significant. The tendency that direct-line families are gathering to Beijing indicates that there will be more advanced people will locate at where their children are living. For the purpose of obtaining true opinions of family members on their parents' migration, the essay constructs a conceptual model to reflect motivations and feasibilities, based on the hypothesis of so-called altruism contract.

The phenomenon of irreversible network change has been observed in reality. To model this phenomenon, we develop a day-to-day dynamic model whose fixed point is a boundedly rational user equilibrium (BRUE) flow. Our BRUE based approach to modeling irreversible network change has two advantages over other methods based on Wardrop user equilibrium (UE) or stochastic user equilibrium (SUE). First, the existence of multiple network equilibria is necessary for modeling irreversible network change. Unlike UE or SUE, the BRUE multiple equilibria do not rely on non-separable link cost functions, which makes our model applicable to real-world large-scale networks, where well-calibrated non-separable link cost functions are generally not available. Second, travelers' boundedly rational behavior in route choice is explicitly considered in our model. The proposed model is applied to the Twin Cities network to model the flow evolution during the collapse and reopening of the 1-35 W Bridge. The results show that our model can to a reasonable level reproduce the observed phenomenon of irreversible network change. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The demand is elastic in the sense that the service provider can accept any fraction of the origin-destination demand.

In this model, containers are carried by shipping lines operating strings (or port rotations) with given service frequencies. An origin-destination matrix of full containers is assigned to these strings to minimize sailing time plus container dwell time at the origin port and any intermediate transhipment ports. This necessitated two significant model extensions. The first involves the repositioning of empty containers so that a net outflow of full containers from any port is balanced by a net inflow of empty containers, and vice versa. As with full containers, empty containers are repositioned to minimize the sum of sailing and dwell time, with a facility to discount the dwell time of empty containers in recognition of the absence of inventory. The second involves the inclusion of an upper limit to the maximum number of container moves per unit time at any port. The dual variable for this constraint provides a shadow price, or surcharge, for loading or unloading a container at a congested port. Insight into the interpretation of the dual variables is given by proposition and proof. Model behaviour is illustrated by a simple numerical example. The paper concludes by considering the next steps toward realising a container assignment model that can, amongst other things, support the assessment of supply chain vulnerability to maritime disruptions.

The task is to recover the impacted train schedule from the current and future disturbances and minimize the expected additional delay under different forecasted operational conditions. Based on a stochastic programming with recourse framework, this paper incorporates different probabilistic scenarios in the rolling horizon decision process to recognize (1) the input data uncertainty associated with predicted segment running times and segment recovery times and (2) the possibilities of rescheduling decisions after receiving status updates. The proposed model periodically optimizes schedules for a relatively long rolling horizon, while selecting and disseminating a robust meet-pass plan for every roll period. A multi-layer branching solution procedure is developed to systematically generate and select meet-pass plans under different stochastic scenarios. Illustrative examples and numerical experiments are used to demonstrate the importance of robust disruption handling under a dynamic and stochastic environment. In terms of expected total train delay time, our experimental results show that the robust solutions are better than the expected value-based solutions by a range of 10-30%.

The upper level of the MNDP aims to optimize the network performance via both expansion of existing links and addition of new candidate links, whereas the lower level is a traditional Wardrop user equilibrium CUE) problem. In this paper, we first formulate the UE condition as a variational inequality (VI) problem, which is defined from a finite number of extreme points of a link-low feasible region. The MNDP is approximated as a piecewise-linear programming (P-LP) problem, which is then transformed into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. A global optimization algorithm based on a cutting constraint method is developed for solving the MILP problem.

In fact, their simple structure provides several advantages both to the passengers and to the management of the service. The design of such timetables has recently received a certain attention in the literature, but the standard model aims to optimize the service for a fixed demand. We relax this unrealistic assumption, taking into account the reciprocal influence between the quality of the timetable and the amount of transport demand captured by the railway. This results into a mixed-integer non linear model with a non-convex continuous relaxation. We solve it by a branch-and-bound algorithm based on a piecewise-linear overestimate of the objective function and a heuristic algorithm which iteratively applies the standard fixed-demand model and a demand-estimation model, feeding each one with data based on the solution obtained from the other one at the previous iteration.

For interrupted traffic flow on a signalized road, it has been recognized that the arterial fundamental diagram (AFD) is significantly affected by signal operations. But little research up to date has discussed in detail how signal operations impact the AFD. In this paper, based upon empirical observations from high-resolution event-based traffic signal data collected from a major arterial in the Twin Cities area, we study the impacts of g/C ratio, signal coordination, and turning movements on the cycle-based AFD, which describes the relationship between traffic flow and occupancy in a signal cycle. By microscopically investigating individual vehicle trajectories from event-based data, we demonstrate that not only g/C ratio constrains the capacity of a signalized approach, poor signal coordination and turning movements from upstream intersections also have significant impact on the capacity. We show that an arterial link may not be congested even with high occupancy values. Such high values could result from queue build-up during red light that occupies the detector, i.e. the Queue-Over-Detector (QOD) phenomenon discussed in this paper. More importantly, by removing the impact of QOD, a stable form of AFD is revealed, and one can use that to identify three different regimes including under-saturation, saturation, and over-saturation with queue spillovers. We believe the stable form of AFD is of great importance for traffic signal control because of its ability to identify traffic states on a signal link. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In a perfectly competitive framework with perfect information, the price of transport from low demand locations to high demand locations, the so-called backhaul price, drops to zero when the imbalance is sufficiently large. However, this result is inconsistent with empirical observations for many competitive transport markets (e.g. taxi and inland navigation markets). In this paper, we develop a matching model to show that a deviation from perfect information may address this inconsistency. We argue that carriers' search time to locate customers plays an important role in the determination of prices. We demonstrate that carriers are compensated for a part of the transport cost and for the time they search for customers. This implies positive backhaul prices. The matching model is numerically applied to the inland navigation shipping market in the Rhine river area in Western-Europe. We find that backhaul prices are substantial. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The goal of this research is to develop an emergency response planning tool that determines the location and quantities of various types of emergency supplies to be pre-positioned, under uncertainty about if, or where, a natural disaster will occur. The paper presents a two-stage stochastic mixed integer program (SMIP) that provides an emergency response pre-positioning strategy for hurricanes or other disaster threats. The SMIP is a robust model that considers uncertainty in demand for the stocked supplies as well as uncertainty regarding transportation network availability after an event. Due to the computational complexity of the problem, a heuristic algorithm referred to as the Lagrangian L-shaped method (LLSM) is developed to solve large-scale instances of the problem.

It consists of determining anonymous monthly schedules, called bidlines, that will be subsequently assigned to the crew members according to their bids and seniority. These bidlines must satisfy safety and collective agreement rules. Furthermore, to ensure an equity between the employees, each bidline should have as much as possible the same number of days off and the same number of credited (paid) hours. In this paper, we propose an approximate set partitioning type formulation for this problem and two heuristics for solving it. The first one is a standard branch-and-price heuristic that relies on a rounding procedure to derive integer solutions. The second one is obtained by combining this first heuristic with a dynamic constraint aggregation method that was recently proposed in the literature. Computational results show that, for the largest tested instances, the dynamic constraint aggregation heuristic can produce better quality solutions in a fraction of the computational time required by the standard branch-and-p rice heuristic.

The SATS problem is important because additional services must often be given access to the railway and subsequently integrated into current timetables. The SATS problem therefore considers the competition for railway infrastructure between new services and existing services belonging to the same or different operators. The SATS problem is characterised as a hybrid job shop scheduling problem with time window constraints.

A fixed volume of traffic is assigned to departure times and routes Such that the total system travel cost is minimized. We derive and discuss the necessary conditions on the network inflow for operating the transportation system optimally. We further provide detailed mathematical analysis and discussion of dynamic system optimal assignment when the deterministic queuing model is adopted. Solution algorithm is developed and investigated for solving the traffic assignments. The effect of choosing the underlying traffic model and time discretization on the quality of the corresponding assignment results are also discussed.

As PFI continues the implementation of the previous privatization which are formerly synonym with poor public accountability, reduction in competition as well as the development of monopolies, the key characteristics of PFI value-for-money delivery, performance assessment based on government's specification and viability enhancement through risk distribution among stakeholders are expected to streamline these privatization projects. Given that Malaysia's version of PFI is claimed as dissimilar from the archetypical PFI as it withdraws some of the PFI key elements of finance fully initiated by the private sector and suitability merely for the provision of social infrastructure projects, it is momentous for this paper to assess the real status of fair risk allocation in the Malaysia's version of PFI implementation.

Different from other real estimates, it requires a large investment of resources to maintain the attractiveness for visitors. Inappropriate strategy as well as incorrect scheduling may cause the failure of any development project. However, planners often subjectively overestimate the project or cater to the preferences of the investors, resulting in an over-developed or imbalanced development. This paper analyzed the characteristics of a recreation area and its facilities, and the relationships between facilities and people. We found that the activities in a recreation area development project are executed based on the resources provided. In the past, the main financial analysis used by planners for a development project was NPV. But this analysis is static and does not consider the resources during the process of development of the recreation area and its operation. We applied the simulation network to present and calculate the dynamic resource flows for the total duration of the project. We also established a decision support system. In addition to the simulation, the system has a dual-loop optimization model. It combines the polyploidy genetic algorithm and the haploid genetic algorithm to search the near-optimal facility development level set with the near-optimal NPV. This paper also evaluated the model using a realistic project and compared it with the planning carried out by human experts. The results showed that the model can propose a better plan faster than the human experts. With regards to the dynamics of resources and activities, the human experts couldn't provide a thorough consideration in their planning, while the model provided a fully integrated proposal. Because the complex calculations are done by the model instead of by the planner, and because the planning advice is proposed by the system, the decision making process has become substantially easier.","[Lee, H.

In the model, ground delay decisions are static, while those on rerouting are dynamic. The decision variables in the model are aggregate number of flights planned to arrive at various capacity constrained resources. The model does not directly assign arrival times to individual flights. Therefore, in context of Collaborative Decision Making, which is the governing philosophy of the air traffic management system of the United States, the solutions from the dynamic rerouting model can be directly fed to some resource allocation algorithm that assigns routes and release times to individual flights or to the airlines who operate them. When adverse weather blocks or severely limits capacity of terminal approach routes, rerouting flights onto other approaches yields substantial benefits by alleviating high ground delays. Our experimental results indicate that making rerouting decisions dynamically results in 10-15% delay cost reduction compared to static rerouting, and about 50% less delay cost compared to a pure ground holding strategy (i.e.. no rerouting). In contrast to static rerouting, the dynamic rerouting capability results in making rerouting decisions that are better matched to realized weather conditions. Lower total expected delay cost is achieved by delaying the rerouting decisions for flights until they reach the divergence point between alternative routes, and hence exploiting updated information on weather while making those decisions. In cases where the airport is the main, but not the only, bottleneck, the dynamic rerouting model may assign higher ground delays so that the rerouting decisions can be deferred until more information on en route weather becomes available.

Based on game theory, the complete information dynamic game model among three main stakeholders in building energy efficiency market government, developers and consumers, is established. The cost and benefit of the main stakeholders are analyzed by this model. In conclusion, the government should implement economic incentive policies to developers and consumers separately. And such policies should be strengthened in initial building energy efficiency market. Giving them direct economic subsidies to share high-cost of building energy efficiency can aroused the enthusiasm of developers and consumers. In order to effectively supervise the conduct of developers and form energy-saving market, it is essential to apply appropriate administrative penalty to non-energy saving building developers.

In reality, information or data for scheduling may not be well-defined due to the nature of the construction site. There are many uncertain factors do affect the performance of construction activities such as forecast of weather, prediction of equipment troubles, uncertain preparation of materials, and fuzziness in the procedures to be applied in the activity. Obviously, it is very difficult to interpret these factors properly and to get the data needed for scheduling into precise or probabilistic measures. Thus neither deterministic nor probabilistic technique for many construction works can be used effectively, since imposing deterministic or probabilistic approach to ill generated data or badly defined conditions may produce unrealistic result. So, the interpretation of these data is still much dependent on the uncertain knowledge and experience of the decision-maker. In this paper, fuzzy network as a method for project scheduling is developed in consideration of fuzziness associated with durations and precedence relationships of activities. To measure the possibility of the execution for a specific schedule, two types of membership functions of fuzziness are introduced. The first, time membership function, aims at measuring the possibility that the activity in question will be performed within the estimated duration. The second, precedence relationship membership function, enables the manager to predict the possibility that the lag time of precedence relationship between activities will be carried out within the estimation. Furthermore the different summarized values of those membership functions would provide the decision-maker with different alternative schedules. Finally, the fuzzy network mathematically results in an optimal model of linear programming and the process of calculation is illustrated on a small network.","[Tseng, H. S.; Chiou, H.

A number of continuous-time path flow dynamics have been proposed and studied in the literature whose stationary path flow pattern coincides with user equilibrium. However, the application prospects of these findings are limited by the fact that it might be difficult for transportation management centers to measure and monitor day-to-day dynamic path flow pattern. On the other hand, thanks to the fast development of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), the day-to-day link flow pattern can be more easily monitored and analyzed. Thus, it is not only of theoretical interest but also with implement viability to explore equilibrium in the perspective of link flow dynamics. This paper carries on the study originated by [Zhang, D., Nagurney A., Wu, J., 2001. On the equivalence between stationary link flow patterns and traffic network equilibria.

The investigation benefits from the iceberg competency model, the training management cycle, and Kirk-Patrik's evaluation model as the theoretical basis and context for drawing a comparison of the suitability and effectiveness of training approaches adopted in major ERP implementations in UAE. The proposed approach, which is built around 'end-user characterization' as the main input into 'competency building' is flexible enough to plug into standard ERP methodologies and may be projected throughout the ERP life-cycle.

The question to be asked is how can a country measure its involvement in globalisation. One way is by using E-Commerce drivers and barriers. There are many issues that could count as drivers and barriers to E-Commerce and Globalisation such as cost, payment systems and legislation. By examining the E-Commerce drivers and barriers of a country which will depend upon the level of technological involvement with E-Commerce and its effect on a particular economy could result in Globalisation readiness in the country. For digital classification the level of engagement could be measured by the level of Internet involvement in the economy could measure the level of engagement. This measurement could be used to indicate the extent of globalisation in a country's economy. Globalisation is a result of removing barriers and restrictions to international trade and adopting free economic policy, which are the same drivers for E-Commerce.","[Hamed, Abdalla; Ball, David; Berger, Hillary; Cleary, Pat] Univ Wales Inst, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",,,ahmaed@uwic.ac.uk; Dball@uwic.ac.uk; HBerger@uwic.ac.uk; PMCleary@uwic.ac.uk,,,,,,,29,1,1,0,9,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-0-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,761,769,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Information Systems; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science,BPB66,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000278458300098,0

Also, we explored the impacts of age,education, position level on these variables. The main findings are showed as follows. Firstly, communication openness is significantly related to LMX, Guanxi and organizational commitment. Secondly, Guanxi fully mediates the relationship between communication openness and organizational commitment. Thirdly, LMX doesn't mediate the relationship between communication openness and organizational commitment directly. This research finds that personal Guanxi between supervisor and subordinate plays an important role in Chinese enterprises, and the suggestions for Chinese enterprises from the result are as follows. Chinese enterprises should build effective formal communication networks to ensure that any information can transmit without obstacle. Supervisors should be more open to subordinates,especially strengthen the initiative of communication. In addition to formal LMX, supervisors need to keep good personal Guanxi with subordinates, and spend time caring them to win subordinates' commitment, thus increase employees' organizational commitment.","[Liu Yuyu; Huang Xiaoke; Ding Guolin; Yan Su] Renmin Univ China, Sch Business, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,,liuyy123@yahoo.com.cn; hxkme@hotmail.com; dingguolin@yahoo.com.cn; suyan86@gmail.com,"wangwangwang, yuanyaunyuan/HHN-6432-2022",,,,,,18,0,0,0,12,HUBEI PEOPLES PRESS,WUHAN,"268 XIONGCHU RD, WUHAN, 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-216-06098-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,1727,1734,,,,,,8,"Business; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Engineering, Mechanical; Management; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Public Administration,BLW28,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271211500321,0

Even in this era of the New Technologies, as computers are designed to work faster and faster, it is welcomed to know to which extent a specific function is welcomed to be optimized by using a specific algorithm, or to which extent the time required by that algorithm to get the optimum is a polynomial or an exponential one.

This paper focuses on the impact of relational attributes on mobile phone users' communication behavior. Instead of considering the market as a set of independent entities, market in this paper's prospect is a social network in which the customers are linked with each other via mobile communication applications such as voice calling, SMS, MMS, blue-tooth, etc. The presumption in our empirical study is that customers' relational attributes can significantly affect their communication behavior (i.e. voice calling). The result of our study is fully supported this presumption, and approves that relational attributes are the powerful predictors of customers' voice calling behaviour, and furthermore, higher calling level and lower calling level users show different relationships with those network attributes.","[Yang, Xuecheng; Zhang, Xiaohang] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100088, Peoples R China; [Zuo, Feng] China Network Commun Corp, Broadband Online Ltd, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications,"Yang, XC (通讯作者)，Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100088, Peoples R China.",yangxuecheng@bupt.edu.cn; zuofeng@cnc.cn,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,2,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,978-0-7695-3560-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,67,+,,10.1109/ISBIM.2008.183,0.0,,,2,"Business; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,BLA42,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000269751900016,0

The aim of this article is to resume the strategic goals of UNESCO and European Union concerning education, to asses information systems and technical tools to facilitate policy consultations and policy-making, and study the impact on Romanian Higher Education planning and management; on policy formulation and capacity development of Romanian universities Through this paper we wish to contribute to the debate on decentralization policies in education in the context of the Education for All (EFA), while seeing how they can be taken into account in the preparation and implementation of national plans of action in the case of military.","[Cosma, Daniela] Nicolae Balcescu Land Forces Acad, Dept Tech Sci, Sibiu, Romania; [Stanciu, Leontin] Nicolae Balcescu Land Forces Acad, Dept Sci Res, Sibiu, Romania; [Rizescu, Alexandru] Nicolae Balcescu Land Forces Acad, Sibiu, Romania; [Patesan, Marioara] Nicolae Balcescu Land Forces Acad, Dept Social & Managerial Sci, Sibiu, Romania",Nicolae Balcescu Land Forces Academy; Nicolae Balcescu Land Forces Academy; Nicolae Balcescu Land Forces Academy; Nicolae Balcescu Land Forces Academy,"Cosma, D (通讯作者)，Nicolae Balcescu Land Forces Acad, Dept Tech Sci, Sibiu, Romania.",danasibro@yahoo.com; leontinstanciu@yahoo.com; arizescu@armyacademy.ro; mpatesan@yahoo.com,"patesan, marioara/I-2657-2017; Rizescu, Alexandru Marius/I-3157-2017",,,,,,12,0,0,0,3,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-848-2,,,,2009,,,,,,,672,+,,,,,,2,"Business; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Engineering,BMU59,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000273607900138,0

Through the optimization of resource allocation, the limited resources are utilized for developing core activities and meanwhile the peripheral activities are outsourced to suppliers, thus making use of the resources of outside enterprises and form complementary advantages with the enterprise's own resources. During cooperation, the organizational learning is enhanced to strengthen the absorption and application of external knowledge and improve the efficiency of learning and absorbing knowledge. Therefore, the enterprise's innovative capability is bettered. Based on this, the theoretical model is built for the relationship between outsourcing and enterprises' innovative capability, so as to propose a relevant hypothesis, holding that outsourcing has positive effects on enterprises' innovative capability.","[Zhao Yanping; Wang Lei] Jiangsu Univ, Sch Management, Zhenjiang 212013, Peoples R China",Jiangsu University,,ZYP@ujs.edu.cn; wanglei116ujs@gmail.com,"zhao, yan/GWC-9174-2022",,,,,,13,0,0,0,3,HUBEI PEOPLES PRESS,WUHAN,"268 XIONGCHU RD, WUHAN, 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-216-06098-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,869,872,,,,,,4,"Business; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Engineering, Mechanical; Management; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Public Administration,BLW28,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271211500161,0

Free riding in a dual-channel supply chain occurs when one traditional channel engages in the customer service activities necessary to sell a product, while another electronic channel benefits from those activities by making the final sale. This paper quantitatively studies the free-riding behavior of a dual-channel supply chain in E-commerce and the dual-channel models are established. Besides the electronic channel's best-response function and optimal profit, relationship between the free-riding factor and the electronic channel's profit is found. Due to the existence of free riding, the electronic channel's profit is an increasing function of the free-riding factor when the free-riding behavior has positive effect. This is mainly because the electronic channel as a free rider can benefit from the traditional channel's high level of service. This paper also studies the free-riding effects in channel conflict, and presents several response measures.","[Cao Lei; Zhang Zigang; Chen Zilin] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology,,Lilyleil125@163.com,"liu, sha/JXL-6600-2024",,,,,,12,0,0,0,24,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,978-0-7695-3560-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,214,217,,10.1109/ISBIM.2008.197,0.0,,,4,"Business; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,BLA42,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000269751900051,0

Detailed consideration is given to the impact of the learning environment if the learner is in a paid or unpaid work role It is reported that the main focus over the last decade has been on the operation of workplace learning where learners are in paid employment. It is concluded that both the traditional on-campus and the paid work environments deprive learners of a negotiated approach to learning and thus do not provide the base of knowledge upon which learners can arrive at their own decisions It is shown that if learners do not develop an ability to take responsibility for their decisions they make, then they fail to develop critical competence in exercising independent judgment. This competence is considered essential and core to professional development. It is further proposed that essential to the successful use of alternative learning environments, is the need for the personal and professional autonomy of the individual to be core to the learning model. Environments such as the non-aid workplace, the home and the community are considered in relation to effectiveness for the development of personal and professional autonomy We describe here, a model based on using off-campus life places combined with negotiated learning to enable informal and non-formal learning to be recognised through assessment and the award of credit where appropriate The model has at its core, development of competence in independent judgment.

The theoretical analysis and the experimental results show that the proposed method is a good solution to real-time evaluation for the network risk.","[Zeng, Jie] Sichuan Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Jinquan] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Chengdu, Peoples R China",Sichuan University; University of Electronic Science & Technology of China,"Zeng, J (通讯作者)，Sichuan Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China.",jet.zengjie@gmail.com; jinquanzeng@gmail.com,"Zeng, Jie/H-1327-2011","Zeng, Jie/0000-0002-8812-0298","National Natural Science Foundation of China [60573130, 60502011, 60873246]; National High-Tech Research and Development Plan of China [2006AA01Z435]; National Research Foundation for Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China [20070610032]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National High-Tech Research and Development Plan of China(National High Technology Research and Development Program of China); National Research Foundation for Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China(Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (SRFDP)),"This work was sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (60573130, 60502011 and 60873246), the National High-Tech Research and Development Plan of China (2006AA01Z435), and the National Research Foundation for Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (20070610032).",,9,0,0,0,0,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,978-0-7695-3560-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,3,+,,10.1109/ISBIM.2008.105,0.0,,,2,"Business; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,BLA42,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000269751900001,0

The existing law system in China remains scant of e-privacy, but doesn't reduce the importance of the issue. Legal problems shall never be ignored when it comes to management.

In complex purchasing supply chain, the incomplete information causes a variety of contradictions during the cooperation among multiple suppliers and buyer, which holds back the development of buyer collaborative partnership, decreases the operational efficiency, and corrupts the whole benefits of the supply chain. Therefore, the importance of purchasing coordination management has become increasingly prominent. The state-of-art research on the purchasing supply chain coordination mechanism is very few. Accordingly, the paper proposes a novel purchasing supply chain coordination mechanism for multiple suppliers with incomplete information. The two game processes of the buyer with the upstream suppliers and the downstream customers are investigated. The coordination mechanism with upstream and downstream counterparts are designed and verified with numerical analysis. The proposed mechanism contributes to purchasing supply chain coordination mechanism, improves the purchasing management theory and is of great value for the enterprises.","[Gao Ai-Ying; Liu Kai] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Inst Modern Logist, Sch Traff & Transportat, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University,,ay_bjtu@yahoo.cn; kliu@bjtu.edu.cn,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,3,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,978-0-7695-3560-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,514,517,,10.1109/ISBIM.2008.238,0.0,,,4,"Business; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,BLA42,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000269751900124,0

Based on the theory of multiattribute procurement auction, the traditional one-dimensional equipment procurement auction is evolved into the two-dimensional form. The two-dimensional attribute optimal auction mechanism model is built up and then the corresponding implementation mechanism and theory are both presented. Finally, the effectiveness of mechanism is shown by an example and the rational equipment competitiveness procurement price is fixed under the conditions at equipment procurement expected utility maximization and equipment quality optimization.

This back to the special characteristics exist in neural network which are very suitable to stock market nature. In this paper we aim to propose a new approach for stock market prediction and provide an answer for two interesting issues. First, is the market predictable and what factors are actually affecting the accuracy of this prediction. The second issue is what is the correct neural network structure that will provide the most accurate prediction, and how this network handles the market movement over short.

Once the long-distance payment instruments diversified and once the clients became aware of the benefits of such services, the electronic banking services corroborated with the new technologies seduces the clients with their expected benefits: comfort, promptness and accessible costs. As an alternative to the classic payment system, the fees attached to the virtual access are regularly smaller than the fees of the classic services. Strong development of the Internet and mobile telecommunications is fortunately also met in Romania, so some of the industries can benefit of the major advantages offered by the new technologies. So, banking industry lunched on the market in the last years the electronic banking services as a viable alternative for classic banking services which assume the client's presence at the banking desk. In the last years, Internet became a popular distribution platform for electronic banking. Consumers of the electronic banking had easier access to their accounts in every moment. Still with this comfort, the e-banking adopting rates were very low in many countries. In Romania, of 39 banks that operate in the Romanian market, 21 offer their clients 28 long-distance payment instruments of which 14 are Internet Banking solutions, 12 are Home Banking solutions and 2 are Mobile Banking solutions.

In this method, the components of the warehouse were defined as passage, shelf, storage point and node. Passage is a roadway by which the operator can access goods stored on shelf. Node is the intersection of a vertical passage and a horizontal passage. To retrieve the goods stored at storage point, the operator must pass by passage an no e. As we know, the number of nodes is much smaller than the number of storage points, so, we can simplify the computing of the shortest route between every two goods items in an order by computing and storing the shortest route between every two nodes. Based on this idea, this paper presented an algorithm to initialize the warehouse layout diagram and to find the adjacency relationship between the elements and to compute the shortest route between every two storage points. On this foundation, a hybrid genetic algorithm was given to solve the optimizing order-picking problem of irregular multi-layered warehouse. After then, an order-picking system based on C/S structure was given to guide the operator's work.","[Zhang Haijun; Yue Puxiu; Zhu Jie] Beijing WUZI Univ, Commun Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Wuzi University,,haijun_cumtb@yahoo.com.cn; yuepuxiu@m165.com; zhujiewy@public.bta.net.cn,,,,,,,6,1,1,1,5,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,978-0-7695-3560-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,27,32,,10.1109/ISBIM.2008.111,0.0,,,6,"Business; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,BLA42,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000269751900007,0

Therefore, in order to achieve better fulfillment of SMEs economic and financial objectives, using a computerized instrument for performing the economic and financial diagnose of its activity is a high priority. The specialized market offers quite a diversity of information technologies that can be used in order to design such an instrument as that depicted above. Among those, we decided to combine the web technologies with expert systems and spreadsheets. This paper is a continuation of a former idea where we stated as a future direction the implementation of such a tool, in the web environment, making it available worldwide to those interested in performing a computerized financial diagnose. Also, we have made several improvements regarding the methods used to fulfill the economic and financial diagnose. One of the papers' major aims is to illustrate a manner of computerizing the field of economic and financial diagnoses for the case of a Romanian small and medium-sized enterprise. Thus, we will conduct the current study by implementing into a real application the theory (from the specialized literature) and expertise (collected from experts) related to the field of financial diagnose and apply, for exemplification purposes, the financial ratios that are used in the process of a financial diagnose. In author's opinion, the innovative feature of this system is its development by combining three technologies: web, spreadsheet and expert systems and also the methods used for performing the economic and financial diagnose. Thus, the computer based model is accessed throughout a webpage (hosted on an Apache virtual server), is developed using Exsys Corvid and obtains variable's values from a spreadsheet files.

However, they are easy to be trapped into the local deceptive peak, and the operations in QEA lack the capability of meeting an actual situation, so that some torpidity often appears when solving problems. In this paper, a new improved quantum-inspired immune evolutionary algorithm (QIEA) is proposed to overcome the shortcoming of the conventional QEAs. The new QIEA combines the main mechanisms of immune theory and every individual of each chromosome will make its own dynamic clone to build its new sub-swarm; then every new chromosome will be mutation in its low bit; at last, the QIEA will update the whole swarm by using random strategy. Experiments on the knapsack problem are compared with other evolutionary algorithms. The result indicates that the performance of new algorithm is superior to the others.","[Zhang Xiangxian] Henan Univ, Inst Management Sci & Engn, Henan, Peoples R China",Henan University,,homzbou@163.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,6,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,978-0-7695-3560-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,323,325,,10.1109/ISBIM.2008.137,0.0,,,3,"Business; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,BLA42,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000269751900078,0

The premise of this paper is that knowledge management would make it possible for all the trading partners in a supply chain to reap benefits. Current research in knowledge management in the consulting industry is generally targeting those big organizations that are main contractors. This has restricted the scope of knowledge management, and limits the benefits to a few, rather than the whole industry. If the consulting industry as a whole is to prosper and improve its productivity, strategies for knowledge management at the industry level must be established. This paper argues the case for melting the scope of knowledge management across the full extent of the supply chain, and attempts to identify the benefits that may arise out of sharing knowledge across the supply chain.","[Ming Yingzhao; Feng Dexiong] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 43007, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology,,myzcareer@yeah.net,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,4,HUBEI PEOPLES PRESS,WUHAN,"268 XIONGCHU RD, WUHAN, 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-216-06098-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,1427,1431,,,,,,5,"Business; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Engineering, Mechanical; Management; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Public Administration,BLW28,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271211500263,0

However, recent experiences reveal that, at least in emerging economies, it is not the case. The firms from emerging markets expand overseas without overwhelming advantages. So how is it happened? For filling this gap, this paper investigates the internationalization motivations of emerging market enterprises and develops an integrated framework to explain the question basing on institution-based view. From the three different pillars, we convince that the compound strengths including internal and external forces impel these emerging market enterprises venturing overseas. Overall, the paper not only probes into the unique motivations that steer them toward internationalization comparing to the multinational enterprises from developed countries, but also sheds light on institution view, which is significant especially in emerging economies.","[Luo Hua; Zhang Shanshan] Wuhan Univ, Econ & Management Sch, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China",Wuhan University,,stevenluo123@gmail.com; az_3@163.com,"Zhang, Shuo/IUO-8909-2023; Zhang, shanshan/HLP-6320-2023",,,,,,12,0,0,1,12,HUBEI PEOPLES PRESS,WUHAN,"268 XIONGCHU RD, WUHAN, 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-216-06098-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,873,877,,,,,,5,"Business; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Engineering, Mechanical; Management; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Public Administration,BLW28,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271211500162,0

The contribution of this study is that it examines the impact of organizational variables, in addition to macroeconomic and financial variables, focusing primarily on the role played by the Board of Directors. The interest to this internal governance mechanism stems from the particularities of banks corporate governance. The empirical results of this study, contrary to expectations, show that the board of directors, despite its great importance, it granted only a limited place in Tunisian banks and it has several shortcomings in relation to its mission.","[Mamoghli, Chokri; Dhouibi, Raoudha] Univ Tunis, ISG, Tunis, Tunisia",Universite de Tunis,,mamoghli@yahoo.fr; dhouibi_raoudha@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-0-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,281,290,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Information Systems; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science,BPB66,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000278458300036,0

Drawn on the experience of Griliches' Knowledge Production Function (KPF), the paper constructs the updated KPF model with the consideration of the venture capital investment influence to the zone innovation. Under the frame of the updated KPF model and according to,the spatial econometrics theory, it makes an empirical analysis for the effect of knowledge spillovers (venture capital, R&D expenditure, etc.) through the Spatial Lag Model (SLM). As a result, venture capital and R&D expenditure have an obvious positive spatial diffusion (spillover) effect on the zone innovation. Thus, the R&D investment should be increased successively, and we should focus the development of the VC on establishing the zone venture capital center in four areas (Beijing, Shanghai, Hubei and Guangdong), instead of blossom everywhere which we used to in the past.","[Wan Kunyang; Zhao Zhijiang; Yu Shujuan] Zhejiang Water Conservancy & Hydropower Coll, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University of Water Resources and Electric Power,,wanky_x@126.com; zhaozj@zjwchc.com; yushj@zjwchc.com,,,,,,,19,1,1,0,5,HUBEI PEOPLES PRESS,WUHAN,"268 XIONGCHU RD, WUHAN, 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-216-06098-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,1271,1278,,,,,,8,"Business; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Engineering, Mechanical; Management; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Public Administration,BLW28,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271211500234,0

Despite its short history, urban tourism has surged in China in recent years. The author of this paper uses a combination of empirical and normative methods in the research, examines the development of domestic and overseas urban tourism, and argues that China's city development process suffers from some institutional hindrances, which have seriously constrained the healthy development of urban tourism. Through analyses, the author finds that at present institutional hindrances constraining the development of China's urban tourism are largely manifested in the following facts: first, legislation on urban tourism has lagged behind; second, city leisure space layout has yet to be incorporated into urban planning; third, the existing urban tourism investment management system suffers from various deficiencies; and fourth, notions of leisure and leisure tourism commercialism remain outdated. On the basis of the above research findings, the author draws the conclusion that as an integral party of urban economic development and the turning point and area of growth for the urban economy, the urban tourism industry is set to significantly boost the development of China's urban socio-economic development; given China's vast resources in urban tourism, its development prospects are brilliant; and that to meet the demand of domestic and overseas tourists for urban tourism, institutional supply must be innovated. Thus, the author proposes the following measures: (1) to administrate tourism according to the law; (2) to improve the planning of urban tourism; (3) to improve the operating management system of the urban tourism industry; and (4) to reform mentality and build a leisure education system. The innovation of this paper lies in its comprehensive examination of the problems with the institutional supply of China's urban tourism, and its proposal of highly operational measures.","[Yang Meijing] Xiamen Univ, Econ Res Inst, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China",Xiamen University,,ymj62@sina.com,,,,,,,4,0,0,1,7,HUBEI PEOPLES PRESS,WUHAN,"268 XIONGCHU RD, WUHAN, 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-216-06098-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,1108,1113,,,,,,6,"Business; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Engineering, Mechanical; Management; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Public Administration,BLW28,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271211500205,0

Researchers find out that the feed-back mechanism developed by some cognitive psychologists is effective to explain some anomalies to a certain extent. In order to investigate the feed-back mechanism and to determine an effective model, we use daily data of the stock index of two Chinese stock markets.

Our result clearly shows the common coefficient of expectations and fourth-order autoregressive disturbance exist in the two Chinese stock markets.

Therefore, return policy is a key factor to influence a customer's purchasing decision. There is a trade-off between cost due to more returned products and benefit due to more attractive refund policy. This paper develops a profit-maximization model and discusses e-tailer's optimal pricing and return policies with respect to certain market reaction parameters in a competitive e-business scenario. Furthermore, the impact of competing degree on e-tailer's profit is illustrated with a numerical example. It is also explained that how to influence the responsive sensitivity of company's return policy in a way of using marketing and operational strategies so as-to maximizing the e-tailer's profit.

Thus, the market of real estate goes beyond its nature of providing houses for those who need a place to dwell on and becomes a marketing choice for those who hold a big amount of capital. When the capital-pushed market is encouraged by the limited land, it is inevitable that the housing demand exceeds the supply and the price in the market of real estate rises. Under the policy of opening-up economy, the coming up of foreign investors further enhances the rise of price. As a result of marketing, it is reasonable that the price of real estate increases and the froth is produced. To deal with the market failure of real estate, the rise of interest rates would reduce the chance of speculation and the general demand of construction market. The increasing of expenditure on public buildings would also result in the reduction of demand in construction market, which helps to eliminate the froth of speculation as well as avoid the turbulence of economic growth to achieve the equilibrium growth of construction economy.","[Wu Jianfeng] Hubei Univ Technol, Wuhan 430068, Peoples R China",Hubei University of Technology,,wujf80@yahoo.cn,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,HUBEI PEOPLES PRESS,WUHAN,"268 XIONGCHU RD, WUHAN, 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-216-06098-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,610,616,,,,,,7,"Business; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Engineering, Mechanical; Management; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Public Administration,BLW28,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271211500115,0

As 2008 Beijing Olympic Games was held and 2010 Shanghai World Expo is drawing near, some brands of China's economy hotels are expanding with the growth speed of 200%-300%, and some new brands also continue to emerge. Facing the situation that the transnational economy hotels come into China one after another, China's economy hotels have many opportunities, in the meantime, they also face enormous challenges. Comparing with the transnational economy hotels, the internet marketing of China's economy hotels generally has a lower level of development and is still at the initial stage, so there are still many problems. To solve these problems, this paper adopts the methods of induction and systems analysis, takes 7daysinn Group as a case study, has analyzed the actuality and existing problems for China's economy hotels to develop the internet marketing, and has proposed some corresponding innovative strategies about how to develop the internet marketing of China's economy hotels. Finally such a conclusion has been reached: As long as China's economy hotels understand fully the importance of internet marketing, take some I corresponding measures to resolve the current problems, and innovate continuously on the strategies of internet marketing according to actual conditions, China's economy hotels will surely get a sustainable and healthy development.","[Cheng Congxi] Wuhan Polytech Univ, Econ & Management Coll, Wuhan 430023, Peoples R China",Wuhan Polytechnic University,,grahamcheng@yahoo.com.cn; mytcn@163.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,5,HUBEI PEOPLES PRESS,WUHAN,"268 XIONGCHU RD, WUHAN, 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-216-06098-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,932,937,,,,,,6,"Business; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Engineering, Mechanical; Management; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Public Administration,BLW28,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271211500174,0

Technological innovation plays a certain negative role on economic growth, while institutional change exerts great promotion on the economic growth regardless of the interaction between technological innovation and institutional change; the inhibitory impact of technological innovation on economic growth is further increased if the interaction of technological innovation and institutional change is taken into account.

However, R&D project selection is a complicated and knowledge intensive decision-making process in that project selection is complicated by many factors, such as uncertainty, interrelationships between projects. This paper considers an R&D project selection model which maximizes the whole net present value (NPV) of the firm in a fuzzy environment. The NPV and expenditure of individual project are treated as fuzzy variables. It is assumed that the fuzzy NPV of some projects may depend on the crisp NPV of other projects and that the common realization of certain couples of projects may allow some savings in the resource expenditure. Furthermore, the decision-maker is supposed to take a rather pessimistic attitude. The proposed model takes on the form of a quadratic 0 - 1 programming problem.

A closer look to the structural features of the scientific discourse could reveal a much more complex image. A continuously evolving science is trying to reveal the most significant characteristics of reality. The engineer is invited to exploit them and doing so, he has the possibility to discover the limits of the epistemological optimism of the scientific discourse. Fie has the opportunity to observe the complex mixture between the qualitative and quantitative aspects of scientific concepts and the very refined dynamics of scientific representations, a process we analyse using the concept of descriptive imaginary.

However, it lacks a clear ontology of the business model. This paper aims at discussing business process modeling and improvement as an essential work to create a successful and competitive enterprise. To achieve this goal, we use a methodology called norm analysis linking with UML to capture the business process.

The theory of Markowitz on portfolio management, based on a long time scale analysis of return and variance, is first optimized over a selection of pair of stocks from the Hang Seng Index and then corrected by the return of short time scales of the stocks. Several choices of short time returns, from 1 to 5 days in the past, are studied. The cumulative return is highest when the returns of the two-stock portfolio in the past 2 days are included in the correction to the modified Sharpe ratio. The testing data cover the period between Jan 10, 2007 and July 21, 2009 for 24 blue chip stocks from the Hang Seng Index. The strategy is compared to the average return of these 24 stocks as well as to the Hang Seng Index in the same period. We conclude that our strategy has a positive return over most of the days of the testing period, including a very stable positive performance in the period of market crash. The variation of the cumulative return of our strategy is less than both the average returns of the chosen stocks or the Hang Seng Index, thereby providing a portfolio with a smaller risk but still attractive return. This strategy of time dependent mean variance analysis to include both the long and short time scale data appears to be a good investment scheme for conservative investors who prefer stable return even during market downturn.","[Chen, Wenjin; Szeto, Kwok Y.] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Phys, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,,wenjin@ust.hk; phszeto@ust.hk,,"Szeto, Kwok Yip/0000-0001-9804-9221",,,,,16,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER-VERLAG TOKYO,TOKYO,"37-3, HONGO 3-CHOME BONKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113, JAPAN",1861-0803,,978-4-431-53906-3,SPRINGER SER AGENT B,,,2011,8.0,,,,,,35,45,,10.1007/978-4-431-53907-0_3,0.0,,,11,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BUN08,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000289810000003,0

Then, a contentious issue is dealt with - as less biased as possible: Engineering Education is regarded as the area where a paradigm shift is both more influential and more urgent. Hence, Innovating is considered not just a means, it becomes a must. Among the conclusions: a) Universities should start a critical - but not hasty - revolution towards Life-Long Learning.

Also, the expansion of wireless communication technologies allows the access to Internet and to users' permanent interconnection. Therefore, a normal desire of human beings is developed, that of using miniaturized equipment, with no less performance, capable to ensure access to various information sources and to support communication. This tendency will result in the transition towards a new evolution stage of the IT&C, known as the calm technologies era.

This paper will illustrate these differences as the recent developments in project management suggest a new way of thinking. This new approach recommends considering project management as a process instead of only a set of managerial actions. We will describe the nature of the purpose of both the worldviews and how they influence the definition of project and project marketing.

Knowledge management may be able to address this. Previous studies have not clearly identified nor demonstrated the relationship between the management of projects and the use of knowledge management processes. The purpose of this research is to identify if a positive relationship exists between the two? If a relationship does exist, which knowledge management processes in use by practitioners of project management are significant in terms of improving project management, and what is their impact? Hundred and fourteen project practitioners (project managers, managers, team leaders, team members, supervisors, etc) some affiliated with the Project Management Institute (PM!), and mostly from organizations in the IT industry both governmental and private had participated in the research to answer these questions.

Interestingly, while most of the interviewed applicants suggested social network features they already knew from other online platforms, lead users came up with more innovative service solutions.

This paper idea aims to discuss and evaluate a modeling approach for student evolution. It is developed as a component of an adaptive achievement system. At the beginning of the process, associations of student achievement results are found based on each student's factors that affect learning process, which finds the relationship between student evolution during years of study and understanding the modular scheme, that finds the main effect of enrolling on the correct modules i.e. getting the right advice and student support regarding choosing modules, meeting all the necessary prerequisites, having summer courses, and taking in consideration the student's high school grades, as well as finding the relationship between modules type and student gender. Clustering [10], or unsupervised classification, method is employed to model this task. The goal of clustering is [7] to objectively partition data into homogeneous groups such that the within group object similarity and the between group object dissimilarity are determined. Clustering here is used to model student achievement according to predefined criterion functions that measure similarity among students who grant certain goal having the same conditions using data collected from University Database. A clustering method is developed far this step. We evaluated the student progress according to associations between different factors using data collected. We concluded the performance of those groups using these two approaches. Now, the need for solid information about student evolution and how to improve it has only grown in importance for state policy. The compelling metaphor of increasing flow through the educational pipeline is now common in state policy discussions, fueled by more vocal recognition by business and civic leaders of the importance of the critical supply chain of educational capital in their states.","[Qaddoum, Kifaya S.] Technol Philadelphia Univ, Fac Informat, Amman, Jordan",Philadelphia University Jordan,,kqaddoum@philadelphia.edu.jo,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-0-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,1251,1255,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Information Systems; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science,BPB66,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000278458300159,0

First, combined decision (pricing and inventory decision) models are made for the retailer with demand-curves with random shocks. Then, impacts of decisions on the bullwhip effect are analyzed. The result shows that when the market demand is a linear curve with AR(I) shocks, the retailer's optimal decision cannot make the bullwhip effect occur and its measure has no concerns with its demand elasticity and scaling factor; however, when the market demand is an iso-elastic demand function with AR(1) shocks, the bullwhip effect measure will decrease with the increase of the demand elasticity and its scaling factor, but the bullwhip effect will always occur. Moreover, for the above two curves, the bullwhip effects change differently with autoregression coefficient of shocks. Therefore, retailers must consider the pattern of the demand curve and its fine structure to reduce the bullwhip effect.","[Wang Weijun; Tang Xiaowo; Ni Debin] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Chengdu 610056, Peoples R China",University of Electronic Science & Technology of China,,wwjun@mail.sc.cninfo.net; xwtang@uestc.edu.cn; nidb@uestc.edu.cn,"Liu, Joanne/JRY-7564-2023",,,,,,15,1,1,0,5,HUBEI PEOPLES PRESS,WUHAN,"268 XIONGCHU RD, WUHAN, 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-216-06098-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,1366,1373,,,,,,8,"Business; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Engineering, Mechanical; Management; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Public Administration,BLW28,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271211500252,0

The inheritance algorithm is a sort of self-adaptive optimized search algorithm based on natural selection and natural inheritance. It can be implemented in different areas of parameter space in the colony generation subrogation toward the optimal direction which the search could more possibly find and couldn't get in local minimization. So, we can adopt the inheritance algorithm to train the BP neural network to overcome the above disadvantages.

The surrounded volume amount these components can represent the knowledge value. To see how powerful our model is, we have considered a case study. It has been shown that the model can valuate customer knowledge. We extracted different aspects of knowledge value from the literature and showed that they can be also acknowledged by the proposed model.

The discussion will be based on learning style, task-oriented attitude and personal management style. The assessment of the organizational climate is made usually with the help of a set of three standardized questionnaires conceived by Adizes. The first questionnaire that will be described is called the learning style, with its four types described by Adizes, the second questionnaire will make reference to the task requirements, which aims at the managerial development styles and the third questionnaire, Adizes' personal test, aiming at the assessment of the respondents' profile regarding the managerial development. Other questionnaires developed to assess learning styles will be presented, due to the importance for an academic institution. The assessment of the organizational climate at the level of the top management is based, besides the above-mentioned questionnaires, on McGregor's XY-theory and on the LEADSELF questionnaire. Such a complex analysis of the organizational climate is important for an educational organization as it helps to design the best ways to deliver knowledge to the students, taking into account their learning styles and behavioural profiles. A study of the correlation of different assessments of learning styles and the consequences for educational management is also presented.","[Carmen, Domnariu] Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Victor Papilian Fac Med, Sibiu, Romania; [Ioana, Moisil] Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Fac Engn, Sibiu, Romania",Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu; Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu,"Carmen, D (通讯作者)，Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Victor Papilian Fac Med, Sibiu, Romania.",carmen.domnariu@ulbsibiu.ro; ioana.moisil@ulbsibiu.ro,"Domnariu, Carmen Daniela/HLW-2797-2023",,,,,,8,0,0,0,4,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-848-2,,,,2009,,,,,,,302,+,,,,,,2,"Business; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Engineering,BMU59,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000273607900063,0

In view of these questions, the Logistics equilibrium conceptual model is proposed.

We may expect that Flash memory will finally take the place of magnetic disk in the next few years. Therefore, it is possible for us to consider running a full database on the flash computing platforms. However, disk-based database technology can not be used on flash memory directly because of different characteristics between flash memory and magnetic disk. Some researches are being done currently on flash-based database technology. In this paper, we propose a new approach called Dynamic logging. This new approach makes use of the characteristics of flash memory effectively to acquire more benefits from using traditional database technology on flash memory.","[Du, Ming] Donghua Univ, Glorious Sun Sch Business & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yan; Le, Jiajin] Donghua Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Donghua University; Donghua University,"Du, M (通讯作者)，Donghua Univ, Glorious Sun Sch Business & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",duming@dhu.edu.cn; zyambition@163.com; lejiajin@dhu.edu.cn,"Wang, lili/IXD-9828-2023",,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,978-0-7695-3560-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,37,+,,10.1109/ISBIM.2008.145,0.0,,,2,"Business; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,BLA42,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000269751900009,0

They will derive efficiencies through the automation of their core business processes, and the exploitation of knowledge. Agility will be improved by one or two orders of magnitude, intelligence density within the enterprise will grow sharply and problem-solving capacities will be dramatically enhanced.

The Cultural Behaviour concept models some characteristics of users interacting with a knowledge management system and acknowledges the behaviour of users in the system that can be associated with incentives so that users are willing to share their knowledge and be active in the system. The framework designed focuses on three features, i.e. the cultural behaviour of people in the organization, incentives system and technical system. Detailed analysis was conducted on the cultural behavioural perspectives of users based on existing cultural practiced in the organization and factors that can motivate staff to share knowledge through the KM system was also looked at. Based on the analysis performed, it was discovered that the behaviour of KM users may be influenced by the technical system. From the technical system, the behaviour of users can be identified and the system rewards a form of incentive to staff that share knowledge.

Without converting mysteries, it helps organize the unknown serving as provisional explanation, on the possibility of communication at a distance without prior knowledge regarding the mechanism inside the means of communication. Discussing the design trend started by Apple with their iPods, iPhones and Macs, moving to the simple yet astounding Google and then to slick, transparent, visually rich, yet simple to use operating systems took and feel: from Mac OSX to Windows Vista, this article will try to encompass modem visual culture in digital media migrating towards magic in order to better fulfil the consumer's need to be empowered.

Based on the perceived success realized by the private sector through information and communication technology (ICT) introduction, diffusion and adoption, governments around the world are becoming more and more interested in embracing ICT, and respectively have made a remarkable progress over the last few years. Once only regarded as a means for modernizing the public sector and increasing government productivity and efficiency, eGovernment is presently recognized as a driver and a key enabler of citizen-centric, cooperative, and seamless modern governance. This implies not only a profound transformation in the way government interacts with the governed but also the reinvention of its internal processes and how organizations carry their business both internally as well as externally with other segments of the community. Based on the literature, it is frequently claimed that the availability of an effective eGovernment assessment framework is a necessary condition for advancing eGovernment proper implementation. This paper aims to review some of the existing electronic readiness (eReadiness) and eGovernment readiness (EGR) frameworks, to identify the different aspects covered by both types, and to discuss to what extent they can really fulfill their intention in acting as guiding tools in the successful introduction and implementation of eGovernment. Based on this discussion, the paper concludes that such assessment tools are not suitable in assessing EGR over a micro level (i.e., a public organization). At the end, the paper presents the building blocks of an EGR assessment framework. These building blocks - categorized into four Main dimensions: strategy, processes, technology, and people - cover all internal factors that should be addressed when setting an appraisal framework of eGovernment success on a public organization scale.","[Azab, Nahed A.] IT Consultant, Cairo, Egypt",,,nahed@tedata.net.eg,,,,,,,48,1,1,1,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-0-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,364,375,,,,,,12,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Information Systems; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science,BPB66,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000278458300047,0

This paper thus aims at examining IT outsourcing decisions and practices of Malaysia SMEs. Data was collected from SMEs in the manufacturing and service sectors in Malaysia. The findings show that the lack of internal competency is the primary reason that drives IT outsourcing and that SMEs prefer shorter-term contractual agreements. To attract SMEs, vendors have to establish trust prior to contract signing. This trust is critical for long-term outsourcing engagement.

It has the advantage of combining both qualitative and quantitative information in the decision analysis, which is extremely important for CRM. To derive the decision rules from different customer group for identifying features that contribute to CRM, both fuzzy clustering and heuristic algorithm are developed in this paper. It has been demonstrated in the empirical research that the proposed algorithm is able to derive the rules and identify the most significant features more accuracy than FRI when feature difference between customer segments is not obvious, which is unique and useful in solving CRM problems.

By encouraging a flow of useful information, they provide a better understanding of a situation characterized by uncertainty, increasing the efficiency of the decision-making process. Though never formally proved, this hypothesis is widely accepted based on the observation of existing institutions. In this paper, we observe the impact of boundary organizations through an agent-based model of continuous opinion dynamics over two dimensions where heterogeneous experts distinguished by credibility and uncertainty interact. We conclude that boundary organizations significantly reduce the diversity of opinions expressed and increase the number of experts agreeing to emerging positions, which confirms their positive impact on the efficiency of decision-making.","[Boissin, Denis] SKEMA Business Sch, F-06902 Sophia Antipolis, France",SKEMA Business School,,denis.boissin@skema.edu,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,8,SPRINGER-VERLAG TOKYO,TOKYO,"37-3, HONGO 3-CHOME BONKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113, JAPAN",1861-0803,,978-4-431-53906-3,SPRINGER SER AGENT B,,,2011,8.0,,,,,,177,188,,10.1007/978-4-431-53907-0_13,0.0,,,12,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BUN08,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000289810000013,0

While in more than two stages case,. solve the model numerically by using numerical iteration algorithm based on dynamic programming. We show that the capital cost is significant differential in the pre-and post patent investment completion. Before patent investment is completed, the capital cost is a decreasing function with respect to patent length, and the number of stages completed and expected future cash flow, while increasing function with respect to market risk. However, after completion the capital cost only is an increasing function with respect to market risk.

However, many of the previous financial literature show that Chinese enterprises do not have the effect of debt governance.

Explicit agency costs only describe the observable and confirmed agency problems, implicit agency costs describe the observable and no-confirmed agency problems. Based on chinese samples, this paper empirically studies the effect of creditor's governance of chinese enterprises. The results show debt in chinese enterprise only reduces explicit agency costs, and doesn't act on implicit agency costs. Instead, debt increases the agency costs on the whole, which means the effect of creditor's governance of enterprise in china is negative.","[Lei Xintu; Huang Min] Zhejiang Forestry Univ, Inst Accounting, Hangzhou 311300, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang A&F University,,lxttt505@163.com,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,6,HUBEI PEOPLES PRESS,WUHAN,"268 XIONGCHU RD, WUHAN, 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-216-06098-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,1219,1222,,,,,,4,"Business; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Engineering, Mechanical; Management; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Public Administration,BLW28,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271211500225,0

Therefore, the key to break the existing organizational framework of forestry enterprises is to innovate upon the system of the state-owned forest regions of the northeast and Inner Mongolia, clarify the relationship among the government, society and enterprises in the state-owned forest regions, thus let government become a government in the real sense and enterprises become a enterprise in the real sense. The study holds that we separate social management functions of forest resources management from the existing management functions system of forestry enterprises, and then establish special district government in the state-owned forest regions to be in charge of social and administrative affairs; set up branch bureau of forest resources management in the state-owned forest regions to supervise and manage forest resources of the state-owned forest regions. Thereby enterprises become a purely operation subject and strive to build modem enterprise system.","[Wang Yufang; Wang Jian] NE Forestry Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China",Northeast Forestry University - China,,w_yufang@163.com; Wfangwei@mail.shufe.edu.cn; bhes@163.com; Stevenwangjian1982@126.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,HUBEI PEOPLES PRESS,WUHAN,"268 XIONGCHU RD, WUHAN, 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-216-06098-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,666,673,,,,,,8,"Business; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Engineering, Mechanical; Management; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Public Administration,BLW28,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271211500125,0

In other words, the UBCF utilizes user similarities and the IBCF tries to make a prediction by utilizing item similarities. It means that methods may use only half of the total information from the given data set. For completing the missing part of usable information, this paper proposes a CF algorithm integrating the UBCF and IBCF, which takes both vertical and horizontal information in the user-item matrix.

Methods: The trial group receive both physical and psychological rehabilitation treatment, and the control group only receive physical rehabilitation treatment, Hamilton depression scale (HAMD), Fugal-Meyer motion function scale, and the activities of daily living scale are employed in measuring the impact of psychological rehabilitation on the patients with work-related Brain Trauma in terms of recovery and the ability to reintegrate into the society. Results: The results are as follows: I measured by HAMD, patients in two groups show no evident difference after one-month treatment, and very significant difference (P<0.05) after three-month treatment and significant difference after six-month treatment (p<0.01). 2. Measured by Fugl-Meyer FMA, the patients show relatively significant difference after being treated for one month and after being treated for three months (P<0.05). After six-month treatment the trial group and the control group show very significant difference (P<0.01). 3. Measured by Activity of Daily Living Scale (ADL), the trial group shows great difference from the control group after 1-month, 3-month and six-month treatment in terms of MBI (P<0.05). Conclusion: Based on the analysis, this paper comes to the conclusion that psychological rehabilitation plays an important role in helping the patients to get rid of psychological problems, to relieve emotional disorders and to build self-confidence. In turn the patients will be encouraged to coordinate with the doctors in the treatment and to have better ability in reintegrating into the society.","[Wan Qirong; Wang Zhihong] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Med Coll, Liyuan Hosp, Wuhan 430077, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology,,wanqirong@sohu.com; lyyy_@163.com,"Wang, Zhihong/M-9785-2019","Wang, Zhihong/0000-0003-2425-8623",,,,,5,0,0,0,3,HUBEI PEOPLES PRESS,WUHAN,"268 XIONGCHU RD, WUHAN, 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-216-06098-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,1931,1933,,,,,,3,"Business; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Engineering, Mechanical; Management; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Public Administration,BLW28,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271211500357,0

To find a better solution, the authors have treated the subject simultaneously as engineering and as business education's problem. Finally, the adequate approach was a statistical one. in many natural surfaces, the texture is always exposed and a successful visual system must be able to work with the environmental textured world. The methods of texture examination proposed in this paper could be and are indeed used in a wide range of domains such as: medical picture processing, automatic inspection of surfaces, documents processing, distance viewing etc. The texture's analysis was intensively used also in classifying and finding distance images (satellites etc). In this kind of images there are also a lot of homogeneous regions with different type of textures that must be identified (for instance a texture analysis could identify different types of fields: water portions, earth, cities, grass, etc.) and different methods are more or less adequate to a proper texture analysis. For the experiments the authors have used soil, water and grass samples. The final remark details the inferences from the samples' experiment to the world of engineering and business education, through images and Computer's performance.

The DMI enables joint collaboration between radiologists and physicians while they are at distant geographical locations. The DMI environment consists of heterogeneous, autonomous, and legacy resources.

In that context, the classical techniques of machine learning or data mining can he challenged. This is why we suggest investigating the use of analogical learning, which allows highlighting hidden correspondences between diverse contexts.

Although corporations are busy adopting and enhancing CSR practices, there is (beyond very few notable exceptions) no established empirical research on CSR's impact and relevance in the capital market. Author holds a point of view that the meaning of CSR is changing in various corporate governance structures and contractual relations. Different governance structures under social contractual relationship determine the main content of corporate social responsibility. This paper investigates this issue by tracing the impact factors to CSR from the aspect of corporate governance. More importantly, based on the degree of overlap between social expectations and Community responding, companies will improve the response process and policies through the study of social responsibility.","[Xie Wenwu; Chen Yong] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Publ Adm, Hangzhou 310015, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,,xieww@zucc.edu.cn; chenyong@zucc.edu.cn,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,8,HUBEI PEOPLES PRESS,WUHAN,"268 XIONGCHU RD, WUHAN, 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-216-06098-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,998,1002,,,,,,5,"Business; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Engineering, Mechanical; Management; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Public Administration,BLW28,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271211500185,0

Necessity of coordinated policy was analyzed by comparing supply chain decision under partially symmetric information with supply chain decision under symmetric information. Then an incentive function based on penalty and bonus was introduced and a coordination policy was set up by the combined use of order quantity, bonus and penalty cost. The policies can make suppliers deliver more under the limited production capacity and reach the order quantity of manufacturer.

At last, two case studies are used to show how the compatibility issue can be detected quantitatively using this approach.","[Zhang, Shuai; Sun, Jianling; Yin, Keting; Xu, Bin] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,,zhangshuai@zju.edu.cn; sunjl@zju.edu.cn; yinketing@zju.edu.cn; binxu@ieee.org,"chen, yue/JXW-9556-2024; zhang, lin/IZQ-4870-2023; yang, qing/JBR-8440-2023",,,,,,12,1,1,0,0,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,978-0-7695-3560-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,473,476,,10.1109/ISBIM.2008.106,0.0,,,4,"Business; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,BLA42,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000269751900114,0

This paper joins this conversation by focusing on the antecedents of organizational innovation. Drawing on institutional theory, the resource-based view (RBV), transaction cost theory and agency theory, this paper discusses about several particular innovation antecedents that are of extreme importance for a special group of firms (i.e., private firm) in an emerging economy (i.e., China). Specifically, we probe into the effects of actual financial position, financial slack resource and family governance on management innovation in Chinese private firms. We propose that firms with higher actual financial position, more financial slack resources and lower family governance will be more likely to innovate on their management system and to take higher risk level when conducting management innovation. This paper contributes to the innovation literature through three ways. First, concerning the research content, it focuses on management innovation instead of the well-discussed technological innovation. Second, in terms of the research context, it explores innovation phenomenon in an emerging economy and transition market - China, instead of western developed countries. Third, with respect to the research object, this paper examines the innovation behaviors of small private firms instead of big state-owned enterprises or multinational firms that have been investigated a lot. In addition to the theoretical contribution, this paper may also shed light on the management practice.","[Wang Yagang; Cao Chunhui] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Res Ctr Chinese Management Issues, Xian 710049, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University,,yagangwang@mail.xjtu.edu.cn; chunhui.cao@stu.xjtu.edu.cn,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,13,HUBEI PEOPLES PRESS,WUHAN,"268 XIONGCHU RD, WUHAN, 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-216-06098-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,844,850,,,,,,7,"Business; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Engineering, Mechanical; Management; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Public Administration,BLW28,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271211500156,0

The purpose of this paper is to provide model-based analysis and empirical evidence concerning branch establishment of SOBs in China. Explorative research on the optimal branch layer and span for SOBs under framework of principal-agent theory was conducted. In addition, DEA method was adopted to empirically test bank efficiency relating branch establishment in 2006-2008. It is found that efficiency of SOBs is significantly lower than that of other domestic joint-stock commercial banks. Moreover, the decreasing returns to scale mainly account for the low efficiency of these state-owned banks.

A portfolio of generic competencies is developed and considered against factors such as ethnicity, culture, language, religion and ethics and detailed consideration is given to how best such competencies can be developed. It is concluded that the use of a range of novel learning environments can provide considerable advantage over the traditional on-campus education environment particularly in relation to delivering of the competencies within the context of a rapidly developing global information society. Particular difficulties relating to the achievement of such competencies are analysed and solutions suggested based on the use of a range of global based environments where aspects such as culture, ethics, and ethnicity can be effectively related to the evolution of generic competencies within a global context It is concluded that a range of life-place environments are essential to the effective realisation of generic competencies within a global context for engineers at undergraduate, postgraduate and post-experience levels.

Strategic Flexibility requires a comprehensive set of abilities to acquire, interpret, share and utilize knowledge by scanning internal and external environments carefully and profoundly in order to take immediate and proper actions. Therefore managing knowledge is an inseparable component of strategic flexibility. An integrated system has to be executed to strategize all enterprise activities based on knowledge toward becoming flexible strategically. But in enterprise's management literature a dearth of an intensive study in the context of SMEs is vividly felt. Therefore, addressing this gap seems worthwhile for SME's competitiveness; hence, the main objective of this study is to fill the gap empirically based on case-study of some service provider and manufacturing SMEs in Malaysia.

Which strategy to be selected relies on the comparison of related revenues and costs. Game theory analysis proves that firms are more likely to cooperate in research and development activity. Clusters provide well-established institution structure to reduce transaction cost and information cost.

Its purpose is to determine the most important issues that should be considered when designing for a particular culture. To obtain a deeper and more detailed knowledge on how designers work in each country, it necessitated that the researcher get closer to the designers environment. In such a way the researcher can enquire, observe and converse with them in an open-ended style of discussion. This can best be done through a case study in each of the two countries (Oman and UK). The specific aims of conducting these case studies in the two selected countries were to: I) investigate the extent of the usage of the published usability guidelines and tools in the design of the user interface of a website; 2) Explore the differences and similarities in designing websites for each of the two cultures; 3) Discover whether they design for different cultures; if they do what considerations they take into account when designing for different cultures; and 4) Investigate whether the designers in both countries consider using Cultural User Interface (CUI) profile or something similar to capture the target culture preferences and expectations, and whether it would fit into the way they normally do business. The data collection instrument consisted questionnaire for the designers and in many cases, this was followed with an interview or an email to the surveyed design companies to clarify their responses. In addition to the questionnaire, the researcher made use of available documentation or archival data that could provide any help to the current research. The researcher also investigated the usability tools and guidelines used as well as other specific design tools which the company found helpful in designing usable websites. The main outcome of this study was that the designers in both countries believed that although the users share similar preferences and perceptions about many website usability issues, however, they differ in the importance they give to certain usability elements such as the adherence to local language, culture and religious beliefs. The results of this study proved that one-size-for-all is not the right approach for a successful website.

Our results show that the bid-ask spreads is negatively related to the employment of an industry specialist auditor and Big4 auditor; and positively related to audit firm tenure. However, further tests refine those conclusions, in that the positive association between tenure and bids-ask spread differs between specialist and non-specialist auditors and between Big4 and non-Big4 auditors. Specifically, we find that bid-ask spreads is increasing in tenure for clients of non-specialist and clients of non-Big4. These findings are consistent with a market that perceives audit quality diminishing with tenure for non-specialist auditors and non-Big4 auditors; and a market that finds audit quality increasing with industry specialization and Big4 auditors.","[Hakim, Faten] Fac Econ Sci & Management Tunis, Res Unit Finance & Strategy Businesses, El Manar 2092 II, Tunisia; [Omri, Abdelwahed] Inst Higher Management Tunis, Dept Management Sci, Bardo 2000, Tunis, Tunisia",,"Hakim, F (通讯作者)，Fac Econ Sci & Management Tunis, Res Unit Finance & Strategy Businesses, El Manar 2092 II, Tunisia.",hkm.faten@laposte.net,,,,,,,45,0,0,0,9,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-0-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,1828,+,,,,,,4,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Information Systems; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science,BPB66,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000278458300228,0

The incorporation of risk into the internal auditing has seen an improvement in risk management practices within the corporations including banking. This has seen a rise in the number of corporations and companies embracing Risk Based Internal Auditing practices (RBIA).

Can such cognitive costs affect the structure of the microblogging network? Here we extracted data from the most major microblogging service: Twitter. We find that the network structure in Twitter has some features: power law decay in the small degree range, link reciprocity and asymmetry between distributions of the in-degree and out-degree.

In recent years, different approaches have been developed focusing on corporate intangible resources, competencies and capabilities as the main lever creating competitive advantage. Competitiveness has become a central issue in an increasingly open and integrated world economy. Successful economic development requires progress on multiple fronts simultaneously. Much discussion of competitiveness has focused on the macroeconomic side. The macroeconomics conditions are necessary, but not sufficient. Unless there is appropriate improvement at the microeconomic level, political, legal, monetary and fiscal reforms will not bear full fruit.

The European context requires the necessity for Romania to adapt itself to the conditions of the new economy and to the knowledge society, in which the competitive advantage is obtained by innovation and knowledge.

Today Customer data has properties of large samples, high dimensions and more noises. In response to the limitations of existing feature selection in churn-prediction, we introduce and experimentally evaluate Support vector machine-recursive feature elimination attribute selection algorithm. It can identify key attributes of customer churn, rule out the related and redundant attributes, and reduce the dimensions of data. It Is more important that this algorithm is related with the followed classification learning algorithm, so it can be better integrated in churn prediction. The empirical evaluation results suggest that the proposed feature selection algorithm extracts less key attributes and exhibits better satisfactory predictive effectiveness than other three comparable attribute selection algorithms.","[Cao Kang; Shao Pei-Ji] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Econ & Management, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China",University of Electronic Science & Technology of China,,ckhad@uestc.edu.cn; shaopj@uestc.edu.cn,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,9,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,978-0-7695-3560-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,306,309,,10.1109/ISBIM.2008.174,0.0,,,4,"Business; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,BLA42,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000269751900074,0

Products involving significant technology or engineering development are particularly challenging in this respect, because product designers and engineers must be able to cover relevant engineering fundamentals as well as the creative and managerial skills required to drive product development. This paper argues that a firm's new product development performance increases with the extent of its innovation capability. The sources and configuration of innovation capability are internal organizational learning capability and control of external network resources.

Individual mastery of knowledge has been shown to be effective in a variety of learning situations, particularly in face-to-face collaborative learning environments. This qualitative study explores individual perceptions of mastery of knowledge acquired in a technology-supported online collaboration context. Results from the study indicate individual student mastery of knowledge was strongly supported in online collaboration via engagement in online discussion forums. By using mastery of knowledge to enhance the learning process, there would be a commensurate enhancement of the likelihood of the transfer of knowledge.

Construction is one of them. Supplies and products in construction consists of material and immaterial, knowledge, elements. The paper argues however that in a knowledge economy, those two elements are increasingly intertwined and competition and markets will increasingly be constituted by the knowledge element. Creating value for the customers and the enterprises becomes dependent of the ability to organise and coordinate in the supply networks. This includes the issue of quality. The approach taken here is study the emergence of failures occurring in the supply chain, and thereby understanding its quality aspects better. The paper presents case study work done in Chinese construction. The method was to observe work at the construction site and interviewing actors following backwards upstream the supply chain to the origin of the failure. The building project followed generated 160 failures over a three month observation period. These were compiled and analysed. The economic consequences are calculated to be 8% of the production costs. The analysis of relations in the supply chain both shows relations to materials and knowledge aspect of the supply network and these to aspects' interaction. Most of the failures was generated in relation to knowledge processes and then occasionally transform into the material process. The paper proposes initiatives to strengthen partnerships in supply chains and especially at engineer to order production.

In this paper, we analyze the SOD constraint in PBDM delegation model and give the formal definition for the constraint.

This paper analyzes the reasons why cannot be imitated and the characteristics of its developmental stage. Through an extensive research we have concluded that, even by combining different innovation factors, the characteristics of the evolution pattern of the Silicon Valley cannot be imitated without having a significant innovative product because there is no conditions to come into being significant innovational products or technology in a short time, however, we can draw many useful lessons from this case for seeking different developmental ways to guide other high-tech industrial park.","[Mu Renyan] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology,,murenyan@163.com,,,,,,,5,0,0,1,5,HUBEI PEOPLES PRESS,WUHAN,"268 XIONGCHU RD, WUHAN, 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-216-06098-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,622,626,,,,,,5,"Business; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Engineering, Mechanical; Management; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Public Administration,BLW28,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271211500117,0

The pirate version of Win XP could not pass the verification of WGA, and the desktop of this system would be enforced to turn into black once an hour as a result. In China, people from all social circles, especially a large number of netizens responded to the so called Microsoft Black-out screen event. Most of them argued that MS WGA had violated various laws and regulations; however, through an analysis of such event with some relative theories and cases, this article believes that MS WGA is a due action of Digital Right Management (DRM). From the angel of Intellectual Property Law, DRM is a kind of legitimate technical measure. Therefore, this article would Re to illustrate the legitimacy of MS WGA by comparing it with the cases of Jiangmin corporation logical lock and SONY BMG. Though MS WGA is not an illegal action, most people in China evaluate such action negatively. This is similar to what has happened to the recording industry in the past few years, the recording industry had employed a variety of DRM in Internet music downloading in order to limit such usage. Unfortunately, these measures didn't succeed, but stirred heavy criticism. Recently, many record companies such as iTunes Store and Napster music store have begun to provide DRM free music for downloading, which shows a reform of operation and profit mode of digital copyrighted works. This article then summarizes the transformation of profit mode in the software industry. Some digital copyrighted works, such as antivirus software and office software, gain money through service and advertisement, which not only ensures the popularization and application of the digital copyrighted software, but also protects the profit of the software designers. Thus, this article concludes that a new commercial mode characterized by collaborative development is taking shape and will have a promising future.","[Zhu Linbin; Fang Zhengzheng] Xiamen Univ, Publ Affair Dept, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China",Xiamen University,,13328773510@189.cn; yuzhou_0407@sina.com; yangse1986@163.com,,,,,,,4,0,0,1,7,HUBEI PEOPLES PRESS,WUHAN,"268 XIONGCHU RD, WUHAN, 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-216-06098-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,1072,1076,,,,,,5,"Business; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Engineering, Mechanical; Management; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Public Administration,BLW28,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271211500199,0

When enterprise systems exchange information, PI goes beyond the compatibility between the structure and the meaning of shared information. It also considers the use of information in a given context as an equally important aspect.

Powered by globalization, competition, and the Internet, that process happens globally and at accelerating speed. It breaks existing product supply chains and transforms them into a volatile network of collaborating businesses the business value network. The network forms around service value propositions of the participants that lead to joint value creation. While SAP and other players have developed quite a sophisticated understanding of on premise software solutions and accompanying services, the field of on-demand software services is relatively new to the industry, and the underlying principles of value creation in many successful new service businesses are often a miracle. Business value networks will become increasingly important in the world's economy in the future. Their appropriate IT support must efficiently realize business collaborations and interactions between globally spread organizations. In the past, Enterprise Interoperability has been often seen as a synonym for Enterprise Application Integration at intra- or inter-organizational level. In the future, the ability to adapt to changing market and business requirements together with the ability to reflect the business adaptations on the level of the connected ICT systems will constitute key challenges for the support of business network formations. Enterprise Interoperability will have to address business value networks not only from ICT viewpoint but also as socio-technical systems from the business and operational perspective. Over the past years, SAP Research was involved into intense research that has taken place to explore the Internet of Services. New ways of developing, hosting, aggregating, mediating and finally consuming services have been described and tested.

Meanwhile, Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) aims at facilitating the development of distributed application functionality, independent from its implementation using a specific technology platform and thus contributes to deployment in different platforms. In this paper we propose an MDA-based transformation technique for service composition. The contribution of the paper is two-fold. First, our approach shows how enterprise interoperability is supported by service composition at two different technical levels, namely at choreography and orchestration level. Second, the approach contributes to the management of changes that affect enterprise interoperability, by defining a (semi-)automated transformation from choreography to orchestrations in which the interoperability constraints specified at the choreography level are preserved.","[Khadka, Ravi; Jansen, Slinger] Univ Utrecht, POB 80 089, NL-3508 TB Utrecht, Netherlands; [Sapkota, Brahmananda; Pires, Luis Ferreira; Van Sinderen, Marten] Univ Twente, NL-7500AE Enschede, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Khadka, R (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, POB 80 089, NL-3508 TB Utrecht, Netherlands.",ravi@csuu.nl; b.sapkota@ewi.utwente.nl; l.ferreirapires@ewi.utwente.nl; m.j.vansinderen@ewi.utwente.nl; s.jansen@cs.uu.nl,"Roijackers, Slinger/Y-4244-2019; Sapkota, Brahmananda/HPC-7994-2023","Roijackers, Slinger/0000-0003-3752-2868;",,,,,23,8,8,0,1,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1865-1348,,978-3-642-19679-9,LECT NOTES BUS INF P,,,2011,76.0,,,,,,177,+,,,,,,3,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BVE81,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000291327000015,0
