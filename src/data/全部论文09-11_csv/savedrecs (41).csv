The model shows that demand pressure in one option contract increases its price by an amount proportional to the variance of the unhedgeable part of the option. Similarly, the demand pressure increases the price of any other option by an amount proportional to the covariance of the unhedgeable parts of the two options. Empirically, we identify aggregate positions of dealers and end-users using a unique dataset, and show that demand-pressure effects make a contribution to well-known option-pricing puzzles. Indeed, time-series tests show that demand helps explain the overall expensiveness and skew patterns of index options, and cross-sectional tests show that demand impacts the expensiveness of single-stock options as well.","[Garleanu, Nicolae] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, CEPR, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Garleanu, Nicolae; Pedersen, Lasse Heje] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Pedersen, Lasse Heje] NYU, CEPR, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Poteshman, Allen M.] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); New York University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Gârleanu, N (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, CEPR, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",garleanu@haas.berkeley.edu,"Pedersen, Lasse Heje/AAE-7552-2019","Pedersen, Lasse Heje/0000-0001-7126-5530",,,,,38,315,371,5,60,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

I empirically investigate a possible explanation for this segregation: the gender difference in preferences for competition, which in recent experimental studies has been found to affect economic outcomes. My findings suggest that women's greater distaste for competition decreases educational achievement. It can also explain part of the gender segregation in occupational fields. Specifically, accounting for distaste for competition seems to reduce gender segregation in the fields of Law, Business & Management, Health, and Education. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Several studies of indoor air pollution from solid fuels have analyzed the problem at the village and household level, but to design effective policies it is important to understand the large-scale socioeconomic drivers of household air pollution (HAP). Using county-level data covering all of China, we examine relationships between socioeconomic variables and ambient concentrations of PM and SO2 resulting from household energy use.

We compare the capital structures of SMEs across countries and differences in country characteristics, asset structure, size, profitability, risk, and growth and how these may impact capital structure choices. The results show that SMEs in these countries determine their capital structure in similar ways. We attribute these similarities to the country institutional and financial characteristics and the commonality of their civil law systems. However, structural differences arise due to firm specific effects. We find that size is positively related to leverage while the relationship between leverage and asset structure, profitability and risk is negative. Growth is not a statistically significant determinant of leverage for any of the four countries. Our main conclusion is that firm-specific rather than country facts explain differences in capital structure choices of SMEs.","[Psillaki, Maria] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, Dept Econ, GREDEG CNRS Demos, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Daskalakis, Nikolaos] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Mkt & Commun, Athens 10434, Greece",Universite Cote d'Azur; Athens University of Economics & Business,"Psillaki, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, Dept Econ, GREDEG CNRS Demos, 250 Rue A Einstein, F-06560 Valbonne, France.",maria.psillaki@gredeg.cnrs.fr,"Psillaki, Maria/ABD-4999-2020; Daskalakis, Nikolaos/AAM-8860-2021; Daskalakis, Nikos/AAB-5314-2022","Psillaki, Maria/0000-0002-2424-4208; Daskalakis, Nikos/0000-0001-5253-2752",,,,,59,165,198,9,92,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

In the longer run, market uncertainty declines after earnings are announced, regardless of whether there is a preceding earnings forecast.

The formula predicts that an increase in the coefficients in the monetary policy rule will lead to an increase in the coefficients in the affine equations. Empirical evidence for such a prediction is provided. The curve of the response coefficients by maturity is also predicted by the formula.

Population aging and consumption inequality in Japan. Rev. Income Wealth 44, 361-381]. Given this information, we examine whether this phenomenon is consistent with the standard precautionary saving model developed by Carroll [Carroll, C.D., 1997. Buffer-stock savings and the life cycle/permanent income hypothesis. Quart. J. Econ. 62, 1-56]. Specifically, we investigate: (1) the degree of age dependence of idiosyncratic income risks; and (2) the importance of age dependence for the evolution of inequalities in consumption predicted by the household model of Carroll (1997). We find a strong age dependence of income risks, which creates a nonlinear age-variance profile of income, and the standard precautionary saving model is consistent with the observed consumption inequalities as long as we take the nonlinearity in age-variance profiles of income into account.

We model the interaction between the macroeconomy and financial markets using a time-varying VAR augmented with the factors from the yield curve. There is evidence of a great moderation in the dynamics of the yield curve, with the factors being persistent and volatile before the introduction of inflation targeting in 1992 but becoming stable afterwards. The introduction of time-variation in the Factor Augmented VAR improves the fit of the model and results in expectation hypothesis consistent yields that are close to actual yields, even at long maturities. Monetary policy shocks had a significant impact on the volatility of inflation, output and the policy rate over the pre-inflation targeting era, but their contribution has been negligible under the current regime. Shocks to the level of the yield curve accounted for a large fraction of inflation variability only before 1992. (C) 2009 Bank of England. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Colombian carnations enter the EU duty-free under the GSP+ incentive scheme which is less secure than the trade agreement between the EU and Kenya. If the EU withdrew preferences from Colombia, would Kenyan flower exporters be better off in the UK carnation market? The results of study showed that Colombian exports benefited from tariff-free access to the UK where the benefit was due to both trade creation and trade diversion. Additionally, the competition between Colombian and Kenyan carnations was found to be insignificant and there was no evidence that GSP+ negatively affected Kenyan carnations.

This paper introduces the notion of fatigue by assuming that a worker has a limited amount of renewable resources that are depleted when effort is exerted. As multiple equilibria and thresholds can emerge, the optimal intertemporal allocation of effort depends both on the fatigue accumulated by the worker and on the wage rate chosen by the firm. A principal should take this into account, because choosing a wage rate that equals the marginal product value is, in general, suboptimal. This holds even if the worker is expected to exert constant effort over time. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Through a detailed case study analysis of a community-based electric micro-grid in rural Kenya, we demonstrate that access to electricity enables the use of electric equipment and tools by small and micro enterprises, resulting in significant improvement in productivity per worker (100-200% depending on the task at hand) and in a corresponding growth in income levels in the order of 20-70%, depending on the product made. Access to electricity simultaneously enables and improves the delivery of social and business services from a wide range of village-level infrastructure (e.g., schools, markets, and water pumps) while improving the productivity of agricultural activities. We find that increased productivity and growth in revenues within the context of better delivery of social and business support services contribute to achieving higher social and economic benefits for rural communities. We also demonstrate that when local electricity users have an ability to charge and enforce cost-reflective tariffs and when electricity consumption is closely linked to productive uses that generate incomes, cost recovery is feasible.

We apply various econometrics models to a unique longitudinal dataset with rich information that allows for the exploitation of four different health indices. Our findings show strong cross-sectional correlations between health and both financial and non-financial assets, but these correlations seem to be mainly driven by heterogeneity as the correlations largely disappear in the fixed-effects model. Adverse health shocks, however, are found to motivate a safer portfolio choice even after individual fixed-effects are controlled for - a result consistent with the prediction made by the background risk theory. Our findings suggest that health shocks shift investment from risky assets toward other financial assets, but keep the total financial assets unchanged. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that the abnormal behavior of the slope estimators in these regressions arises from the simultaneous presence of high persistence, low signal-to-noise ratio, strong endogeneity, and an omitted variable problem. The paper develops the limiting theory for the slope parameter estimators in the levels and differenced forward premium regressions under some assumptions that match the empirical properties of the data. The asymptotic results derived in the paper help to reconcile the findings from the levels and difference specifications and provide important insights about the time-series properties of the implied risk premium.","[Gospodinov, Nikolay] Concordia Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada; [Gospodinov, Nikolay] CIREQ, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Concordia University - Canada; Universite de Montreal,"Gospodinov, N (通讯作者)，Concordia Univ, Dept Econ, 1455 Maisonneuve Blvd W, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada.",nikolay.gospodinov@concordia.ca,,,,,,,39,19,20,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

J,"Hattori, M; Shin, HS",,,,"Hattori, Masazumi; Shin, Hyun Song",,,Yen Carry Trade and the Subprime Crisis,IMF STAFF PAPERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Yen carry trades have traditionally been viewed in narrow terms purely as a foreign exchange transaction. This paper argues that the carry trade should instead be viewed in the broader context of global credit conditions. We show that the volume of yen funding that is channeled for use outside Japan is mirrored by fluctuations in the size of U. S. broker-dealer balance sheets. Differences in short-term interest rates across currencies help to explain the incidence of the carry trade, as does the measure of implied equity risk given by the VIX index. The conjunction of deteriorating credit conditions in the United States and the weakness of the dollar against the yen in the early stages of the credit crisis of 2007-08 can thus be seen as two sides of the same coin. Both can be seen as consequences of financial sector deleveraging in the United States.

Because claim-auditing is costly for the insurer, ex-post moral hazard problem arises. I find that the repeated game effect serves as a commitment device, allowing the insurer to deter fraud completely (for sufficiently high discount rate) but only when the policyholders observe past auditing strategies. Under weaker observability conditions, only partial efficiency gains are generally possible. I conclude that the insurers should spend resources on signaling their anti-fraud attempts to the potential policyholders.

Controlling for the effects of economic conditions, this study analyzed the effects of density dependence, age, imprinting, rate dependence, and the origin of new entrants on the industry. The results indicate that the inflow was comprised of start-ups that proved to be relatively short-lived. In contrast, new entrants that originated as part of incumbent firms that were diversifying in IT stabilized the industry by depressing its disbanding rate and facilitating the entry of new firms. In explaining the dynamics of the industry, the analysis supports the established models of density dependence, age dependence, imprinting, and organizational origin.","[Zaring, Olof; Eriksson, C.

The model is estimated using national survey data on parents' perceptions of skin cancer risks and their actual use of sun protection products in order to test the equilibrium condition that the parent's marginal rate of substitution between equal percentage reductions in her child's and her own risk equates to unity. Empirical results are consistent with this prediction.

To test this hypothesis, we perform convergence regressions derived from a theoretical model on the impact of FDI on endogenous technological change in small economies. The model includes FDI externalities that enhance growth, but also shows that FDI can crowd out host country income and reduce local innovation. The empirical analysis employs disaggregated US data for various FDI-related activities-in addition to the conventionally used aggregate FDI stocks and flows. We estimate the net FDI impact on the convergence rate of per-capita income to US levels, controlling for human development, financial development, and trade.

We also develop Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) from the survey using both standard gamble and time-tradeoff elicitation methods to explore the relationship between QALYs and willingness-to-pay (WTP), and to develop QALY weights for subtle developmental effects. The results of the CV surveys are designed for incorporation into a case study of an integrated risk model to monetize the benefits of predicted risk reductions. Respondents showed a nearly proportional, positive relationship between decreasing the risk of a 6-point reduction in IQ (a standard measure of intelligence) and WTP, but showed a negative relationship between risk reduction and WTP for reading comprehension as an outcome. The range of mortality risks that respondents would accept on behalf of their (hypothetical) 10-year-old child is 2 in 10,000 to 9 in 1,000 per IQ point, and WTP per IQ point is $466 ($380, $520). QALY weights elicited via time tradeoff (reduction in life expectancy) were significantly different from QALY weights elicited via a standard gamble (p = 0.001).

Clearly, the directive integrates economic instruments in environmental policies to provide incentives for the sustainable use of water resources. Our analysis will focus on public water utilities, required to be financially self-sufficient, facing demand and capacity shocks. The paper deals with the simultaneous determination of incentive pricing policies and investment rules under an ex similar to ante maximum demand charge. We will characterize the welfare-optimal capacity selection rule and the welfare-optimal maximum demand pricing rule. Heterogeneous consumers demands are considered when tariffs are set ex similar to ante, before demands are known.

To the extent that there is any forecasting power, the most promising models are those based on purchasing power parity or the current account, although it must be noted that these mainly predict the real exchange rate, rather than the nominal exchange rate. Thus, some of the adjustment takes place in prices.

A decreased predilection for financing via equity markets is associated both with greater power of bank regulators and with more globalization and an English legal origin. One interpretation of our results suggests that while common law promotes both banking and financial markets, common law and societal openness act to promote banking more than markets in less developed environments.

The latter two options terminate the loan. The termination rates of subprime mortgages that originated each year from 2001 through 2006 are surprisingly similar: about 20, 50, and 80 percent, respectively, at one, two, and three years after origination. For loans originated when house prices appreciated the most, terminations were dominated by prepayments. For loans originated when the housing market slowed, defaults dominated. The similarity of the loan termination rates for all vintages in the sample suggests that subprime mortgage loans were intended to be bridge (i.e., temporary) loans. In addition, between 2001 and 2006, the number of terminated subprime purchase-money loans (loans used to purchase rather than refinance a house) outweighed the estimated number of first-time-homebuyers with subprime mortgages. The effect of the subprime lending on the increase of homeownership in the United States-a potentially positive outcome of subprime mortgages-most likely has been overstated.

We show that these differences are heavily influenced by the choices made in modelling fiscal behaviour. We make a case for the use, in assessing policies and in the EMU context, of the standard modelling choice where the discretionary reaction of fiscal policy is directly estimated. Models where the overall reaction to the cycle - which includes the effects of both discretionary actions and automatic stabilisers - is directly estimated tend to suggest either strong pro-cyclical or strong counter-cyclical discretionary reactions, depending on how this component is identified. Within the standard model and for the years 1994 to 2008, we show that results are significantly affected by the data vintage (ex post or real-time). With ex post data, we find an unambiguous indication of a-cyclicality. Using real-time data, we find that the output gap matters. However, depending on whether we assess policy intentions or actual policies, euro-area governments' behaviour radically changes. A plausible interpretation is that in the implementation phase, governments loosen their fiscal stance, giving in to political pressures that are proportional to the scale of the economic difficulties in bad times and the size of the 'growth dividend' in good times.","[Golinelli, Roberto] Univ Bologna, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Golinelli, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",roberto.golinelli@unibo.it; sandro.momigliano@bancaditalia.it,"Golinelli, Roberto/F-1605-2013","Golinelli, Roberto/0000-0003-1107-6417",,,,,49,43,46,0,13,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0143-5671,,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

A higher quota of collateral leads to a higher recovery rate, whereas the risk premium of the borrower and the size of the company is negatively related to the recovery rate.

The impact of food aid was measured using the reduced form market equilibrium model consisting of maize quantity and maize producer price functions, estimated simultaneously through the two-stage least squares (2SLS) method. Analytical results revealed that food aid received by Swaziland does not lower prices of domestic maize and has no significant negative effect on the quantity of maize produced in subsequent seasons.","[Mabuza, M.

The bulk of FDI is horizontal rather than vertical, and standard theory predicts that horizontal FDI is discouraged when trade costs fall. This seems to conflict with the experience of the 1990s, when trade liberalisation and technological change led to dramatic reductions in trade costs yet FDI grew much faster than trade. Two possible resolutions to this paradox are explored. First, horizontal FDI in trading blocs is encouraged by intra-bloc trade liberalisation, because foreign firms establish plants in one country as export platforms to serve the bloc as a whole. Second, cross-border mergers, quantitatively more important than greenfield FDI, are encouraged rather than discouraged by failing trade costs. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We find that higher enforcement formalism mitigates the negative impact exerted by rigid working time regulations on the number of entrepreneurs. While it is agreed that regulatory rigidities may increase labour transaction costs, we show that entrepreneurs are less sensitive to labour regulations the higher the level of enforcement formalism in which they operate. Higher formalism is associated with lower enforcing efficiency and lower probability of being punished for transgressing laws. A policy implication is that encouraging labour flexibility might not improve conditions for entrepreneurial activity in procedurally formalist countries. This is due to the fact that, in those countries, flexibility de facto characterises employment relations, no matter what the law says.","[Urbano, David; van Hemmen, Stefan] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Stephen, Frank] Univ Manchester, Sch Law, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",Autonomous University of Barcelona; University of Manchester,"Urbano, D (通讯作者)，Autonomous Univ Barcelona, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",david.urbano@uab.cat,"van Hemmen, Stefan Felix/GLU-6278-2022; Urbano, David/B-6879-2009; Urbano, David/GLQ-6309-2022","van Hemmen, Stefan Felix/0000-0003-1452-166X; Urbano, David/0000-0001-7600-8656; Urbano, David/0000-0001-7600-8656",,,,,39,36,39,0,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

One issue that has not been adequately addressed by previous studies is the relative depreciation rates of subsidized and unsubsidized housing units. Simple economic theory suggests that subsidized projects should depreciate more quickly than unsubsidized units, as the rents received by owners of these projects do not depend directly on the condition of their units provided that they meet minimum housing standards. However, many government programs aimed at modernizing subsidized housing projects exist. Whether there is a difference between the depreciation rates of subsidized and unsubsidized housing units is therefore an empirical question. Using panel data from the American Housing Survey, I find that there is no significant difference in the depreciation rates of subsidized and unsubsidized housing units over the period from 1985 to 2005.

We find that strong union laws protect not only workers but also underperforming managers. Weak investor protection combined with strong union laws are conducive to worker-management alliances, wherein poorly performing firms sell assets to prevent large-scale layoffs, garnering worker support to retain management. Asset sales in weak investor protection countries lead to further deteriorating performance, whereas in strong investor protection countries they improve performance and lead to more layoffs. Strong union laws are less effective in preventing layoffs when financial leverage is high.","[Atanassov, Julian] Univ Oregon, Lundquist Coll Business, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Kim, E.

The data used to implement these investigations are from a survey designed to estimate the value Maine residents place on a farmland conservation easement program.

Furthermore, short-term institutions trading forecasts future stock returns. This predictability does not reverse in the long run and is stronger for small and growth stocks. Short-term institutions trading is also positively related to future earnings surprises. By contrast, long-term institutions trading does not forecast future returns, nor is it related to future earnings news. Our results are consistent with the view that short-term institutions are better informed and they trade actively to exploit their informational advantage.","[Zhang, Zhe] Singapore Management Univ, Lee Kong Chian Sch Business, Singapore 178899, Singapore; [Yan, Xuemin (Sterling)] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",Singapore Management University; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Zhang, Z (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Lee Kong Chian Sch Business, 50 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178899, Singapore.",joezhang@smu.edu.sg,"ZHANG, Zhe (Joe)/D-2190-2010",,Research Committee of Singapore Management University; Lee Foundation,Research Committee of Singapore Management University(Singapore Management University); Lee Foundation,"We thank Paul Brockman, Kalok Chan, Charles Cao, Bhagwan Chowdhry, Dan French, Allaudeen Hameed, Grace Hao, John Howe, Inder Khurana, Tina Martin, Sandra Mortal, Shawn Ni, Andy Puckett, Avanidhar Subrahmanyam, Marti Subrahmanyam, and seminar participants at the Singapore Management University and University of Missouri Columbia for helpful comments.

The amount of property value protected from taxation throughout the state by this amendment has grown to over $246 billion (13.9% of total property value) since the amendment's implementation in 1995. This study tests whether the protection has accrued disproportionately over time among homestead property owners, the very group of people the amendment was intended to protect. The results suggest that the amendment has reduced the degree of progressivity in the state's property tax system such that the owners of lower value home properties are shouldering an increasing proportion of the property tax burden relative to the owners of higher value homestead properties. The differential impacts of the SOHA across value ranges of homestead properties are likely attributable to differential appreciation and ownership transfers for higher and lower value homestead properties throughout the state.","[Allen, Marcus T.] Coll Charleston, Charleston, SC 29401 USA; [Dare, William H.] Oklahoma State Univ, Tulsa, OK 74106 USA",College of Charleston,"Allen, MT (通讯作者)，Coll Charleston, Charleston, SC 29401 USA.",allent@cofc.edu; dare@okstate.edu,,,,,,,13,3,5,1,4,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

The estimates are carried out from French data called TDE-MLT, conducted by the DARES. An econometric treatment of the endogeneity of the labour contract status and unobservable heterogeneity is carried out. Our results show that wages positively affect employment duration.

Among the many synthetic indicators of economic performance, proposed by the doctrine and professional practice from the last years (other than EVA), a large distribution have known CFROI (residual cash flow), CFA (cash flow added) and VEIR (integrated economic income, residual), but an undoubted notoriety had the Economic Value Added, known under the acronym EVA. The contrast between the methods of approximate evaluation that require a rational volume of information and exact evaluation methods, in the face of some modest benefits, expressed in terms of quality of results, requires a large number of data and assumptions. Models on which are based methods of evaluation involves the approximate representation of reality, and we cannot expect from them more than an acceptable resemblance with the economic financial reality that is referred to. Choosing the level of complexity of the evaluation model should be done carefully and cautiously, taking into account the hierarchy of options to evaluate. A typical problem, which the authors will try to confront, arises from the need to evaluate in an advantageous way the proposals or investment decisions, which lead to certain terms of maturity and cash flows (in the form of entries or exits). In the present paper, we consider to be appropriate to present first the evaluation method VAN (Net Present Value) or REA (Updated Economic Result), a logical method, imposed in an absolutely fair and realistic, which may be considered as an improvement of the basic scheme. After a brief definition of the concept of EVA, are illustrated parameters which contributed to the playback of the EVA evaluation formula, describing the process through which, from the calculation of EVA can be reached at the economic evaluation of an entity.","[Grosu, Veronica; Bostan, Ionel] Univ Stefan Cel Mare Suceava, Fac Econ Studies & Publ Adm, Suceava, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,,doruveronica@yahoo.it; ionel_bostan@yahoo.com,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,9,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,293,298,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS73,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287985000044,0

The trends in higher education show an increase in the following demands towards academic institutions: - to organize higher education in the context of lifelong learning, - to internationalize the education process and research, - to cooperate and create an interactive partnership between university and business, - to reorganize knowledge, - to provide mobility and flexibility for knowledge-producing jobs, - to continuously promote new knowledge and new expectations. Knowledge based on an economic, i.e. business premise is marked by information production, transfer and dissemination - for universities in general, as well as for individual processes in academic institutions. The conclusion of different European (academic) commissions is that more should be invested in modernization and quality of university and other higher education teaching.

In this context, the issue of capital cost estimate is essential for assessing the efficiency or inefficiency of the investment. Determining the cost of capital of an enterprise is one of the most difficult and most complex aspects on which modern financial research is focused. In this paper we propose to identify the relationship between capital cost and a series of fiscal and financial variables, such as rate of return, the distribution of dividends and the tax rates of profit in case of a company with no debts, in an attempt to determine the change of capital cost from one period to another, under the influence of three variables. In this sense, the analysis has considered the case free-of-debts enterprises, which are financed exclusively from their own internal (reinvestment of profits) and external (share capital) sources; in terms of provision of capital, the need for funding appears to be an opportunity, both from the perspective of financial resources, destinations, and in that of their origin: if the company benefits from tax deductibility of expenses arising from the issue of new securities, it will benefit, at the same time, from tax protection related to the tax on dividends, which affects only its creditors in this case, the cost of equity in these conditions, remaining constant. The taxation impact, and not least the additional costs (the issuance and placement of shares), generates a cost of capital for the company different from the rate of return obtained by capital bringers.","[Ungureanu, Mihai Aristotel; Toader, Stela Aurelia; Predescu, Iuliana] Romanian Amer Univ, Bucharest, Romania",,,m_a_ungureanu@yahoo.com; stelatoader@rau.ro; iulianapredescu@yahoo.com; gen3pavo@yahoo.com,"Ungureanu, MIhai/GYR-1244-2022",,,,,,8,0,0,0,3,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,653,659,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS73,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287985000100,0

Economic Value Added (EVA) of the companies is estimated in order to determine dependencies between the working capital management strategy and the increase of the value for their owners. The superiority of effective working capital strategies over the ineffective ones according to the EVA criterion has been determined.

While the capture of explicit knowledge is relatively straightforward, methods for eliciting tacit knowledge are less well-developed. This paper overviews a number of strategies for eliciting tacit knowledge and then provides a detailed examination of one of these strategies: the critical decision interview approach. The critical-decision interview method can assist expert respondents to articulate tacit knowledge by probing beyond their espoused theories about their actions to reveal their practice. Tacit knowledge then can be identified by contrasting respondents' practices with theoretical prescriptions for best practices in the field. The application of the method in an investigation of risk management is described, and the effectiveness of this method for surfacing tacit knowledge is discussed.","[Xu, Yun] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Educ & Technol, Hangzhou 310014, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University of Technology,,xuyun@zjut.edu.cn; Morries@163.com; hsywxq@163.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,AMER SCHOLARS PRESS,MARIETTA,"3238 HARVEST WAY, MARIETTA, GA 30062 USA",,,978-0-9798471-5-8,,,,2009,,,,,,,645,647,,,,,,3,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BNT76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275501800136,0

Furthermore, banks which have been subjected to SCAs are likely to reduce their excessive risk positions.

More importantly, it encapsulates the stocks' cross-sectional variability in trading frequency, a relatively neglected but possibly important determinant of stock returns given the recently observed trends in financial markets. Overall, our findings argue against the conventional wisdom that there is a simple direct link between trading costs and stock returns by strongly suggesting that it is the compound effect of trading frequency and transaction costs that matters for asset pricing, not each aspect in isolation.

In order to measure the impacts of reduced emissions of local pollutants, this study considers the Warner-Lieberman bill (S.2191) of 2007 and the paper considers the impacts of reduced emissions in the transport and electric power sectors. This analysis provides strong evidence that climate change policy in the US will generate significant returns to society in excess of the benefits due to climate stabilization. The total health-related co-benefits associated with a representative climate policy over the years 2010-2030 range between $103 billion and $1.2 trillion in present value terms. Much of the co-benefit stems from between 32,000 and 189,000 avoided premature mortalities associated with exposure to PM2.5 and O-3. Most of the co-benefits are due to reduced emissions of SO2 from coal-fired power plants since these are an important contribution to ambient concentrations of PM2.5. Among the most important determinants of co-benefits is the relationship between climate policy and existing policies governing SO2 discharges from coal-fired power generation capacity. If SO2 emissions are permitted to remain at current levels, total co-benefits are cut by 65%. We find that the co-benefit per ton of CO2 emissions ranges between $1 and $77 depending on modeling assumptions and year.","[Muller, Nicholas Z.] Middlebury Coll, Dept Econ, Middlebury, VT 05770 USA; [Groosman, Britt] Environm Def Fund, New York, NY USA",Environmental Defense Fund,"Muller, NZ (通讯作者)，Middlebury Coll, Dept Econ, 303 Coll St, Middlebury, VT 05770 USA.",bgroosman@edf.org; nmuller@middlebury.edu; e.oneill.toy@gmail.com,,,,,,,24,42,50,3,62,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

However, these expectations have been the subject of relatively little research in European countries, with no contemporary evidence available in the UK. There has also been little consideration in the literature thus far of how much estimates may be biased by non-response and sample selection. This paper thus makes an original contribution to the literature by comparing UK undergraduate students' wage expectations with the actual wages earned by the same cohort on graduation, after attempting to correct for the aforementioned statistical issues in terms of observable characteristics.

We show that the asset growth effect is pervasive, and evidence to the contrary arises due to specification choices; that one measure of asset growth, the change in total assets, largely subsumes the explanatory power of other measures; that the ability of asset growth to explain either the cross section of returns or the time series of factor loadings is linked to firm idiosyncratic volatility (IVOL); that the return effect is concentrated around earnings announcements; and that analyst forecasts are systematically higher than realized earnings for faster growing firms. In general, there appears to be no asset growth effect in firms with low IVOL.

Analysts like Sandrey and Jensen (2007) have argued that such developments signal a significant change in the relevance of the EU as South Africa's main trading partner. This paper, however, argues that, even with the rise of emerging markets, South Africa still needs to take the EU seriously and remain strategic in its relationship with the Union. Even though total export flows to countries like China have risen exponentially since 2005, they still constituted only about 5 per cent of South Africa's total exports in all other sectors in 2008. More specifically, agricultural export data shows that, since 1997, EU-destined exports in the sector have been growing at a rate above that of agricultural exports to the world. The trends could imply that the ongoing implementation process of the Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement (TDCA) between the EU and South Africa remains relevant for economic growth and probably for poverty alleviation as well.","Univ S Africa, Dept Econ, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Mbatha, CN (通讯作者)，Univ S Africa, Dept Econ, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.",nhlanhla.mbatha@gmail.com,"Mbatha, Nhlanhla Cyril/P-6530-2014","Mbatha, Nhlanhla Cyril/0000-0002-6990-6455",,,,,22,0,0,0,15,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,,,AGREKON,Agrekon,DEC,2011,50.0,4,,,,,75,100,,10.1080/03031853.2011.617904,0.0,,,26,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,876WL,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299138400004,0

A brief review of long-term projections of demand for road transport suggests that problems related to road network congestion and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are likely to become more pressing in the future than they are now. Next we review, from a macroscopic perspective, three policy measures aimed at addressing these problems: stimulating shifts in transport modes to decrease congestion and GHG emissions, boosting low-carbon technology adoption to reduce GHG emissions, and regulating land use to reduce road transport volumes. We find that although these policies can produce tangible results, they may also have unintended and costly consequences.","[Proost, Stef] Catholic Univ Louvain, Ctr Econ Studies, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Van Dender, Kurt] Joint Transport Res Ctr Int Transport Forum, F-75116 Paris, France; [Van Dender, Kurt] OECD, F-75116 Paris, France",Universite Catholique Louvain; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Proost, S (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, Ctr Econ Studies, Naamse Str 69, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",stef.proost@econ.kuleuven.be; kurt.vandender@oecd.org,,"Proost, Stefaan/0000-0003-3731-4532",,,,,59,18,20,1,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1750-6816,,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

Given that these countries have adopted alternative exchange rate regimes over this period, we employed a Markov-switching vector error correction model which allowed for regime shifts in the entire set of parameters and the variance-covariance matrix. The main finding of the analysis was that depending on the nominal exchange rate regime in operation, the adjustment to the long run implied by the monetary model of the exchange rate determination came either from the exchange rate or from the monetary fundamentals. Moreover, based on a Regime Classification Measure, we showed that our chosen Markov-switching specification performed well in distinguishing between the two regimes for all cases.

Previous studies have argued that aid can entrench dictatorships, making a transition less likely. I find evidence that the relationship between aid and democratization depends on characteristics of the aid donor. During the period from 1992 to 2007, aid from democratic donors is often found to be associated with an increase in the likelihood of a democratic transition. This is consistent with a scenario in which aid promotes democratization and/or a situation in which democratic donors reward countries that take steps in a democratic direction. In either case, it suggests that democratic donors use scarce aid resources to encourage democracy. During the same period, aid from authoritarian donors exhibits a negative relationship with democratization. This suggests that the source of funding matters, with donor preferences regarding democracy helping to determine the link between aid and democratization. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

I hypothesize that changes in accounting standards can explain part of this decline. Standard setting has shifted towards a balance sheet approach, which I predict has made the balance sheet less useful for contracting. I measure the effect of the balance sheet approach on specific borrowers using a volatility ratio. I find that borrowers with greater volatility ratios are less likely to have balance sheet-based covenants. This evidence is consistent with reductions in the contracting usefulness of the balance sheet being associated with reductions in balance sheet covenants. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The study was conducted by arranging a series of seminars, carrying out field measurements, optimisation analysis and emission estimation. Data on eight companies that distribute food in and around Uppsala city, distribute were gathered and analysed. Different tools were used successfully i.e. Global Positioning System (GPS) for field measurement. RouteLogiX for route optimisation analysis and MODTRANS (a Matlab based package) for emission estimation. Optimising the individual routes reduced travel distance by 39% and time by 40% while total optimisation reduced the number of routes by 58%, the number of vehicles by 42%, and the total distance by 39%.

In San Francisco, California, there is a political movement to eliminate the use of LOS in planning. But this movement has met significant obstacles and debate.

We also investigate whether the degree of business cycle synchronization has increased after the 1999 EAC Treaty. We use an unobserved component model to measure business cycle synchronization as the proportion of structural shocks that are common across different countries, and a time-varying parameter model to examine the dynamics of synchronization over time. We find that although the degree of synchronization has increased since 2000 when the EAC Treaty came into force, the proportion of shocks that is common across different countries is still small implying weak synchronization.

The interdependency existing among these three decisions jointly influences household mobility and overall travel patterns. Therefore, a dynamic modeling framework that can account for the effects of interdependencies between vehicle transaction behavior and residential and job location choices is highly desirable. These decisions are made in the household level while individuals' decisions influence the overall outcome; therefore, it is also important to incorporate a group decision making process within such modeling frameworks. This study introduces a dynamic model for vehicle ownership, residential mobility, and employment relocation timing decisions. These decisions are modeled at the individual level and then sequentially aggregated to the household level if it is required. A hazard-based system of equations is formulated and applied in which work location and residential location changes are included as endogenous variables in the vehicle transaction model while other important factors such as land-use and built environment variables, household dynamics, and individuals' socio-demographics are also considered.

While an observable stochastic drift mainly makes the economy more risky, a latent expected growth rate process with learning significantly changes the equilibrium price-dividend ratios, price reactions to dividend and drift innovations, expected returns, volatilities, correlations, and differences between the stocks. These effects are the more pronounced the more risk averse the representative investor.","[Branger, Nicole] Univ Munster, Finance Ctr Munster, D-48143 Munster, Germany; [Schlag, Christian; Wu, Lue] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany",University of Munster; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Branger, N (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Finance Ctr Munster, Univ Str 14-16, D-48143 Munster, Germany.",nicole.branger@wiwi.uni-muenster.de; schlag@finance.uni-frankfurt.de; wu_lue@hotmail.com,,"Branger, Nicole/0000-0003-0466-6515; Schlag, Christian/0000-0001-9967-7916",,,,,20,6,6,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

Three key results emerge from the analysis. First, we find a positive correlation between movements of the ABX index and the equity returns for all the LCFIs. Second, the volatility of ABX index returns tend to be transmitted to the volatilities of the equity returns of the financial institutions. Third, ABX prices changes lead equity returns changes of the European-based LCFIs. For the US LCFIs a two-way linkage emerges. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

This paper proposes that localism afflicts choice of transport mode for commuting. A field study and two experiments provide evidence that commuting by bus is estimated to be less enjoyable than it is experienced to be and that driving to work is estimated to be more enjoyable than it is experienced to be. To the extent that commuting behavior is informed by subjective expected utility, commuters will inflict unanticipated costs on themselves and on society. Transport mode choice has external and dynamic consequences. Focalism in this domain implies welfare distortions that are worthy of policymakers' attention.

A sample of 445 Caucasian subjects selected among fulltime employees at international asset management companies underwent the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) while skin conductance was recorded, and a series of questions related to their demographic-socio-economic profile. Aside from confirming the role played by traditional explanatory variables commonly used as determinants of household indebtedness, results revealed the significant influence of individuals' impulsivity in making debt decisions. Impulsivity predicted unsecured debt (i.e. consumer credit), but it was not significantly associated with secured debt (i.e. mortgages). Neither presence of a somatic marker to guide decisions nor performance at the IGT predicted real-life indebtedness decisions in this non-clinical sample.

The results of our empirical analysis are used to carry out a horse-race comparing discrete and continuous models across multiple sample periods, forecast horizons, and evaluation intervals. Our evaluation involves comparing models during two distinct historical periods, as well as across our entire weekly sample of Eurodollar deposit rates from 1982 to 2008. Interestingly, when our entire sample of data is used to estimate competing models, the best performer in terms of distributional fit as well as predictive density accuracy, both in-sample and out-of-sample, is the three factor Chen (Chen, 1996) model examined by Andersen, Benzoni and Lund (2004). Just as interestingly, a logistic type discrete smooth transition autoregression (STAR) model is preferred to the best continuous model (i.e. the one factor Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (CIR: 1985) model) when comparing predictive accuracy for the Stable 1990s period that we examine. Moreover, an analogous result holds for the Post 1990s period that we examine, where the STAR model is preferred to a two factor stochastic mean model. Thus, when the STAR model is parameterized using only data corresponding to a particular sub-sample, it outperforms the best continuous alternative during that period. However, when models are estimated using the entire dataset, the continuous CHEN model is preferred, regardless of the variety of model specification (selection) test that is carried out. Given that it is very difficult to ascertain the particular future regime that will ensue when constructing ex ante predictions, thus, the CHEN model is our overall winning model, regardless of sample period.

The identification and estimation of the systems rely on the methodology of identification through heteroskedasticity proposed by Rigobon (2003). Using a panel consisting of 70 countries over the period 1960-2007, we find a two-way causal relationship between financial development and trade openness. A better-developed financial sector induces higher openness to trade, while higher openness in goods market stymies financial development.

Adopting the ratio of assets lost due to the floods as a likely exogenous shock proxy, we find that child labor increases with the magnitude of the shock but only if households do not receive credit. This suggests that following shocks child labor may be a response to non-availability of credit. The policy implication suggests a distinct and alternative channel in combating the economic incentives behind child labor access to credit diminishes the immediate financial burden on constrained households, reducing their need for child labor.

In this paper we assess the potential cyclicality of Basel II for the entire bank portfolio. This is in contrast to previous studies which have taken into account only parts of banks' assets, and also neglected the potential cyclicality of bank capital. We apply a detailed data set covering a relatively long period to analyse the cyclicality of both bank capital and Basel II capital requirements. Moreover, we employ a more comprehensive system of models than applied in the existing literature. Consistent with previous evidence, we find a substantial increase in the calculated Basel II capital requirements at the same time as bank capital deteriorates in a recession scenario. However, we also find that the cyclicality of Basel II capital requirements may be effectively contained if risk weightings are based on a sufficiently long observation period which includes economic downturns.

As the result of an empirical analysis over the period 1992-2008, we base our segmentation on investment screens that help us to examine whether values affect prices. We find that, although the profit-driven segment earns abnormal returns in the short run, these profit-generating opportunities do not persist in the long run for SRI stocks.

Each of the three outcomes can be summarized by a single closed-form equation. In the presence of moral hazard, assignment is distorted from positive assortative matching on firm size as firms with higher risk or disutility choose less talented CEOs. Such firms also pay higher salaries in the cross-section, but economy-wide increases in risk or the disutility of being a CEO do not affect pay. The strength of incentives depends only on the disutility of effort and is independent of risk and risk aversion. If the CEO can affect firm risk, incentives rise and are increasing in risk and risk aversion.

In three studies, UK adults' under-standing and use of credit cost and duration information were investigated from a bounded rationality perspective. Study 1, part of a representative survey of UK adults (N = 1000), found that when presented with annual percentage rate (APR) participants significantly overestimated the total cost (TC) of a 12-month loan. In Study 2, loan duration and APR were varied in an independent groups experiment (N = 242). Bank customers' TC estimates were sensitive to both loan duration and APR but TC was again substantially overestimated. Study 3 was an independent groups experiment investigating the effect of APR and TC information on credit decisions (N = 241). APR often influenced decisions between loans varying in duration and monthly repayment, but this effect was moderated by TC information. It was concluded that: (1) people generally misunderstand the relation between APR and TC: and (2) although APR information can have a large effect on credit decisions, its effect is either attenuated or amplified by TC information. The findings are interpreted in terms of a 'take the best APR' heuristic and a dual mental account model of instalment credit.

Though both the absolute number and the proportion of blended families is increasing throughout Europe, there is still little research information available on how they manage their finances. Blended families are an interesting group to study because their money management is clearly more complex than that of traditional nuclear families. In this paper I examine the extent of the differences between blended and nuclear families in money management, with special reference to bank accounts and the conducting of payments. I also seek to identify factors explaining the differences discovered. The research data comes from an Internet survey conducted in November 2006, which yielded answers from 469 Finnish families with children. The results, confirming earlier findings, suggested that money management is more separated in blended families than in nuclear ones. In nuclear families, both the bank accounts and the paying of expenditures are consistently managed jointly, whereas the spouses in blended families prefer separate bank accounts and display several different practices in the paying of common expenditures. In nuclear families the adults pay the expenditures together, but in blended ones they are responsible for the expenditures of their own biological children. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We find that these two measures of credit risk deviate considerably in the short run, due to factors such as liquidity and contract specifications, but we estimate a stable long-term equilibrium relationship for most countries. In particular, CDS premiums tend to move more than one-for-one with yield spreads, which we show is broadly consistent with the presence of a significant cheapest-to-deliver (CTD) option. In addition, we find a variety of cross-sectional evidence of a CTD option being incorporated into CDS premiums. In our analysis of the short-term dynamics, we find that CDS premiums often move ahead of the bond market. However, we also find that bond spreads lead CDS premiums for emerging market sovereigns more often than has been found for investment-grade corporate credits, consistent with the CTD option impeding CDS liquidity for our riskier set of borrowers. Furthermore, the CDS market is less likely to lead for sovereigns that have issued more bonds, suggesting that the relative liquidity of the two markets is a key determinant of where price discovery occurs.

We study this phenomenon using a unique dataset of hedge fund activism for the period 1994-2005, and find evidence that hedge fund activists improve both short-term stock performance and long-term operating performance of their targets. The most dramatic changes in performance accrue to targets where activists seek corporate governance changes and reductions in excess cash. Additionally, hedge funds themselves benefit from activism: the risk-adjusted annual performance of hedge funds seeking changes in corporate governance is about 7-11% higher than for non-activist hedge funds and hedge funds pursuing less aggressive activism. These results imply that hedge funds can facilitate long-lasting changes in corporate governance, cash flows, and operating performance that benefit target firm shareholders and hedge fund investors alike.","[Boyson, Nicole M.; Mooradian, Robert M.] Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Northeastern University,"Boyson, NM (通讯作者)，Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",n.boyson@neu.edu,"Shingade, Sudam Shrikrushna/D-5452-2019",,,,,,55,77,90,5,51,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

We used homogeneous urban and airline data that make international comparisons possible. We found that GDP, the level of economic decision-power, tourism functions, and the distance from a major air market account for more than two-thirds of the variation in air service. This seems to indicate that air service remains profoundly rooted in the metropolitan features of urban regions (notably size and decision-power), even if low-cost airlines are probably less linked to the latter because they partly focus on niche markets and regional airports. Much of the remainder is probably attributable to the specificities of the urban economy, to actors' strategies and to competition from high-speed trains. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Our analysis provides new insights on interactions between internal liquidity, external funds, and real corporate decisions, such as investment and employment. We first describe how companies used credit lines during the crisis (access, size of facilities, and drawdown activity), the characteristics of these facilities (fees, markups, maturity, and collateral), and whether managers had difficulties in renewing or initiating lines. We also describe the dynamics of credit line violations and the outcome of subsequent renegotiations. We show how companies substitute between credit lines and internal liquidity (cash and profits) when facing a severe credit shortage. Looking at real-side decisions, we find that credit lines are associated with greater spending when companies are not cash-strapped. Firms with limited access to credit lines, in contrast, appear to choose between saving and investing during the crisis. Our evidence indicates that credit lines eased the impact of the financial crisis on corporate spending.","[Harvey, Campbell R.] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Campello, Murillo; Graham, John R.; Harvey, Campbell R.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Campello, Murillo] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Giambona, Erasmo] Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands",Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Cornell University; University of Amsterdam,"Harvey, CR (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",cam.harvey@duke.edu,"Campello, Murillo/E-9433-2016; Harvey, Campbell/ABI-4900-2020; Harvey, Campbell/A-6106-2014; Graham, John R/A-6272-2014","Harvey, Campbell/0000-0002-2397-652X;",,,,,19,296,348,4,129,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

The South African Bureau for Food and Agricultural Policy (BFAP) model, which models a major share of agricultural output in South Africa, has also up to now not integrated input expenditure into the modelling framework. In most models, input costs are treated as exogenous and the recursive link between the input and output sides of the sector is overlooked in the models that attempt to incorporate input expenditures. This article addresses both issues by integrating agricultural input expenditures into the South African sectoral partial equilibrium model by endogenising input costs and recursively linking both the input and output sides of the agricultural sector. Thus, the impact of increasing the input cost may not only signal a fall in the gross value added and net farming income, but also a growth in subsequent years when the recursive effect of the impact is fully accounted for.","[Gebrehiwet, Y.; Meyer, F.] Univ Pretoria, BFAP, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Gebrehiwet, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, BFAP, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",Yemane.gebrehiwet@up.ac.za; Ferdie.Meyer@up.ac.za; Johann.Kirsten@up.ac.za,"Kirsten, Johann/AAC-8055-2019","Kirsten, Johann/0000-0003-0770-9648",,,,,13,0,0,4,11,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,,,AGREKON,Agrekon,JUN,2011,50.0,2,,,,,83,101,,10.1080/03031853.2011.589982,0.0,,,19,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,827QP,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000295443300005,0

Higher levels of retained director ownership increase underpricing in contrast to that of founders. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Not only access to but also quality of infrastructure affects firm productivity as well as people's livelihood. Frequent interruptions of the infrastructure-service supply impose extra backup costs on enterprises, hinder their timely business activities, and result in large losses of sales opportunities. This paper focuses on the impacts of improving the quality of public utilities (electricity, water supply, and telecommunications), using firm-level data from 26 transition economies in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The results suggest that firm costs would significantly increase when electricity outages occur frequently and the outage duration becomes longer. Similarly, when more time is required to restore suspended water supply, firms' competitiveness would be weakened. Not surprisingly, the impacts tend to vary depending on industry. The construction, manufacturing, and hotel and restaurant sectors are found particularly vulnerable.","World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Iimi, A (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",,,,,,,,43,13,14,1,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,,,DEV ECON,Dev.

Convergence starts when one firm begins to sell products in hitherto separate horizontal markets competing against rivals active in just one or another of the markets. Convergence creates a strategic link between the markets which alters the price levels, creates the possibility of bundle prices, and creates winners and losers in the population. Partial convergence (e.g., a merged provider of telephony and internet services vs. independent sellers of telephony or internet broadband) lowers prices in the less competitive sector, raises them in the more competitive sector and raises the total prices paid by consumers active in both sectors as compared to the counter-factual of no convergence. Full convergence (e.g., multiple firms offering TV and internet bundles) leads to deep discounts for bundle purchases but no reductions in stand alone prices paid by consumers in only one of the converging sectors. The bundle on bundle competition is so fierce that profits for all converging firms are reduced compared to the counter-factual of partial convergence.","Univ Oxford, Dept Econ & Christ Church, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Thanassoulis, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ & Christ Church, Oxford, England.",john.thanassoulis@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,17,9,10,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-1821,,,J IND ECON,J.

In the model investment depends on policy that depends on economically important fundamentals and is, thus, endogenous. The paper analyzes what might be concluded when treating policies as randomly assigned, when in fact they are not. When policy is endogenous, the measured effects of policy on growth will generally be biased. Based on the model and OECD data, the signs of the biases for tax variables and for redistribution are derived. Based on these signed biases, the paper discusses some empirical results that seem puzzling from a theoretical viewpoint. The paper argues that regressing growth on policy can still yield important information if policy endogeneity is taken into account.","Tech Univ Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany",Technical University of Darmstadt,"Rehme, G (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany.",,,"Rehme, Guenther/0000-0002-1717-8863",,,,,73,7,8,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

We show that while jumps occur mostly at prescheduled macroeconomic announcement times, announcement surprises have limited power in explaining bond price jumps. Our analysis further shows that pre-announcement liquidity shocks, such as changes in the bid-ask spread and market depth, have significant predictive power for jumps. The predictive power is significant even after controlling for information shocks.

While most retailers' food quality positioning is in line with consumer trends, based on conventional price-orientated strategies, the retail sector has been entering and driving quality related niche markets and is even proactively re-establishing the demand for products, such as in the case of Karoo lamb. As illustrated by the organic case, alternative quality trends provide an opportunity for value addition that could potentially lead to considerable price premiums and growth. This potential has, however, been left largely untapped by local suppliers. The article shows that the main vehicle for the institutionalisation of quality in South Africa has been the establishment of new certification schemes which are largely driven by the dominant retail sector. This sector captures most of the consumer purchasing power and sets the rules governing the system. Based on this analysis, the article then explores the implications of new food quality trends and the dominant role of the retail sector in small-scale farmers' market access.","[Bienabe, Estelle; Vermeulen, Hester; Bramley, Cerkia] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Biénabe, E (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",estelle.bienabe@up.ac.za; hester.vermeulen@up.ac.za; cerkia.bramley@up.ac.za,"Vermeulen, Hester/P-5739-2016",,,,,,49,14,17,0,10,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,MAR,2011,50.0,1,,,,,36,52,,10.1080/03031853.2011.562662,0.0,,,17,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,783XL,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000292118100003,0

Our comparative case study analysis is based on a wide range of statistical datasets, secondary reports, and interviews with a panel of 22 bicycling policy and planning experts. The main finding is that cycling levels in Melbourne are roughly twice as high as in Sydney and have been growing three times as fast in recent years. The difference is due to Melbourne's more favorable topography, climate, and road network as well as more supportive public policies. In particular, Melbourne has more and better integrated cycling infrastructure as well as more extensive cycling programs, advocacy, and promotional events. Melbourne also benefits from safer cycling than Sydney, which suffers from a lack of traffic-protected cycling facilities and aggressive motorist behavior toward cyclists on the road. While cycling has been increasing in Australia. it remains at very low levels relative to northern Europe, where both land use and transport policies are far more supportive of bicycling while discouraging car use through numerous restrictions and financial disincentives.

Most estimates of MTRs follow a procedure developed by Koester and Kormendi (1989) (K&K). Unfortunately, the time-invariant nature of the K&K estimates precludes their use as explanatory variables in panel data studies with fixed effects. Furthermore, the associated MTR estimates are not explicitly linked to statutory tax parameters. Our approach addresses both shortcomings. Using comprehensive tax policy data, we estimate state-specific, time-varying MTRs for all 50 states over the years 1977-2004. The inclusion of statutory tax variables has a significant impact on MTR estimates.","[Reed, W.

In several cases, subsidies for local public transportation have led to substantial reductions in road transportation and have thereby reduced externalities. Some but not all estimates suggest positive overall welfare effects of such policies. In the rare cases where road pricing has been applied, it has helped to reduce automobile transportation, and it has led to environmental improvements. The experience with specific driving restrictions like days without cars and low emission zones has been mixed. Local transportation policy can have a useful role to play as a complement to national policy instruments, but neither efficiency nor effectiveness can be taken for granted.","[Schmutzler, Armin] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schmutzler, Armin] CEPR, London, England",University of Zurich; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Schmutzler, A (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Blumlisalpstr 10, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",armin.schmutzler@uzh.ch,,,,,,,32,7,11,1,38,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Such acquisitions can give the acquirer a competitive edge and hurt its competitors. In this paper, I first show that if a firm will be adversely affected by a competitor's acquisition, then it can rationally overpay for the target to avoid this outcome within a value-maximizing framework due to industry equilibrium effects. Next, I show that depending on the level of anticipation by the market, the magnitude of the cost of losing, and the competition between bidders, an acquirer can earn negative payoffs at the announcement of such an acquisition. Even though the merger is the best decision given the circumstances, negative returns incorporate the understanding that the target is a necessary resource to survive in this changing environment, losing it to a rival is costly, and there is a positive probability that the bidder may not win or win by paying more than the synergy value of the target. Finally, I extend the model to include 2 targets that become available sequentially to multiple bidders and show that when there are alternatives available for the target's resources, overbidding subsides.","Koc Univ, Coll Adm Sci & Econ, TR-35440 Istanbul, Turkey",Koc University,"Akdogu, E (通讯作者)，Koc Univ, Coll Adm Sci & Econ, TR-35440 Istanbul, Turkey.",eakdogu@ku.edu.tr,"Akdogu, Evrim/AAY-8645-2020",,,,,,44,16,18,1,42,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

We present a model where the knowledge stock of a country grows over time as a function of three main factors: innovation intensity, technological infrastructures, and human capital. The latter two variables determine the absorptive capacity of a country as well as its innovative ability. We then carry out an empirical analysis that investigates the dynamics of technology in a large sample of economies in the last two-decade period, and studies its relationships with income per capita growth. The results indicate that the cross-country distributions of technological infrastructures and human capital have experienced a process of convergence, whereas the innovative intensity is characterized by increasing polarization between rich and poor economies. Thus, while the conditions for catching up have generally improved, the increasing innovation gap represents a major factor behind the observed differences in income per capita.","Norwegian Inst Int Affairs NUPI, Dept Int Econ, Dept 0033, Oslo, Norway",,"Castellacci, F (通讯作者)，Norwegian Inst Int Affairs NUPI, Dept Int Econ, Dept 0033, POB 8159, Oslo, Norway.",fc@nupi.no,,,,,,,21,75,84,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Using panel estimations, I find that ADR and H-share investors form their exchange rate expectations according to standard exchange rate theories such as the Harrod-Balassa-Samuelson effect, the risk of competitive devaluations, relative purchasing power parity, uncovered interest rate parity, and the risk of currency crisis.

While activists target firms with high CEO pay (whether excessive or not), voting support is higher only at firms with excess CEO pay. Firms with excess CEO pay targeted by vote-no campaigns experience a significant reduction in CEO pay ($7.3 million).

The experimental study presented here aims at investigating whether some easier-to-implement procedure could be adequately used. For that purpose, the subjects' degree of risk aversion is compared across three payment conditions: a real-losses condition based on a random-lottery (incentive-compatible) system, which serves as a benchmark, and two challengers, namely a losses-from-an-initial-endowment procedure and a hypothetical-losses condition. As a by-product, our experimental design also allows us to investigate the impact of monetary incentives in the gain domain. The main result is twofold: no significant difference arises between the three payment conditions in the loss domain, while real and hypothetical choices significantly differ in the gain domain. Our results suggest that the use of monetary incentives may be more crucial in the gain domain than in the loss domain.","[Etchart-Vincent, Nathalie] Ecole Normale Super, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, CNRS, F-94235 Cachan, France; [l'Haridon, Olivier] Univ Paris 04, GREG HEC, F-78501 Jouy En Josas, France; [l'Haridon, Olivier] Inst Univ France, F-78501 Jouy En Josas, France",Universite Paris Saclay; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Sorbonne Universite; Institut Universitaire de France,"Etchart-Vincent, N (通讯作者)，Ecole Normale Super, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, CNRS, 61 Ave President Wilson, F-94235 Cachan, France.",nathalie.etchart-vincent@ens-cachan.fr,"L'Haridon, Olivier/GYU-3062-2022","L'Haridon, Olivier/0000-0001-8786-4765; ETCHART-VINCENT, Nathalie/0000-0002-7051-8134",,,,,53,67,71,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

It has as reference sources several approaches about enterprise creation and institutional economic theory due to their adequacy to the study of the factors that influence enterprise creation by encompassing institutions, services, programs and support measures. With this analysis we try to evaluate the extent to which entrepreneurs know about and employ the available institutional programs/services. Investigation hypotheses are formulated and subject them to empiric tests. The results, from the offer point of view of the services/programs, show that, duplication of resources and efforts on the part of institutions in the region often occurs making coordination more difficult and alienating the demand (entrepreneurs). From the view point of the demand, we noticed that entrepreneurs may have a broad awareness of the institutions, but this does not imply that they use their programs and services. Therefore recommendations are made having in view a better coordination among the different institutions involved so that the programs they offer can be more effective in the future.","[Silva, Maria Jose; Antunes, Rute] UBI, Covilha, Portugal; [Silva, Maria Jose; Antunes, Rute] NECE, Covilha, Portugal; [Trigo, Virginia] ISCTE IUL, Sch Business, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade da Beira Interior; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Silva, MJ (通讯作者)，UBI, Covilha, Portugal.",msilva@ubi.pt,"Madeira, Maria Jose Aguilar/AAC-7928-2020; Silva, Maria Jose A/A-8672-2014","Madeira, Maria Jose Aguilar/0000-0003-1722-6148;",,,,,49,2,3,1,16,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2011,13.0,29,,,,,258,272,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,710QA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000286525100019,0

While disclosure eliminates a bank's information advantage over its competitors, disclosing information creates a new advantage for the bank in terms of a lower cost of external funds.

Therefore, there is a dire need to develop an effective mechanism for funds remittance home from abroad.The development of mobile money (m-Money) will facilitate access to finance through the mobile platform, which has the largest rate of adoption all over the world (two-third of the world population has access) among other information and communication technology (ICT) facilities.This paper proposes a framework for m-Money implementation in Nigeria as a poverty alleviation tool for sending money from cities and towns to the rural dwellers. The primary objective of this paper is to design a simple, cheap and secure way of sending money better than the existing transfers. The developed framework is premised on the public and private partnership (PPP) initiatives that combines both account-based and electronic currency systems. It employs a 2-factor authentication using the phone and the national ID card, which doubles as an identity card and a payment card. The model will help jumpstart the implementation of bank-to-ATM, ATM-to-bank and mobile-to-ATM funds transfer in Nigeria among others as well as increase accessibility to funds.","[Ayo, C.

Under financial integration banks optimally diversify their holdings of sovereign debt in an effort to minimize the costs with respect to an individual country's sovereign debt default. Although diversification generates risk diversification benefits ex ante, it also generates contagion ex post. The paper shows that financial integration without fiscal integration results in an inefficient equilibrium supply of government debt. The safest governments inefficiently restrict the amount of high-quality debt that could be used as collateral in the financial system and the riskiest governments issue too much debt, as they do not take account of the costs of contagion. Those inefficiencies can be removed by various forms of fiscal integration, but fiscal integration typically reduces the welfare of the country that provides the safe-haven asset below the autarky level.

A questionnaire-based international survey was used to investigate the research questions. Data from a sample of 244 companies were analyzed using a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) procedure and following the Ping 2-step approach [1]. The analyses demonstrate that demand variability does not significantly moderate the relationship between JIT and efficiency, whereas it negatively moderates the relationship between JIT and responsiveness.

Quantitative part consisted of a survey with sample frame of 253 respondents living in Riga. Findings - research with some exceptions showed that Latvians have quite clear image of Croatia. It is mainly positive and polycentric. The research results revealed scenery/nature, sea, sun, sand and mountains as the main brand attributes of Croatia. There were also negative attributes such as 'war'. Main choice factors of Croatia for Latvians are: 'scenery and nature', 'sea and beach', 'climate', 'new destination' and 'value for money'. Research also showed a large discrepancy in association attributes of non visitors and visitors and a smaller one in destination choice factors. Visitors to Croatia tend to have more affective and holistic image than non visitors. Research limitations/implications - due to different sample of non visitors and visitors some minor discrepancies in finding might take place. Practical implications - this research might be useful for Croatian destination marketers in building marketing strategies towards holidaymakers from Latvia. Originality/value - the paper points out the image, its association attributes and choice factors of Croatia as a possible source of competitive advantage of the destination.

There also have been identified the barriers that slow down this emergent industry, like communication failures between research and development (R&D) of functional foods and marketing. One of the findings of this research is that the communication barriers between research and development (R&D) and marketing teams could evolve into marketing unethical approaches (e.g. deceptive packaging, creation of false needs, etc.) that could artificially maximize the new products value and also hinder consumers' understanding, knowledge and freedom of choice, therefore becoming a threat to consumers' health. A smooth collaboration between R&D and marketing in the food industry is essential to assure the right balance between scientific research and value communication in order to improve consumers' health on the long term. This paper's conclusions show that food companies should integrate the local/traditional recipes into new products to assure a right communication and consumers understanding of the newly discovered bio-active ingredients, to drive consumers' acceptance, positive attitude and receptivity towards a series of new functional aliments.","[Chiru, Codrin] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,icchiru@yahoo.com; lia_chiru@yahoo.com,,,,,,,37,0,0,0,7,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-6-9,,,,2011,,,,,,,2439,2448,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEO28,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000317550001134,0

A sample of 535 individuals sourced from a household survey explores ratings of 18 types of transport problems. The questionnaire also measured social exclusion represented in five dimensions including income, unemployment, political engagement, participation in activities and social support networks. Well-being was also measured adopting standard psychological measures of 'Satisfaction with Life', 'Personal Well-being Index,' 'Positive Affect' and 'Negative Affect'. A factor analysis of self-reported transport difficulties identified four statistically significant sub-scales ('transport disadvantage', 'transit disadvantage', 'Vulnerable/Impaired' and 'rely on others') which together account for 57% of the variance in the responses. Analysis established that those with high self-reported transport problems were more likely to be located in fringe and remote parts of the city and lived in areas where it was not possible to walk to a local shop. However all groups made an average number of trips per day (except the 'Vulnerable/Impaired' group which make fewer trips) suggesting that self-reported transport disadvantage is unrelated to realised mobility. Analysis further established that only the 'Vulnerable/Impaired' group was associated with social exclusion and that they also had the lowest values of well-being compared to other groups. Overall findings confirm the methodological concerns associated with the use of self-reported measures of transport problems as a basis for defining transport disadvantage. The majority of those with high self-reported transport problems did not travel less than the survey sample as a whole and they were not associated with social exclusion. However the 'Vulnerable/Impaired' group was the exception, displaying a significantly higher association with social exclusion and lower well-being. The findings suggest which aspects of transport disadvantage are likely to be of greater concern for social policy. A concentration of research and policy on issues and social groups associated with the 'Vulnerable/Impaired' factor would be more effective in reducing social exclusion. Transport problems associated with this group including physical access to transport, knowing where to go and feeling safe from theft or attack when travelling may deserve higher priorities for attention. In addition those associated with the 'Vulnerable/Impaired' factor including older retired females and those who are more likely to be looking after someone with an illness or disability are clearly a high risk group and should warrant positive discrimination in transport and social policy.

It appears that life satisfaction ratings are retrospective assessments of how life has gone thus far, or at least how the last few years have gone. Most respondents would be reluctant to take a pill to improve their life satisfaction. Respondents were also generally in favour of providing good public services and perhaps promoting the conditions for happiness rather than focussing on happiness itself. Some people did not think the government should be responsible for promoting happiness directly and others were against happiness as a goal of policy because people were seen as being too different for policies to actually make any difference.

After wresting power from the Dutch, the leaders of the new republic adopted a constitution that required this national wealth to 'be controlled and utilised by the State for maximum prosperity of the people'. The dream of turning the country's abundant natural resources into a catalyst for socio-economic development was not pursued actively until 1967, when Soeharto's incoming New Order government introduced policies that supported a significant expansion of the mining industry. The combined effect of the Asian financial crisis and domestic political unrest in 1997-98 interrupted this process. It was anticipated that the introduction of a new mining law in 2009 would re-invigorate the sector. Based on an analysis of five significant elements of the new legislation, this article finds it is unlikely to result in a mining industry that provides maximum benefit to the Indonesian people.","[Haymon, Kirsty] Monash Univ, Monash Asia Inst, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University,,,,,,,,,26,17,18,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-4918,,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Their development has been strongly influenced by the external environment and political approaches to cooperative promotion. Although farmer cooperatives have developed rapidly in China in the last three years, progress has not been uniform across the provinces, due to differences in farmer education levels and varying economic and social situations. In order to identify factors for the successful development of farmer cooperatives in Northwest China, two cases of provincially approved successful farmer cooperatives in Shandan county of Gansu province were chosen for this research. The results revealed that a stable legal environment; a dedicated initiator and leader; government financial and technical support; farmer understanding and participation of cooperative activities and appropriate external support from professional NGOs were the key factors for the successful development of farmer cooperatives in Northwest of China. This study also found some challenges that farmer cooperatives have faced in their development.

It focuses on the most prominent exchange rate theory, purchasing power parity (PPP), which is tested using wavelet analysis, an engineering tool that has been increasingly applied to economic and financial data since the late 1990s. This paper applies wavelet analysis to PPP using two approaches. The first approach examines the relationship of the two components of PPP the nominal exchange rate and relative price. The second approach tests for a unit root of the real exchange rate. The empirical results from both approaches lend support for PPP for the British pound, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc. The estimated length of the long run for these three currencies varies from 1.5 to 5 years.

In this study, we test the sensitivity of preferences for several proposed expanded protection programs that would protect up to three US Endangered Species Act-listed species: the Puget Sound Chinook salmon, the smalltooth sawfish, and the Hawaiian monk seal. An external scope test is employed via a split-sample SP choice experiment survey to evaluate whether there is a significant difference in willingness to pay (WTP) for protecting more species and/or achieving greater improvements in the status of the species. The majority of 46 scope tests indicate sensitivity to scope, and the pattern of scope test failures is consistent with diminishing marginal utility with respect to the amount of protection to each species. Further tests suggest WTP may be proportional to the number of species valued.","[Lew, Daniel K.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Lew, Daniel K.] NOAA, Resource Ecol & Fisheries Management Alaska Fishe, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Wallmo, Kristy] NOAA, Off Sci & Technol, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Wallmo, Kristy] Univ Maryland, Princess Anne, MD 21853 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Eastern Shore,"Lew, DK (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",Dan.Lew@noaa.gov,"Lew, Daniel K./AAL-3013-2021","Lew, Daniel/0000-0002-3394-138X",,,,,55,39,39,0,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Similarly, the same-period sterilization coefficients are high under all regimes. This indicates that the Malaysian central bank possesses some short-run control over its monetary policy even under fixed exchange rate regime and an open capital account. These results show that Malaysia is exempted from the impossible trinity in the very short-run. Nonetheless, Malaysia abandoned its US dollar exchange rate peg on 20 July 2005 to move back to managed floating so as to increase its monetary policy independence. One implication of the Malaysian monetary policy experience is that managed floating with active sterilization may be a viable strategy for emerging market economies to deal with volatile capital flows.","[Lim, EweGhee; Goh, SooKhoon] Univ Sains Malaysia, Ctr Policy Res & Int Studies, George Town 11800, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia,,skgoh@usm.my,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,2,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9925-7,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,16.0,,,,,,144,148,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEW95,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000318459200027,0

The resilience of labour markets is crucial for the poor who rely on labour to reduce risk. We evaluate how the 1998 'flood of the century' affected wages in Bangladesh. We find short-term declines in agricultural and non-agricultural wages. Agricultural workers who moved towards non-agricultural employment to cope benefitted through a lower percentage reduction in short-term wages. Endowed with human capital, salaried workers were unable to mitigate income risk. Extending the eligibility of credit access or relief programmes may preserve local businesses and their employees in the years following a flood.","[Mueller, Valerie] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Dev Strategy & Governance Div, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Quisumbing, Agnes] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Poverty Hlth & Nutr Div, Washington, DC 20006 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Mueller, V (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Dev Strategy & Governance Div, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",v.mueller@cgiar.org,"mahsum, masot/ABC-4546-2020",,,,,,29,33,39,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Attention was drawn to the fact that while some people think that the new economy has been and gone, others believe that there never was any 'new economy'. Of the powerful forces driving change are, technology, globalization, the increasing value of intangible assets and the 'war for talent'. These forces are reshaping the way businesses manage their relationships in varying national, regional and international contexts, with people, and with other corporate entities. Organizations are expected to operate in a more open way and be more accountable. There is also the expectation that the business functions on the basis of an explicit contract with its stakeholders. Amongst other things, the corporation should ideally minimize the negative impact of decision-making on the society and the environment. This paper focuses on the weaknesses facing the global economy in a crisis situation and proposes some potential solutions. Referring to the current economic crisis, emphasis is laid on problems commonly experienced in a global context that is, declining values often resulting in conflicting situations, negatively impacting on bottom-line. Solutions include reinforcing values, nurturing the right attitude in a professional context and managing stakeholder relations by having recourse to compliance programs.","[Napal, Geetanee] Univ Mauritius, Fac Law & Management, Moka, Mauritius",University of Mauritius,"Napal, G (通讯作者)，Univ Mauritius, Fac Law & Management, Moka, Mauritius.",vnapal@uom.ac.mu,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,0,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9084-1,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,11.0,,,,,,297,302,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000392766500057,0

Specifically, we find a positive association between electricity and fertility for urban households, contrasted by a negative relationship for rural households.

In this paper, we focused on the SMEs in emerging markets particularly in Malaysia. By using questionnaires, data was gathered from 100 employees working in SMEs particularly in Selangor, Malaysia. The purpose of this study is to let owners/managers/founders of SMEs better understand the relationships among organizational commitment, leadership, and organizational culture, towards job satisfaction as antecedents of competitive advantage and/or success of SMEs. Employees' attitudes and behaviours are affected by the relationship between them and their employer. This relationship is referred to as organizational commitment. Moreover, leadership and organizational culture considerably have an influence on job satisfaction. Understanding this concept will aid employers to instil strong organizational culture and create solid organizational commitment among their employees and lead effectively so that they would be able to retain their well-experienced and skilful employees. Ultimately job satisfaction plays a very important role in the success of organizations particularly in the context of SMEs in Malaysia. The findings revealed positive relationships among the variables and their importance as determinants of job satisfaction in SMEs, which hopefully could contribute to the extant literature on job satisfaction and competitive advantage from the perspective of this country in Asia.","[Rashid, Zafiah] Univ Tun Abdul Razak, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",,,safr23@yahoo.com; cristina@uum.edu.my; ruswiati@uum.edu.my; ari.warokka@uum.edu.my; hilman@uum.edu.my; kristychie@yahoo.com,"Warokka, Ari/M-1314-2019; abdullah, haim hilman/AAQ-3549-2020; Warokka, Ari Ari/P-5066-2016","Warokka, Ari/0000-0003-2332-4780; Warokka, Ari Ari/0000-0003-2332-4780; , Haim Hilman/0000-0002-6265-9308",,,,,43,0,0,0,12,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-6-9,,,,2011,,,,,,,1950,1962,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEO28,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000317550001081,0

The paper is focused on position and relationship between farmers and wholesalers within the pork agri-food chain in the Czech Republic and the nature of its price transmission. Moreover, the analysis discusses the impact of the time series frequency based on example of the price transmission between farm-gate price and wholesale price in pork agri-food chain in the Czech Republic. The analysis is based on monthly and bi-weekly data of farm-gate price and wholesale price in period from July 2002 to October 2010, provided by Ministry of Agriculture and State Agricultural Intervention Fund. The time series of monthly data contain 100 observations while the time series of bi-weekly data contain 200 observations. The main hypothesis was defined and verified subsequently using the selected methodological tools. The Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), an econometric model suitable for application of multivariate time series analysis, is employed to describe and explain vertical price transmission in selected agri-food chain. The analysis shows the similarities and differences in outputs of empirical analysis based on the time series containing data of different frequency. Finally, the author suggests some advices and precautions to avoid bias conclusions concerning the selected topic. The aim of the paper is to demonstrate risks of data for the time series analysis. The researcher should be very careful when selects the time series for empirical analysis.","Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Sobrová, L (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",sobrova@pef.czu.cz,"Rumankova, Lenka/H-4357-2018","Rumankova, Lenka/0000-0003-0734-6883",,,,,17,0,0,0,6,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-2196-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,159,168,,,,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000338036100016,0

On the other hand, developing countries still lag behind in meeting the same health-related goals, yet they continue to report successful stories of mobile technology growth and adoption but no major usage of the same to deliver healthcare. This research sought to explore existing mHealth applications to establish their suitability for use in developing countries such as Kenya to provide home-based care. This was done by a survey of existing literature and mHealth models, and an architecture developed in light of local communication infrastructure and local mobile phone abilities. It was established that for developing countries to take advantage of this leapfrogging technology in health, they would have to take advantage of the Short Message Service (SMS) that is cheap and accessible to all.

Instead of assuming that performance differences are exogenous, this article focuses on two endogenous strategies-innovation and global engagement-and interprets them as two ways to accumulate knowledge and improve firms' capabilities. We are particularly interested in analyzing interactions between these strategies and their effect on firms' performance. By using a firm-level panel dataset drawn from a Japanese large-scale administrative survey for the years 1994-2003, we first find that innovation and exporting strategies are characterized by complementarities, which define coherent productive models or patterns of learning. Second, we show that these different strategies lead to various performances in terms of productivity and survival. Third, by using a propensity score-matching approach, we show that these differences in performance are lasting. Overall, our article shows that the interaction of innovation and export investments is a source of permanent differences in performance among firms.","[Ito, Keiko] Senshu Univ, Fac Econ, Tama Ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 2348500, Japan; [Lechevalier, Sebastien] Ecole Hautes Etud Sci Sociales, Paris, France",,"Ito, K (通讯作者)，Senshu Univ, Fac Econ, Tama Ku, 2-1-1 Higashimita, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 2348500, Japan.",keiko-i@isc.senshu-u.ac.jp; sebastien.lechevalier@ehess.fr,"Ito, Keiko/AAA-6255-2019","Ito, Keiko/0000-0002-2162-2517",,,,,39,39,39,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Is the United States increasingly importing goods whose production generates relatively more pollution, rather than manufacturing those goods domestically? The consensus seems to be yes, at least judging by the many public policies designed to counteract this offshoring of pollution. The evidence, however, is mixed, at least in part because empirical research has focused on a slightly different set of questions. After reviewing this research, I present a simple methodology for answering the specific question asked in the title. Using the World Bank's 1987 inventory of industry-specific U.S. air pollution emissions intensities, Bureau of Economic Analysis input-output tables, and data on U.S. imports, I show that from 1972 to 2001 the composition of U.S. imports shifted toward relatively clean goods, rather than polluting goods. Perhaps more surprising, this green shift of U.S. imports is even larger than the corresponding green shift of U.S. domestic manufacturing. Based on this analysis, the article concludes that over the past thirty years, the United States does not appear to have been offshoring pollution by importing polluting goods.","[Levinson, Arik] Georgetown Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Levinson, Arik] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Georgetown University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Levinson, A (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",aml6@georgetown.edu,,,,,,,31,75,79,2,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1750-6816,,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

We examine these issues for a closed economy focusing on how the co-existence between these two sectors affects sustainable development and the well-being of the poor, i.e., the harvesters.

We first characterize the balanced growth paths of a benchmark model without maintenance. Then we introduce maintenance activity via the depreciation rate of capital. We characterize the optimal allocation of labor across the three activities. Although maintenance deepens the technological gap by diverting labor resources from adoption, we show that it generally increases the long run output level. Moreover, we find that equilibrium maintenance and adoption efforts respond in opposite directions to policy or technology shocks.

We analyze investor behavior and mechanism performance in these auctioned IPOs using detailed bidding data. The existence of some bids posted at high prices suggests that some investors (mostly retail) try to free-ride on the mechanism. But institutional demand in these auctions is very elastic, suggesting that institutional investors reveal information in the bidding process. Investor participation is largely predictable based on deal size, and demand is dominated by institutions. Flipping is at most as prevalent in auctions as in bookbuilt deals. But, unlike in bookbuilding, investors in auctions do not flip their shares more in hot deals. Finally, we find that institutional investors, who provide more information, are rewarded by obtaining a larger share of the deals that have higher 10-day underpricing. Our results therefore suggest that auctioned IPOs can be an effective alternative to traditional bookbuilding. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We call this effect accelerated investment. It stems from a potential loss of investment option in the event of default. The possibility of default reduces the value of the option to wait and provides equity holders with an incentive to speed up investment. As a result, in the absence of wealth expropriation by a levered firm's debt holders, its shareholders exercise their investment option earlier than the shareholders of an otherwise identical all-equity firm. This result is at odds with the generally accepted intuition that in the absence of potential wealth transfers and taxes the shareholders of a levered firm would follow the same investment policy as that of an unlevered firm. In addition to providing various illustrations of the accelerated investment effect, we relate its magnitude to the presence of competition for investment opportunities. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This study explores the spatial distribution of demand by comparing two main classes of variables: those without a displacement component such as population in a census block group, and those that imply a vector or directionality such as vehicle kilometers traveled. The spatial distribution of these variables is compared to the spatial distribution of demand for gasoline using regression. Many models examining the transition from gasoline to an alternative fuel assume a demand pattern for fuel a priori in order to estimate potential demand at a future alternative fuel station. This paper studies not the models themselves but the variables used to predict demand. The results indicate that vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) is the best variable to pinpoint where demand for fuel will occur. However, travel to the central business district of the metropolitan area does not appear to translate into demand for fuel in proportion to the VKT. While gasoline demand does appear to vary with population as well, the location of demand is much less specific than that predicted by VKT. The results also suggest that the route between home and the nearest freeway entrance may help predict a large portion of refueling and merits further investigation. This possible tendency can be used to create a new variable called population-traffic which appears to describe the spatial distribution of demand well. The good performance of this independent variable in regressions suggests that stations sited along the freeway may serve customers needs and provide the necessary concentration of demand for initial alternative fuel stations. A practical application of this work would be to help define refueling demand patterns in a rollout of alternative fueled vehicles in a neighborhood or town.

A sub-area of neuroeconomics that investigates marketing-relevant problems is called neuromarketing or consumer neuroscience. On the basis of 10 theses, this article discusses the status quo, the future development and essential challenges of these research branches. The central challenge for neuroeconomics and consumer neuroscience is to further expand and validate the obtained results as well as to implement an increasingly deductive focus that allows for negating, modifying, or extending existing economic theories. Recent neuroeconomic findings indicate that the boundaries between psychological and physiological categories are arbitrary, and that a redefinition of the concept of emotion is necessary. Additionally, the article emphasizes that the success of the new research areas is dependent upon the consideration of methodological problems, and the effective translation of findings into corporate practice, and into the neurophysiological descriptions of classical theories and constructs. By facing these challenges of the future, neuroeconomics and consumer neuroscience will become an integrated and accepted branch of economic and consumer research. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We conduct the three-stage least squares (3SLS) procedure to estimate a simultaneous equations model. The key finding is that undercapitalized insurers increase capital to avoid regulatory costs and take more risks to generate higher returns. We also investigate firm characteristics that determine the insurer's capital structure. The results indicate that insurers appear to rely heavily on retained earnings to make up their capital shortage and insurers with greater growth opportunity may hold high levels of capital to control for agency problems. Robustness tests with an alternative risk measure and subsamples present consistent results. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The pre-reserve population is assumed to follow the logistic growth law and two post-reserve growth models are discussed to explore the importance of model assumptions for assessment of reserves. The post-reserve growth has either a common carrying capacity as in the pre-reserve case, or each sub-population has its own carrying capacity proportionate to its distribution area. A combined model, as a continuum of the two models, is also formulated and briefly discussed. Population protection against extinction is assured against low cost harvesting, including zero cost, when relative reserve size is greater than relative migration. Reserve size may be tuned to realize MSY in one model, but not in the other. Economic yield is generally greater in the former, but maximum EY cannot be realized in any one.","[Flaaten, Ola] Univ Tromso, Dept Econ & Management, Norwegian Coll Fishery Sci, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Mjolhus, Einar] Univ Tromso, Dept Math & Stat, N-9037 Tromso, Norway",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Flaaten, O (通讯作者)，Univ Tromso, Dept Econ & Management, Norwegian Coll Fishery Sci, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",olaf@nfh.uit.no; einarm@math.uit.no,,,,,,,44,15,16,4,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We define related securities as stocks from the same country, the same region, or other foreign stocks. We find strong evidence that a higher prominence of related stocks in the specialist portfolio is associated with a higher U.S. share in price discovery of our sample firms. We interpret our findings as evidence that concentrating market makers in similar stocks reduces information asymmetries and improves the information environment as market makers can extract information relevant to a stock from order flow to related securities. To support our argument, we show that the adverse selection component of the bid-ask spread is negatively related to the prominence of other foreign stocks in the specialist portfolio.

The ability to diversify livelihoods depends on asset portfolios and the economic shocks that rural households face. The main objective of this paper is to improve understanding of rural livelihood challenges in south-east Zimbabwe and how households in this area diversify livelihoods to cope with these challenges. A cluster analysis of 200 households surveyed in 2008 in the Chiredzi district identified five distinct livelihood strategies: (1) subsistence smallholders/unskilled workers; (2) subsistence smallholders/nontimber forestry products (NTFPs) harvesters; (3) crop production and NTFPs extraction integrators; (4) commercial smallholders with regular off-farm employment; and (5) specialised commercial livestock producers. Multinomial logit model results showed that the level of education of the household head, value of physical assets, cattle numbers and income, remittances, NTFP income and economic shocks were the main determinants of these livelihood choices. There is also some evidence that those households that were statistically significantly affected by HIV/AIDS shock practised distress-push diversification by harvesting NTFPs. These results suggest that policymakers need to advise rural households on how to improve their risk management capacities, and move from geographically untargeted investments in livelihood assets to a more integrated approach adapted to the asset bases of individual households.","[Mutenje, M.

We find evidence that the capital structures of smaller companies respond more heavily to changes in the tax benefit of debt. Additional analysis confirms that, in particular, variation in capital income tax rates at the shareholder level implicates significant capital structure adjustments.

S. counties. Those counties that experienced a large increase in household leverage from 2002 to 2006 showed a sharp relative decline in durable consumption starting in the third quarter of 2006-a full year before the official beginning of the recession in the fourth quarter of 2007. Similarly, counties with the highest reliance on credit card borrowing reduced durable consumption by significantly more following the financial crisis of the fall of 2008. Overall, the statistical model shows that household leverage growth and dependence on credit card borrowing as of 2006 explain a large fraction of the overall consumer default, house price, unemployment, residential investment, and durable consumption patterns during the recession. The findings suggest that a focus on household finance may help elucidate the sources of macroeconomic fluctuations.

A theoretical framework compares this method, also known as the life-satisfaction approach, with the standard hedonic pricing approach, identifying their similarities and differences. As a corollary, we show how SWB data can be used to test for the equilibrium condition implicit in the hedonic approach (i.e., equality of utility across locations). Results for Ireland show that the equilibrium condition required by the hedonic pricing approach in Irish markets does not hold. They also show that air quality, in the baseline specification, and warmer climate, across all the specifications, have a significant positive impact on SWB.

By making use of insights from Transaction Cost Economics and Resource-based View, the paper helps to understand why and how shipping lines and terminal operating companies enlarge their scope in inter-modal transport and in inland terminals. The paper discusses a number of cases from the Hamburg-Le Havre range, where shipping lines and terminal operating companies have changed their scope of activities in ports and hinterland networks.

I find that incumbents in state legislative elections have a significant advantage, and this advantage serves as a strong barrier to re-entry of challengers who had previously been defeated.

However, outside our discipline, this terminology has been singularly unhelpful. This article argues that there could be a considerable reduction in wasted resources if economists were to change this terminology to something less incendiary, and that this could help to increase the acceptance of benefit-cost analysis as an input to the decision-making process for environmental, health, and safety regulations. I propose that we change our standard unit of measurement and replace the VSL terminology with willingness to swap (WTS) alternative goods and services for a microrisk reduction in the chance of sudden death. Analogous terminology would be used for other types of risks to life and health. I also argue that economists' continual pursuit of a single number for the VSL is misguided and can be misleading, especially if individual WTS is correlated with the magnitudes of the risk changes. Such one-size-fits-all VSLs also hinder our ability to understand the distributional consequences of risk-reducing policies or interventions. Estimates of aggregate risk reduction benefits need to reflect the particular type of risk reduction as well as the characteristics of the affected populations.","Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",University of Oregon,"Cameron, TA (通讯作者)，Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",cameron@uoregon.edu,"Cameron, Trudy Ann/A-2952-2008",,,,,,23,60,66,0,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1750-6816,,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

Sustained increases in obesity, diabetes, and other diseases could reduce life expectancy - with a concomitant decrease in the public sector's annuity burden - but these savings may be offset by worsening functional status which increases health care spending, reduces labor supply, and increases public assistance. Using a health microsimulation model, we quantify the competing public finance consequences of shifting trends in population health for medical care costs, labor supply, earnings, wealth, tax revenues, and government expenditures. We find that the trends in obesity and smoking have different fiscal consequences and that, because of its more profound effects on morbidity and health care expenditures, obesity represents a larger immediate risk from a fiscal perspective.

A difference-in-differences empirical strategy reveals that substitution to bank debt and alternative sources of capital (e.g., equity, cash balances, and trade credit) was limited, leading to an almost one-for-one decline in net investment with the decline in net debt issuances. Despite this sharp change in behavior, corporate leverage ratios remained relatively stable, a result of the contemporaneous decline in debt issuances and investment.

While projections of known reserves indicate sufficient coal for 114 years, air pollution from coal power plants causes serious environmental damage. The production of lignocellulosic biomass for generating bioelectricity seems to be an appropriate option in order to become less dependent on fossil fuels. In this article, the potential for producing this type of biomass was investigated for the Cape Wine lands District Municipality (CWDM). First, the potential area for production in a Short-Rotation Coppice (SRC) system was identified by means of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). After assessing suitable tree species and their productivity rates, an annual supply of about 1.4 million tonnes per year could be expected, using exotic species such as Eucalyptus cladocalyx. Three scenarios were assessed by means of farm modelling. The first scenario describes woody biomass production as a single production activity on fynbos/uncultivated land, not competing with other agricultural activities. In the second scenario, biomass production is introduced as an additional enterprise on a dryland winter-grain farm, typically in the rainfed grain- and livestock-producing Gouda/Hermon farming area. The third scenario describes biomass production in an intensive farming environment. Given the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA) tariff for bioelectricity, it can be concluded that woody biomass production in a short-rotation system, either as a sole-production business or integrated into a farming business with other agricultural activities, can be economically and financially viable. Land values, however, have a large influence on viability.","[von Doderer, C. C. C.; Kleynhans, T.

In addition, a growing body of evidence indicates that P&R may increase the vehicle miles travelled (VMT) of its users. This paper reports on a recent survey of UK local authorities, both with and without current P&R provision, to understand the reasons behind its popularity and the level of recognition of its effectiveness in reducing car use. Particular consideration is given to the relationship between P&R and conventional public transport (particularly bus) services, as the transfer of passengers from these can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of P&R. The potential future growth of P&R is also addressed. The results suggest a number of divergences with the empirical evidence, particularly with regards the traffic effects of P&R. P&R is predicted to grow but there is support for implementing P&R in ways that may increase its effectiveness. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we develop a Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based maintenance model considering pavement and roadside slope stability conditions. A pavement maintenance priority map is prepared based on pavement condition. International Roughness Index (IRI) is used as the pavement condition index. Similarly, a roadside slope maintenance priority map is produced by analyzing slope stability condition. An integrated maintenance priority map is produced by combining both pavement and roadside slope maintenance priority maps with consideration of weighting of each maintenance component. The integrated maintenance priority index developed in the research lies from 1 to 3. and is distributed heterogeneously. Higher index values qualify for higher priority in maintenance planning. Thus, a conventional method of maintenance planning under the constraints of budget, time and resources can be improved by incorporating the actual condition of pavement and roadside slope failure susceptibility, which has the potential to improve significantly the serviceability of the road system. The study shows that GIS, which can manage and visualize different types of data together or separately, can help the decision making process for road maintenance planning in the Himalayan regions.

While considerable research has focused on how immigrants affect local wages and housing prices, less research has asked how immigrants fare in US urban public schools. Previous studies find that foreign-born students outperform native-born students in their elementary and middle school years, but urban policymakers and practitioners continue to raise concerns about educational outcomes of immigrants arriving in their high school years. We use data on a large cohort of New York City (NYC) public high school students to examine how the performance of students who immigrate during high school (teen immigrants) differs from that of students who immigrate during middle school (tween immigrants) or elementary school (child immigrants), relative to otherwise similar native-born students. Contrary to prior studies, our difference-in-difference estimates suggest that, ceteris paribus, teen immigrants do well compared to native-born migrants, and that the foreign-born advantage is relatively large among the teen (im)migrants. That said, our findings provide cause for concern about the performance of limited English proficient students, blacks and Hispanics and, importantly, teen migrants. In particular, switching school districts in the high school years that is, student mobility across school districts - may be more detrimental than immigration per se. Results are robust to alternative specifications and cohorts, including a cohort of Miami students. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

To this end, employing a panel data from 58 provinces, the study first estimates a translog stochastic production function to extract technical efficiency component. Then, it specifies an efficiency model that embodies investment incentives and public investment along with standard variables. Finally the study modifies the efficiency model to examine the existence of a threshold for provincial economic performance above which investment subsidies and/or public investment affect efficiency differently The findings indicate that both public policies positively influence technical efficiency at provincial level and they have the same efficiency impacts on provinces irrespective of their performances, a result that points to the absence of equality/efficiency tradeoff in Turkey","[Cakmak, Hatice Karacay; Erden, Lutfi] Hacettepe Univ, Iktisat Bolumu, Ankara, Turkey",Hacettepe University,"Çakmak, HK (通讯作者)，Hacettepe Univ, Iktisat Bolumu, Ankara, Turkey.",hatice@hacettepe.edu.tr; lerden@hacettepe.edu.trAr,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,8,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

The decision to introduce direct incentives was pivotal, generating anxiety at both the federal and provincial levels. However, the evolution of a series of additional policy tools, each holding tangible value, proved just as important. These included waiving Auto Pact liabilities, the introduction of targeted duty remission plans, adjustments to Voluntary Export Restraints, and manipulations of the Foreign Investment Review Agency. These elements were under the management of Canada's federal government, making it a far more active participant in automotive foreign direct investment (FDI) attraction than its US equivalent. While some observers believe that the approach that public policy-makers brought to automotive FDI attraction during the period this article explores might hold lessons for present day practitioners, the reality is that the evolution of global governance structures precludes access to many of the tools that were deployed with such effect in the 1980s.

Higher investment raises the firm's survival probability, which in turn reduces tax-evasion payoffs, since evaded taxes may also be detected and penalized later on. At the same time, tax evasion in future periods increases future expected profits, making higher investment desirable. Consequently, tax evasion distorts investment, while the latter determines firm activity. Investment in the event of tax evasion may be higher or lower, depending on parameters of tax enforcement.","[Friehe, Tim] Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, D-78457 Constance, Germany",University of Konstanz,"Friehe, T (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, Box 136, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",tim.friehe@uni-konstanz.de,"Friehe, Tim/ABF-4676-2020","Friehe, Tim/0000-0002-9390-3537",,,,,25,6,6,3,23,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,MAR,2010,66.0,1,,,,,1,14,,10.1628/001522110X503352,0.0,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,603KU,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000278208300002,0

The external representation of Eurozone has not yet reached its equilibrium point, and the relative economic weight of the area is bound to diminish in future years but this has not prevented the euro from gaining a prominent role on international financial markets. The euro has risen mainly as a reserve of value and as a regional currency but it has not become a competitor to the US dollar as a vehicle currency. Its development potential is still large, in particular if the markets for euro-denominated government securities were to be unified. A possible scenario would be the advent of a multi-centered system with several key currencies, including the dollar, the euro, and possibly the yen and the renminbi. The international monetary system would thus follow the rebalancing of economic power and this would solve the Triffin paradox, which threatens today the dominance of the dollar. The consequences for the exchange rate of the euro would be unclear, the link between the international status of a currency and its exchange rate being ambiguous. At most could the Europeans hope in such an environment that the exchange rate of the euro would better cushion the economic shocks faced by the Eurozone, which it has not really done so far.","[Coeure, Benoit] Ecole Polytech, F-91128 Palaiseau, France",Institut Polytechnique de Paris,,,,"Benassy-Quere, Agnes/0000-0003-4898-3694",,,,,29,2,2,0,14,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Using a sample of four Australian stocks cross-listed in New Zealand and five New Zealand stocks cross-listed in Australia for the period January 2002 to December 2007, we assess Hasbrouck (1995) information shares and Grammig et al. (2005) conditional information shares over time. We observe that in both cases the home market is dominant in terms of price discovery. However, when studying price discovery over time, we find that the importance of the Australian market (the larger of the two markets) is increasing for both Australian and New Zealand domiciled firms. Finally, using panel regression analysis, we find that the growth in the importance of the Australian market is positively related to the growth in the size of the firm and negatively related to the size of the percentage spread in the Australian market, implying that as firms grow larger and their cost of trading in Australia declines, the Australian market becomes more informative.

To address this limitation, the practitioners increasingly make use of contingent behavior (CB) data; i.e., asking survey respondents to forecast their trip patterns under hypothetical quality conditions. However, relatively little is known as to whether these stated responses are consistent with how households response to actual quality variation. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the convergent validity of CB data with observed trip patterns. Toward this end, we jointly model recreational lake usage in Iowa using observed and CB trip data collected from the 2004 Iowa Lake Survey. The Iowa lakes Survey collected three sets of trip data for 131 lakes in the state: (a) actual trips in 2004, (b) anticipated trips in 2005 to the same lakes given current lake conditions and (c) anticipated trips in 2005 given hypothetical improvements to a subset of the lakes. The three types of recreation demand data provide a unique opportunity to investigate the convergent validity of individual responses to actual versus hypothetical environmental conditions.","[Herriges, Joseph A.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Jeon, Yongsik] Samsung Res Inst Finance, Seoul, South Korea",Iowa State University; Samsung,"Herriges, JA (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, 260 Heady Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",jaherrig@iastate.edu,,,,,,,18,22,31,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Similar to, but separate from, the relation for creditor rights, greater political rights are associated with lower yield spreads. A one standard deviation increase in political rights is associated with an 18.6% decline in bond spreads. We find evidence that political and legal institutions are substitutes; marginal improvements in political rights produce greater reductions in the cost of debt for firms from countries with weaker creditor rights. We examine potential factors through which political rights may affect the cost of debt and find that greater freedom of the press provides an important channel for reducing bond risks. Moreover, debt of firms with cross-listed equity trades at a premium in U.S. markets, but this relation appears to be more consistent with improved visibility than with bonding effects.

Each selected recipient observes if the intermediary under-delivers to them, so they serve as natural monitors. These recipients may, however, withhold complaints to 'thank' the intermediary for selecting them. Furthermore, the intermediary may distort selection (for example, by picking richer recipients who feel less entitled) to reduce complaints. We design an experimental game representing the donor's problem. We compare two institutions. In one treatment the intermediary selects recipients. In the other selection is random-as by an uninformed donor. In our data random selection dominates delegation of the selection task to the intermediary. Selection distortions are similar but intermediaries divert more when they have selection power (correctly anticipating that gratitude for selection will reduce complaints).

This paper shows that if the compromising optimal policy between these two extreme examples is nonbinding, it becomes time-inconsistent. And, parametric reforms tend to be biased in favor of contemporaneous generations, unfair in terms of generational justice, and inefficient in terms of the optimal level of consumption.","St Marys Univ, Dept Econ, Sobey Sch Business, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada",Saint Marys University - Canada,"Aydede, Y (通讯作者)，St Marys Univ, Dept Econ, Sobey Sch Business, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada.",yigit.aydede@smu.ca,,,,,,,13,3,3,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1748-7870,,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

The counterargument is based on game-theoretical model developed in Bowles 2004. The inevitable incompleteness of contracts results in allocation inefficiency: agents with above average wealth endowment are able to finance larger projects, and/or projects of worse than average quality, while agents with insufficient initial wealth endowment are excluded from the financial market. This inefficiency can be attenuated only by redistribution enforced by the government.

Thus, we would expect the law of one price to hold and price adjustments to occur simultaneously. However, significant price differences can be observed which are often caused by sales. As price promotions are not related to supply or demand changes, they might bias measures of price synchronization. As dairy products are a key category that is often used in sales, we study the impact of price promotions on measures of price synchronization using dairy product prices in the German food retail market. Our results show with a very few exceptions that price promotions significantly bias the measures of price synchronization within and between stores. Over all stores and products 25% of regular prices are synchronized but only 10% of promotional prices occur simultaneously. Discounters synchronize regular price changes to a greater extent and promotional prices to a lesser extent. The level of price synchronization between stores indicates a positive correlation with the number of competitors and with the level of menu costs. Price synchronization is lower for perishable compared to durable products. Also, some store and chain effects are observed. Within stores, regular price changes of substituting brands are highly synchronized whereas price promotions are staggered within the same category.","[Hoffmann, Angela] Univ Kiel, Inst Agrarokon, D-24118 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Hoffmann, A (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Inst Agrarokon, Olshaussenstr 40, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",ahoffma@ae.uni-kiel.de,"Loy, Jens-Peter/JKJ-3029-2023",,,,,,51,2,2,1,14,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

In the case of Romania, the switch to IAS/IFRS was an important cultural paradigm shift, as it meant substituting a vigorous patrimonialist accounting culture, with a new one, based on opposite values. In this context, the purpose of this paper is to discuss the extent to which the Romanian patrimonialist tradition has been able to endure within the local accounting culture, in spite of the decision to adopt the IFRS taken in the upper reaches of the financial reporting standardization process. To meet this objective the paper reviews the major sources expected to emanate the new accounting philosophy in Romania, that is, accounting regulations and accounting literature, especially the text books used in teaching financial reporting. The results show that there is a strong local dimension of the accounting culture that is resilient to changes induced by the internalization of accounting.","[Ionascu, Ion; Ionascu, Mihaela; Sacarin, Marian; Minu, Mihaela] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,ionascui@cig.ase.ro,"MIHAELA, IONASCU/GWQ-5043-2022",,,,,,41,0,0,0,7,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",,,978-606-505-347-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,194,209,,,,,,16,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BSE06,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284258100013,0

Improved management accounting information can only come through a participation of managers to management control.

Intra-industry trade is separated into horizontal and vertical components on the basis of differences in unit values. We have found that although inter-industry trade still accounts for almost 50% of the trade of the countries that joined the EU in 2004, its share has been declining to the benefit of intra-industry trade (except for Malta). Intra-industry trade accelerated in the post-accession period and in 2007 Slovenia and the Czech Republic recorded the highest shares. Intra-industry trade of the new Member States has been dominated by the vertical component, usually low-quality goods. However, in almost all new Member States, the share of high-quality vertical intra-industry trade, as well as the horizontal component increased. Thus, the pattern of trade specialization in the new Member States has improved. Growing shares of intra-industry trade, particularly the horizontal component, reflect increasing similarities between new and old Member States and a favourable convergence process between the two groups of countries. In the automotive sector, intra-industry trade is generally larger than in total trade, meaning deeper specialization. This phenomenon can be largely attributed to the high volume of foreign direct investment in the sector.","[Kawecka-Wyrzykowska, Elzbieta] Warsaw Sch Econ, Jean Monnet Chair European Integrat, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,,ekawec@sgh.waw.pl,,"Kawecka-Wyrzykowska, Elzbieta/0000-0002-6655-874X",,,,,28,3,3,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-3-642-12515-7,,,,2010,,,,,,,11,31,,10.1007/978-3-642-12516-4_2,0.0,,,21,Economics; International Relations,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BUC56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288879000002,0

Its size can be crucial for an approval (or disapproval) of the project under evaluation, therefore it is important to have a theoretically founded estimate of the discount rate. There are two main approaches to estimating the social rate of discount. The first one is a so called social time preference rate (STPR), which is composed of three components: pure time preference, mortality rate and a component reflecting secular growth of per capita consumption and wealth. We agree with other authors that although pure time preference is not in reality zero for individuals due to myopia and irrationality, it should be equal to zero from the point of view of the public sector. We have also shown why it is inconsistent to use mortality rate directly as a component of the STPR and why a somewhat lower rate should be used instead. These two components together with an estimate of gradually decreasing growth of per capita consumption give a gradually decreasing STPR for the Czech Republic starting at 5.4 % and converging in 40 years' period to 2.8 % per year.

In this paper we utilise a unique set of survey data set from nearly 2450 randomly selected villages describing China's recent progress in village governance reforms and its relationship to the provision of public goods in rural China between 1998 and 2004. Two sets of questions are investigated using an empirical framework based on a theoretical model in which local governments must decide to allocate fiscal resources between public goods investments and other expenditures. The empirical analysis-both in the descriptive and econometric analyses-suggests that when the village leader is elected directly, ceteris paribus, the provision of public goods rises (compared to when the leader is not elected directly by villagers). Thus, in this way it is possible to conclude that democratisation-at least at the village level in rural China-appears to increase the quantity of public goods investment. Second, we seek to understand the mechanism that is driving the results. Also based on the survey data, we find that when village leaders (who had been directly elected) were able to implement more public projects during their terms of office, they, as the incumbent, were more likely to be re-elected. In this way, we argue that the link between elections and investment may be a rural China version of pork barrel politics.","[Luo, Renfu; Zhang, Linxiu; Huang, Jikun] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, IGSNRR, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Shorenstein Asia Pacific Res Ctr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Chinese Academy of Sciences; Stanford University,"Zhang, LX (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, IGSNRR, 11A,Anwai Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",lxzhang.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Zhang, Lin/HZH-4842-2023; ZHANG, LIN/GYD-9123-2022",,,,,,44,38,41,0,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,,,J DEV STUD,J.

The paper departs from the premise that with more than a billion people living in absolute poverty, it is of great practical importance to understand if and when entrepreneurship is a binding constraint on economic development and catching up in developing countries. This in turn requires at least a deeper theoretical modeling of the entrepreneur in development economics. This special edition contains a number of contributions emanating from the UNU-WIDER project on Promoting Entrepreneurial Capacity, which integrates the disciplines of entrepreneurship and development economics. These contributions model and explore the role of the entrepreneur in key areas of concern for development economics, such as structural change and economic growth, income and wealth inequalities, welfare, poverty traps, and market failures. This introduction discusses and contextualizes these various contributions and their implications for further theoretical and empirical work.","United Nations Univ, World Inst Dev Econ Res, Helsinki, Finland",,"Naudé, W (通讯作者)，United Nations Univ, World Inst Dev Econ Res, Katajanokanlaituri 6B, Helsinki, Finland.",wim@wider.unu.edu,"Naudé, Wim/E-3812-2017","Naudé, Wim/0000-0003-2496-6945",,,,,33,231,273,4,81,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Its two objectives are firstly, to examine the migrant workers' residential conditions, their residential satisfaction level and their current residence type in Shenzhen; and secondly, to explore whether factors, like trades which the migrant workers are engaged in and their marital status, have any impacts on the residential satisfaction.

The framework is used as a basis for a longitudinal case study to understand the process of management accounting change. It reveals that the extranet, specifically through its reporting facilities, is a very important tool that facilitated changes in information availability and business process redesign. It provides the accountants with accurate and timely information about sales, cash collection and inventory levels which assisted the company to change its sales from consignment basis to a just-in-time basis. Our findings confirm that management accounting practices have changed in the case under study and show how management accountants have become more involved in the day-to-day running of the business.

The potential value is remarkable. While, the tailings piled up on the earth's surface will cause a series of environmental impact including air pollution, land degradation, vegetation deterioration, geological disasters, etc. On the base of the concept of tailings recycling and low-carbon mining industry, this paper discusses the necessity of the tailings recycling management and the methods of tailings recycling.

Following the literature on structural vector autoregressive models (SVARs), I use long-run restrictions to identify three structural shocks: demand, supply, and portfolio shocks. For some countries, portfolio shocks are important factors behind real stock returns. Furthermore, these shocks seem to be important in explaining cross-country co-movement patterns. However, these findings are not statistically strong due to the degree of uncertainty about the estimates of the importance of each structural shock and the cross-correlation coefficients. Therefore, macroeconomic shocks (supply and demand) cannot be neglected in accounting for the dynamics of real stock returns. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Headline inflation, itself is subject to different shocks and contains noise due to the heterogeneity inherit in it. Therefore, core inflation measures, which are better capable of indicating the general trend, are developed. Atuk and Ozmen (2009) introduced and discussed various core inflation measures for Turkey. Among various core inflation measures discussed, trimmed mean inflation -TRIM- performs relatively better However this measure fails to distinguish signal and noise when dealing with the seasonal items. To overcome this drawback, this paper introduces a new core inflation measure SATRIM-seasonally adjusted trimmed mean inflation. This methodology first seasonally adjusts disaggregated price series and uses seasonally adjusted monthly figures in the trimming process. Overall, SA TRIM outperforms TRIM measure on the basis of trend tracking ability in different time spans. Moreover, SATRIM, which is dynamic in nature, is also more careful when dealing with seasonal items, removing only the non-seasonal extreme changes.","[Atuk, Oguz; Ozmen, Mustafa Utku] Cent Bank Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Ankara, Turkey",Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey; Prime Ministry Turkey,"Atuk, O (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Ankara, Turkey.",oguz.atuk@tcmb.gov.tr; utku.ozmen@tcmb.gov.tr,,,,,,,19,4,4,0,5,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

This still leaves open the possibility of return distribution asymmetry via coskewness with the benchmark portfolio. A simulation study shows that the new tests have very good power relative to that of many commonly used tests.

This lime span is one during which parental leave legislation expanded at both the state and federal level.

Our main finding is that leave expansions are associated with increased leave-taking by both mothers and fathers.

We then suggest that evolutionary psychology can illuminate certain cognitive constraints and biases to which human actors are subject in their attempt to seek the most efficient means to achieve their ultimate goal of reproductive success. We illustrate the utility of an evolutionary psychological perspective on social capital with its application to some empirical puzzles: Why women have more kin in their personal relationships than men do, and why we are closer to our maternal grandmothers than to our paternal grandfathers.

The model matches the equity risk premium, risk-free rate, and volatilities. From the intratemporal first-order condition, one can substitute out basic good consumption and the habit level, yielding a stochastic discount factor driven by two observable risk factors: luxury good consumption and the relative price of the two goods. I estimate these processes and find them to be heteroskedastic, implying time variation in the conditional volatility of the stochastic discount factor. These dynamics occur both at the business cycle frequency and at a lower, generational frequency. The findings reveal that the time variation in aggregate stock market and Treasury bond risk premiums are consistent with the predictions of the model.","[Lochstoer, Lars A.] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Lochstoer, Lars A.] London Business Sch, London, England",Columbia University; University of London; London Business School,"Lochstoer, LA (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Uris Hall 405B,3022 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA.",LL2609@columbia.edu,,,,,,,41,8,12,1,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

I next exploit the segregation of firms to examine the effect of affirmative action on the success of minority-owned firms. Following the significant curtailment of affirmative action in California due to a direct statewide ballot initiative, the number of highway construction establishments located in zip codes with the highest concentrations of black and Asian residents fell relative to the rest of the state, even conditional on the number of non-construction establishments.

The present study is an attempt, despite limited availability of studies in the relevant literature and scant data relating to the sector of services, to clarify the issue by a VEC model. Relative price movements were explained by economic factors including inter-sectoral productivity differences, transmission from exchange rate, exposure to global competition and higher income elasticity of services sector Our empirical study concluded that there is a long-term relationship between relative price series and economic factors recognized in literature. It was found that exchange rate and differences in productivity levels have significant share in accounting for relative price movements.","[Kalafatcilar, Koray] Cent Bank Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey; [Ozcan, Kivilcim Metin] Bilkent Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06800 Bilkent, Turkey",Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey; Prime Ministry Turkey; Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Kalafatcilar, K (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey.",kivilcim@bilkent.edu.tr; koray.kalafatcilar@tcmb.gov.tr,"metin ozcan, Kıvılcım/GSM-9356-2022","metin ozcan, Kıvılcım/0000-0002-9310-3492",,,,,40,2,2,0,10,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

When given a hypothetical choice between cash and non-cash incentives, participants chose the cash incentive (joint evaluation, JE). However when asked to evaluate them separately (separate evaluation, SE), participants gave higher ratings to the non-cash incentive; these findings were replicated with real monetary incentives. Preference reversals were partially dictated by the type of non-cash incentive offered: they were observed for hedonic non-cash incentives but not for utilitarian non-cash incentives. Preference reversals were caused by two factors: a shift in the dominant attribute under consideration and the presence of a value-seeking attribute that provides information about the rational choice. Specifically, participants consider the affective characteristics of the incentives during SE and the fungibility of the incentives during JE. Additionally, employees receiving rewards from an incentive program reported that recipients of non-cash awards would enjoy their reward more and would be more likely to tell their friends about it.

Corsetti, Martin, and Pesenti (2007), henceforth CMPs analytically show that a static two-country model with endogenous firm entry can generate improvement of the terms of trade in response to a positive technology shock in the form of lowering the entry cost. This paper evaluates the robustness of the results in CMP in a model with richer and more realistic dynamics such as nominal price and wage stickiness as in the Global Economy Model. It shows how the economic variables respond to the shocks that shift the production frontier outward, namely, productivity gains in manufacturing and efficiency gains in creating new firms. The main conclusions are that short-run responses could be different from those in CMP because of the existence of real as well as nominal rigidities, and that the persistence of shocks also alters the direction of responses via the wealth effect. These results suggest that it is of great importance for policy institutions to acknowledge the dynamic aspects of productivity spillovers by simulating a model with richer dynamics.

Unlike existing literature, unemployed individuals can secretly participate in a hidden labor market. This extension modifies the standard problem in three dimensions. First, it imposes an endogenous lower bound for the lifetime utility that a contract can deliver. Second, it breaks the identity between unemployment payments and consumption. And third, it hardens the encouragement of search effort. The optimal unemployment insurance system in an economy with a hidden labor market is simple, with an initial phase in which payments are relatively flat during unemployment and with no payments for long-term unemployed individuals. This scheme differs substantially from the one prescribed without a hidden labor market and resembles unemployment protection programs in many countries. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The discrete tick size alone introduces enough noise to make model comparisons difficult, especially for lower-priced stocks. We demonstrate that microstructural noise can lead to incorrect inferences in the univariate diffusion test of Bakshi et al. (Rev Financ Stud 13: 549-584, 2000), the transition density diffusion test of Ait-Sahalia (J Financ 57:2075-2112, 2002), and the speed-of-convergence test of Carr and Wu (J Financ 58:2581-2610, 2003). We also show that microstructural noise induces a bias into the implied risk-neutral moment estimators of Bakshi et al. (Rev Financ Stud 16:101-143, 2003). Even in active, liquid option markets, observation error is likely to reduce significantly the power of tests, and in some cases represents an important source of bias.","[Dennis, Patrick] Univ Virginia, McIntire Sch Commerce, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Mayhew, Stewart] US Secur & Exchange Commiss, Off Econ Anal, Washington, DC 20549 USA",University of Virginia; U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC),"Dennis, P (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, McIntire Sch Commerce, POB 400173, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",pjd9v@virginia.edu; mayhews@sec.gov,,,,,,,28,19,20,2,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

This article generalizes the model for application to a wider class of trade-offs, including municipal utilities that are not legally permitted to make a profit. Extending Peltzman's idea of political support functions, this article defines political feasibility relative to economic efficiency. A Pareto superior change with compensation is sufficient but not necessary for political feasibility; the Kaldor-Hicks criterion is neither necessary nor sufficient for political feasibility. The generalization of Peltzman's model of public choice and the concept of political feasibility together explain why Tucson in 1976 and Los Angeles in 1993 adopted efficient water rates during droughts and why, 1 yr later, Tucson rescinded the rates and Los Angeles almost rescinded them. The concept of political feasibility explains why and how, after the drought, the Los Angeles innovations to rate design achieved efficiency and political feasibility, avoiding reversion to the previous, inefficient rates, by separating economic efficiency from political feasibility in both the rate design and the rate reform process.

Issuance predictability has greater statistical significance than either size or momentum, and is similar to book-to-market. As in the U.S., the international issuance effect is robust across both small and large firms. Unlike the U.S., the effect is driven more by low returns after share creation rather than positive returns following share repurchases. Issuance return predictability is stronger in countries with greater issuance activity, greater stock market development, and stronger investor protection. The results suggest that the share issuance effect is related to the ease with which firms can issue and repurchase their shares. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This research examines whether teacher licensure test scores and other teacher attributes affect elementary student achievement. The results are based on longitudinal student-level data from Los Angeles. California requires three types of teacher licensure tests as part of the teacher certification process; a general knowledge test, a subject area test (single subject for secondary teachers and multiple subject for elementary teachers), and a reading pedagogy test for elementary school teachers. The student achievement analysis uses a value-added approach that adjusts for both student and teacher fixed effects. The results show large differences in teacher quality across the school district, but measured teacher characteristics explain little of the difference. Teacher licensure test scores are unrelated to teacher success in the classroom. Similarly, student achievement is unaffected by whether classroom teachers have advanced degrees. Student achievement increases with teacher experience, but the linkage is weak and largely reflects poor outcomes for teachers during their first year or two in the classroom. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Home production of meals requires the combination of food and time inputs.

We also present some caveats to previous simulation results on aggregate welfare that are related to the importance of the elasticity of substitution between food and time in the household production of meals.","[Ferri, Javier] Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Valencia 46022, Spain",University of Valencia,"Ferri, J (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Ave Naranjos SN, Valencia 46022, Spain.",francisco.ferri@uv.es,"Ferri, Javier/L-2024-2014","Ferri, Javier/0000-0001-7722-9186",,,,,22,2,2,0,8,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,SEP,2009,65.0,3,,,,,313,334,,10.1628/001522109X477796,0.0,,,22,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,529FK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272501200003,0

In the literature, the preferred choice of estimator is usually maximum likelihood (ML). ML has strong asymptotic justification but is not necessarily the best method in finite samples. This paper proposes a simulation-based method. When it is used in connection with ML, it can improve the finite-sample performance of the ML estimator while maintaining its good asymptotic properties. The method is implemented and evaluated here in the Black-Scholes option pricing model and in the Vasicek bond and bond option pricing model. It is especially favored when the bias in ML is large due to strong persistence in the data or strong nonlinearity in pricing functions. Monte Carlo studies show that the proposed procedures achieve bias reductions over ML estimation in pricing contingent claims when ML is biased. The bias reductions are sometimes accompanied by reductions in variance. Empirical applications to U.S. Treasury bills highlight the differences between the bond prices implied by the simulation-based approach and those delivered by ML. Some consequences for the statistical testing of contingent-claim pricing models are discussed.","[Yu, Jun] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, Singapore 178903, Singapore; [Phillips, Peter C.

Welfare gains do not arise from a lower tax rate as such, but from leveling the playing field between different types of capital or otherwise promoting economic efficiency. Some base broadening measures obstruct, rather than advance, efficiency. Furthermore, corporate tax base broadening is likely to yield smaller welfare gains than reforms that reduce the distortion between business and non-business capital or between current and future consumption.","Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, Washington, DC 20036 USA",American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research,"Viard, AD (通讯作者)，Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",,,,,,,,28,1,1,0,7,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

This paper focuses on road traffic accidents, the reduction of which is an important aim of transport policy world wide. The primary objective of this paper is to develop a series of relationships using spatially disaggregated area-level cross-sectional data between different traffic casualties, road traffic speed and road curvature by controlling for other contributing factors associated with area characteristics. The spatial units of the analysis are the 8019 census wards in England. Ward-level casualty data are disaggregated by severity of the casualty (such as fatalities, serious injuries and slight injuries) and by the severity of the casualty related to various road users. The results suggest that increased average speed within a ward is positively associated with total fatalities and serious injuries; and road curvature is found to be negatively associated with road accidents.

His contribution is extraordinarily broad in scope, which makes it difficult to pinpoint one or a few specifics that we associate with Shane's scholarship. Instead, they can be summarized in the following three points. First, he has influenced what we view as central aspects of entrepreneurship. Shane has been a leading figure in redirecting the focus on entrepreneurship research itself. Second, he has influenced how we view entrepreneurship. Shane's research is arguably theory driven and it applies and develops theoretical lenses that greatly improve our understanding of entrepreneurship. Third, he has contributed to how we conduct entrepreneurship research. Shane has been a forerunner in examining relevant units of analysis that are difficult to sample; research designs and databases specifically designed for studying entrepreneurial processes; and sophisticated analytical methods. This has contributed to advancing the methodological rigor of the field.

In line with the theoretical literature, we find that better developed and more integrated financial markets increase emerging markets' ability to borrow abroad. Moreover, the degree of financial integration within the convergence clubs - as opposed to the state of financial integration in the global economy - and the extent of reserve accumulation are significant factors in explaining the divergent patterns of real convergence and the current account in the regions under review.

As a consequence individuals do not reduce current consumption in response to an expected income decline as long as uncertainty is high enough. Such a behavior is consistent with excess sensitivity of consumption to income growth, an empirical regularity which is hard to explain within a standard Life Cycle model. Loss Aversion is tested on an Italian dataset (the Bank of Italy's Survey on Households'. Income and Wealth). The conclusion is that excess sensitivity could be explained by a model that do not assume individuals to be expected utility maximizers.","Utrecht Sch Econ, NL-3512 BL Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Pasini, G (通讯作者)，Utrecht Sch Econ, Janskerkhof 12, NL-3512 BL Utrecht, Netherlands.",g.pasini@econ.uu.nl,"Pasini, Giacomo/E-7032-2014","Pasini, Giacomo/0000-0002-2052-3453",,,,,17,2,2,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

This belief is flawed because the typical start-up is not innovative, creates few jobs, and generates little wealth. Getting economic growth and jobs creation from entrepreneurs is not a numbers game. It is about encouraging the formation of high quality, high growth companies. Policy makers should stop subsidizing the formation of the typical start-up and focus on the subset of businesses with growth potential. While government officials will not be able to pick winners, they can identify start-ups with a low probability of generating jobs and enhancing economic growth. By eliminating incentives to create these low probability companies, policy makers can improve the average performance of new businesses.","Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University,"Shane, S (通讯作者)，Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",scott.shane@case.edu,,,,,,,36,769,870,3,196,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This development calls for a framework that allows for a systematic assessment of the overall evolution of the spatiality of airline networks. To this end, we develop an analytical framework based on a set of spatial interaction indices, which allows measuring the degree of hierarchical differentiation (i.e. dominance and connectivity) in a network. Moreover, a normalization of these indices through a systematic comparison with the corresponding values for a rank size distribution makes it possible to engage in meaningful longitudinal analyses and/or to compare the spatiality of networks with different numbers of nodes and/or links. Our framework is tested by applying it to data on air passenger flows within Europe, and its usefulness is discussed in the context of research on air traffic liberalization. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Using loan-level data, we find that sold loans contain additional covenants and more restrictive net worth covenants, particularly when agency and informational problems are more severe. Why do borrowers agree to incur the additional costs associated with loan sales? Our evidence suggests that these borrowers benefit through increased private debt availability. Further, loan sales go hand in hand with more durable lending relationships, suggesting that risk management aids continued relationship lending.

The information asymmetries in the OTD market can lead to moral hazard problems on the part of lenders. We find, using a plausibly exogenous source of variation in the ease of securitization, that the quality of loan origination varies inversely with the amount of regulation: more regulated lenders originate loans of worse quality. We interpret this result as a possible evidence that the fragility of lightly regulated originators' capital structure can mitigate moral hazard. In addition, we find that incentives which require mortgage brokers to have 'skin in the game' and stronger risk management departments inside the bank partially alleviate the moral hazard problem in this setting. Finally, having more lenders inside a mortgage pool is associated with higher quality loans, suggesting that sharper relative performance evaluation made possible by more competition among contributing lenders can also mitigate the moral hazard problem to some extent. Overall, our evidence suggests that market forces rather than regulation may have been more effective in mitigating moral hazard in the OTD market. The findings caution against policies that impose stricter lender regulations which fail to align lenders' incentives with the investors of mortgage-backed securities. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Risk, uncertainty, and divergence of opinion. journal of Finance 32, 1151-1168] hypothesizes that prices of stocks subject to high differences of opinion and short-sales constraints are biased upward. We expect earnings announcements to reduce differences of opinion among investors, and consequently, these announcements should reduce overvaluation. Using five distinct proxies for differences of opinion, we find that high differences of opinion stocks earn significantly lower returns around earnings announcements than low differences of opinion stocks. In addition, the returns on high differences of opinion stocks are more negative within the subsample of stocks that are most difficult for investors to sell short. These results are robust when we control for the size effect and the market-to-book effect and when we examine alternative explanations such as financial leverage, earnings announcement premium, post-earnings announcement drift, return momentum, and potential biases in analysts' forecasts. Also consistent with Miller's theory, we find that stocks subject to high differences of opinion and more binding short-sales constraints have a price run-up just prior to earnings announcements that is followed by an even larger decline after the announcements.

A Comparative Growth Analysis of the Dominican Republic and Haiti,IMF STAFF PAPERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The Dominican Republic and Haiti share the island of Hispaniola and are broadly similar in terms of geography and historical institutions, yet their growth performance has diverged remarkably. The countries had the same per capita real GDP in 1960, but, by 2005, the Dominican Republic's per capita real GDP had tripled, whereas that of Haiti had halved. Drawing on the growth literature, this paper explains this divergence through a combined approach that includes a panel regression to study growth determinants across a broad group of countries, and a case study framework to better understand the specific policy decisions and external conditions that have shaped economic outcomes in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. This paper finds that initial conditions cannot fully explain the growth divergence, but rather policy decisions have played a central role in the growth trends of the two countries.

The inherent uncertainty associated with and discretion permitted in estimating the LLP contributes to information asymmetry. The auditor's certification and monitoring roles influence firm value by mitigating this information asymmetry. We examine two aspects of auditor reputation, auditor type (Big 5 vs. non-Big 5) and auditor expertise, in the banking industry. We find a significant, positive association between the discretionary component of LLP and stock return for banks audited by the Big 5 auditors. Further analysis indicates that auditor expertise within banking and not auditor type drives this significant, positive association.

Municipalities that adopted the new tax instrument have a three-rate tax property tax system with different tax rates on land before development, land after development and buildings. The remaining municipalities have a two-rate system with a uniform land tax and a building tax. A theoretical model of decisions by landowners suggests that the pre-development land tax ought to lead to faster development, but also the density of development may be affected. In the two-rate system land tax is neutral. The empirical results suggest that landowners respond to the tax incentives.

The most recent line of investigation criticizes the EKC hypothesis on more fundamental grounds, in that it stresses the lack of sufficient statistical testing of the empirical relationship and questions the very existence of the notion of EKC. Attention is in particular drawn on the stationarity properties of the series involved-per capita emissions or concentrations and per capita GDP-and, in case of presence of unit roots, on the cointegration property that must be present for the EKC to be a well-defined concept. Only at that point can the researcher ask whether the long-run relationship exhibits an inverted-U pattern. On the basis of panel integration and cointegration tests for sulfur, Stern (2004) and Perman and Stern (1999, 2003) have presented evidence and forcefully stated that the EKC hypothesis does not exist. In this paper we ask whether similar strong conclusions can be arrived at when carrying out tests of system fractional integration and cointegration. As an example we use the controversial case of carbon dioxide emissions. The results show that more EKCs come back into life relative to traditional integration/cointegration tests. However, we confirm that the EKC hypothesis remains a fragile concept.","[Manera, Matteo] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Stat, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Galeotti, Marzio] Univ Milan, Milan, Italy; [Galeotti, Marzio] IEFE Bocconi, Milan, Italy; [Manera, Matteo] Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Milan, Italy; [Lanza, Alessandro] Eni Corp Univ, San Donato Milanese, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca; University of Milan; Bocconi University; Fondazione Mattei; Eni SpA,"Manera, M (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Stat, Via Bicocca Arcimboldi 8, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",matteo.manera@unimib.it,,,,,,,50,115,118,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

When employment risk is more important than compensation incentives, fund managers with a poor midyear performance tend to decrease risk relative to leading managers to prevent potential job loss. When employment risk is low, compensation incentives become more relevant and fund managers with a poor midyear performance increase risk to catch up with the midyear winners. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Using Chinese provincial data in the 1990s, we find that enhanced legal system suppresses private investment and has no effect on financial depth although it increases the private share of bank credits and bank competition. We interpret these findings as evidence showing the existence of the leakage effect that moves financial resources from the privileged state sector to the rationed private sector.

We distinguish between the income effect of the cut and the (intertemporal) substitution effect. The former is likely to be small because the change in lifetime income is minimal. The second effect is likely to be much more important because the reduction in the price of goods bought in 2009 compared with 2010 gives an incentive to increase consumer spending this year. With an elasticity of intertemporal substitution of about 1, we would expect the cut in VAT to boost consumer spending by about 1.2 per cent over what it would otherwise be. The distributional consequences of the VAT cut are regressive because goods subject to VAT tend to be luxuries. Unlike a cut in interest rates, there is no difference in the distributional consequences for borrowers compared with savers.","[Crossley, Thomas F.; Low, Hamish] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Wakefield, Matthew] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Wakefield, Matthew] Univ Bologna, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Cambridge; University of London; University College London; University of Bologna,"Crossley, TF (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",thomas.crossley@econ.cam.ac.uk; hamish.low@econ.cam.ac.uk; matt_w@ifs.org.uk,,"Low, Hamish/0000-0002-6064-9448; Crossley, Thomas/0000-0003-0952-7450",Economic and Social Research Council [RES-544-28-5001] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,10,25,26,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

For small risks, we derive a measure of the strength of the precautionary saving motive that generalizes the concept of prudence introduced by Kimball (1990b). For large risks, we show that decreasing absolute risk aversion guarantees that the precautionary saving motive is stronger than risk aversion, regardless of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. Holding risk preferences fixed, the extent to which the precautionary saving motive is stronger than risk aversion increases with the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. We derive sufficient conditions for a change in risk preferences alone to increase the strength of the precautionary saving motive and for the strength of the precautionary saving motive to decline with wealth.

We conclude that insurers' losses are the primary driver of the market deterioration during the period 1998 through 2003.","[Neale, Faith R.] Univ N Carolina, Belk Coll Business, Dept Finance, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Eastman, Kevin L.] Georgia So Univ, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA; [Drake, Pamela Peterson] James Madison Univ, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; University System of Georgia; Georgia Southern University; James Madison University,"Neale, FR (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Belk Coll Business, Dept Finance, 9201 Univ Way Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",frneale@uncc.edu,,,,,,,41,7,8,0,8,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-4367,,,J RISK INSUR,J.

I find that bank lines of credit, also known as revolving credit facilities, are a viable liquidity substitute only for firms that maintain high cash flow. In contrast, firms with low cash flow are less likely to obtain a line of credit, and they rely more heavily on cash in their corporate liquidity management. An important channel for this correlation is the use of cash flow-based financial covenants by banks that supply credit lines. I find that firms must maintain high cash flow to remain compliant with covenants, and banks restrict firm access to credit facilities in response to covenant violations. Using the cash-flow sensitivity of cash as a measure of financial constraints, I provide evidence that lack of access to a line of credit is a more statistically powerful measure of financial constraints than traditional measures used in the literature.","Univ Chicago, Grad Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Sufi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Grad Sch Business, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",amir.sufi@chicagogsb.edu,,,FDIC's Center for Financial Research,FDIC's Center for Financial Research,"I thank Heitor Almeida, Murillo Campello, Douglas Diamond, Michael Faulkender, Mark Flannery, Christopher James, Anil Kashyap, Aziz Lookman, David Matsa, Francisco Perez-Gonzalez, Mitchell Petersen, James Poterba, Joshua Rauh, Antoinette Schoar, Jeremy Stein, Philip Strahan, and Peter Tufano for helpful comments and discussion.

This paper examines whether PIN is priced because of information asymmetry or because of other liquidity effects that are unrelated to information asymmetry. Our starting point is a model that decomposes PIN into two components, one related to asymmetric information and one related to illiquidity. In a two-pass Fama-MacBeth [1973. Risk, return, and equilibrium: empirical tests. Journal of Political Economy 81, 607-636] regression, we show that the PIN component related to asymmetric information is not priced, while the PIN component related to illiquidity is priced.

If agents anticipate this happening, a speculative attack may still occur. This result is different from that of the first-generation currency crisis model, where the inconsistent domestic policy brings in the collapse of the peg. The policy options to defend the peg in the author's model depend on the nature of the shock. Effective capital control can only be implemented for capital outflow shock. Capital account deregulation is more stabilizing under a current account deficit shock, however.

As households shift away from farm to non-farm activities and their children pursue higher education, non-farm income and revenues from pawning of land have emerged as main sources of schooling funds in the early 2000s.

In this study, we investigate the relationship between aid and changes to economic freedom in recipient nations over the 1990-2000 decade. The evidence is mixed. In general, we find that foreign aid has no significant effect on economic freedom overall. However, using a hedonic approach on the different categories of economic freedom, we find that aid has still managed to contribute toward a policy and institutional environment favorable to growth, as the different categories of economic freedom improved by aid more than offset those which are harmed by aid, in terms of their impact on growth.

Untheorised increases in precarious informal work, unemployment, and emigration as well as a growing breech between wages and productivity followed trade, capital, and labour market reforms and the prescribed macro stabilisation policies. Orthodox reforms in both countries paradoxically facilitated market failures given the forms or modes taken by foreign direct investment (FDI), which introduced ever more increasing scale economies with their attendant information imperfections. In addition, the growing competition from tradeable goods faced by domestic producers in both countries and the decision to buy rather than make technologies by way of FDI undermined job creation and induced inter-sectoral flows toward service sector and informal work.","Tennessee Technol Univ, Dept Econ Finance & Mkt, Cookeville, TN 38505 USA",Tennessee Technological University,"Jonakin, J (通讯作者)，Tennessee Technol Univ, Dept Econ Finance & Mkt, Box 5083,Johnson Hall, Cookeville, TN 38505 USA.",jjonakin@tntech.edu,,,,,,,56,2,2,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,,,J DEV STUD,J.

We focus on two sets of IPO regulations issued between January 1, 1996 and February 11, 1999: pricing regulations, which Stipulate that IPO prices be a function of accounting performance, and penalty regulations, which penalize IPO firms for overly optimistic forecasts. We find that IPO firms that report better pricing-period accounting performance have larger declines in post-IPO profitability, lower first-day stock returns and worse long-run post-IPO stock performance. Furthermore, IPO firms that make overoptimistic forecasts also have lower first-day returns and worse post-IPO stock performance. Using non-core earnings as the proxy for earnings management, we document some evidence that IPO firms that report higher pricing-period accounting performance have engaged in more income-increasing earnings management. Hence, pricing regulations may have induced I PO firms to inflate pricing-period earnings and affect the post-IPO performance negatively. On the other hand, penalty regulations have deterred IPO firms from making overoptimistic earnings forecast and therefore have a positive impact on the behavior of IPO firms. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We implement this analysis through the instrument-variable threshold regressions approach. The empirical evidence shows that there indeed exists an income threshold above which greater trade openness has beneficial effects on economic growth and below which heightened trade has detrimental consequences. It implies that greater international trade and integration may contribute to more diverging economies. In addition, the relationship of trade with growth is found to work possibly through both investment and productivity growth channels.","[Kim, Dong-Hyeon] Providence Univ, Shalu 43301, Taiwan; [Lin, Shu-Chin] Tamkang Univ, Tamsui, Taiwan; [Lin, Shu-Chin] Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Providence University - Taiwan; Tamkang University; Kyung Hee University,"Kim, DH (通讯作者)，Providence Univ, 200 Chungchi Rd, Shalu 43301, Taiwan.",dhyeonkim@yahoo.com,"Lin, Shu-Chin/AAG-3608-2019",,,,,,59,59,67,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,,,J DEV STUD,J.

To this end, the EU Member States most conduct cost-benefit analysis in order to establish both targets objectives and timelines for implementation set targets and deadlines. This challenging and ambitious Policy reinstates the issues about the pollution control cost and ecological profits assessments. Regarding costs, the discrimination of pollution abatement effort enables to minimize the total cost when the location of the emissions matters, whereas an uniform effort can reach the required pollution levels more flexibly. Therefore, the discrimination of the abatement effort can't be justified unless it induces significant cost reduction. In this paper, the authors show that the efficiency gains due to a discrimination of pollution abatement efforts depend on the intensity of the ecological constraint, and on the polluters profile. These findings are important for the EU Commission, which is charged with assessing the estimates provided by the member states.","[Nafi, Amir; Destandau, Francois] CEMAGREF ENGEES, Lab GSP, F-67070 Strasbourg, France",INRAE,"Nafi, A (通讯作者)，CEMAGREF ENGEES, Lab GSP, 1 Quai Koch,BP 61039, F-67070 Strasbourg, France.",francois.destandau@engees.u-strasbg.fr,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,11,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Most pension funds switched to an average-wage plan with solvency-contingent indexation. This pension plan redesign was the outcome of a new compromise between the major stakeholders of Dutch pension funds. The redesign is of interest as it results in a hybrid combination of DB and DC. This new setting indeed greatly improves solvency risk management. Moreover, the new plan structure appears to be welfare-dominant compared to other collective plan settings and individual alternatives, as it improves the conditions for intergenerational risk sharing. However, drawbacks of the new plans are the lack of transparency and potential welfare loss for individuals because of the inherent contingent claim structure of the new plan. Moreover, the plan redesign has led to value redistribution from older to younger plan participants.","[Ponds, Eduard H.

The NATREX concept represents a macroeconomic model based on stock-flow interaction. After the estimation of the NATREX model for the CZK, we have been able to answer such questions as: What are the pace and main determinants of the current long-term equilibrium appreciation?

The explored sample of countries are the Visegrad group countries which have similar experience with central planned economy. Regional disparities have occured during transition period in these countries especially between the metropolitan regions and the rest of regions. The paper also attempts to identify the factors responsible for the persistence of regional unemployment disparities in these countries because the persistence of significant regional disparities challenges countries' capacity to promote economic growth while ensuring social cohesion. There are several measures of regional disparities. It must be emphasized however, that measures of concentration are not the same as measures of inequality, such as the Gini coefficient which measures inequality in the income distribution of a country. Examples of measures of regional disparities or concentration like the Concentration ratio, the Herfindahl index, the Ellison and Glaeser index, the Geographic concentration index and the Adjusted geographic concentration index which are tested on data which are obtained from accessible statistics databases. In this paper we also compare these approaches to measurement of regional disparities. The findings are consistent with the view that regional unemployment disparities are explained primarily by regional disparities in economic competitiveness.","[Tvrdon, Michal] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business & Adm Karvina, Dept Econ, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,,tvrdon@opf.slu.cz,"Tvrdon, Michal/J-4806-2012","Tvrdon, Michal/0000-0001-9029-883X",,,,,5,2,2,0,1,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-523-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,389,397,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BMK17,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272657000044,0

In order to understand the impacts of the reform and the influence of Danwei on jobs-housing relationships and commuting behavior, this study investigates whether there are differences in commuting behavior between individuals who live in houses provided by Danwei and those who reside in houses from private market sources in urban China. We apply the structural equations model to investigate the interactions between housing source (from Danwei or not), jobs-housing relationship, transport mode and commuting time in Beijing, the capital city of China. The results show that Danwei housing commuters have shorter commuting trips and higher usage of non-motorized transport mode than those who live in houses from the market sources. This finding implies that the diminishing influence of the traditional Danwei system and the market-oriented reform in urban development may have changed the jobs-housing balance and increased travel demand in Chinese cities.

The financial exposures faced by the commercial banks increases with the opening up of China's financial market. The essence of competition among the commercial banks in future is the competition of the quality of risk management. It is an acute problem waiting for resolution by China's commercial banks as how to prevent and control the birth of new financial risks, and alleviate the potential financial risks. It is the current status of the risk management of China's commercial banks that there are more qualitative than quantitative governance; more ex-post response than ex-ante prevention. Considering this, this article introduces two models that can be used to give the pre-warnings of the banks' risks quantitatively: the main factor analysis model and VAR model. The article demonstrates the mechanism of their quantitative evaluation, and gives an example to explain the applicability of the VAR model. This may offer valuable proposals to improve the governance of China's commercial banks.","[Wang Shifen] Shanghai Univ, Coll Econ, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China",Shanghai University,,shifenwang@shu.edu.cn,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,3,M D FORUM,ALLAWAH NSW,"17 AUGUSTA ST, ALLAWAH NSW, 2218, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9806854-2-8,,,,2009,,,,,,,1279,1285,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BPO33,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279533000159,0

Keep-factors were examined on the company level and represented by six financial indicators. The sample covers 692 Czech manufacturing companies (foreign owned) with one hundred or more employees. The main goal is to identify branches of manucaturing threatened by delocalization.

To capture expected inflation, we develop a recursive filtering algorithm that extracts unexpected inflation from real interest rate data, even in the presence of diverse risks and a potential Mundell-Tobin-effect. The extracted unexpected inflation is compared to the forecasting errors of ten econometric forecasts. In addition to the standard AR(p) and ARMA(1,1) models, which are known to have the best performance on average, we also employ several Phillips curve-based approaches, VAR, dynamic factor models and two simple model averaging approaches. Finally, we show that the quality of the expectations clearly matches the quality of the forecasts derived with the techniques that are currently proposed for this purpose in the economic literature.

Equilibrium bond portfolios are nonsensical and imply a trading volume that vastly exceeds observed trading volume on financial markets. Instead, portfolios that combine bond ladders with a market portfolio of equity assets are nearly optimal investment strategies. The welfare loss of these simple investment strategies, when compared to the equilibrium portfolio, converges to zero as the length of the bond ladder increases.

We use a binary instrument based on the reform and unique information on individual cognitive skills to examine the importance of cognitive skills on labor market outcomes. The results suggest that the main beneficiaries of the reform were those who at the time were pupils in basic schooling. Once the treated group is expanded to include older (secondary school age) students, schooling premiums decrease dramatically while the return to cognitive skills increases accordingly, suggesting that a large part of the estimated return from a typical earnings function is due to classical ability bias. Overall, the findings point to heterogeneous effects of the reform. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The goal is to control the portfolio's total risk exposure and attain an effective balance between risk and expected return. By incorporating options and forward contracts in the portfolio optimization model we are able to numerically assess the performance of alternative tactics for mitigating exposure to the primary risks. We find that control of market risk with options has more significant impact on portfolio performance than currency hedging. We demonstrate through extensive empirical tests that incremental benefits, in terms of reducing risk and generating profits, are gained when both the market and currency risks are jointly controlled through appropriate means.

The use of the model is to ascertain the modal share of competing transport modes (road and intermodal) while taking complex transport service supply-demand dynamics into account. It is structured by modules describing company generation, supplier choice, modal competition and International road freight transport market dynamics. The behaviour of individual actors is simulated using normative agent behaviour and market knowledge. Using the micro-simulation approach, shippers and carriers (primarily road hauliers and a maritime based intermodal operator) interact through simulated contracts resulting in the generation of tours. The service performance of the tours is fed back into the model for decision making during contract deliberations. Preliminary application of model to Mediterranean case study show that market share gains of around 25-30% are obtained with policy interventions of financial subsidies to intermodal services and more frequent shipping services in the intermodal transport respectively.

Aid fragmentation has continued to increase despite international efforts to foster donor coordination. One possible implication of fragmentation is smaller aid projects, potentially with the result of more administrative work for overtaxed recipient governments per dollar of aid received. This paper makes use of AidData data on bilateral aid commitments, sector, and funding agencies to explore the determinants of project size and to better understand the forces driving aid fragmentation. To the extent that project size is driven by the sectoral composition or purpose of aid, the associated administrative costs may be justified. Variations due to other factors, e.g. a donor's administrative structure or bureaucratic interest:, provide a stronger case for reforms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Our findings are largely consistent with predictions from the optimal contracting literature. The size of the plan is negatively related to Tobin's Q and firm size and positively related to proxies for monitoring costs, which also influence the probability of launching premium ESOPs. Our results also show that the premium (out-of-the-moneyness) is negatively related to prior stock returns and cash flow-to-assets, which may be an indication of high-water mark contracting, or alternatively, of managerial power. Finally, we also find some support for a positive relation between the premium and the length of the vesting period when maturity is fixed, which indicates an effort to keep the incentives for management from falling over time.

However, shuttle bus systems without adequate planning and management may lead to unintended consequences such as eliminating the constraint to visitor use levels associated with parking lot capacities. As a consequence, the demand for recreation use in the area increases the potential impacts to the visitor experience and park resources. This study examined the trade-offs Rocky Mountain National Park visitors were willing to make about transportation mode choice using a stated choice survey to inform park managers about visitor acceptance of potential transportation related management actions. Results indicate that visitors prefer to use their private vehicles over the parks transit system but are willing to make trade-offs to ride the shuttle bus in order to avoid crowding along the trail at Bear Lake and vehicle traffic along the Bear Lake Road. In addition, there were statistically significant differences among choices of transportation mode trade-offs among different age groups (i.e., less than 40 years of age, 40-60 years of age, and more than 60 years of age) Specifically, results suggest that visitors less than 40 years are more willing than the older age groups to make trade-offs among transportation options to enhance their chances of being on the trail system at Bear Lake with fewer other people. The significant and interacted relationships with shuttle bus use, visitor use, and vehicle traffic levels found in this study provide RMNP managers opportunities to influence visitors' transportation mode choices.

Are the two linked? Does development assistance for health (DAH) improve, on balance, recipient countries' mortality trajectory? Using a new data source containing DAH on 96 high mortality countries, the regression analysis shows no effect of DAFT on mortality. Other types of aid, including water development, also have no effect. Economic growth, on the other hand, has a strong negative effect on mortality. These findings confirm and build upon recent work by Williamson (2008) and are shown to be robust to a variety of sensitivity analyses and alternative model specifications and estimation methods. This analysis also shows that the effectiveness of DAH has not increased over time, even as the level of that funding has increased fourfold, though spending on infectious diseases and family planning may have caused small reductions in mortality. Furthermore, even though it is encouraging that DAFT has tended to go where the need is highest, it also goes to states that have experienced the greatest mortality reductions in the recent past. In other words, DAH appears to be following success, rather than causing it. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The decomposition of variance and semivariance of asset returns is presented for forty-four country-level indexes. The proportion of risk explained for country-level returns in the Downside CAPM framework is higher than in the CAPM framework. On average for all markets, global systematic risk, as a proportion of total risk, is 42% in the CAPM and 56% in the Downside CAPM. A strong role for semivariance and downside beta is found in explaining the cross-section of country returns.

We show that endogenous trading by small bondholders may result in multiple equilibria. Some equilibria entail vanishing liquidity and sharp increases in yields absent changing fundamentals. In turn, anticipation of illiquid equilibria induces firms to eschew public debt financing, since such equilibria create higher bankruptcy costs and debt illiquidity discounts. The model thus offers a rational micro-foundation for stylized facts commonly attributed to investor sentiment and CFO market timing. Finally, we show that the vulnerability of debt markets to multiple equilibria is highest during downturns, when small bondholders face severe adverse selection.","[Zechner, Josef] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, CEPR & ECGI, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Hennessy, Christopher A.] London Business Sch, CEPR & ECGI, London, England",Vienna University of Economics & Business; University of London; London Business School,"Zechner, J (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, CEPR & ECGI, Heiligenstadterstr 46, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",josef.zechner@wu.ac.at,"Paredes, Katty/G-6386-2018","Zechner, Josef/0000-0002-3357-0208",Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [W 1001] Funding Source: researchfish,Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),,,17,4,5,0,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Although the productivity of a fishery is known to be dependent on species diversity, this relationship is not widely documented. This paper uses an extended Gordon-Schaefer model that is modified to incorporate species diversity to estimate the MSY levels of catch and the corresponding fishing effort. Species diversity is expressed as both biological and bioeconomic diversity using the Simpson index. The model reports that the actual fishing effort has exceeded the maximum level necessary to support sustainable yield, while the maximum level of catch for maintaining sustainable yield is not known. A comparison of fish landings and effort data across different fishing techniques indicates that there is a potential to decrease the current level of fishing effort without experiencing a significant decline in fish catch.","Univ Delhi, Dept Business Econ, New Delhi 110021, India",University of Delhi,"Kapuria, P (通讯作者)，Univ Delhi, Dept Business Econ, South Campus, New Delhi 110021, India.",pkapuria@gmail.com,,,,,,,12,1,1,1,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Using propensity score matching methods, we find that adopting improved groundnut varieties (technology) significantly increases crop income and reduces poverty. The positive and significant impact on crop income is consistent with the perceived role of new agricultural technologies in reducing rural poverty through increased farm household income. This study supports broader investment in agriculture research to address vital development challenges.

By using household-level data collected in a large-scale gravity irrigation scheme in Uganda, whose management was transferred from the government to the community, we find that household contributions to the cleaning of irrigation channels are determined by the scarcity of irrigation water, the opportunity cost of labor and the private benefit associated with plot size. We also find that the availability of irrigation water increases in the tertiary irrigation canal where the coefficient of variation of plot size is large, which may indicate that farmers of larger plots are particularly active in water management.

But these studies assume that small samples of loan announcements adequately represent the loan population. We find that loan announcements are rare and driven by factors such as information asymmetry and perceived materiality. We show that the sample used by Billett, Flannery, and Garfinkel (1995) fails to represent the loan universe and that significant abnormal announcement returns are confined to their smallest firms. Our sample, which better represents the loan population, produces an abnormal return insignificantly different from zero. The findings suggest that self-selection bias affects extant loan announcement research and do not support the views that loans are a special form of finance or that private and public debt differ in significant ways. Were all loans to be announced, the average abnormal return would likely be insignificant. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Selective negative externalities create network externalities, but outcomes may differ greatly from typical network effects. Price effects may cause the imposing product's sales to decline with the size of the negative externality. Consequently, a positive competitive effect may overwhelm the externality's negative direct effects on welfare, such that a policy that enlarges the externality may improve welfare.","CUNY City Coll, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10031 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; City College of New York (CUNY),"Nagler, MG (通讯作者)，CUNY City Coll, Dept Econ, 160 Convent Ave, New York, NY 10031 USA.",mnagler@ccny.cuny.edu,,,,,,,21,3,3,4,30,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-1821,,,J IND ECON,J.

This finding is different, in spirit, from the widely-found negative relationship between financial development and the strength of the lending channel of monetary transmission. Focusing on the balance sheet channel, and using bank-level observations, we find that securitizing banks are more sensitive to borrowers' balance sheets and that monetary policy has a greater impact on this sensitivity for securitizing banks. The optimality conditions from a simple partial equilibrium framework suggest that the positive effects of securitization on policy effectiveness could be due to the high sensitivity of security prices to policy rates.

Among men with the 7-repeat allele of DRD4, namely 7R + men, those with more bridge skill take more good risks and fewer bad risks, while the opposite is found for less-expert 7R + men. Conversely, skill does not predict risk-taking among men without the 7R + allele. Consistent with some prior studies, we also find that 7R + men take more risk in the financial gamble. We find no relationship between 7R + and either risk measure among our female subjects.

They note significant quantitative gender differences in business entry, with male-owned firms heavily prevailing over firms owned by women in many parts of the world. They find that enterprises owned by men on the one hand and women on the other are generally concentrated in different sectors, women entrepreneurs being better represented in labor intensive sectors such as trade and services rather than capital intensive manufacturing industries. They also observe certain gender differentials in business survival and growth patterns. Yet an analysis of a large body of literature does not suggest that, in general, the so called gender gap in entrepreneurship can be explained by explicit discrimination in laws or regulations. Rather, differences in quantitative and qualitative indicators of business entry and performance can in part be explained by a number of business environment factors that disproportionately affect a woman's decision to operate a business in the formal sector. For example the concentration of women in low capital intensive industries-which require less funding and at the same time have a lower potential for growth and development-might also be driven by barriers against women regarding access to finance. Furthermore, women may have relatively less physical and reputational collateral than men, which limits their access to finance. Overall the literature suggests that improvements in the business environment can help promote high-growth female entrepreneurship.

J,"Lin, JYF",,,,"Lin, Justin Yifu",,,New Structural Economics: A Framework for Rethinking Development,WORLD BANK RESEARCH OBSERVER,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FOREIGN-INVESTMENT; INDUSTRIAL-POLICY; GROWTH; TECHNOLOGY; INNOVATION; MODEL,"As strategies for achieving sustainable growth in developing countries are re-examined in light of the financial crisis, it is critical to take into account structural change and its corollary, industrial upgrading. Economic literature has devoted a great deal of attention to the analysis of technological innovation, but not enough to these equally important issues. The new structural economics outlined in this paper suggests a framework to complement previous approaches in the search for sustainable growth strategies. It takes the following into consideration. First, an economy's structure of factor endowments evolves from one level of development to another. Therefore, the optimal industrial structure of a given economy will be different at different levels of development. Each industrial structure requires corresponding infrastructure (both hard and soft) to facilitate its operations and transactions. Second, each level of economic development is a point along the continuum from a low-income agrarian economy to a high-income industrialized economy, not a dichotomy of two economic development levels (poor versus rich or developing versus industrialized). Industrial upgrading and infrastructure improvement targets in developing countries should not necessarily draw from those that exist in high-income countries. Third, at each given level of development, the market is the basic mechanism for effective resource allocation. However, economic development as a dynamic process requires industrial upgrading and corresponding improvements in hard and soft infrastructure at each level. Such upgrading entails large externalities to firms' transaction costs and returns to capital investment. Thus, in addition to an effective market mechanism, the government should play an active role in facilitating industrial upgrading and infrastructure improvements.

The increase in aggregate exports in response to the transfer reflects extensive and intensive adjustments, as the sales of new exporting firms (extensive margin) contribute to the current account adjustment along with the sales of existing exporting firms (intensive margin). The relative size of the intensive and extensive margins of the adjustment is determined by the size dispersion of firms. The model calibrated to the observed distribution of firm sizes shows that the intensive margin is the predominant channel of the current account adjustment. The dampening effect of the extensive margin has therefore very little impact on the exchange rate adjustment.","[Pappada, Francesco] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",Paris School of Economics,,,"Pappada, Francesco/ABI-2315-2020","Pappada, Francesco/0000-0002-2764-4792",,,,,18,4,4,0,6,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

This article reviews the main indicators and finds that de jure vs. de facto indicators yield systematically different growth results. Among de jure indicators, sample differences account for much of the variation in growth results, with a weaker impact found in more recent data and among advanced economies. It also finds that many indicators capture different and useful facets of financial openness, such as intensive vs. extensive measures, and de facto vs. de jure. A small minority of indices suffer weaknesses that make them not useful for rigorous economic analysis, most notably the Investment Freedom Index by the Heritage Foundation.","[Quinn, Dennis] Georgetown Univ, McDonough Sch Business, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Schindler, Martin] Joint Vienna Inst, Vienna, Austria; [Schindler, Martin] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Toyoda, A.

Based on an analysis of 2005 Afrobarometer data, the study finds that the rural poor are more likely to use public schools and clinics than the urban, better-off. The data suggest that a two-tiered social service system now exists across many African countries where the rural poor may have little choice but to use public social services while the urban, better-off choose to pay for private alternatives.

We find that different factors are effective for different levels of renewable energy commitment and the magnitudes of some effects evolve in accordance with the level of renewable energy sources used. Consequently, some policies that do not take into account the different stages could carry different effects. The results suggest that the lobbying effect of the established industries hampers the development of renewable sources, and that this effect is greater for lower initial level of renewable energy use. The results reveal that environmental concerns have not yet achieved enough pressure to stimulate major developments on renewables. We include two new drivers, geographic area and European Union Directive 2001/77/EC.

This article examines the genesis and trajectory of one such mobilization that emerged in the province of San Marcos and neighbouring Condebamba Valley, located in the northern Andean department of Cajamarca. The social movement's internal organization, strategy, tactics and repertoires of struggle are analyzed. Practices inherited from the rondas campesinas (nightwatch patrols) are seen to have exercised an important influence in shaping its modus operandi, which contrasts in key respects with the behaviour of other anti-mining protests in Peru, such as Majaz. The article concludes with an assessment of how shifting power relations within the state might influence the chances of successful collective action in the countryside.","Univ Liverpool, Liverpool L69 7WW, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool,"Taylor, L (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, 86 Bedford St S, Liverpool L69 7WW, Merseyside, England.",ltaylor@liv.ac.uk,,,,,,,22,25,31,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

This is the main reason why many advocate the use of positive incentives as a viable alternative. Not only do rewards provoke no defensive reaction, but they may elicit a rally in support of compliance - a fifth-column effect. Yet, positive incentives are vulnerable to extortion - doing wrong in the hope of obtaining larger rewards. As a result, many conjecture that sanction threats and promises of reward are most efficient when used simultaneously. We put this conjecture to a test, staging a formal confrontation of the two forms of incentives. Our model pits a sanctioner and a target in a game allowing for the possibility of rally-round-the-flag, fifth-column, and extortion effects. The game yields unambiguous results: under no circumstances should a sanctioner prefer sanction threats to reward promises. This result holds despite the risk of extortion, a risk that proves to be less of a drawback than the rally round the flag.","[Verdier, Daniel] Ohio State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Woo, Byungwon] Oakland Univ, Rochester, MN USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Oakland University,"Verdier, D (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 2140 Derby Hall,154 N Oval Mall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",verdier.2@osu.edu,"Woo, Byungwon/GPG-1771-2022","Woo, Byungwon/0000-0003-4211-616X",,,,,31,9,10,0,25,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN STREET, MALDEN, MA 02148-529 USA",0954-1985,,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

In our model, an employee of a firm generates an idea for a new project that can be financed either by issuing equity against the cash flows of the entire firm (integration), or by undertaking an equity carve-out of the new project alone (non-integration). While the patent underlying the new project is owned by the firm, the employee generating the idea needs to be motivated to exert optimal effort for the project to be successful. The firm's choice between integration and non-integration is driven primarily by heterogeneity in beliefs among outside investors (each of whom has limited wealth to invest in the equity market) and between firm insiders and outsiders: if the marginal outsider financing the new project is more optimistic about the prospects of the project than firm insiders, and this incremental optimism of the marginal outsider over firm insiders is greater regarding new-project cash flows than that about assets-in-place cash flows, then the firm will implement the project under non-integration rather than integration. Two other ingredients driving the firm's financing choice are the cost of motivating the employee to exert optimal effort, and the potential synergies between the new project and assets in place. We derive a number of testable predictions regarding a firm's equilibrium choice between integration and non-integration. We also provide a rationale for the negative stub values documented in the equity carve-outs of certain firms (e.g., the carve-out of Palm from 3Com) and develop predictions for the magnitude of these stub values.

Using a Markov chain approach, it shows that both quantitative and qualitative characteristics of FDI affect per capita income and growth. The empirical findings suggest that employment-intensive FDI, concentrated in richer states, has been conducive to income growth, while capital-intensive FDI, concentrated in poorer states, has not. Consequently, FDI has tended to be associated with weaker rather than stronger income convergence among US states. It appears to be less important whether FDI has been undertaken in the manufacturing sector of US states or in other sectors.","[Bode, Eckhardt; Nunnenkamp, Peter] Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24100 Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Nunnenkamp, P (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Hindenburgufer 66, D-24100 Kiel, Germany.",eckhardt.bode@ifw-kiel.de; peter.nunnenkamp@ifw-kiel.de,,,,,,,59,11,11,0,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

An empirical approach, based on an unbalanced panel of Portuguese manufacturing firms covering a 10-year period, is used. The findings confirm that market selection forces low-productivity firms to exit, but there is also evidence that a sizeable portion of low-productivity firms do not shut down. Conversely, there is a non-negligible fraction of high-productivity firms that do actually close. Consistent with some key theoretical predictions, our analysis reveals that exiting firms have a falling productivity level over a number of years prior to exit. Finally, the results from the survival model show that both small firms and ones with low productivity are relatively much more likely to exit the market.

The study pays close attention to a critical role played by broad money and an interest rate term spread in the economy. A vector autoregression reveals two cointegrating relationships, both of which are consistent with macroeconomic theory: the first relationship corresponds to a broad money demand function, while the second represents a monetary policy rule function. The cointegrated system is then reduced to a vector equilibrium correction system, which characterizes the interaction between money demand and monetary policy rule.

We examine whether communication by the European Central Bank (ECB) adds information compared to the information provided by a Taylor rule model in which real-time expected inflation and output growth are used. We use five indicators of ECB communication that are all based on the ECB President's introductory statement at the press conference following an ECB policy meeting. Our results suggest that even though the indicators are sometimes quite different from one another, they add information that helps predict the next policy decision of the ECB. Furthermore, also when the interbank rate is included in our Taylor rule model, the ECB communication indicators remain significant.","[De Haan, Jakob] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Sturm, Jan-Egbert; De Haan, Jakob] ETH, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Zurich, Switzerland; [De Haan, Jakob] DNB, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Sturm, Jan-Egbert; De Haan, Jakob] CESifo Munich, Munich, Germany",University of Groningen; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Ifo Institut,"De Haan, J (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",jakob.de.haan@rug.nl,,"Sturm, Jan-Egbert/0000-0002-9421-5736",,,,,26,52,53,1,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Our analysis begins with the identification of fixed-asset lending technologies used to make small business loans. Our results suggest that large banks do not have equal advantages in all of these hard lending technologies and these advantages are not all increasing monotonically in firm size, contrary to the predictions of the current paradigm.

For example, in 2007, Taiwanese firms accounted for 90% of the world's laptop output. However, over 90% of this output was under the foreign outsourcing firms' brands. This leads to two questions: (i) Why do most subcontractors not establish their own brands in the final goods market? (ii) Under which conditions would those subcontractors be more likely to establish their own brands? This article considers that two players, a US branding firm and a Taiwanese subcontractor, play a hybrid game that decides whether they should cooperate. Under this cooperation scenario, the US branding firm decides to outsource production to the Taiwanese subcontractor and the latter also agrees to take this job. The result shows that without horizontal differentiation, the subcontractor will become a branding firm only if it is subsidized to do so. However, even if the subcontractor and the branding firm remain to have the comparative advantage in production and branding, respectively, if (i) the brands are horizontally differentiated; (ii) the sunk cost to brand is low enough; and (iii) the brand value of this potential branding firm is high enough, then the subcontractor might choose to brand and enter the final goods market even without subsidies.

In contrast, exporters are more sensitive to a lack of information because they have higher losses when there is technology leakage.

The study was conducted by using mail-in questionnaires, which were sent to credit card holders who was using or had used either revolving credit or petty installment plans. According to regression functions, we found that demographic variables and credit card features had limited explanatory power compared to attitude variables and personality variables. Specifically, we found that revolving credit use and petty installment use were closely related to attitudes about credit cards, money and debt. Risk attitude efficiently predicted petty installment use; however, it did not correlate with revolving credit use. Personality factors of self-control, self-esteem, self-efficacy, deferring gratification, internal locus of control and impulsiveness were significantly correlated with revolving credit use; on the other hand, sensation seeking, impulsiveness, and deferring gratification were correlated with petty installment use. We also found that some credit card features easily led to an illusion of income that facilitated consumer credit card debt behavior. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Bootstrap VAR models are pet:An-wed to carry out the short term relationship between inflation and real tax revenues. Bootstrap techniques are preferred to overcome the small sample data problem. Major findings, unlike the expectations with respect to Tanzi effect, show that inflation positively affects the real tax revenues. The impact of the inflation, taken as some sort of hidden tax, is visibly stronger during the period between 1987 and 2005. In addition, the performances of the analytical method and the bootstrap methods are compared, resulting in a better performance in the estimates by bootstrapping.","[Akgul, Isil] Marmara Univ, Dept Econometr, Buffalo, NY USA; [Beser, Mustafa Kemal] Eskisehir Osmangazi Univ, Dept Econ, Iktisadi & Idari Bilimler Fak, TR-26480 Eskisehir, Turkey",Eskisehir Osmangazi University,"Beser, MK (通讯作者)，Eskisehir Osmangazi Univ, Dept Econ, Iktisadi & Idari Bilimler Fak, Meselik Kampusu, TR-26480 Eskisehir, Turkey.",iakgul@marmara.edu.tr; mkbeser@ogu.edu.tr,"Beşer, Mustafa Kemal/JVP-2224-2024","Beşer, Mustafa Kemal/0000-0002-9988-1965",,,,,37,0,0,2,7,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

The model offers a complementary instrument for quickly, promptly assessing the country ratings based on the most relevant characteristics employed by prestigious agencies such as Standard and Poor's, Moody's, the Institutional Investor, etc. The model results are consistent with the ratings provided by these agencies, confirming its usefulness for country risk research.","[Danciu, Aniela-Raluca; Strat, Vasile Alecsandru; Goschin, Zizi] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Dept Stat & Econometr, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,anielaco@hotmail.com; strat_vasile@yahoo.com; zizigoschin@yahoo.com,"Strat, Vasile A/J-5917-2016; GOSCHIN, ZIZI/Y-1227-2019; Strat, Vasile/AAS-3578-2021","GOSCHIN, ZIZI/0000-0002-9030-7772; Strat, Vasile/0000-0002-5074-1419; Constantin, Daniela Luminita/0000-0002-6839-7396",,,,,24,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-6-9,,,,2011,,,,,,,1251,1261,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEO28,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000317550001007,0

Nowadays it is widely recognized that central bank independence accompanied with arrangements like inflation targeting strategy have become largely accepted mechanisms to attain and maintain the price stability objective. In this paper it is presented the importance and the correlation between central bank independence and inflation targeting in four Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC): Czech Republic, Poland, Romania and Hungary. It is important to analyze these countries because of the institutional changes that had been taken starting from 1990s, the increasing and strengthening central bank independence, central bank credibility and the adoption of the inflation targeting strategy within its particularities and different specifications related to each country. In the final section of this paper it is measured central bank independence and inflation targeting in the four CEEC using the Index for central bank independence and inflation targeting (ICBIIT) constructed by the author based on three main pillars: central bank political and legal central bank independence, central bank governance and conduct of monetary policy and central bank transparency and accountability.","[Dumiter, Florin Cornel; David, Delia; Soim, Horatiu] Vasile Goldis Western Univ Arad, Arad, Romania",Vasile Goldis Western University of Arad,,fdumiter@yahoo.com; david_delia2003@yahoo.com; horatiu_soim@yahoo.com,"Dumiter, Florin Cornel/G-9398-2015","Dumiter, Florin Cornel/0000-0002-1043-238X",,,,,20,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-6-9,,,,2011,,,,,,,150,163,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEO28,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000317550000014,0

The general rule is that members of the top management and boards of directors are compensated with large sums of annual bonuses, depending on the corporate financial performance of the previous year. Therefore, top management and boards of directors have incentives to make decisions that have high positive impacts to the corporation in the short-term. Nonetheless, many of those decisions may impact the corporation negatively in the long-term, even yielding to an eventual bankruptcy, but management's only incentive is to make decisions with short-term positive impact. This paper provides a conceptual alternative method of delayed corporate compensation, where the annual bonus is not compensated immediately depending on the financial performance of the corporation in the previous year, but is delayed many years to prove that past management has made decisions for the positive long-term performance of the corporation.","[Galadari, Abdulla] Higher Coll Technol, Dubai, U Arab Emirates",Higher Colleges of Technology - United Arab Emirates,,,"Galadari, Abdulla/B-2328-2017","Galadari, Abdulla/0000-0001-6178-6076",,,,,9,1,1,1,6,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9925-7,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,16.0,,,,,,8,12,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEW95,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000318459200002,0

The forecast densities for inflation reflect the uncertainty across models using many statistical measures of the output gap, and allow for time-variation in the ensemble Phillips curves. Using real-time data for the US, Australia, New Zealand and Norway, we find that the recursive-weight strategy performs well, consistently giving well-calibrated forecast densities. The equal-weight strategy generates poorly-calibrated forecast densities for the US and Australian samples. There is little difference between the two strategies for our New Zealand and Norwegian data.

Logistic and hazard models show that utilities' prices and capacity, and states' stock of own gas wells, prices of competing fuels and the regulatory climate, help explain the pattern of deregulation.

It argues that even though the aid delivery process is represented as a gift, in reality it is more concerned with strengthening the social capital of the local and foreign donors. Through this process there is an expectation and an implicit demand for acquiescence from the beneficiaries, which leaves them with a social debt. This, in turn, compels them to participate in the game of development rituals and ceremonies, in order to express their (ambivalent) gratitude and thankfulness. Through two case studies, we explore how the good intentions of donors to provide aid and alleviate suffering and the acceptance of this aid by the local communities, results in an asymmetric relationship where both become accomplices of Bourdieuian notions of subtle and gentle violence.","[Ruwanpura, Kanchana N.] Univ Southampton, Sch Geog, Southampton SO17 1B1, Hants, England; [Hollenbach, Pia] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Southampton; University of Zurich,"Ruwanpura, KN (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Sch Geog, Shackleton Bldg 2065, Southampton SO17 1B1, Hants, England.",k.n.ruwanpura@soton.ac.uk,,"Hollenbach, Pia/0000-0002-1285-9272",,,,,37,14,15,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

We apply this framework to study the horizon effects in the allocations of equity-only investors, who hold a mix of value and growth indices, and a more general investor, who also has access to Treasury bills and bonds. We find that the mean allocation of equity-only investors is heavily tilted towards value stocks at short-horizons, but the magnitude of this tilt declines dramatically with the investment horizon, implying that growth is less risky than value at long horizons. Investors with access to bills and bonds exhibit similar behavior, when value and growth tilts are computed relative to the total equity allocation of the portfolio. However, after accounting for the propensity of these investors to increase their total equity allocation as the horizon increases, the mean value tilt of the optimal allocation is shown to be positive and stable across time.","[Jurek, Jakub W.] Princeton Univ, Bendheim Ctr Finance, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Viceira, Luis M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Princeton University; Harvard University,"Jurek, JW (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Bendheim Ctr Finance, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,,,,,,53,26,31,2,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

In 1996, the government ceased to index the education subsidy for inflation, which created a natural experiment ideal for studying the effect of the education subsidy on fertility. Using the difference-in-differences approach, we find that the reform reduced the fertility probability for public-sector households by 17 per cent and this negative response appears to be permanent. The estimated probability elasticity of fertility is 0.05, which is smaller than that of personal tax exemption (0.8).

Contrary to other sectors, pharmaceutical products take somewhere thirteen to fifteen years to receive FDA approval. In the US strong patent protection mechanisms are present in comparison to Japan and Italy, where only processes can be protected not products. It has been learnt that strong appropriablity regime drives innovation by acting as an incentive for research and development investments. However, on the flip side of the tight control only two out of ten launched drugs generates sales that are equal to or exceed their research and development costs. Rise in the number of patents maybe due to patent overlapping for patent evergreening purposes. Positive correlation has been found in the specialization of US Pharmaceutical sector, the investment in the industry and the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RTA>1). The highly regulated industry with longer product development cycles and greater R&D investment has not only differentiated it from other industries in the US, but also has provided it with a lead over pharmaceutical industries in other countries.","[Khan, Saif Ullah] Univ Peshawar, Inst Management Studies, Peshawar, Pakistan; [Tariq, Muhammad] Sarhad Univ Sci & Informat Technol, Peshawar, Pakistan",University of Peshawar,"Khan, SU (通讯作者)，Univ Peshawar, Inst Management Studies, Peshawar, Pakistan.",,"Khan, Saif/IQU-2754-2023",,,,,,18,2,2,0,8,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9175-6,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,14.0,,,,,,11,19,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8ZN,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000392896300003,0

However, Indonesia has been an outlier within the region. Inflows of FDI have been lower to Indonesia than to other countries, especially in manufacturing, and they have been lower than could be expected from Indonesia's size, population and other country characteristics. We show that the inflows that have occurred have benefited Indonesia, and use the East Asian experience to identify measures that are likely to increase these flows.

The author compared the objectives and tools of companies in each country with the other and with the code of CG of its own country. Results are in line with previous research that issuing reports about CG is more by UAE companies comparing to Egypt. Also it was found that public companies in Egypt are more concerned with adopting and reporting CG than private companies there unlike in the UAE where such distinction did not appear.

It utilizes simulations (Vensim Software) and dynamic systems in a vegetable oil manufacturing firm in Iran. At first, the cause and effect diagrams of the model are shown via Delphi techniques, and then the statistical distribution of different factors affecting various parts of the model is determined by the Arena Software. Consequently the effect of different parts of the model on other parts is analyzed via the dynamic system. Then, by obtaining financial data relating to a digital generator, the cost- benefit of the model is determined from profit status views. The results of this study exhibit that the designated simulation model is potent and was able to indentify 5 factors influencing the repair time. The power disconnection (C.V=1.48), is indeed the most negative factor affecting the system. In addition, the profitability of the model can be enhanced 8.66% by investing in a digital generator.","[Namazi, Mohammad] Shiraz Univ, Accounting Dept, Shiraz, Iran; [Forougozar, Hamed] Islamic Azad Univ, Shiraz Branch, Dept Ind Management, Tehran, Iran; [Namazi, Navid Reza] Shiraz Univ, Dept Accounting, Accounting, Shiraz, Iran",Shiraz University; Islamic Azad University; Shiraz University,"Namazi, M (通讯作者)，Shiraz Univ, Accounting Dept, Shiraz, Iran.",mnamazi@rose.shirazu.ac.ir,"Namazi, Mohammad/I-4390-2014; Namazi, Navidreza/W-5676-2018","Namazi, Mohammad/0000-0002-0342-7603; Namazi, Navidreza/0000-0002-4030-9585",,,,,11,0,0,0,2,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9084-1,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,11.0,,,,,,373,378,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000392766500072,0

The theoretical survey in this research work yielded a six-blocked schematization of origins of inflation; monetary shocks, Demand side, supply-side (or real) shocks, structural and political factors (or the role of institutions).

However, the question of whether the trend growth rate of aggregate productivity has changed significantly is rarely examined formally. This paper examines the latest aggregate labour productivity data for Canada using a new testing approach specifically designed to detect recent changes in trends. In addition to showing the strength of the evidence for changes in long-run trends, it considers the effect that data revision and changing sample period has had on inference about structural changes. In an appendix, it investigates how large such changes must be before they can be detected and to what degree detection tends to lag the structural change. Evidence of a decline in the trend rate of labour productivity growth in Canada since 1990 is mixed. In particular, conclusions vary considerably from year to year as data are revised and as the accumulation of observations after purported breaks changes initial perceptions. The instability of test results suggest that policymakers need to use extreme caution in interpreting claims of changes in labour productivity trends and highlight the uncertainty that they face.

Larger urban households that have greater financial and social capital, and/or whose members have an elementary or secondary education, are more likely to participate. Corruption at the local parliament and local government levels reduces the number of participants, while higher-quality formal institutions and infrastructure boost entrepreneurship. The period is marked by a rise in participation in 2000, but communities that experienced a loss in well-being due to the crisis were less likely to participate in micro-entrepreneurship.","[Vial, Virginie] Euromed Management, Marseille, France; [Vial, Virginie] Ctr Rech Dev Econ & Finance Int, Aix En Provence, France",,"Vial, V (通讯作者)，Euromed Management, Marseille, France.",,"Vial, Virginie/AAD-4491-2022",,,,,,32,20,20,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

By using a pre-election survey from 2007, it is first demonstrated that migrants vote differently than non-migrants. Then province-level election data is brought into the analysis to determine whether migrants political tendencies are associated more with the voting patterns prevailing in their host provinces or the provinces they are originally from. According to the results of the econometric models estimated, a positive and significant 'origin' effect exists Jar most migrants, but a significant 'destination' effect is lacking. The origin effect estimate implies that if the vote share of a party exceeds its nationwide average by 10 percentage points in a given province, then the probability that this party will be chosen fry a migrant born in that province increases by about 5 percentage points. This finding is attributed to continued cultural and economic ties of the migrants with their origins and with fellow migrants from their hometowns at their destinations.","[Akarca, Ali T.] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Baslevent, Cem] Istanbul Bilgi Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Istanbul Bilgi University,"Akarca, AT (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Mc 144,601 S Morgan St, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",akarca@uic.edu; cbaslevent@bilgi.edu.tr,,,,,,,59,13,14,0,13,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

We consider the case in which the government finances its spending by levying distortionary taxes and issuing state-contingent debt. While in a closed economy taxes are essentially invariant, in an open economy taxes can be as volatile as output. This is because the presence of a terms of trade externality introduces efficient fluctuations in the consumption-leisure wedge driven by movements in the real exchange rate. As a result, the optimal fiscal rule suggests that taxes should be varied to replicate these fluctuations.","[Benigno, Gianluca] London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Benigno, G (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, London, England.",g.benigno@lse.ac.uk; bianca.depaoli@bankofengland.co.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,50,14,19,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

The theoretical literature on IPOs has long argued that institutional investors possess private information about IPOs and that underpricing is a mechanism for compensating them to reveal this private information. We study whether institutions indeed have private information about IPOs, retain their information advantage in post-IPO trading, and are able to realize significant profits from their participation in IPOs. We also study institutional IPO allocations and allocation sales to analyze whether institutions play an important role in supporting IPOs in the aftermarket and are rewarded by underwriters for playing such a role. We find that institutions sell 70.2% of their IPO allocations in the first year, fully realize the money left on the table, and do not dissipate these profits in post-IPO trading. Further, institutions hold allocations in IPOs with weaker post-issue demand for a longer period, and they are rewarded for this by underwriters with more IPO allocations. Finally, institutional trading has predictive power for long-run IPO performance, especially in IPOs in which they received allocations; however, this predictive power decays over time. Overall, our results suggest that institutional investors possess significant private information about IPOs, play an important supportive role in the IPO aftermarket, and receive considerable compensation for their participation in IPOs.","[Chemmanur, Thomas J.] Boston Coll, Carroll Sch Management, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA; [Hu, Gang] Babson Coll, Babson Pk, MA 02157 USA; [Huang, Jiekun] Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Business, Singapore, Singapore",Boston College; Babson College; National University of Singapore,"Chemmanur, TJ (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Carroll Sch Management, Fulton Hall 330, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",chemmanu@bc.edu,"; Huang, Jiekun/D-7901-2017","HU, Gang/0000-0001-6088-4707; Huang, Jiekun/0000-0002-4015-080X",,,,,36,88,108,3,57,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Expansion into noninterest income-generating activities such as trading increases the rate of return on assets, and it could offer some risk diversification benefits at very low levels. Nondeposit, wholesale funding in contrast lowers the rate of return on assets, while it can offer some risk reduction at commonly observed low levels of nondeposit funding. A sizable proportion of banks, however, attract most of their short-term funding in the form of nondeposits at a cost of enhanced bank fragility. Overall, banking strategies that rely prominently on generating noninterest income or attracting nondeposit funding are very risky, consistent with the demise of the US investment banking sector.

After a literature review, the paper discusses several approaches useful for detecting asset price busts. Considering a sample of 17 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development industrialized countries and the euro area over the period 1969 Q1-2008 Q3, an asset price composite indicator incorporating developments in both stock and house price markets is constructed and a criterion to identify the periods characterized by asset price busts is proposed. The empirical analysis is based on a pooled probit-type approach with several monetary, financial and real variables. According to statistical tests, credit aggregates (either in terms of annual changes or growth gap), changes in nominal long-term interest rates and investment-to-GDP ratios jointly with either house or stock price dynamics turn out to be the best indicators helping to forecast asset price busts up to eight quarters in advance. Some robustness checks indicate that both the method used to identify asset price busts and the choice of the binary variable are reliable.","[Gerdesmeier, Dieter; Roffia, Barbara] European Cent Bank, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany; [Reimers, Hans-Eggert] Hsch Wismar, Fak Wiztschaft, D-23952 Wismar, Germany",European Central Bank,"Gerdesmeier, D (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Kaiserstr 29, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany.",dieter.gerdesmeier@ecb.int; hans-eggert.reimers@hs-wismar.de; barbara.roffia@ecb.int,,,,,,,37,34,38,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

We show that this measure is given by the Gamma of the American option at the optimal exercise boundary. More precisely, if B is the optimal exercise price, but exercise is either brought forward when or delayed until a price (B) over tilde has been reached, the cost of suboptimal exercise is given by 1/2 x Gamma(B) x (B - (B) over tilde)(2), where Gamma(B) denotes the American option Gamma.

In particular, ex-ante evidence indicates that the incorporation of option implied volatility and trading volume into an EGARCH model leads to outperformance over other alternate forecast approaches. Noticeably, abnormal returns obtained from trading simulation underscores the improvement in forecast accuracy to be economically significant.

We use a total of 16 countries and regions, both including those that are industrialized, such as Japan, the US, and the EU, and developing countries, such as China, Brazil, the Philippines, and Peru. Our simulation results show that a permanent immigration flows of 150,000 will improve the Japanese economy and the welfare of current and future generations. On the other hand, a standalone increase in the consumption tax will not improve long-run welfare. The results indicate that substantially increased inflows of working-age immigrants would alleviate the need for future fiscal reform and also help to dramatically reduce the public pension burden on the working generations.

Although aggregate data often indicate a shift in favor of FIEs, indigenous firms in many cases have slowly increased market share and deepened their technical capabilities. Through an analysis of aggregate data and three sectors, we show how the dynamics of competition between Chinese and FIEs in China's domestic market enhance the upgrading prospects for Chinese firms. China represents a new model of development in several important respects: industrial upgrading efforts are often domestically driven, within this domestic market there is intense competition between both domestic and foreign firms, and this competition is driving and stimulating the upgrading efforts of domestic firms.

The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment is built on a conceptual framework that links biodiversity with the services ecosystems provide to society and human welfare. Numerous empirical studies have measured ecosystem goods and services in terms of economic values; however, less evidence is available of the indirect effect of biodiversity on these values. Based on this, we first compile market and non-market forest valuation studies and, secondly, explore the potential of an econometric modelling exercise by conducting a worldwide meta-analysis. This exercise aims to highlight the role of biodiversity indicators on valuation. In this way, we can study the underlying transmission mechanisms that explain to what extent biodiversity is related to human welfare. Furthermore, we also propose to evaluate the magnitudes of the respective distributional impacts, including the different ecosystem goods and services under consideration. Our results show that biodiversity indicators may have an underlying effect on forest ecosystem values, which also depend on the type of ecosystem services. Lastly, the results are discussed and analysed with respect to their policy implications concerning biodiversity conservation.","[Ojea, Elena] Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Bilbao 48009, Spain; [Nunes, Paulo A.

Obviously, children do not act autonomously and their travel behaviours also strongly influence their parents' travel behaviours. Therefore, a better understanding of children's travel behaviours seems necessary. This paper reports the results of a large-scale, self-reporting survey (N = 2546) that was conducted to examine the concept and meaning of travel and travel behaviour of children aged between 10 and 13 years in Flanders. It was found that children are able to complete a travel diary on their own, that their travel patterns differ and that the most important part of travelling for them is the social aspect.

To this end, we employ an innovative experimental design which enables us to reproduce ambiguity in the laboratory in a transparent and non-probabilistic way. We find that judging theories on the basis of their theoretical appeal, or on their ability to do well in terms of estimation, is not the same as judging them on the basis of their predictive power. We find that the models that perform better in an aggregate sense are Gilboa and Schmeidler's MaxMin and MaxMax Expected Utility Models, and Ghiradarto et al.'s Alpha Model, implying that more elegant theoretical models do not perform as well as relatively simple models. This suggests that decision-makers, when confronted with a difficult problem, try to simplify it, rather than apply a sophisticated decision rule.","[Hey, John D.] LUISS, Rome, Italy; [Hey, John D.] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Lotito, Gianna] Univ Piemonte Orientale, Alessandria, Italy; [Maffioletti, Anna] Univ Turin, Turin, Italy",Luiss Guido Carli University; University of York - UK; University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro; University of Turin,"Hey, JD (通讯作者)，LUISS, Rome, Italy.",jdh1@york.ac.uk,"maffioletti, anna/AAL-1272-2021","Lotito, Gianna/0000-0002-0295-6730",,,,,21,71,79,2,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

Our results show that these relationships can be conceptualized as forming non-linear multi-directional, locally-contingent mobility 'systems'. Two such systems were identified: the first centred on the communal area within the retirement community and the second focused on the senior centre. The types of non-movement, movement and communicative travel that form each of these mobility chains, the number and variety of spaces connected and consequently the form and nature of the social relations created exhibit both similarities and differences. The mobility systems created by residents of the retirement community connect and flow through more spaces, involve a greater variety of movement and non-movement and are more varied than the senior centre users' mobility chains. For both populations the place-bound and place-creating social relations that result from and generate movement, non-movement and communicative travel occur as individuals carry out daily errands and routines. For the users of the senior centre, interaction/participation by definition is the result of routine and repeated planned presence at the senior centre. Once at the centre, contact and participation predominately result from engaging in pre-arranged organised activities. For retirement community residents interaction occurs as a result of within-community movement, extensive travel outside the community and periods spent at home alone. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper develops a model of the international transmission of shocks due to interdependent portfolio holdings among leverage-constrained investors. In our model, without leverage constraints on investment, financial integration itself has no implication for international macro comovements. When leverage constraints bind, however, the presence of these constraints in combination with diversified portfolios introduces a powerful financial transmission channel that results in a positive comovement of production, independently of the size of international trade linkages. In addition, the paper shows that with binding leverage constraints, the type of financial integration is critical for international comovement. If international financial markets allow for trade only in noncontingent bonds, but not equities, then the international comovement of shocks is negative. Thus, with leverage constraints, moving from bond trade to equity trade reverses the sign of the international transmission of shocks.","[Devereux, Michael B.] Univ British Columbia, NBER, CEPR, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Devereux, MB (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, NBER, CEPR, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",devm@interchange.ubc.ca; james.yetman@bis.org,,,,,,,33,117,131,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

We illustrate the accuracy of the method in handling several realistic features of portfolio choice problems such as intermediate consumption, multiple assets, multiple state variables, portfolio constraints, non-time-separable preferences, and nonredundant endogenous state variables.

Using data from the Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics, we estimate a significant gap of 43 percent in private pension income and 30 percent in private pension contributions between immigrants and the native born. The gap in public pension incomes is negligible and reduces the overall pension gap, but only partially. Furthermore, the pension income and contribution gap is significantly larger for more recently arrived immigrant cohorts, consistent with evidence of weaker earnings for this group. We provide age profiles of pension income and contributions and discuss problems in interpreting the results without adjusting for age. Controlling for age and earnings differences, immigrants are still about II percent less likely to make contributions to a private pension program, but there is no difference in the contribution rates out of earnings of those who contribute. Recently arrived immigrants are significantly less likely to make contributions to a private pension program and appear to be neglecting private pension contribution opportunities more than earlier immigrants and the native born, which may have adverse implications for Canada's public retirement programs.","[Hum, Derek; Simpson, Wayne] Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada",University of Manitoba,"Hum, D (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.",,,,,,,,14,9,10,0,7,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

First, there is no disparity in the income and returns-to-education benefits of democratic reform across genders in Nigeria. Second, there are no within-gender disparities in the impact of democratic reform on income and returns to education in Nigeria. From the results, both hypotheses are rejected.

This logic is subsequently applied to a group of remarkably dynamic, high-growth firms: gazelles. Strategic management theory emphasises the importance of firms adjusting strategies in response to changes in the external environment. In our study, it is used to explain several key empirical findings using a novel British data set containing information on more than 100 gazelles. These findings help explain: (1) why Gibrat's Law of random firm growth processes does not generally hold, (2) which strategy and environmental variables have a predictable influence on firm performance and (3) why routine application of 'best practice' strategies is unlikely to foster firm growth in a changing economic environment.

From a geographical diversification point of view, trade facilitation at home is an important complement to improving market access abroad. Customs procedures and document preparation in exporting countries have particularly strong effects. Trade costs in general have larger effects in manufacturing, and highly differentiated sectors.

Using a life-cycle model with a version of a Ben-Porath (1967) human capital accumulation technology, stationary equilibria of calibrated cases are analyzed in which risk arises from specialization risk and career risk. With career risk only, stationary equilibria resemble those studied by Aiyagari (1994), and the impact of uninsurable idiosyncratic risk is relatively small. With a significant amount of specialization risk, however, stationary equilibria are severely distorted, with human capital about 57 percent as large as its complete markets counterpart.

J,"Aminian, N; Calderon, C",,,,"Aminian, Nathalie; Calderon, Cuauhtemoc",,,Prospects for Closer Economic Cooperation in Northeast Asia,REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT,"In contrast to developments in other world regions, efforts to institutionalize regional economic cooperation in East Asia have been weak. Though Southeast Asian economies have taken action toward trade liberalization (ASEAN Free Trade Area), the major economies of the region such as China, Japan, and Korea have not been part of any formal trade groupings until recently. However, given the slow pace of progress within AFTA and the importance of the Northeast Asian countries in terms of weight in the Asian economy, a de facto Northeast Asian economic cooperation is a necessary condition for East Asian integration. This paper investigates the substance of recent economic cooperation in Northeast Asia. The trilateral economic cooperation is analyzed through examination of trade and direct investment links for 1990-2004, and estimation of selected determinants of direct investment, in particular the relationship between trade and FDI. Estimation results suggest that the main driving forces for direct investment outflows from the source country have been the falling-off of exchange rate risk, the level of the nominal bilateral exchange rates, growth rate of the recipient country, and the per capita GDP gap between source and host countries. Bilateral trade has been shown to be statistically insignificant.","[Calderon, Cuauhtemoc] El Colegio Frontera Norte, Dept Estudios Econ, Tijuana 22709, Mexico; [Aminian, Nathalie] Univ Havre, Dept Econ, F-76057 Le Havre, France",Colegio Frontera Norte; Universite Le Havre Normandie,"Calderon, C (通讯作者)，El Colegio Frontera Norte, Dept Estudios Econ, Km 18-5 Carretera Escen Tijuana, Tijuana 22709, Mexico.",nathalie.aminian@univ-lehavre.fr; ccalderon22@hotmail.com,"Villarreal, Cuauhtemoc Calderon/I-8458-2019; Aminian, Nathalie/ABD-2404-2021","Villarreal, Cuauhtemoc Calderon/0000-0001-9663-7759;",,,,,16,2,3,0,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1363-6669,,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

In addition, by randomising respondents into one of two groups (assessing happiness before and after the event or only after), we are also able to show that previously focusing on an event can affect subsequent happiness responses. From a final sample of 309 soccer fans contacted via a social networking site, the happiness ratings of the fans of the losing team who answered before and after the soccer match is a whole point lower (on a 0-10 scale) than similar fans who rated their happiness only after the event.

Scale economies in production are of three types: internal economies associated with large plants, localization economies that come from sharing of inputs and infrastructure and from greater competition among firms, and urbanization economies that are generated through diversity and knowledge spillovers. The benefits (and costs) of localization and urbanization are together called external (dis) economies because they arise due to factors outside any single household, farm or firm. The empirical literature yields some stylized facts. Internal scale economies are low in light industries and high in heavy industries. External scale economies are amplified by economic density and dissipate with distance from places where economic activity is concentrated. Scale economies are most visibly manifest in towns and cities. To simplify somewhat, towns allow firms and farms to exploit internal scale economies, medium-sized cities help firms in an industry exploit localization economies, and large cities and metropolises provide urbanization economies to those who locate within or nearby. Scale economies have implications for policy makers. The first is that because urban settlements rise and thrive because market agents demand their services, they should be seen as creatures of the market, not creations of the state. The second is that because settlements of different sizes provide differing services, towns, cities, and metropolises are more often complements for one another, not substitutes. Third, as a corollary, policymakers should aim to improve the functioning of urban settlements, and not become preoccupied with their size.

On the other hand, banks lend more to large enterprises and to the government if the legal system is unsound.

A static private investment function is derived from the neoclassical framework, with appropriate modifications to account for the structural features observed in the country. To introduce dynamics into the model, we adopt a cost minimization problem, which assumes firms optimize investment levels with respect to a quadratic loss function. The results suggest that the availability of financial resources in the economy has a significant positive impact on private investment. Macroeconomic uncertainty exerts a negative influence on the investment climate in the private sector. Both foreign direct investment and public investment are found to have a complementary effect on private investment. Consistent with the prediction of the neoclassical model, a higher level of aggregate output raises private investment, whereas the user cost of capital has the opposite impact.

The data, 1995-2000 holdings of over 20,000 clients at a large German broker, are consistent with the predictions of the hypothesis: the returns of stocks within each portfolio have remarkably similar volatilities, when stocks are sold they are replaced by stocks of similar volatilities, and the more risk-averse customers indeed hold less volatile stocks.

Exercising a first-mover advantage, the incumbent increases his share of surplus by issuing public debt that appreciates in the event of merger. Incumbent debt reduces the equilibrium value of entrant assets and thus reduces the return to (likelihood of) entry through two channels: venture capitalists recover less in default and ownership rights provide weaker managerial incentives. High incumbent leverage has a countervailing cost, since the resulting debt overhang prevents ex post efficient mergers if merger surplus is low. Event risk covenants limiting counterparty debt are optimal for the incumbent, further limiting the entrant's share of merger surplus. A poison-put covenant is also optimal for the incumbent, allowing him to extract the same surplus with lower debt face value.

The wage elasticity of employment increases after trade liberalization. Nevertheless, output elasticity of labor demand is higher than wage elasticity in the total manufacturing sector for the whole estimation period, and in the high- and medium-skilled sectors in the post-1980 period. Trade effects, after controlling for output, seem to have a low economic significance. The positive effects of exports on the labor intensity of production are low or are offset by labor saving effects of foreign trade, particularly in the high- and medium-skilled sectors. On the other hand, there is some evidence of a negative import effect in the low-skilled sectors, whereas in the high- and medium-skilled group a complementary relation between domestic labor and imported inputs dominates the effects.","[Aydiner-Avsar, Nursel] Univ Utah, Dept Econ, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Onaran, Oezlem] Middlesex Univ, Dept Econ & Stat, London N17 8HR, England",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Middlesex University,"Aydiner-Avsar, N (通讯作者)，Univ Utah, Dept Econ, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",,,"Onaran, Ozlem/0000-0002-6345-9922; Aydiner-Avsar, Nursel/0000-0002-4228-9020",,,,,58,13,16,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0012-1533,,,DEV ECON,Dev.

Empirical results from behavioural economics provide a reminder that human behaviour is context-dependent, implying that policy may go awry if based upon models of behaviour which are inappropriate to the contexts in which decisions are made. Recognizing that agents may, in some contexts, systematically make mistakes raises challenging questions about the role of paternalism in government policy. The paper considers the research into hyperbolic discounting, and examines the implications for environmental policy. We develop a model of resource management under hyperbolic discounting, which shows that if a planner is unable to commit to a policy, the temptation to re-evaluate the policy in future could lead to an inadvertent collapse in the stocks of a natural resource.","[Hepburn, Cameron] New Coll, Oxford OX1 3BN, England; [Hepburn, Cameron] Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, Oxford OX1 2BQ, England; [Duncan, Stephen; Papachristodoulou, Antonis] Univ Oxford, Dept Engn Sci, Oxford OX1 3PJ, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Hepburn, C (通讯作者)，New Coll, Holywell St, Oxford OX1 3BN, England.",cameron.hepburn@new.ox.ac.uk; stephen.duncan@eng.ox.ac.uk; antonis@eng.ox.ac.uk,"Papachristodoulou, Antonis/C-2597-2012","Papachristodoulou, Antonis/0000-0002-3565-8967; Hepburn, Cameron/0000-0003-0467-7441",EPSRC [EP/H03062X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/H03062X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),,,97,45,48,1,51,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

I utilize an instrumental variables strategy that exploits a change in the formula used by the federal government to allocate funding to the states. Identification is achieved by the fact that different birth cohorts were exposed to different degrees to the original formula and the new formula, along with the fact that the change of the formula affected states differentially by per capita income. Participation in the program as a child appears to have few long-run effects on health, but the effects on educational attainment are sizable. These results may suggest that subsidized lunches induced children to attend school but displaced food consumption from other sources. Alternatively, the program may have had short-run health effects that dissipated over time but that facilitated higher educational attainment.

Higher prices increase the value of collateral and net wealth of borrowers and thus reduce the likelihood of credit defaults. In contrast, persistent deviations from fundamentals may foster the adverse selection of increasingly risky creditors by banks seeking to expand their loan portfolios, which increases bank distress probabilities. We test these hypotheses using unique data on real estate markets and banks in Germany. House price deviations contribute to bank instability, but nominal house price developments do not.

EU membership reduces DD while it increases LD. The negative effect on DD captures the increased confidence of the private sector in the domestic currency, as they consider the EU admission process a reflection of their government's commitment to promoting policies of long-run currency stability. The positive impact on credit dollarization is the outcome of a greater convergence of exchange rates to the euro and the subsequent anticipation of lower currency risk, which diminishes the cost of foreign currency borrowing.","Univ Manchester, Econ & Ctr Growth & Business Cycle Res, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Neanidis, KC (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Econ & Ctr Growth & Business Cycle Res, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",kyriakos.neanidis@manchester.ac.uk,,"Neanidis, Kyriakos/0000-0001-5258-2688",,,,,17,11,13,0,8,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1367-0271,,,INT FINANC,Int.

Countries that experience takeoffs average 2.3% annual growth following their stagnation episodes, while those that do not average 0%. Using probit, we find that de jure trade openness is positively and significantly associated with takeoffs. A one-standard-deviation increase in de jure trade openness is associated with a 55% increase in the probability of a takeoff in our default specification. Capital account openness encourages takeoff responses, but measures of de facto trade openness are found to be poor predictors of takeoffs. We also examine the determinants of nations achieving sustained takeoffs; i.e. those lasting eight years or longer.

This even occurs in the absence of a taste for discrimination against ethnic minorities or exogenous differences in distance to jobs. Because of the initial wealth difference, minorities cannot afford to buy a car while whites can. Car ownership allows whites to reach more jobs per unit of time, which gives them a better bargaining position in the labor market. As a result, in equilibrium, ethnic minorities end up with both higher unemployment rates and lower wages than whites. Furthermore, we also show that it takes more time for minorities to reach their jobs even though they travel less miles when employed. Those predictions are consistent with the data. Better access to capital markets or better public transportation will reduce the differences in labor-market outcomes. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Chandler's work highlighted the complicated interplay between markets and firms, especially the arrangements created by firms to buffer and manage market forces. Arguably his most important work examines one aspect of firms, organizational structure, and how it changed in response to the competitive needs of growing businesses. Much the same approach can be applied to understanding other aspects of firms such as the structure of the most important jobs in corporations, executive positions, and how those positions have been filled over time. Here the interplay includes a different market, the labor market. The arguments that follow trace the evolution of executive roles from the early days of corporations, where executive jobs were largely shaped by the labor market, to internalized and bureaucratized arrangements consistent with the idea of an integrated Chandlerian firm after the 1950s, back to something much closer to the market-dominated approach following the 1982 recession. In large measure, the change seems driven by the different context that business faced and the interplay with labor markets that made internal development more difficult. The implications for the future of large-scale Chandlerian firms may be considerable.","Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Cappelli, P (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 2205 Steinberg Hall,Dietrich Hall, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",cappelli@wharton.upenn.edu,,,,,,,95,9,16,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

The total economic value of a given transport service can be classified into use, option and non-use values, but other grouping rules can be applied, respectively. The use value is the consumer's surplus from the actual ride of a specific mode. The option value, on the other hand, can be defined as a traveller's willingness to pay for reserving a travel mode, which is not his or her main choice, as a standby alternative. Finally, the non-use value represents benefits that are not attributable to the actual use or option use, but to the vicarious, altruistic, functional and existing worth of a transport service. A random stated preference survey based on a double-bounded dichotomous choice is conducted. A survival model is applied to the data collected. Calculations are based on trip makers' willingness to pay for option and non-use values, using the parameters of the estimated survival model. Some concluding remarks are also presented.

In this paper, we formulate two types of demand models for home safety: a model for barrier-free conversion and a model for seismic retrofit based on a logit model. We explore statistically the factors that affect the demand for each improvement using prefectural data in Japan. We also analyze statistically the significance and impact of financial support programs for improving existing houses, which the Japanese government has implemented at the prefectural and municipal level. The results clarify the differences between the determinants of each type of improvement and show that the support program for barrier-free conversion has a positive and statistically significant effect on households' preference. However, neither the seismic test nor the seismic retrofit program conducted by prefectures has a positive impact on preference, whereas those by municipalities do affect preference.

Furthermore, we show that the increase and subsequent reversal is concentrated among firms with low stock prices and high retail ownership. This evidence suggests that the increase in idiosyncratic volatility through the 1990s was not a time trend but, rather, an episodic phenomenon, at least partially associated with retail investors. Results from cross-sectional regressions, conditional trend estimation, stock-split events, and attention-grabbing events are consistent with a retail trading effect.

The paper finds that households respond to crop losses primarily by intensifying fishing effort, not by relying on gathering of nontimber forest products, hunting, or asset liquidation. This ex post labor adjustment helps to smooth total income against small crop losses but less well against large crop losses. Both relatively nonpoor households with better fishing capital and poor young households with a physical labor advantage employ this natural insurance in rivers.","[Takasaki, Yoshito] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058571, Japan; [Barham, Bradford L.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Coomes, Oliver T.] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada",University of Tsukuba; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; McGill University,"Takasaki, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058571, Japan.",takasaki@sk.tsukuba.ac.jp; barham@aae.wisc.edu; oliver.coomes@mcgill.ca,,"Takasaki, Yoshito/0000-0002-4324-4668; Coomes, Oliver T/0000-0002-8220-8758",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [21653022] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,22,33,42,0,23,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1363-6669,,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Such separation of activities into discrete pieces is commonly termed the fragmentation of activity. Regrettably, only limited empirical evidence is available on the fragmentation of work activity and the factors that contribute to it. The goal of this paper is to extend the previous work in the activity fragmentation arena in three ways: (i) to operationalize measures of spatial fragmentation and reformulate some of the temporal fragmentation measures for the specific purpose of investigating the fragmentation of the work activity; (ii) to analyse fragmentation not only in terms of the individual indicators, but also as a multi-dimensional construct including all dimensions of spatial and temporal fragmentation collectively: (iii) to test a detailed set of ICT-related, work related, and sociodemographic variables to identify the factors that are crucial in the occurrence of the fragmentation of the work activity. The study shows that there is heterogeneity in the fragmentation of work. Three internally homogenous patterns of fragmentation, which diverge in the degree of fragmentation, are identified: (I) a less temporally and spatially fragmented work pattern: (2) a less spatially and more temporally fragmented work pattern; (3) a more spatially and temporally fragmented work pattern. The multiple discriminant analysis Suggests that ICT variables and work-related variables as well as personal-household attributes are associated with the fragmentation of work. However, the degree of association differs considerably among representative patterns of fragmentation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Reputable fund managers exhibit one-year performance persistence for managing new funds, which can help investors assess managers when selecting funds. We also find that the decrease in information asymmetry associated with managerial reputation benefits investors by leading to an increase in new fund returns in the short run, compared to those of new funds run by managers without track records. Overall, the reputation stretching strategy benefits both investors, by reducing information asymmetry and improving investment returns, and fund families, by increasing net fund inflows to new equity funds.

Our results indicate that greater cash holdings are associated with higher levels of investment for constrained firms with high hedging needs and that the association between investment and value is stronger for constrained firms than for unconstrained firms. These findings imply that higher cash holdings allow constrained firms to undertake value-increasing projects that might otherwise be bypassed. We further find that some constrained firms exhibit low cash holdings because of persistently low cash flows.

However, the analysis suggests that the relationship between the global economic crisis, budget deficits, inflation and the declining stock market as well as the fall in international oil prices on the one hand, weak economic policies monitoring and implementation in Nigeria on the other coupled with complex and unending political corruption, constantly escalate the risks of failure associated with policy reform programmes. The paper demonstrates that constant changes and inconsistencies in government policies and corruption lead to wild adjustments in the quality of results from the various reforms over the years. In view of the above, reform programmes in Nigeria often become a thing of the past in the midst of structural corruption, poor budgetary implementation and a political quagmire - a common phenomenon in Nigeria's governance system. It therefore becomes imperative that corrupt political machinations and budgetary indiscipline are totally insulated from the seven-point agenda if policy goal are to be achieved even with the current economic crisis. Finally, the results from the analysis suggest that the current economic crisis and budget deficit will have a significant effect on the expected impact of the seven-point agenda.","[Eamon, Lenihan; Onakuse, Stephen] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Ctr Sustainable Livelihoods, Cork, Ireland",University College Cork,"Éamon, L (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Ctr Sustainable Livelihoods, Cork, Ireland.",elenihan@ucc.ie; s.onakuse@ucc.ie,"Onakuse, Stephen/AAZ-4472-2020","Onakuse, Stephen/0000-0002-6070-3248",,,,,14,0,0,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2123-6,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2010,,,,,,,105,116,,,,,,12,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA6AE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000337077600013,0

Specifically, it examines the impact of foreign aid on real per capita income growth in SIDS by econometrically analysing cross-country data for the period 1980 to 2004.

We show that, when constant market presence is costly, purely idiosyncratic shocks lead to endogenous demand of liquidity and large price deviations from fundamentals. Moreover, market forces fail to lead to efficient supply of liquidity, which calls for potential policy interventions. However, we demonstrate that different policy tools can yield different efficiency consequences. For example, lowering the cost of supplying liquidity on the spot (e.g., through direct injection of liquidity or relaxation of ex post margin constraints) can decrease welfare while forcing more liquidity supply (e.g., through coordination of market participants) can improve welfare.

The information acquisition behaviour of consumers regarding additional ethical values of organic food was analysed by means of an Information-Display-Matrix (IDM) and an accompanying consumer survey in five European countries. Seven ethical attributes were tested of which 'animal welfare', 'regional production' and 'fair prices for farmers' were identified to be most important. Consumers showed an increased willingness to pay for organic food with these additional ethical attributes. Thus, producers of organic food should increasingly focus on additional ethical attributes such as 'animal welfare', 'local production' and 'fair prices for farmers' in production and communication with consumers. With respect to the methodology used, the IDM turned out to be helpful in reducing the problem of social desirability of answers.","[Zander, Katrin] Univ Kassel, Fachgebiet Agr & Lebensmittelmkt, D-37213 Witzenhausen, Germany",Universitat Kassel,"Zander, K (通讯作者)，Univ Kassel, Fachgebiet Agr & Lebensmittelmkt, Steinstr 19, D-37213 Witzenhausen, Germany.",k.zander@uni-kassel.de,"Hamm, Ulrich/AAI-6552-2020; Hamm, Ulrich/F-7886-2013; Zander, Katrin/H-8803-2016",,,,,,31,11,12,2,31,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

We also employ the Cointegration and Granger Causality Test to test the relationship between the population dependency ratios and the savings rate and the relationship between the relative productivity differences and the current account balance. We find that the family planning policy can be sustainable. The current account balance is just the transfer of savings over time and space. The demographic structure determines the savings transfer over time, while the relative productivity difference determines the savings transfer across the space. This transfer does not change the total welfare calculated on the basis of nations or generations. Consequently, focusing too much on improving the consumption rate to boost the economy without consideration of demographic structure transition needs further serious discussion.

We study the experience of the Stockholm Stock Exchange, where listed firms contract directly with LPs. Our analysis offers insights regarding situations where designated liquidity provision may be beneficial. In addition, we consider the form of liquidity provision contracts, including affirmative obligations required of the LP and compensation for LP services. We find that low current trading activity, wide spreads, and higher information asymmetry increase the attractiveness of contracted liquidity provision. The evidence indicates that LPs trade against market movements and in times of wide spreads. On balance, firms contracting with LPs experience a decreased cost of capital and significant improvements in market quality and price discovery.","[Anand, Amber] Syracuse Univ, Whitman Sch Management, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Tanggaard, Carsten] Aarhus Univ, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; [Weaver, Daniel G.] Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA",Syracuse University; Aarhus University; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Anand, A (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Whitman Sch Management, 721 Univ Ave, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",amanand@syr.edu; ctanggaard@creates.au.dk; daniel_weaver@business.rutgers.edu,"Villen Retamero, Andrea Maria/IAR-1667-2023",,,,,,42,32,35,0,21,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

We find that, consistent with previous studies, women start their businesses with significantly lower levels of financial capital than men. A new finding from this research is that women go on to raise significantly lower amounts of incremental debt and equity in years two and three.

Our findings also reveal that women rely heavily on personal rather than external sources of debt and equity for both start-up capital as well as follow-on investments.

It is assumed that the Asian authorities respond by maintaining their peg to the dollar, while the European Central Bank (ECB) can either maintain its monetary policy stance or attempt to stabilize the euro's exchange rate. Using simulations, we find that in many cases, it is not optimal for the ECB to try to offset euro appreciation. The basic results are driven by the degree of substitutability among US, euro area and Asian goods, and the degree of product market competition within each market.","Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus",University of Cyprus,"Coutinho, L (通讯作者)，Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, POB 20537, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus.",leonor@ucy.ac.cy,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

In selecting the moments, the focus is on the fat tails and autocorrelation patterns of the daily returns of several stock market indices and foreign exchange rates. It is argued that it may be meaningful to abandon the econometrically optimal weighting matrix in the objective function and instead invoke the moments' t-statistics in an intuitively appealing way. This modification gives rise to estimations whose moment matching, given the model's parsimony, can be largely considered to be satisfactory. Also the parameter estimates across different markets make good economic sense. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we present evidence that shows that privatized banks in developed countries have experienced significant improvements in operating performance. The improvement in performance remains significant after controlling for persistence in bank performance. A comparison of the performance of privatized banks in developed and developing Countries suggests that privatization has encouraged excessive risk taking among privatized banks in developing countries, with the consequence that those banks carry large non-performing assets than their counterparts in the developed countries. We also observe that consistent with the competitive effects hypothesis, investors view privatization announcements as foreshadowing bad news for rival banks.

Journal of Finance 57(6). 2405-2447.], we classify our news categories in two groups: common knowledge (CK) and non-common knowledge (NCK) news, according to their effects on quoting activity and price changes. Finally we show that scheduled news announcements are NCK news, and there is no evidence for the existence of CK news amongst our announcements, which means that dealers hardly get a consensus in interpreting the news content (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

It proposes some solutions from a global perspective. Using a global vector autoregressive (GVAR) model steady states are estimated as long-horizon expectations and valid instruments are constructed from the global variables as weighted averages. The proposed estimation strategy is illustrated using estimates of the NKPC for eight developed industrial countries. The GVAR generates global factors that are valid instruments and help alleviate the weak instrument problem. The steady states also reflect global influences and any long-run theoretical relationships that might prevail within and across countries in the global economy. The GVAR measure of the steady state performed better than the HP measure, and the use of foreign instruments substantially increased the precision of the estimates of the output coefficient.","[Dees, Stephane] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Smith, L.

We find evidence consistent with improved disclosure and bonding creating value for cross-listings on US exchanges, while overcoming segmentation and bonding are associated with higher announcement returns on the London Stock Exchange.

The proposed estimator can greatly reduce the bias of the nonparametric estimator proposed in Stanton ( 1997) that uses a single time series of short rate observations. Simulations confirm that the new method significantly attenuates the Spurious nonlinearity of the drift function as documented in Chapman and Pearson (2000). We apply the method to estimate the U.S. short rate process using a panel of six Treasury yields. With 42 years' daily observations of the panel of yields, the proposed drift function estimator achieves the same efficiency as the Stanton ( 1997) estimator based oil 145 years of daily short rate observations. Finally, we show that the proposed estimator also has significant economic implications on the pricing of bonds and interest rate derivatives.","[Sam, Abdoul G.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Jiang, George J.] Univ Arizona, Eller Coll Management, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Arizona,"Sam, AG (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, 2120 Fyffe Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",sam.7@cfaes.osu.edu; gjiang@email.arizona.edu,,,,,,,45,8,9,1,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

Productivity of work time relates to human, financial and social capital endowments and the prevalence of outsourcing activities. This study also evaluates actual profit effects 1 year after start-up. We find that on average women invest less time in the business than men.

Our objective is to investigate the informational role that trading volume plays in predicting the direction of short-term returns. We evaluate whether the abnormal change in lagged, contemporaneous, and lead turnovers affects serial correlation in returns. Specifically, we examine if and when the change in volume produces momentum (positive correlation) or reversal (negative autocorrelation) in consecutive weekly stock returns. We find a reversal in weekly stock returns when conditioned on the change in lagged volume in the SSM. Our results are consistent for the whole sample, the two sub-sample periods, and the large- and small-firm portfolios. The results are consistent with Campbell, Grossman, and Wang [Campbell, J. Y., S. J. Grossman, and J. Wang, 1993, Trading volume and serial correlation in stock returns, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 108, 905-939], who present a model in which risk-averse market makers accommodate the selling pressure of liquidity or non-informational traders.

J,"Breyer, F; Hupfeld, S",,,,"Breyer, Friedrich; Hupfeld, Stefan",,,Fairness of Public Pensions and Old-Age Poverty,FINANZARCHIV,,,English,Article,,,,,,social security; life expectancy; poverty; redistribution,MORTALITY,"In several OECD countries, public pay-as-you-go pension systems have undergone major reforms in which future retirement benefit promises have been scaled down. A consequence of these reforms is that, especially in countries with a tight tax-benefit linkage, the retirement benefit claims of low-income workers might not even exceed the minimum income guarantee that the government provides the aged. Recently, some German politicians have criticized this likely development in that it was unjust that persons who have paid contributions over a long working life end up with no higher benefits than those who have never worked or paid any contributions. However, the government defended the current retirement benefit formula with the argument that every euro paid as contributions had exactly the same value in generating future retirement benefits. But this logic has been questioned recently - e.g., by Breyer and Hupfeld (2009) - in that the value of a contributed euro depends on the life expectancy of the individual, which is positively correlated with annual income. In that earlier paper, we introduced the concept of distributive neutrality, which takes income-group-specific differences in life expectancy into account. The present paper estimates the relationship between annual earnings and life expectancy of German retirees empirically and shows how the formula that links benefits to contributions would have to be modified to achieve distributive neutrality. We compare the new formula with the benefit formulas in other OECD countries and analyze a data set provided by the German Pension Insurance office on a large cohort of pensioners to find out how the old-age poverty rate would be affected by the proposed change of the benefit formula. Finally, we discuss other possible effects of a change in the benefit formula, especially on the labor supply of different earnings groups.","[Breyer, Friedrich] Univ Konstanz, D-78457 Constance, Germany",University of Konstanz,"Breyer, F (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Box 135, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",Friedrich.Breyer@uni-konstanz.de,,,,,,,25,12,12,0,21,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,SEP,2009,65.0,3,,,,,358,380,,10.1628/001522109X477813,0.0,,,23,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,529FK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272501200005,0

We conclude that when the legal regime and its accompanying set of investor protections permit, investors force dividends from managers, but they also attempt to extract such payouts indirectly by placing a high value on dividend paying firms.

We formalise the decision-theoretic considerations widely discussed in the existing literature by capturing the quality of the underlying analysis and information available to a regulatory authority, and we obtain a precise necessary and sufficient set of conditions for determining when an Economics or Effects-Based approach would be able to discriminate effectively between benign and harmful actions and consequently dominate per se as a decision-making procedure. We then show that in a full welfare-based approach, the choice between legal standards must additionally take into account, (i) indirect (deterrence) effects of the choice of standard on the behaviour of all firms when deciding whether or not to adopt a particular practice; and (ii) procedural effects of certain features of the administrative process in particular delays in reaching decisions; and the investigation of only a fraction of the actions taking place. We therefore derive necessary and sufficient conditions for adopting Discriminating Rules, as advocated by the Effects-Based approach. We also examine what type of Discriminating rule will be optimal under different conditions that characterise different business practices. We apply our framework to two recent landmark decisions - Microsoft vs. EU Commission (2007) and Leegin vs. PSKS (2007) - in which a change in legal standards has been proposed, and show that it can powerfully clarify and enhance the arguments deployed in these cases.","[Katsoulacos, Yannis] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Athens, Greece; [Ulph, David] Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AJ, Fife, Scotland",Athens University of Economics & Business; University of St Andrews,"Katsoulacos, Y (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Athens, Greece.",ysk@hol.gr; du1@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Katsoulacos, Yannis/AAA-1213-2021","Ulph, David/0000-0003-3171-1270",,,,,32,37,43,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1821,1467-6451,,J IND ECON,J.

This population-based approach to modeling the process sidesteps the problem of upscaling models based upon the choices made by individuals. We find releasing poll data is not advantageous to leading candidates, but it can be exploited by those closely trailing.

A challenging question is how different incentive schemes and their actual choice by the leader shape the team's culture and contribute to the team's success. To shed light on this issue we investigate how a leader chooses between rewards or punishment in an experimental team setting and how team-mates' contributions are influenced by this choice. Leaders show a clear initial preference for rewards, which diminishes over time in some teams. Leaders who observe more free-riders in their teams tend to switch to punishment incentives. A change from rewards to negative incentives results in an immediate and enduring increase in contributions. On the other hand, contributions show a decreasing trend in teams with a leader who sticks to rewards. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Renegotiations result in large changes to the amount, maturity, and pricing of the contract, occur relatively early in the life of the contract, and are rarely a consequence of distress or default. The accrual of new information concerning the credit quality, investment opportunities, and collateral of the borrower, as well as macroeconomic fluctuations in credit and equity market conditions, are the primary determinants of renegotiation and its outcomes. The terms of the initial contract (e.g., contingencies) also play an important role in renegotiations; by altering the structure of the contract in a state contingent manner, renegotiation is partially controlled by the contractual assignment of bargaining power.

The difference between conventional and current Shariah portfolio management is the application of sector screens and financial screens by which the asset universe is reduced. Yet, here different schools of scholars define different screening rules leading to significant differences with respect to compliance, but also with respect to performance. After analyzing this discrepancy we propose several new strategies to apply the inconsistent rule systems and a new paradigm for defining Shariah-compliance. Under this new paradigm compliance is attributed to the portfolio and not to the individual assets of the universe. We report results of an empirical study analyzing the potentials of these strategies and of the paradigm. We can show that under the proposed concepts Shariah-compliant portfolios can be realized which have return and risk profiles comparable to the conventional non-constrained portfolios.

Much of the contemporary discussion of this phenomenon has focused on this reserve growth as the consequence of exchange rate policies which have maintained fixed pegs to the US dollar. By contrast, this paper focuses on emerging market reserve choice as a consequence of portfolio diversification, applied to the experience of Asian economies. While Asian economies have become significant gross creditors in bonds and other fixed income assets, their liability position in equity and FDI assets has also grown significantly. This suggests that a full understanding of the reserve growth episode must be seen as part of an overall model of portfolio choice. The paper constructs a model of the interaction between an emerging market and an advanced economy in which an optimal general equilibrium portfolio structure implies that emerging market economies simultaneously build up a stock of foreign exchange rate reserves while receiving FDI flows from the advanced economy. The model can provide a reasonable quantitative account of the recent Asian experience. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Start-ups are the engine for job creation and economic growth. The lifecycle of a new venture includes seed stage, start-up stage, early stage, and later stage. Securing funding for a start-up in its early stages is from internal sources. The funder provides the initial capital, along with funds from family and fiends (3Fs), and the firm also relies on bootstrapping & business alliances. As the firm grows and needs additional capital, it will require external sources of funding: business loan from a bank, government-sponsored programs/grants, professional investors (angel investors, venture capitalists, and corporate investors), initial public offering (IPO) and the equity markets.

APPLICATION TO A HOTEL USING THE SERVQUAL MODEL,AMFITEATRU ECONOMIC,,,English,Article,,,,,,services; quality; management; models; tourism; hotel,,"Quality is a subjective concept, which depends on the individual's perceptions and expectations. These perceptions and expectations may be different one from the other and they may evolve in time. Quality is important for clients, for the personnel, it may contribute to reducing costs and may provide a better service for the same budget. The main results of the researches have taken shape into conceptual models of the quality of the services (Dotchin and Oakland, 1994; Juwaheer and Ross 2003; Eda Antilgan, et al., 2003). Some of these models can also be applied in tourism, but what is important for those working in this field is to know which these models are and how they can be used. I have chosen this field because lately people rely more and more, internationally, (49th UNWTO Commission for Europe) on the fact that tourism will be the surprise element which will help most countries to get out of the present crisis. The low quality of the services provided in the Romanian tourism is invoked wherever its evolution is being analyzed. As a consequence the hotels' management should be permanently concerned by the quality of the services their hotels provide. This is why the present survey analyzes both the models to improve the quality of the tourist services, and what quality for the clients means, taking the example of a hotel in Bucharest and using the standard proceeding SERVQUAL. We found out from the survey that there are differences between the perceptions and the expectations of the clients, and that the most serious complaints of the clients of that hotel derive from responsiveness, seriousness and empathy. Knowing all this the managers can make future decisions, according to the requests of the clients.","[State, Olimpia; Istudor, Nicolae] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"State, O (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",olimc@yahoo.com; nistudor@eam.ase.ro,"State, Olimpia/AAF-2322-2019; Istudor, Nicolae/AAW-2872-2020","State, Olimpia/0000-0002-9737-867X;",,,,,13,4,5,0,26,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2009,11.0,26,,,,,419,428,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,462KQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267351800021,0

Successful firms in research can enter the market with a cost advantage over older firms and acquire market power. Innovators have the technical knowledge to conduct R&D but lack the necessary financial resources. Their projects are financed by venture capitalists in exchange for a share of future profits. Venture capitalists can also provide advice and support to innovators, which increases the likelihood of success. Moral hazard between innovators and venture capitalists and rent-seeking behavior introduce various distortions in the level of effort provided by venture capitalists, the size of innovations, and the timing of R&D activities. The system of taxes and subsidies on R&D expenditures, capital gains, and capital investment required to induce the social optimum is characterized. Surprisingly, such a tax system must increase the cost of R&D and lower the return to capital.","Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Tremblay, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, 55 Laurier St E, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",Jean-Francois.Tremblay@uottawa.ca,,,,,,,24,1,1,1,16,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,JUN,2009,65.0,2,,,,,141,161,,10.1628/001522109X466545,0.0,,,21,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,499VI,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000270254000002,0

They referred to the negative correlation between market insurance and risk type as advantageous selection. However, the relationship between risk type and the degree of risk aversion is debatable in both theoretical and empirical research. This paper therefore proposes that advantageous selection could be supported from another angle by directly examining the relationships that exist among market insurance, self-protection, and risk probability. By focusing on the commercial fire insurance market, information on the purchase of market insurance, investment in self-protection, and fire accident records is hand-collected by means of a unique survey. It is found that firms purchasing market insurance have a greater tendency to channel efforts into self-protection. It is also found that firms expending effort on self-protection are less likely to suffer a fire accident. Furthermore, it is found that firms with commercial fire insurance have less chance of suffering a fire accident than those without such insurance. Each of the above three findings jointly supports the view that advantageous selection could play a critical role in the commercial fire insurance market.

Simulations of economic conditions experimented by Argentina during the period show that social inequalities and poverty became the main real adjustment variable in such monetary system.","[Montaud, Jean-Marc] Univ Pau & Pays Adour, UFR Pluridisciplinaire, F-64100 Bayonne, France; [Laffiteau, Emilie] ENSAE Senegal, Dakar, Senegal",Universite de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour; Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"Montaud, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Pau & Pays Adour, UFR Pluridisciplinaire, 8 Allee Platanes, F-64100 Bayonne, France.",jean-marc.montaud@univ-pau.fr; emilie.laffiteau@hotmail.fr,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,1,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

We show that loss given default can largely be explained by various characteristics associated with the loan, the underlying property, and the default, foreclosure, and settlement process. We find that the current loan-to-value ratio is the single most important determinant. More importantly, mortgage loss severity in distressed housing markets is significantly higher than under normal housing market conditions. These findings have important policy implications for several key issues in Basel II implementation.

The EKC curve for China's per capita industrial SO2 emissions predicts the turning point at 10,000 yuan (3,085 US$, Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)). However, given China's fast population expansion, the decreasing trend in per capita emissions may well not be enough to bring about an immediate reduction in terms of total industrial SO2 emissions and emissions density. Using the structural EKC model makes it possible to reveal how various factors contribute to the industrial SO2 emissions density - namely, the three commonly known Structural determinants and the marginal impact of international trade. International trade proves to have a two-fold impact: a significantly negative direct one and an indirect one that is dependent on the current capital-labour abundance ratio and on the income level of each province.","[He, Jie] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Econ, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; [He, Jie] Univ Sherbrooke, GREDI, Fac Adm, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada",University of Sherbrooke; University of Sherbrooke,"He, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Econ, 2500 Blvd Univ, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada.",Jie.He@USherbrooke.ca,,,,,,,57,72,76,1,27,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Both China and Hong Kong are affected by mean spillover effects from Taiwan. Volatility in the Hong Kong market spills over into Taiwan, which in turn affects the volatility in the Mainland China market. This means that the Mainland China market is related to other markets, even though the possibilities for outside investments have been limited until recently.

The econometric difficulties are similar to those that bedevil the literature on trade openness and growth though, if anything, they are more severe in the context of international finance. There is also little systematic evidence that financial opening raises welfare indirectly by promoting collateral reforms of economic institutions or policies. At the same time, opening the financial account does appear to raise the frequency and severity of economic crises. Nonetheless, developing countries continue to move in the direction of further financial openness. A plausible explanation is that financial development is a concomitant of successful economic growth, and a growing financial sector in an economy open to trade cannot long be insulated from cross-border financial flows. This survey discusses the policy framework in which financial globalization is most likely to prove beneficial for developing countries. The reforms developing countries need to carry out to make their economies safe for international asset trade are the same reforms they need to carry out to curtail the power of entrenched economic interests and liberate the economy's productive potential.

This rationale underlies our adoption of a cooperative game theory methodology for examining the value of units based on the cost approach of land appraisal. Particularly, we propose the Shapley value solution to examine the allocation of the land and construction cost among the stories of the building. We explore the allocation mechanism and derive several closed-form properties by which the value pattern of stories in a building is rationalized. The proposed cost allocation may, among other things, generate values when comparable market prices are unobservable (consistent with the cost approach); may be used by courts in order to compute compensations in cases of disputes regarding expansions and redevelopments of existing structures among co-owners; and may determine the rent cost allocation in an organization with several profit centers located on different floors of a building.

The complementarities can be partially explained by common factors of standard gravity models such as economy size, state of economic development, and information cost proxies (such as distance), as well as bilateral trade in goods. However, we find an additional direct channel of complementarities among financial asset holdings that cannot be explained by these gravity factors. The complementarities are also robust to the consideration of unobserved fixed effects of both source and destination countries. We find evidence that the sequential reinforcing impact of bank lending on portfolio asset holdings is greater than the impact of portfolio asset holdings on bank lending. We also find that bank loans lead to subsequent portfolio asset holdings by partially alleviating information frictions. However, the role of portfolio investment seems to be independent from the information channel. The mutual reinforcement effect among cross-border asset holdings is stronger in destination countries with better quality of institutions. Overall our findings suggest that, while there may exist pecking order of cross-border investment due to differing sensitivity of capital flows to various costs and frictions, once a country receives a form of cross-border investment, this tends to induce other forms of investment and thus a deeper and more balanced financial integration.J.

The payer has only two instruments: a fixed price for patients whose treatment cost is below a threshold and a cost-sharing rule for outlier patients. We show that a fixed-price policy is optimal when the hospital is sufficiently benevolent. When the hospital is weakly benevolent, a mixed policy solving a trade-off between rent extraction, efficiency, and dumping deterrence must be preferred. We show how the optimal combination of fixed price and partially cost-based payment depends on the degree of benevolence of the hospital, the social cost of public funds, and the distribution of patients severity.","[Mougeot, Michel; Naegelen, Florence] Univ Franche Comte, CRESE, UFR SJEPG, F-25030 Besancon, France; [Mougeot, Michel] Univ Lausanne, IEMS, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",Universite de Franche-Comte; University of Lausanne,"Mougeot, M (通讯作者)，Univ Franche Comte, CRESE, UFR SJEPG, F-25030 Besancon, France.",florence.naegelen@univ-fcomte.fr,,"mougeot, michel/0000-0003-1969-2353",,,,,21,10,13,0,9,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-4367,,,J RISK INSUR,J.

In extracting and transferring the outcomes of this research into entrepreneurship and SMEs, policy makers should see an aspect that must be consolidated within the environment of international globalization that surrounds us.

The choice of the first (second) alternative reveals overconfidence (underconfidence). The individual is well calibrated if he or she chooses the third alternative.

This paper further documents that idiosyncratic volatility is inversely related to future earning shocks, and more importantly, that the return-predictive power of idiosyncratic volatility is induced by its information content about future earnings. We examine various explanations of the triangular relation among idiosyncratic volatility, future earning shocks, and future stock returns. Our results show that the idiosyncratic volatility anomaly is not a simple manifestation of previously documented market anomalies related to excessive extrapolation oil firm growth, over-investment tendency, accounting accruals, or investor underreaction to earnings news. On the other hand, there is evidence that the idiosyncratic volatility anomaly is related to corporate selective disclosure, and the anomaly is stronger among stocks with a less sophisticated investor base.","[Jiang, George J.] Univ Arizona, Eller Coll Management, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Xu, Danielle] Gonzaga Univ, Sch Business Adm, Spokane, WA 99258 USA; [Yao, Tong] Univ Iowa, Tippie Coll Business, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",University of Arizona; Gonzaga University; University of Iowa,"Jiang, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Eller Coll Management, POB 210108, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",gjiang@email.arizona.edu; xu@jepson.gonzaga.edu; tong-yao@uiowa.edu,,,,,,,42,124,153,5,66,UNIV WASHINGTON SCH BUSINESS & ADMINISTRATION,SEATTLE,"C/O OFFICE MANAGER, 115 LEWIS HALL, BOX 353200, SEATTLE, WA 98195-3200 USA",0022-1090,,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

This has mainly been due to the increasing pressures of funding higher education as the student numbers have expanded in the developed economies. One of the major reasons for the growth of student numbers has been the belief of students that there are financial benefits to higher education. This study reports on data on students' expectations regarding the benefits of their higher education studies at three Czech faculties of economics and one English business school. First year students completed a questionnaire which asked their views concerning their earnings at four points in their lives i.e. immediately after graduation and ten years after and, hypothetically, if they had entered the labour market directly from high school, and ten years later. The results of the survey show that students perceive higher education to be a profitable investment. However, these perceptions and expectations are influenced by gender and region of study. Students in Prague expected the highest earnings within the Czech sample. Female students generally expected lower earnings than males, although in Huddersfield, female students tended to expect their earnings to be closer to males' than was the case in the Czech Republic. Overall students are well informed and therefore able to make rational decisions regarding their investment in further study. Given that student perceptions and expectations tend to reflect reality, they may be a useful proxy indicator of the demand for higher education at any particular point in time, at least in vocationally oriented subjects such as economics or business studies. Therefore policy makers would be well advised to track changes in such perceptions.","[Anchor, John; Fiserova, Jana] Univ Huddersfield, Sch Business, Dept Strategy & Mkt, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England",University of Huddersfield,,j.r.anchor@hud.ac.uk; j.fiserova@hud.ac.uk,"Anchor, John/AFM-0328-2022","Anchor, John/0000-0003-2885-9450",,,,,23,0,0,0,3,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-523-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,8,22,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BMK17,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272657000001,0

Random effects estimates show that income has a robust positive influence. GMM estimates indicate that corruption reduces the effectiveness of institutions in promoting literacy. However, this effect is not monotonic; improvements in the corruption index within the high corruption range reduce the effectiveness of institutions, while continuous improvement within the low corruption range enhances the effectiveness of institutions. Similarly, ethnic tensions reduce the effectiveness of institutions. Based on these findings, we conclude that social capital and institutions can complement each other.

Our theory predicts the patterns observed in CEF initial public offerings (IPOs) and the observed behavior of the CEF discount, which results from a trade-off between the liquidity benefits of investing in the CEF and the fees charged by the fund's managers. In particular, the model explains why IPOs occur in waves in certain sectors at a time, why funds are issued at a premium to net asset value (NAV), and why they later usually trade at a discount. We also conduct an empirical investigation, which, overall, provides more support for a liquidity-based model than for an alternative sentiment-based explanation.","[Stanton, Richard] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sagi, Jacob] Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN USA; [Cherkes, Martin] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Vanderbilt University; Columbia University,"Stanton, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, 545 Student Serv Bldg 1900, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",stanton@haas.berkeley.edu,"Stanton, Richard/AAW-2551-2021","Stanton, Richard/0000-0003-1222-6763",,,,,60,93,118,1,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Its main objective is to conceal the original source of the money resulted from illicit transactions, the so-called dirty money, so that it can be re-entered into the economic circuit as money resulted from legal activities, that is to be laundered. The dimensions of this phenomenon so intimately related to the very existence of the underground economy, are estimated by the International Monetary Fund as rising to as much as 2 to 5% of the world's GDP. The process of money laundering can be either simple or highly complex, depending on the amount of money involved, the process of splitting and then recomposing the amount in case, the number of transactions used to circulate the money, the geographical area, the whole duration of the process. Beyond all the afore-mentioned aspects, there are three segments representing the stages of the money laundering process: separating the money from the criminal/illicit source that generated them and investing it in various economic and financial circuits, laundering the money by means of repeated transfers and, finally, recycling the money by recuperating and associating it with legal activities and assets. Money laundering can induce a series of negative effects, both upon the economy and the society, by destabilizing the private sector when creating companies sponsored with dirty money, which affects the market competition, by generating highly inpredictible capital flows, by concentrating on recycling and protecting the amounts involved rather than finding the most profitable placements, by increasing the costs related to prevention of the phenomenon and to elimination of the resulting imbalance. It is also associated with corruption, inequitable distribution of national revenues, ethical derailments with direct impact on the international image of the states involved. The fight against money laundering is based on creating the necessary legal framework to firmly sanction the persons and institutions involved in the phenomenon, as well as on stimulating the cooperation between national and international institutions engaged in tracing and eliminating it. The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (G.A.F.I.), an intergovernment organism aiming at developping and promoting anti-money laundering policies, has issued a 40 recommendation code which constitutes the international legal framework of the fight against the phenomenon.","[Enciu, Adrian] Acad Econ Studies Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,adrianenciu@yahoo.com; doruganea@yahoo.com,,,,,,,18,2,2,1,4,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,251,257,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS73,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287985000037,0

Using panel data estimation techniques, both the market-power and efficient-structure hypotheses are tested. In addition, the model is extended to consider issues such as the impact of bank size/ownership and whether the big four banks enjoy a quiet life. On average, X-efficiency declined significantly and most banks were operating below scale efficient levels. Estimation of the structure-performance models lends some support to the relative market-power hypothesis in the early period. The reforms had little impact on the structure of China's banking sector, though the joint stock banks became relatively more X-efficient. There was no evidence to support the quiet-life hypothesis, probably because strict interest rate controls prevented the state banks from earning monopoly profits. Thus the ongoing liberalisation of interest rates should be accompanied by reduced concentration. Overall. to improve competitive structure, new policies should be directed at encouraging market entry and increasing the market share of the most efficient banks. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that capitalization of school spending into house prices can encourage even childless residents to support spending on schools. We identify a proxy for the extent of capitalization-the supply of land available for new development-and show that towns in Massachusetts with little undeveloped land have larger changes in house prices in response to a plausibly exogenous spending shock. Towns with little available land also spend more on schools. We extend these results using data from school districts in 46 states, showing that per pupil spending is positively related to the percentage of developed land. This positive correlation persists only in districts where the median resident is a homeowner and is stronger in districts with more elderly residents who do not use school services and have a shorter expected duration in their home. Our findings support models in which capitalization encourages the provision of durable local public goods and provides an additional reason why some elderly support local school spending.

We perform a role-playing experiment under Chinese economic and cultural context to test our results. The results show that: individuals with incomplete personal capability cognitions will tend to be overconfident about their performance abilities and such overconfidence will make they incorrectly select a performance-based contract when they should select a fixed-pay contract, then result in lower earnings. Considering the costs on turnover, although the switch behaviors are not significant between the individuals that have different cognition level on performance capability for job-related skills, once individuals with incomplete personal capability cognitions learn their actual performance capability, they will be more likely to switch performance-based contracts to fix-pay contracts in a subsequent period than participants who know their performance capability at the time of initial contract selection.

Further we concentrate on suffixes -tion / - ment / - age, which are used for creating nouns that express activity. Finally, we refer to neologisms created by derivation, especially with respect to the frequency of the mentioned three suffixes.","[Jezkova, Slavomira] Ceska Zemedelska Univ Praze, PEF, Katedra Jazyku, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Jezková, S (通讯作者)，Ceska Zemedelska Univ Praze, PEF, Katedra Jazyku, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",jezkovas@pef.czu.cz,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-1965-3,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2009,,,,,,,823,826,,,,,,4,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BL8MF,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000456720700168,0

Based on panel data of Chinese-listed family-owned firms, we find that the kinship between the CEO and the controlling owner is positively related to the firm's innovative competence. That is, when the CEO is a family member, the firm's innovative competence is stronger, otherwise, when the CEO is a nonfamily member, the firm's innovative competence is weaker.","[Li, Jing; He, Xiao-gang] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Business Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,,lijing_abc@yahoo.com.cn; hxg@mail.shufe.edu.cn,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,0,AMER SCHOLARS PRESS,MARIETTA,"3238 HARVEST WAY, MARIETTA, GA 30062 USA",,,978-0-9798471-5-8,,,,2009,,,,,,,266,270,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BNT76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275501800057,0

Based on contract theory and behaviour approach, we propose three hypotheses from the perspective of functioning manager market, manager power and benchmark effect in pay setting process given Chinese transitional institution background. Based on a balanced panel data of 502 listed firms surviving at least ten years until 2006, we find that the increasing executive pay level reflects competitive market demand for manager talents. However, well framed corporate governance mechanisms as restraints to manager power can not fulfil effectively. Moreover, Chinese executives in firms closer to higher benchmark of foreign peers tend to receive generous pay package, this benchmark effect has been magnified by the role of compensation committee in pay setting process.","[Liu Xuguang; Chen, Jean Jinghan] Univ Surrey, Sch Management, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England",University of Surrey,,david.lxg@gmail.com,"Chen, Jean Jinghan/JMB-9672-2023; Chen, Jean/JMB-9886-2023","Chen, Jean Jinghan/0009-0009-9607-9342; Chen, Jean/0009-0009-9607-9342",,,,,24,0,0,0,5,M D FORUM,ALLAWAH NSW,"17 AUGUSTA ST, ALLAWAH NSW, 2218, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9806854-2-8,,,,2009,,,,,,,759,770,,,,,,12,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BPO33,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279533000093,0
