This relationship is crucial for a potential structural pattern of redistribution between different income and health groups, induced by the public pension system. Evidence for such redistribution from poor to rich is present for most of the specifications in my analysis. The most adequate specification is partially linear, does therefore not impose any parametrical restrictions between duration and benefit claims, and allows for potential endogeneity. The relationship I extract is clearly positive. I also find that redistribution from low-income individuals to individuals with high income is more pronounced the worse the health status is, despite longer benefit spells for pensioners in ill-health.

Our objective was to identify domains at baseline that predict change in HRQoL, and to evaluate the relation between change in HRQoL and change in particular domains of PD. A total of 336 patients who participated in the longitudinal SCOPA-PROPARK cohort study and had data from the first and third annual evaluation were included in this study. The Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's disease (SCOPA) evaluation was used to assess impairments and disabilities. HRQoL was assessed with the EuroQol-5D visual analogue scale. Multiple linear regression analysis with change in HRQoL as dependent variable was used to identify factors that influence the change in HRQoL. Health-related quality of life as well as most impairment and disability domains decreased significantly from baseline to follow-up. The two regression models of change in HRQoL, adjusted for baseline HRQoL, included 1) the baseline domains autonomic dysfunction, nighttime sleep problems, and cognitive function, and 2) change in psychosocial problems, change in depressive symptoms, and change in cognitive function. Patients who have autonomic dysfunction, nighttime sleep problems, and cognitive dysfunction are at risk for deterioration in HRQoL. Deterioration in HRQoL over 2-year time was associated with worsening in psychosocial well-being, mood, and cognitive function. Interventions aiming to improve these domains are important and would likely contribute to improvement in HRQoL, although more research is necessary.","[Visser, Martine; Verbaan, Dagmar; van Rooden, Stephanie; Marinus, Johan; van Hilten, Johannes] Leiden Univ, Dept Neurol, Med Ctr, NL-2300 RC Leiden, Netherlands; [Stiggelbout, Anne] Leiden Univ, Dept Med Decis Making, Med Ctr, NL-2300 RC Leiden, Netherlands",Leiden University; Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC); Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University; Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC); Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"Visser, M (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, Dept Neurol, Med Ctr, POB 9600, NL-2300 RC Leiden, Netherlands.",m.visser@lumc.nl,"Marinus, Johan/E-4038-2010; Stiggelbout, Anne/D-2293-2018","Marinus, Johan/0000-0002-3978-3183; van Hilten, Jacobus/0000-0002-7030-0362; van Rooden, Stephanie/0000-0002-3693-3991; Verbaan, Dagmar/0000-0002-9212-5470; Stiggelbout, Anne/0000-0002-6293-4509",Fonds NutsOhra; van Alkemade-Keuls Foundation,Fonds NutsOhra; van Alkemade-Keuls Foundation,Fonds NutsOhra and the van Alkemade-Keuls Foundation.,,28,47,51,0,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2009,12.0,2,,,,,392,396,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00430.x,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,408WY,18657099.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000263467500028,0

Similarly, the research on expense preference behaviour has not taken demand uncertainty into account. In this paper, we argue that both demand uncertainty and expense preference behaviour may affect public hospital costs and excess capacity and that ignoring either of these effects may lead to biased parameter estimates and misleading inference. To show this, we extend the analysis of Rodriguez-Alvarez and Lovell (Health Econ. 2004; 13: 157-169) by incorporating demand uncertainty into the technology to account for the hospital activity of providing standby capacity or insurance against the unexpected demand. We find that demand uncertainty in Spanish public hospitals affects hospital production decisions and increases costs. Our results also show that overcapitalization in these hospitals can be explained by hospitals providing insurance demand when faced with demand uncertainty. We also find evidence of expense preference behaviour. We conclude that both stochastic demand and expense preference behaviour should be taken into account when analysing hospital costs and production.

We generalize this result by replacing the transitive closure with a more general function. Using this result, we set up a procedure which leads to existence results for complete extensions satisfying various additional properties. We demonstrate the usefulness of this procedure by applying it to the properties of convexity, homotheticity and monotonicity. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

At present plant biomass used for power makes up approximately 94% of all the renewable energy used in Lithuania. The work aim is to determine the technical potential of plant biomass growing and usage for power purposes and to investigate the technologies for biomass use. Wood as a fuel is most widely used at present in Lithuania. Total energy value of Lithuania-produced wood fuel was 720 thousands toe. Wood fuel potential in the nearest decade will be 871 thousands toe. Straw is another source of biomass fuel. About 0.5 Mt (million tons), i.e. 12-15% of the total straw yield can be used as a fuel in Lithuania. Potential of straw as a fuel makes about 167 thousands toe. The resources of plant energy biomass may be supplied by specially grown plants: willows, perennial grasses, rapes, cereals, sugar beets. 22% of agricultural land can be attributed for this purpose. Biogas can be produced from plant biomass in anaerobic reactors. The total biogas potential from plant biomass in Lithuania would amount to 61 thousands toe. About 3 10 thousand ha can be used to grow plants for biofuel. The technologies of growing, harvesting and fuel production from traditional feed-type grasses, coarse-stemmed vegetative plants and willows were evaluated and rational technique was selected. After energetic evaluation of the technologies it was concluded that the total energy input of growing and harvesting of grasses and legumes was equal to 8.3 GJ ha(-1), topinambour stems - 14.4 GJ ha(-1), sunflower stems - 11.3 GJ ha(-1) and willow stems - 15.0 GJ ha(-1), respectively.

The economic impact of varenicline to the national health budget is estimated in a population of current, former, and new smokers. The analyses are based on data from a variety of secondary sources including national health data, clinical trials, and meta-analyses of smoking-cessation aids. The number of patients seeking aid and the treatment patterns are estimated using 2004 national health surveys, costs for medications from national prescription drug pricing tariffs, and efficacy of the various smoking-cessation aids from clinical trial data. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of varying the patient parameters and costs. Model estimates suggest that the budgetary impact of varenicline would be 3.6 pound million in the second year after its introduction, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.63 pound to 7.2 pound million, and a resultant increase of 0.05% to the total NHS pharmacy budget. The model predicts that the addition of varenicline to the market would result in an additional 162,000 successful smoking-cessation attempts and 103,000 fewer smokers over 5 years, when compared to the world without varenicline. The introduction of varenicline is likely to result in greater numbers of individuals succeeding at smoking cessation, with an approximately 3.6 pound million (0.05%) increase in the NHS pharmacy budget.","[Taylor, Douglas C.

We measured adverse events according to the Patient Safety Indicator (PSI) algorithms of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Patient level cost regression analyses were performed using generalized linear modeling techniques. Accounting for the heavily skewed distribution of costs among patients having adverse safety events, results suggested that the excess cost of nine different PSIs for VA patients are much higher than previously estimated. We tested sensitivity of results to whether costs were measured by VA's Decision Support System (DSS) that uses local costs of specific inputs, or by the average costing system developed by VA's Health Economics Resource Center.

In this paper, we consider semiparametric estimation of the bivariate Tobit model proposed by Amemiya (1974), under the independence condition without imposing any parametric restriction on the error distribution. Our estimator is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal, and simulation results show that our estimator performs well in finite samples. It is also worth noting that while Amemiya's (1974) instrumental variables estimator (IV) requires the normality assumption, our semiparametric estimator actually outperforms his IV estimator even when normality holds.

The earnings gap does not disappear when individual and market characteristics are controlled for. This paper investigates whether a gender earnings difference can also be observed in a health-care system predominantly financed by public insurance companies. Using a unique data set of physicians' earnings recorded by a public social security agency in an Austrian province between 2000 and 2004, we find a gender gap in average earnings of about 32%. A substantial share of this gap (20-47%) cannot be explained by individual and market characteristics, leaving labor market discrimination as one possible explanation for the observed gender earnings difference of physicians.

Methods: A DCE survey was developed and administered to LTBI patients. Each patient was given 10 random choices along with two fixed choices to check consistency. Two hypothetical treatment options and one opt-out option were presented in each choice task. Latent class analysis was conducted to estimate preferences for six key treatment attributes. Results: Among the 214 respondents, 194 (90.7%) who provided valid DCE responses and complete sociodemographic information were included. Results consistently suggested that respondents were averse to higher risk of active tuberculosis and side effects and longer treatment. A three-latent-class model with five covariates was chosen. Forty-seven percent of the respondents were assigned to class 1, 32% to class 2, and 21% to class 3. Although all six attributes were shown to significantly influence the respondents' treatment decision, the risk of active tuberculosis, chance of liver damage, and frequency of clinic visits were the most important ones. Significant preference heterogeneity was observed in two attributes: frequency of clinic visits (P < 0.01) and chance of liver damage developing (P < 0.01). Class 1 individuals were most likely to have children. Class 2 had the highest employment rate. Class 3 respondents tended to choose the opt-out option on DCE tasks and were more likely to be born outside Canada, have higher education, and be unemployed. Conclusion: Respondents consistently preferred preventive treatment with higher effectiveness, fewer side effects, and shorter length. Substantial preference heterogeneity existed among respondents.","[Marra, Carlo A.] Univ British Columbia, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Collaborat Outcomes Res & Evaluat, Ctr Hlth Evaluat & Outcome Sci,Providence Hlth Ca, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Elwood, R.

This paper investigates whether spousal bereavement has a causal effect on health and on mortality of the surviving spouse. We advance on the literature in two main ways. First, we model survivals of both spouses and the dynamic evolution of health jointly, allowing for potential endogeneity of timing of bereavement and health in explaining mortality of the surviving spouse. Second, we use a flexible non-parametric data dimensionality reduction method to thoroughly characterize health (using 22 health indicators) by a limited number of latent health indicators. This allows us to investigate the causal effect of spousal bereavement on mortality and on all aspects of health simultaneously. Our analyses are based on an ongoing longitudinal survey that follows a random sample of older individuals from 1992. We find strong instantaneous effects of bereavement on mortality and on certain aspects of health. Individuals lose on average 12% of residual life expectancy after conjugal bereavement. Conjugal bereavement affects the share of healthy years in residual lifetime, primarily because healthy years are replaced by years with chronic diseases. The strong direct effects of bereavement suggest that monitoring and/or interventions just after spousal bereavement are important for the length and quality of life of older bereaved individuals.

Pricing and reimbursement agencies are increasingly using the results from health technology assessments to inform their decision making for new technologies. Such assessments are invariably underpinned by the phase 3 clinical trial evidence which may not provide answers to the key questions. Technology developers are beginning to realize that direct, early dialogue on the evidence requirements of the major pricing and reimbursement agencies, before phase 3 clinical trial designs for their key development compounds have been finalized, may be beneficial. This article reports on the pioneering efforts of one technology developer in seeking early dialogue with seven pricing and reimbursement agencies in five countries globally in 2007-2008 on their likely evidence requirements for a new oral treatment for patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. The pilot project demonstrated that a feasible process of early dialogue could be established, through a face-to-face meeting with prior circulation of a briefing book. Although there was some variation in the advice the similarities far outweighed the differences. More experience of early dialogue needs to be accumulated, involving a wider range of pricing and reimbursement agencies and compounds. The conclusion of this study, however, was that early dialogue can be a worthwhile process for all parties and can lead to a common understanding about evidence development for market access.","[Backhouse, Martin E.; Hornby, Edward; Kilburg, Anne; Mayer, Friedrich Karl] Novartis Pharma AG, Global Pricing & Market Access, Basel, Switzerland; [Drummond, Michael] Univ York, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",Novartis; University of York - UK,"Backhouse, ME (通讯作者)，Therwilerstr 39, CH-4103 Bottmingen, Switzerland.",martin.backhouse@bluewin.ch,,,,,,,10,29,29,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2011,14.0,4,,,,,608,615,,10.1016/j.jval.2010.11.011,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BC,21669387.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299080800028,0

Temporal aggregation includes cumulation of flow variables as well as systematic (or skip) sampling of stock variables. Next, the aggregation result is applied to fractionally integrated processes. In particular, it is investigated whether typical frequency domain assumptions made for semiparametric estimation and inference are closed with respect to aggregation. With these findings it is spelled out, which estimators remain valid upon aggregation under which conditions on bandwidth selection. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The latter distribution appears as a good candidate since it has the same number of parameters as the a-stable distribution, with each parameter playing a similar role. To improve the properties of the estimator in finite sample, we use constrained indirect inference. In a Monte Carlo study we show that this method delivers estimators with good properties in finite sample. We provide an empirical application to the distribution of jumps in the S&P 500 index returns. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We ask when an external observer of household choices, who does not know the individuals' preferences, can rationalize the choices as being Pareto-optimal. Our main contribution is to reduce the problem of rationalization to a graph-coloring problem. As a result, we obtain simple tests for Pareto optimal choice behavior. In addition to the tests, and using our graph-theoretic representation, we show that Pareto rationalization is equivalent to a system of quadratic equations being solvable. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Using nationally representative panel data from Australia, I find that an increase in employability from zero to 100% cancels around three quarters, in some cases more, of the detrimental effect of unemployment. Employability also matters for employees: an increase in men's employability from zero to 100% reduces the detrimental effect of job insecurity by more than half. The effects of extreme job insecurity and of unemployment are large and of comparable magnitudes. The findings are used to compute estimates of the well-being trade-off between increases in job insecurity and increases in employability, relevant to the support of flexicurity policies, and of the misery multiplier, the extent to which the effect of a rise in aggregate unemployment on those becoming unemployed is supplemented by the effects on others' insecurity and employability.

Although a number of studies have undertaken valuation of ecosystem services ranging from the global to the micro level, and quite a few studies have attempted to quantify the costs of soil erosion, studies that address the full costs of land degradation are still scarce. In this review, we attempt to analyze different land resource modeling and valuation techniques applied in earlier research and the type of data used in these analyses, and to assess their utility for different forms of land resource and management appraisal. We also report on the strengths and weaknesses of different valuation techniques used in studies on the economics of soil erosion, and the relevance of these valuation techniques. We make a case for the need for more appropriate models that can make the analysis more robust in estimating the economic costs of land degradation while recognizing the spatial heterogeneity in biophysical and economic conditions.","[Adhikari, Bhim] United Nations Univ, Inst Water Environm & Hlth, Hamilton, ON L8P 0A1, Canada; [Nadella, Karthik] McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON, Canada",McMaster University,"Adhikari, B (通讯作者)，United Nations Univ, Inst Water Environm & Hlth, 175 Longwood Rd S, Hamilton, ON L8P 0A1, Canada.",bhim_adhikari@yahoo.com,,,,,,,87,22,25,2,85,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN STREET, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0077-8923,,978-1-57331-820-4,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,2011,1219.0,,,,,,134,152,,10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05910.x,0.0,,,19,Ecology; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Multidisciplinary Sciences,Book Citation Index– Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH); Book Citation Index– Science (BKCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BUD51,21332496.0,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288933600007,0

Methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data from 1991-2003 for 60,231 patients with lung cancer were used to estimate monthly and patient-liability costs for clinical phases of lung cancer (prediagnosis, staging, initial, continuing, and terminal), stratified by treatment, stage, and non-small-versus small-cell lung cancer. Lung cancer-attributable costs were estimated by subtracting each patient's own prediagnosis costs. Costs were estimated as the sum of Medicare reimbursements (payments from Medicare to the service provider), co-insurance reimbursements, and patient-liability costs (deductibles and co-payments that are the patient's responsibility). Costs and patient-liability costs were fit with regression models to compare trends by calendar year, adjusting for age at diagnosis. Results: The monthly treatment costs for a 72-year-old patient, diagnosed with lung cancer in 2000, in the first 6 months ranged from $2687 (no active treatment) to $9360 (chemoradiotherapy); costs varied by stage at diagnosis and histologic type. Patient liability represented up to 21.6% of care costs and increased over the period 1992-2003 for most stage and treatment categories, even when care costs decreased or remained unchanged. The greatest monthly patient liability was incurred by chemo-radiotherapy patients, which ranged from $1617 to $2004 per month across cancer stages. Conclusions: Costs for lung cancer care are substantial, and Medicare is paying a smaller proportion of the total cost over time.

We show how these views turn on key judgments of fact and value: on whether the social objective is to maximise discounted health outcomes or the present consumption value of health; on whether the budget for health care is fixed; on the expected growth in the cost-effectiveness threshold; and on the expected growth in the consumption value of health. We demonstrate that if the budget for health care is fixed and decisions are based on incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs), discounting costs and health gains at the same rate is correct only if the threshold remains constant. Expecting growth in the consumption value of health does not itself justify differential rates but implies a lower rate for both. However, whether one believes that the objective should be the maximisation of the present value of health or the present consumption value of health, adopting the social time preference rate for consumption as the discount rate for costs and health gains is valid only under strong and implausible assumptions about values and facts.

We compared the cost-effectiveness of the five different 3-month formulations of LHRH agonists currently available for advanced prostate cancer in Italy, because these differ both in their capacity to suppress testosterone and in their acquisition costs. Methods: A probabilistic, patient-level simulation model was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness, from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service (INHS), of leuprorelin 11.25 mg and 22.5 mg, triptorelin 11.25 mg, buserelin 9.9 mg, and goserelin 10.8 mg. The model incorporated testosterone-dependent progression-free and cancer-specific survival functions, LHRH agonist effectiveness data, and national costs and tariffs. Cox's proportional hazard models were used to compute total and progression-free survival functions based on clinical data from 129 patients with metastatic prostate cancer treated in an Italian center. Bayesian random effects models were employed to summarize evidence from published literature on testosterone suppression obtained with the available LHRH agonists. Results: Estimated total survival was approximate to 5 years, with a maximum difference between treatment options of approximate to 2 months. There was a mean difference of almost (sic)2,500 in lifetime total costs between the least costly option (leuprorelin 22.5 mg) and the most expensive (goserelin). In the incremental cost-effectiveness analysis, leuprorelin 22.5 mg dominated all alternatives except buserelin, which had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio versus leuprorelin 22.5 mg of approximate to(sic)12,000 per life-month gained. Conclusions: Based on modelling with meta-analysis of comparative survival data, leuprorelin 22.5 mg was the most cost-effective treatment of the available depot formulation LHRH agonists.

Methods: Health state preferences were measured via a 15-minute survey administered through the Internet in December 2007 using a probability sample of the adult population of the United States (N = 1012). Respondents were asked to value hypothetical descriptions of seasonal influenza illness (uncomplicated influenza illness, hospitalization) and possible vaccine-related adverse events (anaphylaxis, Guillain-Barre syndrome) using time trade-off or willingness-to-pay questions. Respondents were randomized to four different ages for an affected hypothetical individual: 1-year-old, 8-year-old, 35-year-old, 85-year-old. All other aspects of the health state description were held constant. Summary statistics for each health state and age were calculated. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to measure differences in responses across ages of affected individuals in the hypothetical scenarios. Regression analyses were used to evaluate the effect of age on time trade-off or willingness-to-pay amounts controlling for respondent characteristics. Results: Median values for time trade-off and willingness-to-pay were highest for young children. This pattern was generally consistent across responses and type of valuation. Conclusions: Approaches that assume health state values do not differ with the age of a patient may bias economic analyses that use these values. If patient age is likely to affect health state valuations, then age should be included as an attribute in the valuation exercise.

Methods: In a Web-based questionnaire containing contingent valuation exercises, respondents valued health changes in five scenarios. In each scenario, the respondents first valued two health states on a visual analog scale (VAS) and expressed their WTP for avoiding a decline in health from the better health state to the worse, using a payment scale followed by a bounded open contingent valuation question. Analysis: WTP per QALY was calculated for QALY gains calculated using VAS valuations, as well as the Dutch EQ-5D tariffs, the two steps in the WTP estimations and each scenario. Heterogeneity in WTP per QALY ratios was examined from the perspective of: 1) household income; and 2) the level of certainty in WTP indicated by respondents. Theoretical validity was analyzed using clustered multivariate regressions. Results: A total of 1091 respondents, representative of the Dutch population, participated in the survey. Mean WTP per QALY was 12,900 based on VAS valuations, and 24,500 based on the Dutch EuroQoL tariffs. WTP per QALY was strongly associated with income, varying from 5000 in the lowest to 75,400 in the highest income group. Respondents indicating higher certainty exhibited marginally higher WTP. Regression analyses confirmed expected relations between WTP per QALY, income, and other personal characteristics. Conclusion: Individual WTP per QALY values elicited in this study are similar to those found in comparable studies. The use of individual valuations in social decision-making deserves attention, however.","[Bobinac, Ana] Erasmus Univ, iBMG iMTA, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Bobinac, A (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, iBMG iMTA, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",a.bobinac@erasmusmc.nl,"van Exel, Job/E-6191-2013; Bobinac, Ana/ABE-8124-2021; Brouwer, Werner/HSB-9241-2023; Bobinac, Ana/AAF-6113-2021","van Exel, Job/0000-0002-4178-1777; Bobinac, Ana/0000-0001-8798-9795; Brouwer, Werner/0000-0002-0476-8397;",Astra-Zeneca; GlaxoSmithKline; Janssen-Cilag; Merck; Pfizer BV,Astra-Zeneca(AstraZeneca); GlaxoSmithKline(GlaxoSmithKline); Janssen-Cilag(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc); Merck(Merck & Company); Pfizer BV,"This study is part of a larger project investigating the broader societal benefits of health care, which was financially supported by Astra-Zeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Janssen-Cilag, Merck, and Pfizer BV.

An alternative dual appraisal of a class of preferences that take explicit account of heterogeneous consumptions and leisure arbitrages then allows for an unrestricted class of general statements on the stability properties of an optimal accumulation environment that subsumes earlier results as special cases. These are based upon the features of Hicksian demands and it is argued that the retainment of a given sectoral configuration in factors shares and the imposition of concavity and positive income elasticities do not suffice to rule out optimal cycles if consumptions or leisure considered by pairs happen to exhibit complementaries. The SSF approach is finally argued to outshine the PPF protocole because it allows for a simple explicit derivation in the Cobb-Douglas case that have become, since the seminal contribution of Benhabib and Farmer in the nineties, the cornerstone of macroeconomic analysis.

A health care response to the treatment needs of HIV-positive people is a prime example of the desirability of an economic, rational approach to resource allocation in the face of scarcity. Despite this, almost no input based on economic analysis is currently used in national strategic planning. While cost-utility analysis is theoretically able to establish technical efficiency, in practice this is accomplished by comparing an intervention's ICER to a threshold level representing society's maximum willingness to pay to avoid death and improve health-related quality of life. Such an approach has been criticised for a number of reasons, including that it is inconsistent with a fixed budget for health care and that equity is not taken into account. It is also impractical if no national policy on the threshold exists. As an alternative, this paper proposes a mathematical programming approach that is capable of highlighting technical efficiency, equity, the equity/efficiency trade-off and the affordability of alternative HIV-treatment interventions. Government could use this information to plan an HIV-treatment strategy that best meets equity and efficiency objectives within budget constraints.

Methods: MEDLINE was reviewed for studies that evaluated >= 1 adherence intervention compared with a control, used an adherence measure other than self-report, and followed patients for >= 6 months. Effectiveness was assessed as Relative Improvement, ratio of adherence with an intervention versus control. Costs, standardized to 12 months and adjusted to 2007 US$, and effectiveness estimates for each intervention were entered into a previously published model designed to measure the burden of nonadherence with antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications, in a hypertensive population. Outputs included direct medical costs and incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Results: After screening, 23 eligible adherence-improving interventions were identified from 18 studies. Relative Improvement ranged from 1.13 to 3.60. After eliminating more costly/less effective interventions, two remained. Self-monitoring, reminders, and educational materials incurred total health-care costs of $17,520, and compared with no adherence intervention, had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $4984 per QALY gained. Pharmacist/nurse management incurred total health-care costs of $17,896, and versus self-monitoring, reminders, and education had an ICER of $6358 per QALY gained. Conclusions: Of published interventions shown to improve adherence, reminders and educational materials, and a pharmacist/nurse management program, appear to be cost-effective and should be considered before other interventions. Understanding relative cost-effectiveness of adherence interventions may guide design and implementation of efficient adherence-improving programs.","[Chapman, Richard H.; Kowal, Stacey L.; Cherry, Spencer B.; Ferrufino, Cheryl P.] IMS Hlth, US Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Falls Church, VA 22046 USA; [Roberts, Craig S.; Chen, Linda] Pfizer Inc, New York, NY USA",Pfizer,"Chapman, RH (通讯作者)，IMS Hlth, US Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, 300 N Washington St,Suite 303, Falls Church, VA 22046 USA.",rchapman@us.imshealth.com,"Chen, Linda/JXX-7325-2024; Roberts, Craig S/GLQ-8814-2022","Roberts, Craig S/0000-0002-5852-9770",Pfizer Inc.,Pfizer Inc.(Pfizer),"The study was sponsored by Pfizer Inc.

Yet, some scientists speculate that the Food and Drug Administration's prominent mercury in fish advisory may have harmed public health. Lower mercury intakes reduce neurological toxicity risks. However, since seafood is the predominant dietary source of healthful omega-3 fatty acids, reduced fish consumption may have significant offsetting health impacts. We explore this risk trade-off using a rich panel of household-level seafood consumption data. To control for confounding factors, we use a non-parametric changes-in-changes approach. We find strong evidence that while the advisory reduced mercury loadings, it did so at the expense of substantial reductions in healthful omega-3s. We find this response pattern even for consumers with low fish consumption. Using advisory response patterns as inputs into a prominent risk assessment model, the central estimate is that net benefits from the advisory were negative. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The least squares method is used for estimating breaks in means and the quasi-maximum likelihood (QML) method is used to estimate breaks in means and in variances.

Methods: A literature review has been carried out with a particular focus on major health risk characteristics from a multidisciplinary perspective. To assess the economic value of the cancer plan in France, the study uses secondary data on the costs of cancer that have been collected and published by the National Institute for Cancer for 2004. Results: A model is designed to evaluate health risk components that can be classified into four main categories relating the level at which risk is analyzed (individual or population) to the main type of intervention needed (preventive or curative) to cope with it. The findings show that actions and interventions dealing with prevention, education, and research represent 3.54% of the total costs of the cancer plan in France while 96.46% relates to health care and economic losses. Conclusions: The proposed classification of health risk components gives more insight and understanding of risks associated with diseases and illness and proposes an operational representation of actions and costs related to the risks. The methodology proposed might be of significant interest to those involved in making health-care financing decisions.","[Guerrero, Isabelle] Univ Montpellier, Montpellier, France",Universite de Montpellier,"Guerrero, I (通讯作者)，Univ Montpellier 2, 32 Ave Tour, F-34470 Perols, France.",isabelle.guerrero@orange.fr,,,,,,,37,1,1,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2010,13.0,5,,,,,552,556,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00708.x,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,635RQ,20345549.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280674200006,0

It illustraes how the indirect inference principle can be used in the inference of these models. Specifically, we show that an ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation can be used as an auxiliary model, which leads to a method that is similar in spirit to a two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimator. Monte Carlo studies and an empirical analysis of timber sale auctions held in Oregon illustrate the usefulness and feasibiltiy of our approach. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The goal of the paper is to weigh the merits of gatekeeping versus non-gatekeeping approaches to health care when patient self-health information and patient pressure on GPs to provide referrals for specialized care are considered. We find that, when GPs incentives matter, a non-gatekeeping system is preferable only when (i) patient pressure to refer is sufficiently high and (ii) the quality of the patient's self-health information is neither highly inaccurate (in which case the patient's self-referral will be very inefficient) nor highly accurate (in which case the GP's agency problem will he very costly).

Therefore, waiting times caused by limited resources and their impact on treatment effects and costs often remain unconsidered. Queuing theory enables mathematical analysis and the derivation of several performance measures of queuing systems. Nevertheless, an analytical approach with closed formulas is not always possible. Therefore, simulation techniques are used to evaluate systems that include queuing or waiting, for example, discrete event simulation. To include queuing in decision-analytic models requires a basic knowledge of queuing theory and of the underlying interrelationships. This tutorial introduces queuing theory. Analysts and decision-makers get an understanding of queue characteristics, modeling features, and its strength. Conceptual issues are covered, but the emphasis is on practical issues like modeling the arrival of patients. The treatment of coronary artery disease with percutaneous coronary intervention including stent placement serves as an illustrative queuing example. Discrete event simulation is applied to explicitly model resource capacities, to incorporate waiting lines and queues in the decision-analytic modeling example..","[Jahn, Beate; Siebert, Uwe] UMIT Univ Hlth Sci Med Informat & Technol, Inst Publ Hlth Med Decis Making & Hlth Technol As, Dept Publ Hlth Informat Syst & Hlth Technol Asses, A-6060 Hall In Tirol, IT, Austria; [Jahn, Beate; Pfeiffer, Karl-Peter] Innsbruck Med Univ, Dept Med Stat Informat & Hlth Econ, Innsbruck, Austria; [Theurl, Engelbert] Leopold Franzens Univ Innsbruck, Dept Publ Finance, Innsbruck, Austria; [Siebert, Uwe] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Inst Technol Assessment, Cardiovasc Res Program, Boston, MA USA; [Siebert, Uwe] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Radiol, Boston, MA USA; [Siebert, Uwe] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Ctr Hlth Decis Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Pfeiffer, Karl-Peter] FH Johanneum Univ Appl Sci, Graz, Austria","UMIT - Private University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics & Technology GmbH; Medical University of Innsbruck; University of Innsbruck; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

J,"Wagstaff, A",,,,"Wagstaff, Adam",,,SOCIAL HEALTH INSURANCE REEXAMINED,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,social health insurance; health financing,INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS; CARE; FINANCE; COUNTRIES; EQUITY; MARKET; EUROPE; ASIA,"Social health insurance (SHI) is enjoying something of a revival in parts of the developing world. Many countries that have in the past relied largely on tax finance (and out-of-pocket payments) have introduced SHI, or are thinking about doing so. And countries with SHI already in place are making vigorous efforts to extend coverage to the informal sector. Ironically, this revival is occurring at a time when the traditional SHI countries in Europe have either already reduced payroll financing in favor of general revenues, or are in the process of doing so. This paper examines how SHI fares in health-care delivery, revenue collection, covering the formal sector, and its impacts on the labor market. It argues that SHI does not necessarily deliver good quality care at a low cost, partly because of poor regulation of SHI purchasers. It suggests that the costs of collecting revenues can be substantial, even in the formal sector where non-enrollment and evasion are commonplace, and that while SHI can cover the formal sector and the poor relatively easily, it fares badly in terms of covering the non-poor informal sector workers until the economy has reached a high level of economic development. The paper also argues that SHI can have negative labor market effects.

Equilibrium restrictions of the model allow us to recover parameters of interest, including equilibrium effort levels in each hierarchical stage of the firm. We illustrate our estimation procedures using data from major retail chains in the US. We find that only a fraction of the wage differential directly compensates workers for higher effort levels, implying that a large portion of the differentials arises to maintain incentives at lower Rings of the retailers.

We then analyze the case when cointegration does not carry through the aggregation process, and we investigate whether the violation of the formal conditions for perfect aggregation can still lead to an aggregate equation that is observationally equivalent to a cointegrated relationship. We derive a Measure of the degree of noncointegration of the aggregate relationship and we explore its asymptotic properties. We propose a valid bootstrap approximation of the test.

Methodology: A discussion of evidence from behavioral research is followed by the development of a discrete choice modeling framework with explicit planning and action submodels. The plan/action choice model is formulated for both static and dynamic contexts; where the latter is based on the Hidden Markov Model. Plans are often unobservable and are treated as latent variables in model estimation using observed actions. Implications: By modeling the interactions between the planning and action stages, we are able to incorporate richer specifications in choice models with better predictive and policy analysis capabilities. The applications of this research in areas such as driving behavior, route choice, and mode choice demonstrate the advantages of the plan/action model in comparison to a black box'' choice model in terms of improved microsimulations of behaviors that better represent real-life situations. As such, the outcomes of this chapter are relevant to researchers and policy analysts.","[Ben-Akiva, Moshe] MIT, Civil & Environm Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Ben-Akiva, Moshe] MIT, Intelligent Transportat Syst Program, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Ben-Akiva, M (通讯作者)，MIT, Civil & Environm Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,,,,,20,13,16,0,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84950-772-1,,,,2010,,,,,,,19,34,,,,,,16,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Psychology, Mathematical; Transportation",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Psychology; Transportation,BE0JU,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000366173200003,0

Tussilago farfara was evaluated in locality Lidecko kriz, Lidecko - garden and Lidecko Racn. The germination of achenes was done in different light conditions. Analyses of variance and method of least square differences (LSD) were used for data assessment. The average of weight of hundert achenes was 0.0731 g by Taraxacum officinale and 0.0462 g by Tussilago farfara, where the weight differed with locality. The germination of achenes was 74% by Taraxacum officinale and 40% by Tussilago farfara. The germination of Tussilago farfara achenes was influenced by achenes maturity. Achenes by both species had higher germination in conditions of day light in comparison with night. This is in correlation with positive fotoblastic reaction of plants. Low germination showed that generative reproduction is important only in localities with favourable conditions for growth and development.","[Frantisakova, L.; Winkler, J.] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Agrosyst & Bioclimatol, Fac Agron, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Frantisáková, L (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Agrosyst & Bioclimatol, Fac Agron, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",ffranci@seznam.cz,"Winkler, Jan/J-3521-2018","Winkler, Jan/0000-0002-5700-2176",,,,,11,1,1,0,3,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-453-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,34,47,,,,,,14,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2IA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341786800003,0

Our study aimed to determine the costs of nosocomial BSIs in Canada and estimate the investment expenses for establishing infection control programs in general hospitals and conduct cost-benefit analysis. Materials and Methods: The data from the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program was used to estimate the incidence rate of nosocomial BSI. We used Canadian Institute of Health Information data to estimate the extra costs of BSIs per stay across Canada in 2004. The cost of establishing and maintaining an infection control program in 1985 was estimated by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and converted into 2004 Canadian costs. The possible 20% to 30% reduction of total nosocomial BSIs was hypothesized. Results: A total of 2524 hemodialysis-associated BSIs were projected among 15,278 hemodialysis patients in Canada in 2004. The total annual costs to treat BSIs were estimated to be CDN$49.01 million. Total investment costs in prevention and human resources were CDN$8.15 million. The savings of avoidable medical costs after establishing infection control programs were CDN$14.52 million. The benefit/cost ratio was 1.0 to 1.8:1. Conclusion: Our study provides evidence that the economic benefit from implementing infection control programs could be expected to be well in excess of additional cost postinfection if the reduction of BS1 can be reduced by 20% to 30%. Infection control offered double benefits: saving money while simultaneously improving the quality of care.","[Hong, Zhiyong; Wu, Jun; O'Leary, Crystal] Publ Hlth Agcy Canada, Blood Safety Surveillance Div, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Tisdell, Clem] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Gomes, James] Univ Ottawa, Fac Hlth Sci, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Wen, Shi-Wu] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa Hlth Res Inst, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Njoo, Howard] Publ Hlth Agcy Canada, Ctr Communicable Dis & Infect Control, Ottawa, ON, Canada",Public Health Agency of Canada; University of Queensland; University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; Public Health Agency of Canada,"Hong, ZY (通讯作者)，Publ Hlth Agcy Canada, Blood Safety Surveillance Div, AL-0601E2,100 Eglantine Driveway, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",zhiyong_hong@phac-aspc.gc.ca,"Gomes, James/R-8363-2017; Hong, Zhiyong/HGB-8597-2022; Tisdell, Clem A/A-5715-2008","Gomes, James/0000-0002-9818-5984; Tisdell, Clem A/0000-0003-4370-4692",,,,,16,7,10,0,8,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2010,13.0,1,,,,,42,45,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00578.x,0.0,,,4,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,541PI,19659704.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273429000010,0

All oils have been assumed to be Newtonian fluids, thus flow curves have not been determined. Oils have been cooled to below zero temperatures and under controlled temperature regulation, kinematic viscosity (mm(2).s(-1)) have been measured in the range of -5 degrees C and +115 degrees C. Anton Paar digital viscometer with concentric cylinders geometry has been used. In accordance with expected behavior, kinematic viscosity of all oils was decreasing with increasing temperature. Viscosity was found to be independent on oil's density. Temperature dependence has been modeled using several mathematical models - Vogel equation, Arrhenius equation, polynomial, and Gaussian equation.

This analysis is used to evaluate different budgetary policies and examine the adequacy of standard decision rules in cost-effectiveness analysis. The research decision is then considered alongside the allocation problem.

This paper will examine how the popularity of the Renaissance as a draw card for international heritage tourism is impacting a Catholic Church site in Florence, Italy holding Renaissance heritage artefacts resulting in the introduction of museological practices.

The catalytic effect of the introduction of public art into declining industrial centres has, in the UK and elsewhere, become a major tenet of urban regeneration practice since the 1980s. In many cases, the representation of aspects of the local cultural heritage are either required by the commissioning brief or claimed by the artist. The proliferation of such artworks can be viewed as a manifestation of Ritter's 'compensation theory', applied by Lobbe and others to the growth of the museum sector.

One of the enzymes that are involved in this regulation is the maize Zm-p60.1 beta-glucosidase. Protein engineering offers a means to change the substrate specificity of this enzyme. Changes in substrate specificity of enzymes can be achieved by mutations at the DNA level. Introduced mutation may have destructive side effects on protein structure. One of the ways to avoid these negative impacts of mutation is to increase the structural strength of the enzyme by adding new hydrogen bonds, whose side effect is an increase in thermostability of the enzyme. The aim was to study available informations on the Glycoside Hydrolase 1 family (at www.CAZy.org), to subjugate selected group of enzymes to bioinformatic analysis and on that basis to propose another possible direction of research, the enzyme Zm-p60.1 beta-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21) from maize (Zea mays). Based on the analysis of publications and informations contained in the CAZy database this work proposes to increase enzyme thermostability Zm-p60.1 by introducing single point mutations D112K, which should lead to new hydrogen bonds, which would contribute to the stabilization of the protein. New, more stable enzyme Zm-p60.1 should be the default option for the preparation of the next generation of enzymes with modified substrate specificity towards cytokines conjugates.","[Turek, D.; Mazura, P.] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Mol Biol & Radiobiol, Fac Agron, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Turek, D (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Mol Biol & Radiobiol, Fac Agron, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",dusanturek@seznam.cz,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-453-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,1013,1016,,,,,,4,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2IA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341786800132,0

Even though the new Federal Law on Social Health Insurance (LAMal) was implemented in 1996 to promote competition among health insurers in basic insurance, there is limited evidence of premium convergence within cantons. This indicates that competition has not been effective so far, and reveals some inertia among consumers who seem reluctant to switch to less expensive funds. We investigate one possible barrier to switching behaviour, namely the influence of supplementary insurance. We use survey data on health plan choice (a sample of 1943 individuals whose switching behaviours were observed between 1997 and 2000) as well as administrative data relative to all insurance companies that operated in the 26 Swiss cantons between 1996 and 2005. The decision to switch and the decision to subscribe to a supplementary contract are jointly estimated. Our findings show that holding a supplementary insurance contract Substantially decreases the propensity to switch. However, there is no negative impact of supplementary insurance on switching when the individual assesses his/her health as 'very good'. Our results give empirical support to one possible mechanism through which Supplementary insurance might influence switching decisions: given that subscribing to basic and supplementary contracts with two different insurers may induce some administrative costs for the subscriber, holding Supplementary insurance acts as a barrier to switch if customers who consider themselves 'bad risks' also believe that insurers reject applications for supplementary insurance on these grounds. In comparison with previous research, Our main contribution is to offer a possible explanation for consumer inertia.

Methods: A cost-utility model simulated the treatment of patients with PAH of FC III. Patients remained on the selected intervention until death or clinical deterioration to FC IV, which would trigger initiation of epoprostenol treatment. The initial first-line treatment choice was assumed to not affect survival, but to affect the time until clinical deterioration, with this assumption being relaxed in sensitivity analyses. The distribution of time to clinical deterioration was estimated from long-term clinical trial databases of bosentan and from published literature. Utility associated with FC was taken from published literature. Costs were sourced from published literature and from specialist PAH centers. The time horizon was that of patients' lifetimes, with costs and benefits discounted at 3.5% per annum. Results: In the base case, bosentan dominated no active intervention because of the longer time to clinical deterioration and therefore the reduced time, per patient, spent in FC IV, which was associated with high costs of epoprostenol and reduced utility. In sensitivity analyses, bosentan was estimated to be more cost-effective than no active intervention, provided that any survival benefit was not greater than 2 years for patients with iPAH and 1 year for those with PAH-CTD. Conclusions: Bosentan is likely to be a more cost-effective first-line therapy for patients with PAH FC III in the UK than no active intervention.","[Stevenson, Matt D.; Akehurst, Ron] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Macdonald, Frances C.; Langley, Jonathan; Hunsche, Elke] Actel Pharmaceut UK Ltd, London, England",University of Sheffield,"Stevenson, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",m.d.stevenson@shef.ac.uk,,", Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877","Actelion Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, London, UK","Actelion Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, London, UK","Financial support was provided by Actelion Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, London, UK.",,27,12,12,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,NOV-DEC,2009,12.0,8,,,,,1100,1105,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00568.x,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,515TH,19558373.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271495300010,0

The study was designed to assess whether a risperidone long-acting injection (RLAI) is associated with reduced relapses and service utilization in the real world. Methods: The Psychiatric Inpatients Medical Claims dataset was used for the analysis. It is a longitudinal dataset that includes the National Health Insurance claims of service uses by a cohort of mentally ill patients. The inclusion criteria for this analysis were patients who: 1) had available information for at least 12 months after the first dose of RLAI; 2) had a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia; and 3) were regularly treated with RLAI for at least I year. Patients who accumulatively received at least 75-mg RLAI per 3-month period were considered to be undergoing regular treatment. Wilcoxon signed rank tests were performed to compare differences in numbers of acute admissions, hospital days, emergency room visits, and relapses between the pre- and post-RLAI periods in this 1-year mirror-image study. Results: In total, 108 patients were eligible for analysis. Significant reductions in the total annual numbers of acute hospital admissions by 55% (80 vs. 36, P = 0.0003), hospital days by 48% (4106 vs. 2126, P = 0.0021), and relapses by 54% (115 vs. 53, P = 0.0005) were observed. A reduction of emergency room visits was also observed, but did not reach statistical significance (55 vs. 25, P = 0.1255). Conclusions: This 1-year mirror-image analysis with claims-based data demonstrated that RLAI treatment was associated with reductions in relapses and hospital service utilization.","[Chang, Hui-Chih; Tang, Chao-Hsiun] Taipei Med Univ, Sch Hlth Care Adm, Taipei 112, Taiwan; [Tang, Chao-Hsiun] Taipei Med Univ Hosp, Gynecol Res Ctr, Taipei, Taiwan; [Yen, Feng-Chang] Cheng Hsin Rehabil Med Ctr, Taipei, Taiwan; [Tsai, Shih-Jen] Natl Yang Ming Univ, Taipei 112, Taiwan; [Tsai, Shih-Jen] Taipei Vet Gen Hosp, Taipei, Taiwan; [Su, Kuan-Pin] China Med Univ & Hosp, Grad Inst Neural & Cognit Sci, Taichung, Taiwan; [Su, Kuan-Pin] China Med Univ & Hosp, Mind Body Interface Res Ctr, Dept Psychiat, Taichung, Taiwan; [Su, Kuan-Pin; Chang, Hui-Chih] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat, London WC2R 2LS, England",Taipei Medical University; Taipei Medical University Hospital; Taipei Medical University; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; Taipei Veterans General Hospital; China Medical University Taiwan; China Medical University Hospital - Taiwan; China Medical University Taiwan; China Medical University Hospital - Taiwan; University of London; King's College London,"Tang, CH (通讯作者)，Taipei Med Univ, Sch Hlth Care Adm, 250 Wu Shin St, Taipei 112, Taiwan.",chtang@tmu.edu.tw,"Tsai, Shih-Jen/AAK-7944-2020; Su, Kuan-Pin/P-5284-2015","Tsai, Shih-Jen/0000-0002-9987-022X; Su, Kuan-Pin/0000-0002-4501-2502",China Medical University [CMU95-143]; Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Services,China Medical University(China Medical University); Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Services,"K.-P.

Here we examine three hospital ownership types - nonprofit, for-profit, and government - and their spillover effects. We estimate the effects of for profit market share in two ways, on the provision of medical services and on operating margins at the three types of hospitals. We find that nonprofit hospitals' medical service provision systematically varies by market mix. We find no significant effect of market mix on the operating margins of nonprofit hospitals, but find that for-profit hospitals have higher margins in markets with more for-profits. These results fit best with theories in which hospitals maximize their own output. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A representative survey of the noninstitutionalized population aged 18 and above was conducted in three European countries (Germany, The Netherlands, and Spain). A total of 11,932 respondents were interviewed using the EQ-5D self-classifier. Health state values based on community preferences (EQ-5D index) were calculated for each country using four different value sets: national value sets based on the time trade-off (TTO) and the visual analogue scale (VAS), the UK TTO-based value set and the European VAS-based value set. Linear regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the factors associated with different EQ-5D index scores depending on the value set used. Loss of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was calculated for each country using the four value sets by multiplying the age and gender-specific values with the respective population size. Results: In all countries, means of all EQ-5D index scores were higher for men than women, and decreased with age. Index scores calculated using the national value set based on TTO were higher than those calculated using the UK TTO-based value set and, also, slightly higher than those calculated using the European VAS-based value set or the national value set based on the VAS. The mean loss of QALYs estimated for Germany per inhabitant varied between 0.062 (national value set based on TTO) and 0.094 (European VAS-based value set). In The Netherlands, the mean loss of QALYs per inhabitant ranged from 0.090 (national value set based on TTO) to 0.125 (national value set based on VAS). In Spain, the mean loss of QALYs per inhabitant ranged between 0.072 (national value set based on TTO) and 0.085 (European VAS-based value set). Conclusions: In general, the differences among countries and valuations were rather small; nevertheless, some important variations should be taken into account while applying different valuation methods to the EQ-5D descriptive system. The associations between sociodemographic variables and health state scores remained the same across countries regardless of which value sets were used. Using different valuation methods lead to different QALY losses. To overcome this problem in international surveys aimed to compare health state scores or QALYs, it is advisable to use a single valuation method, making these scores comparable.","[Bernert, Sebastian; Koenig, Hans-Helmut; Matschinger, Herbert; Heider, Dirk] Univ Leipzig, Dept Psychiat, Hlth Econ Res Unit, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Fernandez, Ana; Maria Haro, Josep] St Joan Deu SSM, Res & Dev Unit, Barcelona, Spain; [Alonso, Jordi; Vilagut, Gemma] IMIM Hosp Mar, Hlth Serv Res Unit, Barcelona, Spain; [Sevilla-Dedieu, Christine] Fdn MGEN Sante Publ, Paris, France; [de Graaf, Ron] Netherlands Inst Mental Hlth & Addict, Trimbos Inst, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Angermeyer, Matthias C.] Ctr Publ Mental Hlth, Wagram, Austria",Leipzig University; Hospital del Mar Research Institute; Hospital del Mar; Trimbos Institute,"König, HH (通讯作者)，Univ Leipzig, Dept Psychiat, Hlth Econ Res Unit, Liebigstr 26, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",hans-helmut.koenig@medizin.uni-leipzig.de,"Haro, Josep Maria/D-1423-2011; Alonso, Jordi/A-5514-2010; Fernandez, Ana/H-4545-2012; PRISMA, Grupo/AAI-6753-2021; König, Hans-Helmut/P-1211-2018; Vilagut, Gemma/N-8718-2014","Alonso, Jordi/0000-0001-8627-9636; Fernandez, Ana/0000-0002-0333-1345; /0000-0002-8421-8263; Matschinger, Herbert/0000-0001-7146-6770; Vilagut, Gemma/0000-0002-3714-226X",,,,,29,69,72,1,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2009,12.0,5,,,,,750,758,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00509.x,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,459SR,19490564.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267130200016,0

In addition to parameter and methodological uncertainty, there are other sources of uncertainty which include simplifications and scientific judgments that have to be made when constructing and interpreting a model of any sort. These have been classified in a number of different ways but can be referred to collectively as structural uncertainties. Materials and Methods: Separate reviews were undertaken to identify what forms these other sources of uncertainty take and what other forms of potential methods to explicitly characterize these types of uncertainties in decision analytic models. These methods were demonstrated through application to four decision models each representing one of the four types of uncertainty. Results: These sources of uncertainty fall into four general themes: 1) inclusion of relevant comparators; 2) inclusion of relevant events; 3) alternative statistical estimation methods; and 4) clinical uncertainty. Two methods to explicitly characterize such uncertainties were identified: model selection and model averaging. In addition, an alternative approach, adding uncertain parameters to represent the source of uncertainty was also considered. The applications demonstrate that cost-effectiveness may be sensitive to these uncertainties and the methods used to characterize them. The value of research was particularly sensitive to these uncertainties and the methods used to characterize it. It is therefore important, for decision-making purposes, to incorporate such uncertainties into the modeling process. Conclusion: Only parameterizing the uncertainty directly in the model can inform the decision to conduct further research to resolve this source of uncertainty.","[Bojke, Laura; Claxton, Karl; Sculpher, Mark; Palmer, Stephen] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Claxton, Karl] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK; University of York - UK,"Bojke, L (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",lg116@york.ac.uk,,"Sculpher, Mark/0000-0003-3746-9913",MRC [MC_U145079308] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [MC_U145079308] Funding Source: researchfish,MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),,,57,104,114,0,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2009,12.0,5,,,,,739,749,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00502.x,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,459SR,19508655.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267130200015,0

We focus oil the importance of typically unobserved but theoretically important variables (typically unobserved variables, TUVs), other non-standard covariates (NSCs), input reporting, and characterization of infant health. The TUVs represent wantedness, taste for risky behavior, and maternal health endowment. The NSCs include father characteristics. We estimate the effects of prenatal drug use, prenatal cigarette smoking, and first trimester prenatal care on birth weight, low birth weight, and a measure of abnormal infant health conditions. We compare estimates using self-reported inputs versus input measures that combine information from medical records and self-reports. We find that TUVs and NSCs are significantly associated with both inputs and outcomes, but that excluding them from infant health production functions does not appreciably affect the input estimates. However, using self-reported inputs leads to overestimated effects of inputs, particularly prenatal care, oil outcomes, and using a direct measure of infant health does not always yield input estimates similar to those when using birth weight Outcomes. The findings have implications for research, data collection, and public health policy.

This paper aims to fill this gap by evaluating the impact of Rural Mutual Health Care (RMHC), a community-based health insurance scheme, on enrollees' health outcomes. RMHC is a social experiment that was conducted in one of China's western provinces from 2003 to 2006. The RMHC experiment adopted a pre-post treatment-control study design. This study used panel data collected in 2002, 1 year prior to the intervention, and followed up in 2005, 2 years after the intervention, both in the intervention and control sites. We measured health status using both a 5-point Categorical Rating Scale and the EQ-5D instruments. The estimation method used here is difference-in-difference combined propensity score matching. The results show that RMHC has a positive effect on the health status of participants. Among the five dimensions of EQ-5D, RMHC significantly reduces pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression for the general Population, and has a positive impact on mobility and usual activity for those over 55-years old. Our study provides useful policy information on the development of health insurance in developing countries, and also identifies areas where further research is needed.

In this paper, we introduce a new concept of Granger causality in risk and propose a class of kernel-based tests to detect extreme downside risk spillover between financial markets, where risk is measured by the left tail of the distribution or equivalently by the Value at Risk (VaR). The proposed tests have a convenient asymptotic standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis of no Granger causality in risk. They check a large number of lags and thus can detect risk spillover that Occurs with a time lag or that has weak spillover at each lag but carries over a very long distributional lag. Usually, tests using a large number of lags may have low power against alternatives of practical importance, due to the loss of a large number of degrees of freedom. Such power loss is fortunately alleviated for our tests because our kernel approach naturally discounts higher order lags, which is consistent with the stylized fact that today's financial markets are often more influenced by the recent events than the remote past events. A simulation study shows that the proposed tests have reasonable size and power against a variety of empirically plausible alternatives in finite samples, including the spillover from the dynamics in mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis respectively. In particular, nonuniform weighting delivers better power than uniform weighting and a Granger-type regression procedure. The proposed tests are useful in investigating large comovements between financial markets such as financial contagions. An application to the Eurodollar and Japanese Yen highlights the merits of our approach.

The dichotomous response variable A is influenced by a set of covariates that can be partitioned as (X, Z) where Z (real valued) is the covariate of primary interest and X (vector valued) denotes a set of control variables. For any fixed X, the conditional probability of the event of interest (Delta = 1) is assumed to be a non-decreasing function of Z. The effect of the control variables is captured by a regression parameter beta. We show that the baseline conditional probability function (corresponding to X = 0) can be estimated by isotonic regression procedures and develop a likelihood ratio based method for constructing asymptotic confidence intervals for the conditional probability function (the regression function) that avoids the need to estimate nuisance parameters. Interestingly enough, the calibration of the likelihood ratio based confidence sets for the regression function no longer involves the usual chi(2) quantiles, but those of the distribution of a new random variable that can be characterized as a functional of convex minorants of Brownian motion with quadratic drift. Confidence sets for the regression parameter beta can however be constructed using asymptotically chi(2) likelihood ratio statistics. The finite sample performance of the methods are assessed via a simulation study. The techniques of the paper are applied to data sets on primary school attendance among children belonging to different socio-economic groups in rural India. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The HUI3 and Short Form-36 were self-completed by 185 CKD patients enrolled in a prospective study of incident patients with stage 4 and 5 CKD. The mean preference-based score for the SF-6D was 0.67 +/- 0.13 compared to 0.58 +/- 0.26 for the HUI3 (P < 0.01). There was a strong association between SF-6D and HUI3 scores (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.55, 95% CI 0.43-0.65) and moderate agreement with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.44. The HUI3 was better able to capture more severe burden of illness with fewer floor effects. The SF-6D was better at capturing differences among patients at the top range of the scale with fewer ceiling effects. Both the HUI3 and SF-6D were able to discriminate between patient groups differing in disease severity defined as predialysis versus dialysis dependent and depressive symptoms using a Beck Depression Inventory II score of >= 14 as the cutoff. The HUI3 was better able to discriminate greater depressive symptoms. The SF-6D and the HUI3 generate different preference-based scores for patients with CKD and any comparison between their scores should be made with caution. The HUI3 appears more suitable for measuring the health of populations with greater disability such as patients with CKD. It remains to be determined whether these differences will remain when one compares within-instrument differences in preference scores over time.","[Davison, Sara; Jhangri, Gian S.] Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Feeny, David H.] Kaiser Permanente NW, Portland, OR USA",University of Alberta; Kaiser Permanente,"Davison, SN (通讯作者)，11-107 Clin Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G3, Canada.",sara.davison@ualberta.ca,,,Institute of Health Economics,Institute of Health Economics,Source of financial support: This study was partially funded by a grant from the Institute of Health Economics.,,37,24,26,0,8,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2009,12.0,2,,,,,340,345,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00433.x,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,408WY,18657096.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000263467500021,0

On the one hand, a longer life span increases the probability that new and costly diseases occur. On the other hand, a higher life expectancy postpones the expensive last year of life (LYOL), which becomes cheaper with age. Using US expenditure data oil survivors and decedents the paper shows that prevention in the general population causes expenditures for additional diseases that are larger than the savings from postponing the LYOL.

The primary data sources are the American Hospital Association Annual Surveys, the Medicare hospital cost reports, and the HMO enrollment and ownership data from Interstudy. I analyze the risks of shutting down each safety net service separately using the proportional hazard models. I find that the risks of shutting down hospital safety net services do not vary by different levels of overall HMO penetration. However, conditional on the overall HMO penetration level, increasing for-profit presence of HMO does increase the risks of shutting down several safety net services. Policies evaluating the for-profit expansion or ownership conversion of health plans should take this potential adverse effect into consideration.

However, the mechanism of MC's price bargaining has not been well studied. This article uses a unique panel dataset with actual hospital prices in Massachusetts between 1994 and 2000 to examine the sources of MC's bargaining power. I find two significant determinants of price discounts. First, plans with large memberships are able to extract volume discounts across hospitals. Second, health plans that are more successful at channeling patients can extract greater discounts. Patient channeling can add to the volume discount that plans negotiate. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, an egalitarian is assumed to be an egalitarian in the outcome space. But what about egalitarianism in the gains space, such that people focus instead on how equally benefits are distributed? This paper reports on a study in which members of the public were asked to rank a number of health programmes that differed in the distribution of benefits and final outcomes in ways that enabled us to distinguish between different types of egalitarianism. The results suggest that outcome egalitarianism dominates, particularly for differences in health by social class, but a sizeable minority of respondents appear to be gain egalitarians. especially when the health differences are by sex. These results have important implications for how we think about outcome based social welfare functions in economics.

All models are based on the assumption that the model parameters might depend on the underlying physical stimulus scale by which the physical intensities are measured. By discussing the meaningfulness of the model parameters, we come to the conclusion that the near-miss-to-Weber's law can be applied to physical quantities which are measured on a ratio-, interval-, or log-interval scale, whereas applications of Weber's law and Guilford's power law are necessarily restricted to physical ratio scales. Finally, we discuss the meaningfulness of an empirically based submodel of the near-miss-to-Weber's law, referred to as fixed-point model. The results show that, from a theoretical point of view, the fixed-point model is superior to Guilford's power law and the near-miss-to-Weber's law. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Regression analysis is used to establish the relationship between the two instruments. The performance of the model is assessed in terms of how well the responses to the EORTC QLQ C-30 predict the EQ-5D responses for a separate data set. The results showed that the model explaining EQ-5D values predicted well. All of the actual values were within the 95% confidence intervals of the predicted values. More importantly, predicted difference in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) between the arms of the trial was almost identical to the actual difference.

Patients in the USA and UK completed a new Satisfaction with ICT (SICT) instrument consisting of 28 items, three pertaining to adherence. Simple and multivariate regression analyses assessed the relationship between satisfaction with different aspects of ICT and adherence. First assessments of the SICT instrument indicate its validity and reliability. Recommended thresholds for internal consistency, convergent validity, discriminant validity, and floor and ceiling effects were met. A number of variables were identified in the simple linear regression analyses as significant predictors of never thinking about stopping ICT, a proxy for adherence. These significant variables were entered into the multivariate model to assess the combined factor effects, explaining 42% of the total variance of never thinking about stopping ICT. A significant and positive relationship was demonstrated between never thinking about stopping ICT and age (P = 0.04), Perceived Effectiveness of ICT (P = 0.003), low Burden of ICT (P = 0.002), and low Side Effects of ICT (P = 0.01). The SICT is a reliable and valid instrument which will be useful in ICT clinical trials. Furthermore, the administration of ICT by slow subcutaneous infusion negatively impacts on satisfaction with ICT which was shown to be a determinant of adherence. This points to the need for new more convenient and less burdensome oral iron chelators to increase adherence, and ultimately to improve patient outcomes.","[Rofail, Diana; Abetz, Linda; Gait, Claire] Mapi Values, Bollington SK10 5JB, Cheshire, England; [Baladi, Jean-Francois] Novartis Pharmaceut, E Hanover, NJ USA; [Viala, Muriel] Mapi Values, Lyon, France; [Payne, Krista] Caro Res, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Novartis,"Rofail, D (通讯作者)，Mapi Values, Bollington SK10 5JB, Cheshire, England.",diana.rofail@mapivalues.com,,,,,,,31,24,25,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2009,12.0,1,,,,,109,117,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00390.x,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,397XX,18637142.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000262696800017,0

The major finding is the moderate evidence of convergence in total health care expenditure and the diverge performance of the expenditure components regarding convergence. We also find hospital care to be responsible for the bulk of cross-state convergence in total expenditure. The expenditure on prescription drugs is the most important diverging factor.

The approach proposed is applied to the stock markets of the G7 countries to investigate the volatility contagion due to the subprime mortgage crisis.

When stage 1 is competitive, the equilibrium in pure strategies exists and is efficient only if the reference price (R) does not depend on the price of the branded product. When generics collude, the way R is designed is crucial for both the stability of the cartel among generics and the collusive prices in equilibrium. An optimally designed RPS must set R as a function only of the infinitely elastic side of the market and should provide the right incentives for competition. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Content validity is the extent to which an instrument measures the important aspects of concepts that developers or users purport it to assess. A PRO instrument measures the concepts most significant and relevant to a patient's condition and its treatment. For PRO instruments, items and domains as reflected in the scores of an instrument should be important to the target population and comprehensive with respect to patient concerns. Documentation of target population input in item generation, as well as evaluation of patient understanding through cognitive interviewing, can provide the evidence for content validity. Developing content for, and assessing respondent understanding of, newly developed PRO instruments for medical product evaluation will be discussed in this two-part ISPOR PRO Good Research Practices Task Force Report. Topics include the methods for generating items, documenting item development, coding of qualitative data from item generation, cognitive interviewing, and tracking item development through the various stages of research and preparing this tracking for submission to regulatory agencies. Part 1 covers elicitation of key concepts using qualitative focus groups and/or interviews to inform content and structure of a new PRO instrument. Part 2 covers the instrument development process, the assessment of patient understanding of the draft instrument using cognitive interviews and steps for instrument revision. The two parts are meant to be read together. They are intended to offer suggestions for good practices in planning, executing, and documenting qualitative studies that are used to support the content validity of PRO instruments to be used in medical product evaluation.","[Patrick, Donald L.] Univ Washington, Dept Hlth Serv, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Burke, Laurie B.] Food & Drug Adm, Ctr Drug Evaluat Res, Off New Drugs, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Gwaltney, Chad J.] Brown Univ, Dept Community Hlth, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Gwaltney, Chad J.] PRO Consulting, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Leidy, Nancy Kline] United BioSource Corp, Bethesda, MD USA; [Martin, Mona L.] Hlth Res Associates Inc, Seattle, WA USA; [Molsen, Elizabeth] Int Soc Pharmacoecon & Outcomes Res, Lawrenceville, NJ USA; [Ring, Lena] AstraZeneca, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res Div, Sodertalje, Sweden; [Ring, Lena] Uppsala Univ, Dept Pharm, Uppsala, Sweden",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; US Food & Drug Administration (FDA); Brown University; United Biosource Corporation; AstraZeneca; Uppsala University,"Patrick, DL (通讯作者)，Univ Washington Hlth Serv, POB 359455,SeaQoL Grp, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",donald@u.washington.edu,"Patrick, Donald/Y-2460-2019","Patrick, Donald/0000-0003-0756-0492",,,,,44,677,700,1,41,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2011,14.0,8,,,,,967,977,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.06.014,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BM,22152165.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299081900002,0

A Review and Meta-analysis,VALUE IN HEALTH,,,English,Review,,,,,,content validity; meta-analysis; patient-reported outcomes; questionnaire length; response rates,QUALITY-OF-LIFE; POSTAL QUESTIONNAIRES; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; HEALTH SURVEY; FOLLOW-UP; PATIENT SATISFACTION; CANCER-PATIENTS; RATES; INSTRUMENTS; RELIABILITY,"Background: Response burden is often defined as the effort required by the patient to answer a questionnaire. A factor that has been proposed to affect the response burden is questionnaire length, and this burden is manifested in, for example, response rate. Even though response burden is frequently mentioned as a reason for abridging questionnaires, evidence to support the notion that shorter instruments are preferable is limited. Objectives: This study aimed to accumulate, analyze, and discuss evidence regarding the association between response burden, as measured by response rate, and questionnaire length. Methods: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis of studies reporting response rates in relation to questionnaire length was performed. A Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by study using the Breslow-Day test was undertaken to investigate homogeneity of the odds ratios. Results: Thirty-two reports were identified, of which 20 were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Three studies used patient input as main outcome when evaluating response burden. In the meta-analysis, a general association between response rate and questionnaire length was found (P <= 0.0001). Response rates were lower for longer questionnaires, but because the P value for test of homogeneity was P = 0.03, this association should be interpreted with caution because it is impossible to separate the impact of content from length of the questionnaires. Conclusion: Given the inherently problematic nature of comparing questionnaires of various lengths, it is preferable to base decisions on use of instruments on the content rather than the length per se.","[Rolstad, Sindre; Adler, John; Ryden, Anna] AstraZeneca R&D, SE-43183 Molndal, Sweden",AstraZeneca,"Rolstad, S (通讯作者)，AstraZeneca R&D, Room GA252B,Pepparedsleden 1, SE-43183 Molndal, Sweden.",sindre.rolstad@astrazeneca.com,"rolstad, sindre/B-8986-2009","rolstad, sindre/0000-0001-5570-875X","AstraZeneca R&D, Molndal, Sweden","AstraZeneca R&D, Molndal, Sweden(AstraZeneca)","Source of financial support: This study was financed by AstraZeneca R&D, Molndal, Sweden.",,50,473,563,2,62,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2011,14.0,8,,,,,1101,1108,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.06.003,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BM,22152180.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299081900017,0

Using the instrumental variable approach, we propose method of moments estimators for the unknown parameters and simulation-based estimators to overcome the possible computational difficulty of minimizing an objective function which involves multiple integrals. Both estimators are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed under fairly general regularity conditions. Moreover, root-n consistent semiparametric estimators and a rank condition for model identifiability are derived using the combined methods of the nonparametric technique and Fourier deconvolution.

However, due to the differences between men and women in the development and presentation of CVD, such effects may vary by sex. We use a valid set of instrumental variables to evaluate these issues and include a test of essential heterogeneity. CVD events include new occurrences of heart attack (including death from heart attack), stroke (including death from stroke), angina, and congestive heart failure. Controls include age, race, education, marital status, foreign birthplace, and cardiovascular risk factors (health status, body mass index, alcohol use, smoking status, diabetes status, high-blood-pressure status, physical activity, and depression). Our analysis finds no evidence of essential heterogeneity. We find the minimum average treatment effect for women to be -0.01, but find no treatment effect for men. This suggests that women who receive dental care may reduce their risk of future CVD events by at least one-third. The findings may only apply to married middle-aged and older individuals as the data set is only representative for this group.

The impact of school on children's BMI when starting age is endogenous,JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Childhood obesity; School health policies; School starting age,CHILDHOOD OBESITY; HEAD-START,"In this paper, we investigate the impact of attending school on body weight and obesity using a regression-discontinuity design. As is the case with academic outcomes, school exposure is related to unobserved determinants of weight outcomes because some families choose to have their child start school late (or early). If one does not account for this endogeneity, it appears that an additional year of school exposure results in a greater BMI and a higher probability of being overweight or obese. When we compare the weight outcomes of similar age children with one versus two years of school exposure due to regulations on school starting age, the significant positive effects disappear, and most point estimates become negative, but insignificant. However, additional school exposure appears to improve weight outcomes of children for whom the transition to elementary school represents a more dramatic change in environment (those who spent less time in childcare prior to kindergarten).

We build on the work of Bhattacharya and Bundorf (2009), who provide evidence that obese workers receive lower wages on account of their higher expected healthcare costs. Similarly, we find that smokers who hold employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI) receive significantly lower wages than their nonsmoking peers, while smokers who are not insured through their employer endure no such wage penalty. Our results have two implications: first, the incidence of smokers' elevated medical costs appears to be borne by smokers themselves in the form of lower wages. Second, differences in healthcare costs between smokers and non-smokers are a significant source of the smoker's wage gap. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Simple theory predicts that price regulation in one country might affect total investment. but not the location of that investment, if sales are global. Nevertheless, some manufacturers threaten that the introduction of price regulation in a country will motivate them to move their investments to other countries. Are such threats cheap talk, or is there evidence that firms avoid price-controlling countries when making FDI location choices? We use data on 527 investments initiated in 27 European countries between 2002 and 2009 and find that investors are less likely to choose countries with price controls, after controlling for other determinants of investment. We also observe a relative decline in investment in countries that increased the stringency of regulatory regimes during our sample period. The effect is restricted to non-manufacturing investments and is most robust for those related to administrative functions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

These utility weights could then be used in future cost-effectiveness studies. Methods: Health utility weights were measured by the Short Form-6D (SF-6D), a health utility index derived from the Short Form Medical Outcomes questionnaire. Adjusted least square means were calculated for each level of Hgb at baseline and in longitudinal regression analysis the relationship between change in Hgb and change in the SF-6D was examined. Both baseline and longitudinal analyses were performed for all postmenopausal women and separately for those with self-reported heart failure, cancer, and osteoarthritis. Results: Women with Hgb in the anemic range had lower health utility weights than those with higher Hgb levels. Longitudinally, a loss of of 2 g/dl Hgb or more was associated with a statistically significant and clinically meaningfully decline in SF-6D in all participants and also in the group of participants with cancer and osteoarthritis, but not in those with heart failure. Conclusions: Lower levels of Hgb and a loss of Hgb are associated with a statistically significant and clinically meaningful decrement in health utility in all postmenopausal women we studied and also in those with chronic conditions.","[Harrow, Brooke S.] Vertex Pharmaceut Inc, Med Affairs Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Eaton, C.

In this article, we provide both theoretical and empirical analysis of multi-factor joint affine term structure models (ATSM) for dollar and euro interest rates. In particular, we provide a systematic classification of multi-factor joint ATSM similar to that of Dai and Singleton (2000). A principal component analysis of daily dollar and euro interest rates reveals four factors in the data. We estimate four-factor joint ATSM using the approximate maximum likelihood method of Ait-Sahalia (2002, forthcoming) and compare the in-sample and out-of-sample performances of these models using some of the latest nonparametric methods. We find that a new four-factor model with two common and two local factors captures the joint term structure dynamics in the US and the EU reasonably well. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J,"David, G; Neuman, MD",,,,"David, Guy; Neuman, Mark D.",,,Physician division of labor and patient selection for outpatient procedures,JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Outpatient care; Patient selection; Physician behavior,AMBULATORY SURGERY CENTERS,"Little is known about the ability of incentives to influence decisions by physicians regarding choices of settings for care delivery. In the context of outpatient procedural care, the emergence of freestanding ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) as alternatives to hospital-based outpatient departments (HOPDs) creates a unique opportunity to study this question. We advance a model where physicians' division of labor between ASCs and HOPDs affects the medical complexity of patients treated in low-acuity settings (i.e. ASCs). Analyses of outpatient surgical procedure data show that physicians working exclusively in low-acuity settings (i.e. ASCs) treat patients of significantly higher medical complexity in these settings than do physicians who also practice in higher-acuity settings (i.e. HOPDs). This discrepancy shrinks with increasing procedural risk and with increasing distance between ASCs and acute care hospitals. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The outcome that the bargaining finally reaches exactly coincides with the non-cooperative outcome, and it cannot be improved upon even by any objections with almost zero cost.

In addition to more widely discussed issues such as the choice of instrument (e. g. EQ-5D or SF-6D?) researchers must also choose between different recall periods, scoring algorithms and interpolations between points of measurement. Methods: A prospective survey was made among 114 Belgian patients with acute hepatitis A illness. Using non-parametric tests and generalized linear models (GLM's), we compared four different methods to estimate QALY losses, two based on the EQ-5D (administered during the period of illness without recall period) and two based on the SF-6D (administered after illness with 4 weeks recall period). Results: We found statistically significant differences between all methods, with the non-parametric SF-6D-based method yielding the highest median QALY impact (0.032 QALYs). This is more than five times as high as the EQ-5D-based method with linear health improvement, which yields the lowest median QALY impact (0.006 QALYs). Conclusions: Economic evaluations of health care technologies predominantly use QALYs to quantify health benefits. Non-standardised analytical choices can have a decision-changing impact on cost-effectiveness results, particularly if morbidity takes up a substantial part of the total QALY loss. Yet these choices are rarely subjected to sensitivity analysis. Researchers and decision makers should be aware of the influence of these somewhat arbitrary choices on their results.

Methods: From the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register, 2400 patients were chosen at random but stratified by age, sex, and diagnosis for inclusion in a 4-year follow-up using the health-related quality of life tool EQ-5D and visual analogue scales for pain and satisfaction. The patients were randomized to answer the follow-up model protocol either via a password-protected Internet questionnaire or via a mailed pen-and-paper questionnaire. Results: A reliability test for the Internet follow-up instrument showed adequate correlation. However, the Internet group and the pen-and-paper group differed significantly (P < 0.001) with a 92% response rate in the latter and 49% in the former. Adjusted to the normal age distribution of the total hip replacement population, the Internet response rate was 34%. Conclusions: The patient-administered Internet questionnaire alone does not give a sufficient response rate in the total hip replacement population to replace the pen-and-paper questionnaire. However, the system is reliable and could be used for measuring patient-reported outcome if supplemented with traditional pen-and-paper questionnaires for Internet nonrespondents. It is expected that this answer procedure will soon predominate in view of the general development of Internet functions.

A key feature of the model is that the transition function depends on all the parameters of the model as well as on the data. Since the mixing weights are also a function of the regime-specific noise covariance matrix, the model can account for contemporaneous regime-specific co-movements of the variables. The stability and distributional properties of the proposed model are discussed, as well as issues of estimation, testing and forecasting.

For this purpose, a DSGE model of two small open economies with foreign sector is employed. Both small open economies consist of four types of agents: households, firms, importers and monetary authority. Compared to the model framework with one small open economy, the model allows for trade between the small open economies which implies that there are two types of importers according to the origin of the imported goods. The model framework assumes monopolistically competitive firms, complete international financial markets, perfectly competitive labour market and allows for deviations from the law of one price. Four variants of model are estimated using Bayesian method (incorporated in Dynare toolbox for Matlab). The variants differ in the assumptions about interactions between Czech and Slovak economy. The variant that best explains data is used to assess the importance of interactions between these two economies. To complete the assessment of interactions between these two economies, the paper presents forecast error variance decomposition of shocks and shock decomposition of selected variables. The contribution of the paper is in the recommendation for economic policy makers as to whether they should take into account the business cycle of the neighbour economy.","[Belakova, Veronika] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,,ciganova.veronika@gmail.com,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,PROFESSIONAL PUBLISHING,PRUHONICE,"NA SIDLISTI 152, PRUHONICE, PRAGUE 252 43, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7431-058-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,41,46,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BBZ07,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000309074600006,0

The direct (static) effect of the investment is the change in profit compared to the base-case scenario (no investment is made, constant outputs of both investor and competitor). The strategic effect results from changes in output of firms due to transition of the Cournot oligopoly (base-case scenario) to a new equilibrium.

Queues in special types of linear systems were investigated earlier using max-plus algebra. Closed and open tandem networks were considered with special starting conditions. In the paper the control of linear queueing systems is studied, under assumption that the flow of service requests is stable for some time period. The objective of the control is to minimize the variable, fixed and waiting costs in the considered linear manufacturing system. Interesting results in this problem were found, such as an algorithm for computing the variable queue lengths in front of each server during the considered time period.

The experiment consists of three sub-experiments. First experiment tests the biodegradation capability of packages under laboratory conditions. The aim of this part is to simulate intensive composting conditions and to verify the ability of packages decomposing and to observe the impact of the biodegradation process on composted material. This experiment is already finished. Second part is running on real compost facility. Aim of the part is to verify the decomposing ability of packages under real conditions of industrial composting process. The experiment is still running. Finally, third part will be focused on verifying the ability of decomposition of packages under real conditions of garden composting. Third part of experiment will start at the end of April and May 2012. Test will run in eight garden composters, where nine or ten packages in wooden matrixes will be loaded (cellulose filtrate paper as blank). The 02, temperature and humidity in composters will be also monitored. Samples will be observed every week. The chemical analysis of composting material, focused on heavy metals, will be done before and after experiment to observe the impact of the biodegradation process on environmental. In the end the residues of samples will be washed with distilled water and dried in drier. Weight difference of sample before and after test will be expressed as a percentage weight loss. Presumed term of the test is thirteen weeks. Provisional results from laboratory experiment show positive biodegradation ability of three samples and negative ability of four samples. CFP as blank was positive. It seems that one sample is the cause of higher concentration of lead in composted material. Right now the test is repeated to proof it. Provisional results from second part show similar results as laboratory test. It is expected to obtain very similar results from the third part of the experiment.","[Hlisnikovsky, L.; Kotovicova, J.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Appl & Landscape Ecol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Hlisnikovsky, L (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Appl & Landscape Ecol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",luka.hlisnik@gmail.com,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-563-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,367,371,,,,,,5,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2HX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341783400044,0

Our objective was to describe the incidence of the Lydella thompsoni adults able to attack the second generation corn borer larvae in autumn on maize plants in Slovakia. It is a first study that discussed occurrence of parasitoids attacking the second generation larvae of European corn borer (ECB). On October 7 in 2010 together 660 larvae of the pest were collected from maize plants at the location Gabc kovo. Larvae were reared on simplified artificial diet in 200 ml glasses in laboratory conditions (22 degrees C, relative air humidity 60%). Three parasitoid species, Lydella thompsoni Herting, Sinophorus turionus (Ratz.) and Eriborus terebrans (Gravenhorst), were reared from field-collected second generation ECB larvae in the region Gabc kovo in south-western Slovakia. The level of parasitism was relatively low (3.03%) and the emerged parasitoids were fourteen individuals of Lydella Thompsoni (Diptera, Tachinidae), three females of Sinophorus turionus and three females of Eriborus terebrans (both Hymenoptera, Ichneumonidae). Lydella thompsoni was the most abundant parasitoid (2.1%) and represented 70% of all emerged parasitoid species attacking the second generation pest's larvae. The pupation of L. thompsoni started on October 20 and the last pupa was found on November 17. More than 50% larvae of Lydella thompsoni pupated till November 12, twenty two days after the beginning of pupation. The flight of the Lydella thompsoni adults started at the beginning of November in laboratory conditions. The last adults emerged on November 30 in 2010. The length of the flight period corresponded with the length of the pupation period. All pupae of the tachinid appeared in the period of twenty nine days and all the adults emerged within twenty eight days. The pupal stage lasted from ten to fourteen days and the average time for the pupal stage was 12. 21 days. Important question is what adults of L. thompsoni did attack the larvae at the end of September or beginning of October? It is known, that about one-third of L. thompsoni adults emerge from first generation ECB larvae at the end of the growing season in Slovakia. The rest overwinter in host and emerge in spring in next year. Until now it was unknown what host did the autumn generation of L. thompsoni attack. According to our study, these adults parasitize larvae of second ECB generation and probably overwinter in these larvae in the field conditions. This is the first described occurrence of the second generation larvae of the ECB and their parasitoids in Slovakia.","[Pernis, M.; Cagan, L'] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Agrobiol & Food Resources, Dept Plant Protect, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Pernis, M (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Agrobiol & Food Resources, Dept Plant Protect, Trieda A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",pernismiro@gmail.com,"Perniš, Miroslav/D-4964-2019","Perniš, Miroslav/0000-0003-4190-130X",,,,,30,2,2,0,2,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-563-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,433,441,,,,,,9,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2HX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341783400051,0

This laboratory is provided with reactors of various volumes controlling all the variables on which the course of the process, measurement of the quantity of the biogas being generated, temperature measurement, and openings for sampling the substrate and biogas depend. One group of tests was focused on waste produced by starch industry that can be used within the mesophyll anaerobic fermentation. Composition of the dosed substrate was as follows: pentoses 22.57%, bran 22.57%, B-starch 4.07%, draff 5.64% and floater 45.15%. Tests were performed by means of co-fermentation with an inoculation substrate from an agricultural biomass power plant in 10 reactors of which 2 were kept without substrate additions. Biogas production out of these checked reactors was then subtracted from the total production of biogas out of the reactors with substrate. On the basis of the test results the average production of biogas or methane per one kilogram of dry matter respectively was calculated. On the basis of the results it is possible to say that the starch waste of the specified quantity and composition may be used as a substrate for a biomass power plant. On the basis of the tests an average production of biogas per a kilogram of the dry matter was calculated after fifteen days 0.9053 m(3).kg(-1) and 0,9708 m(3).kg(-1) after twenty-two days and 0.4779 m(3).kg(-1) methane after 15 days and 0.5176 m(3).kg(-1) after 22 days.

Nevertheless, methods for synthesis of randomized controlled trials with competing risk outcomes are limited. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and illustrate flexible evidence synthesis methods for trials reporting competing risk results, which allow for studies with different follow-up times, and that take account of the statistical dependencies between outcomes, regardless of the number of outcomes and treatments. Methods: We propose a competing risk meta-analysis based on hazards, rather than probabilities, estimated in a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework using WinBUGS software. Our approach builds on existing work on mixed treatment comparison (network) meta-analysis, which can be applied to any number of treatments, and any number of competing outcomes, and to data sets with varying follow-up times. We show how a fixed effect model can be estimated, and two random treatment effect models with alternative structures for between-trial variation. We suggest methods for choosing between these alternative models. Results: We illustrate the methods by applying them to a data set involving 17 trials comparing nine antipsychotic treatments for schizophrenia including placebo, on three competing outcomes: relapse, discontinuation because of intolerable side effects, and discontinuation for other reasons. Conclusions: Bayesian MCMC provides a flexible framework for synthesis of competing risk outcomes with multiple treatments, particularly suitable for embedding within probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis.","[Ades, A.

The Assessment of Quality of Life Mark 2 (AQoL-6D) instrument was completed by 15,481 adolescents to obtain a description of the quality of life associated with adolescent overweight and obesity, and a corresponding utility score for use in a cost-utility analysis of the interventions. This article describes the recalibration of this utility instrument for adolescents in each country. Methods: The recalibration was based on country-specific time trade-off (TTO) data for 30 multiattribute health states constructed from the AQoL-6D descriptive system. Senior secondary students, in a classroom setting, responded to 10 health state scenarios each. These TTO interviews were conducted for 24 groups, comprising 279 students in the four countries resulting in 2790 completed TTO scores. The TTO scores were econometrically transformed by regressing the TTO scores upon predicted scores from the AQoL-6D to produce country-specific algorithms. The latter incorporated country-specific corrections to the Australian adult utility weights in the original AQoL. Results: This article reports two methodological elements not previously reported. The first is the econometric modification of an extant multi-attribute utility instrument to accommodate cultural and other group-specific differences in preferences. The second is the use of the TTO technique with adolescents in a classroom group setting. Significant differences in utility scores were found between the four countries. Conclusion: Statistical results indicate that the AQoL-6D can be validly used in the economic evaluation of both the OPIC interventions and other adolescent programs.","[Moodie, Marj] Deakin Univ, Populat Hlth Strateg Res Ctr, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Richardson, Jeff; Iezzi, Angelo; Sinha, Kompal] Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Rankin, Bree] Univ Melbourne, Ctr Hlth Program Evaluat, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",Deakin University; Monash University; University of Melbourne,"Moodie, M (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Populat Hlth Strateg Res Ctr, 221 Burwood Rd, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",marj.moodie@deakin.edu.au,,"Richardson, Jeff/0000-0002-4248-4280; Sinha, Kompal/0000-0003-4318-6100; Moodie, Marjory/0000-0001-6890-5250",National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia); Health Research Council (New Zealand); Wellcome Trust (Fiji and Tonga),National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); Health Research Council (New Zealand)(Health Research Council of New Zealand); Wellcome Trust (Fiji and Tonga)(Wellcome Trust),"National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia), Health Research Council (New Zealand), Wellcome Trust (Fiji and Tonga).",,27,72,73,0,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2010,13.0,8,,,,,1014,1027,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00780.x,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,691FR,20825621.0,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285066200021,0

First, we consider a network-based approach; in particular Jackson-Wolinsky's concept of pairwise stability. Next, we discuss a non-cooperative game-theoretic approach, through a refinement of the Nash equilibria of Myerson's consent game. This refinement, denoted as monadic stability, describes myopically forward looking behavior of the players. We show through an equivalence that the class of monadically stable networks is a strict subset of the class of pairwise stable networks that can be characterized fully by modifications of the properties defining pairwise stability.

A preference relation on the set of consumption plans is strictly monotonic whenever to consume more of at least one commodity is more preferred. It is an easy task to find examples of strictly monotonic preference relations when K is finite or countable. However, it is not easy for spaces like l(infinity)-([0, 1]). the space of bounded functions on the unit interval. In this note we investigate the roots of this difficulty. We show that strictly monotonic preferences always exist. However, if K is uncountable no such preference on l(infinity)(K) is continuous and none of them have a utility representation.

Costs of the premiums as well as enrollment location were randomly allocated. Overall, take-up of the program was low, with only 20% enrollment. Program costs and streamlined bureaucratic procedures were important determinants of enrollment. Participation of local microfinance institutions had a slight negative effect on enrollment. One year later, those who received insurance substituted toward services at covered facilities and total out-of-pocket expenditures fell. However, total expenditures fell by less than the insurance premiums. We find no evidence of an increase in health-care utilization among the newly insured. We also find very low retention rates after the expiration of the subsidy, with less than 10% of enrollees still enrolled after one year. To shed light on the findings from the experimental results, we present qualitative evidence of institutional and contextual factors that limited the success of this program.

The paper contributes to the existing literature in two ways. First, by making a comparison with the complete information case it formally describes a set of conditions under which allowing for private information in payoffs facilitates the identification of various features of the game. Second, focusing on the incomplete information case it presents an estimation procedure based on the equilibrium properties of the game that relies on weak semiparametric assumptions and relatively flexible information structures which allow players to condition their beliefs on signals whose exact distribution function is unknown to the researcher. The proposed estimators recover unobserved beliefs by solving a semiparametric sample analog of the population Bayesian-Nash equilibrium conditions. The asymptotic features of such estimators are studied for the case in which the distribution of unobserved shocks is known and the case in which it is unknown. In both instances equilibrium uniqueness is assumed to hold only in a neighborhood of the true parameter value and for a subset 2 of realizations of the signals. Multiple equilibria are allowed elsewhere in the parameter space and no equilibrium selection theory is involved. Extensions to games where beliefs are conditioned on unobservables as well as general games with many players and actions are also discussed. An empirical application of a simple capital investment game is included. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This study provides a real world example of transferring a cost effectiveness study of trastuzumab for the adjuvant treatment of HER2-positive early breast cancer from the United Kingdom to The Netherlands. Methods: Three successive steps were taken. Step I: Collect available information with regard to the original model, and assess transferability using existing checklists. Step 2: Adapt transferability-limiting factors. Step 3: Obtain a country-specific estimate of cost effectiveness. Results: The structure of the UK model was transferable, although some of the model inputs needed adaptation. From a health-care perspective, the Dutch estimate amounted to (sic)5828/quality-adjusted life-year gained. From a societal perspective, the incremental cost effectiveness ratio was dominant. Conclusion: Transferability of a model-based UK-study in three steps proved to be an efficient method to provide an early indication of the cost effectiveness of trastuzumab and has led to the provisional reimbursement of the treatment.","[Essers, Brigitte A.

Methods: A postal survey was conducted on 2900 adult panelists representative of the French population. The participants were asked to complete a questionnaire including the QoL-AGHDA and an evaluation of their overall health status (OHS). The QoL-AGHDA score ranges front 0 to 25, a lower score indicating better QoL. Psychometric properties of the QoL-AGHDA were assessed. The mean QoL-AGHDA scores were described by sex and age groups. Results: The return rate was 75%. The quality of completion and internal consistency reliability were good: 95% of the respondents completed all 25 QoL-AGHDA items and Cronbach's alpha was 0.86. The QoL-AGHDA score was able to discriminate between the respondents according to their OHS (front 1.5 for excellent to 12.3 for poor OHS, p < 0.001). The mean QoL-AGHDA score was 4.6 for the overall population, 5.1 for females and 4.2 for males, and ranged from 4.8 for the youngest to 6.1 for the oldest respondents. Conclusions: The QoL-AGHDA questionnaire showed good psychometric properties when administered in the French population. French reference values were collected, completing the QoL-AGHDA normative database already available in several European countries.","[Gilet, Helene; Viala-Danten, Muriel] Mapi Values, F-69003 Lyon, France; [Chachuat, Anne] Pfizer, Paris, France; [Auziere, Sebastien] TNS Healthcare, Montrouge, France; [Koltowska-Haggstrom, Maria] Pfizer Endocrine Care, KIMS Med Outcomes, Sollentuna, Sweden",Pfizer; Pfizer,"Gilet, H (通讯作者)，Mapi Values, 27 Rue Villette, F-69003 Lyon, France.",helene.gilet@mapivalues.com,,,Pfizer,Pfizer(Pfizer),"This work was funded by Pfizer.

Methods: We performed principal component analysis (PCA) based on 35 items, after optimal scaling via multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), and subsequently on eight scales, after standard summative scoring. Item-based summary measures were planned. Data from the European Community Respiratory Health Survey 11 follow-up of 8854 subjects from 25 centers were analyzed to cross-validate the original and the novel PCS and MCS. Results: Overall, the scale- and item-based comparison indicated that the SF-36 scales and summaries meet the supposed dimensionality. However, vitality, social functioning, and general health items did not fit data optimally. The novel measures, derived a posteriori by unit-rule from an oblique (correlated) MCA/PCA solution, are simple item sums or weighted scale sums where the weights are the raw scale ranges. These item-based scores yielded consistent scale-summary results for outliers profiles, with an expected known-group differences validity. Conclusions: We were able to confirm the hypothesized dimensionality of eight scales and two summaries of the SF-36. The alternative scoring reaches at least the same required standards of the original scoring. In addition, it can reduce the item-scale inconsistencies without loss of predictive validity.","[Grassi, Mario; Nucera, Andrea; European Community Resp Hlth Stud] Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Sci Sanit Applicate, Sez Stat Med & Epidemiol, I-27100 Pavia, Italy",University of Pavia,"Grassi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Sci Sanit Applicate, Sez Stat Med & Epidemiol, Via Bassi 21, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",mario.grassi@unipv.it,,"Grassi, Mario/0000-0001-6612-8566",MIUR-Italy,"MIUR-Italy(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","This study was partially supported by a grant from the MIUR-Italy.

Critics of the structural approach often assert that it produces results that rely on too many assumptions to be credible, and that the experimentalist approach provides an alternative that relies on fewer assumptions. Here, I argue that this is a false dichotomy. All econometric work relies heavily on a priori assumptions. The main difference between structural and experimental (or atheoretic) approaches is not in the number of assumptions but the extent to which they are made explicit. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Meltzer, DO; Jena, AB",,,,"Meltzer, David O.; Jena, Anupam B.",,,The economics of intense exercise,JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Exercise; Intensity; Economics; Health promotion,PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; ADHERENCE; HEALTH; IMPACT,"Despite the well-known benefits of exercise, the time required for exercise is widely understood as a major reason for low levels of exercise in the US. Intensity of exercise can change the time required for a given amount of total exercise but has never been studied from an economic perspective. We present a simple model of exercise behavior which suggests that the intensity of exercise should increase relative to time spent exercising as wages increase, holding other determinants of exercise constant. Our empirical results identify an association between income and exercise intensity that is consistent with the hypothesis that people respond to increased time costs of exercise by increasing intensity. More generally, our results suggest that time costs may be an important determinant of exercise patterns and that factors that can influence the time costs of exercise, such as intensity, may be important concerns in designing interventions to promote exercise.

Expressions for each spouse's allocation to the common good are obtained that are consistent with the pre-eminent role of mortality in the fertility decline. The other determinant of equilibrium is the husband-wife productivity ratio. Furthermore, in a context of demographic transition, the adjustment of allocations to their equilibrium values may be not instantaneous, and the transition resembles the pursuit of a moving target rather than a shift in equilibrium. One consequence is the lack of correlation between the fertility decline and economic variables. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Such data arise in preferential voting systems and market research surveys. Covariate data associated with the judges are also often recorded. Such covariate data should be used in conjunction with preference data when drawing inferences about judges. To cluster a population of judges, the population is modeled as a collection of homogeneous groups. The Plackett-Luce model for ranked data is employed to model a judge's ranked preferences within a group. A mixture of Plackett-Luce models is employed to model the population of judges, where each component in the mixture represents a group of judges. Mixture of experts models provide a framework in which covariates are included in mixture models. Covariates are included through the mixing proportions and the component density parameters. A mixture of experts model for ranked preference data is developed by combining a mixture of experts model and a mixture of Plackett-Luce models. Particular attention is given to the manner in which covariates enter the model. The mixing proportions and group specific parameters are potentially dependent on covariates. Model selection procedures are employed to choose optimal models. Model parameters are estimated via the 'EMM algorithm', a hybrid of the expectation-maximization and the minorization-maximization algorithms. Examples are provided through a menu survey and through Irish election data. Results indicate mixture modeling using covariates is insightful when examining a population of judges who express preferences.","[Gormley, Isobel Claire; Murphy, Thomas Brendan] Univ Coll Dublin, Stat, Dublin, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Gormley, IC (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Stat, Dublin, Ireland.",,"Murphy, Thomas Brendan/H-4366-2012; Gormley, Isobel Claire/F-7089-2016","Murphy, Thomas Brendan/0000-0002-5668-7046; Gormley, Isobel Claire/0000-0001-7713-681X",,,,,62,10,11,0,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84950-772-1,,,,2010,,,,,,,543,569,,,,,,27,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Psychology, Mathematical; Transportation",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Psychology; Transportation,BE0JU,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000366173200026,0

During the post-colonial period, the Government trained indigenous cultural heritage managers with the expectation that they would encourage Malawians to fully participate in cultural heritage conservation. However, the Government did not provide sufficient budgetary support for the managers to perform efficiently. Further, the civil service structure denied them of career advancement within the cultural heritage sector. That led them to change careers and abandon the sector. The result is that Malawians remain uninformed and uninvolved in cultural heritage conservation programs.

Methods: The International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) Task Force on Good Research Practices-Use of Drug Costs for Cost Effectiveness Analysis (DCTF) was appointed by the ISPOR Board of Directors. Members were experienced developers or users of CEA models. The DCTF met to develop core assumptions and an outline before preparing a draft report. They solicited comments on drafts from external reviewers and from the ISPOR membership at ISPOR meetings and via the ISPOR Web site. Results: The cost of a drug to an MCO equals the amount it pays to the dispenser for the drug's ingredient cost and dispensing fee minus the patient copay and any rebates paid by the drug's manufacturer. The amount that an MCO reimburses for each of these components can differ substantially across a number of factors that include type of drug (single vs. mulrisource), dispensing site (retail vs. mail order), and site of administration (self-administered vs. physician's office). Accurately estimating the value of cost components is difficult because they are determined by proprietary and confidential contracts. Conclusion: Estimates of drug cost from the MCO perspective should include amounts paid for medication ingredients and dispensing fees, and net out copays, rebates, and other drug price reductions. Because of the evolving nature of drug pricing, ISPOR should publish a Web site where current DCTF costing recommendations are updated as new information becomes available.","[Carroll, Norman V.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Sch Pharm, Richmond, VA 23298 USA; [Mansley, Edward C.] Merck & Co Inc, N Wales, PA USA; [Chen, Kristina S.] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA USA; [Shah, Nilay D.] Mayo Clin, Rochester, MN USA; [Piech, Catherine Tak] Centocor Ortho Biotech Serv LLC, Horsham, PA USA; [Hay, Joel W.] Univ So Calif, Dept Clin Pharm Pharmaceut Econ & Policy, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Smeeding, James] JestaRx Grp, Dallas, TX USA",Virginia Commonwealth University; Merck & Company; Analysis Group Inc.; Mayo Clinic; Johnson & Johnson; Johnson & Johnson USA; University of Southern California; JeSTARx Group,"Carroll, NV (通讯作者)，Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Sch Pharm, 410 N 12th St,Box 980533, Richmond, VA 23298 USA.",nvcarroll@vcu.edu,,,,,,,17,18,20,1,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2010,13.0,1,,,,,14,17,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00661.x,0.0,,,4,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,541PI,19883404.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273429000005,0

We provide a theoretical framework which reproduces incentives for selective reporting and yields three key implications concerning regulation. First, a compulsory clinical trial registry complemented through a voluntary clinical trial results database can implement full transparency (the existence of all trials as well as their results is known). Second, full transparency comes at a price. It has a deterrence effect on the incentives to conduct clinical trials, as it reduces the firms' gains from trials. Third, in principle, a voluntary clinical trial results database without a compulsory registry is a superior regulatory tool; but we Provide some qualified Support for additional Compulsory registries when medical decision-makers cannot anticipate Correctly the drug companies' decisions whether to conduct trials.

We focus on job loss induced by plant Closure, thereby addressing the reverse Causality problem as job displacements due to plant closure are unlikely caused by workers' health Status, but potentially have important effects on individual workers' health and associated public health costs. Our empirical analysis is based on a rich data set from Austria providing comprehensive information on various types of health care costs and day-by-day work history at the individual level. Our central findings are (i) overall expenditures on medical treatments are not strongly affected by job displacement; (ii) job loss significantly increases expenditures for antidepressants and related drugs, as well as for hospitalizations due to mental health problems for men (but not for women) although the effects are economically rather small; and (iii) sickness benefits strongly increase due to job loss.

We address a general framework leading to applications to games with communication graphs, where the feasible coalitions form a poset whose all maximal chains have the same length. Considering a new way to define the symmetry among players, we propose an axiomatization of the Shapley value of these games. Borrowing ideas from electric networks theory, we show that our symmetry axiom and the efficiency axiom correspond to the two Kirchhoff's laws in the circuit associated to the Hasse diagram of feasible coalitions.

The SIMS was developed to assess the extent to which patients feel they have received enough information about their medicines. Methods: Three hundred seventy chronically ill patients were included in the study. The SIMS was translated to SIMS-D (German version) and evaluated in terms of acceptability, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, discriminant, and criterion-related validity. Results: The SIMS-D showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.92) and adequate test-retest reliability (Pearson's r > 0.7). Relationships to external criteria regarding medication management were acceptable (Spearman's rho > 0.4). The SIMS-D was reasonably well accepted (return rate of 71%); however, older people produced more missing values when filling in the questionnaire.

Methods: The study population comprised surviving children born at 20 through 25 completed weeks of gestation in all 276 maternity units in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland from March through December 1995 and a control group of classmates born at full term, matched for age, sex, and ethnic group. Estimates of utilization of health, social, and education services were combined with unit costs derived from primary and secondary sources. Generalized liner regression was used to estimate the impact of extremely preterm birth on public sector costs during the 11th year of life. Suboptimal levels of function for each of the eight attributes of the Health Utilities Index Mark III (cognition, vision, hearing, speech, ambulation, dexterity, emotion, and pain) and multiplicative multi-attribute utility scores were compared between the extremely preterm children and their classmates. Tobit regressions were performed to explore the effects of gestational age at birth on the Health Utilities Index Mark III multiattribute utility score. Results: Mean (standard deviation [SD]) public sector costs over the 12-month period were 6484 pound (5548) pound for the combined extremely preterm group and 4007 pound (2537) pound for their classmates, generating a mean cost difference of 2477 pound (bootstrap 95% confidence interval [CI] 1605 pound, 3360) pound that was statistically significant (P < 0.001). The generalized linear models revealed that compared to birth at term, birth at < 23 completed weeks, 24+0-24+6 weeks and 25+0-25+6 weeks gestation increased public sector costs by an average of 2417 pound (95% CI 60 pound, 4774; pound P = 0.044), 1528 pound (95% CI 129 pound, 2927; pound P = 0.032) and 1501 pound (95% CI 428 pound, 2574; pound P = 0.006), respectively. In all eight attributes of the Health Utilities Index Mark III, there were significantly higher proportions of suboptimal levels of function among the extremely preterm children (P < 0.05). The mean (SD) multiattribute utility score for the extremely preterm children as a cohort was 0.789 (0.264), compared to 0.956 (0.102) for the classmates born at term, a mean difference in utility score of 0.167 (95% CI 0.124, 0.209) that was statistically significant (P < 0.001). The Tobit regressions revealed that, compared to birth at term, birth at < 23 completed weeks, 24+0-24+6 weeks and 25+0-25+6 weeks gestation reduced the Health Utilities Index Mark III multi-attribute utility score by an average of 0.312 (95% CI 0.169, 0.455; P < 0.001), 0.337 (95% CI 0.235, 0.439; P < 0.001) and 0.243 (95% CI 0.159, 0.327; P < 0.001), respectively. Conclusions: The results of this study should be used to inform the development of future economic evaluations of interventions aimed at preventing extremely preterm birth or alleviating its effects.","[Petrou, Stavros] Univ Oxford, Natl Perinatal Epidemiol Unit, Oxford OX3 7LF, England; [Petrou, Stavros; Abangma, Giselle] Univ Oxford, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Oxford OX3 7LF, England; [Johnson, Samantha] Univ Nottingham, Acad Div Child Hlth, Queens Med Ctr, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Wolke, Dieter] Univ Warwick, Dept Psychol, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Wolke, Dieter] Univ Warwick, Hlth Sci Res Inst, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Marlow, Neil] UCL, Inst Womens Hlth, London, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Nottingham; University of Warwick; University of Warwick; University of London; University College London,"Petrou, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Natl Perinatal Epidemiol Unit, Old Rd Campus,Old Rd, Oxford OX3 7LF, England.",stavros.petrou@npeu.ox.ac.uk,"Johnson, Samantha/S-6876-2019; Petrou, Stavros/ABD-8323-2021; Marlow, Neil/D-2918-2009; Johnson, Samantha/G-2260-2018; Wolke, Dieter/C-5372-2008","Petrou, Stavros/0000-0003-3121-6050; Marlow, Neil/0000-0001-5890-2953; Johnson, Samantha/0000-0001-8963-7881; Wolke, Dieter/0000-0003-0304-268X","UK Medical Research Council; James Tudor Foundation; Department of Health in England; National Co-ordinating Centre for Research Capacity Development in England; Medical Research Council [G0401525, G0501681] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [G0401525, G0501681] Funding Source: UKRI",UK Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); James Tudor Foundation; Department of Health in England(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Co-ordinating Centre for Research Capacity Development in England; Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"The 11-year EPICure follow-up study was supported by the UK Medical Research Council.

The model allows for interdependent values, multidiminensional types and any attitude towards risk.

There is little empirical evidence and ambiguous theoretical guidance on which effects to expect. This paper evaluates the impact of the incentive program on quality of care in diabetes, as measured by the probability of ordering an HbA1c test. The empirical analysis is conducted with a unique data set and a bivariate probit model to control For the self-selection process of practices into the program. The study finds that the incentive program increased the probability of an HbA1c test being ordered by 20 percentage points and that participation in the program is facilitated by the Support of Divisions of General Practice.

We examine the optimal allocation of a fixed Supply of a given treatment between different groups of patients. Even in the absence of any distributional aims, welfare is increased by third degree waiting time discrimination: setting different waiting times for different groups waiting for the same treatment. Because waiting time imposes dead weight losses on patients, lower waiting times should be offered to groups with higher marginal waiting time costs and with less elastic demand for the treatment.

Most of the existing evaluations are cohort-based Markov models missing comprehensive memory management and versatility. In this article, we describe and validate an original Markov microsimulation model to accurately assess the cost-effectiveness of prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Methods: We developed a Markov microsimulation model with a lifetime horizon and a direct health-care cost perspective. The patient history was recorded and was used in calculations of transition probabilities, utilities, and costs. To test the internal consistency of the model, we carried out an example calculation for alendronate therapy. Then, external consistency was investigated by comparing absolute lifetime risk of fracture estimates with epidemiologic data. Results: For women at age 70 years, with a twofold increase in the fracture risk of the average population, the costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained for alendronate therapy versus no treatment were estimated at 9105 and 15,325, respectively, under full and realistic adherence assumptions. All the sensitivity analyses in terms of model parameters and modeling assumptions were coherent with expected conclusions and absolute lifetime risk of fracture estimates were within the range of previous estimates, which confirmed both internal and external consistency of the model. Conclusion: Microsimulation models present some major advantages over cohort-based models, increasing the reliability of the results and being largely compatible with the existing state of the art, evidence-based literature. The developed model appears to be a valid model for use in economic evaluations in osteoporosis.","[Hiligsmann, Mickael; Ethgen, Olivier; Bruyere, Olivier; Richy, Florent; Reginster, Jean-Yves] Univ Liege, Dept Publ Hlth Epidemiol & Hlth Econ, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Hiligsmann, Mickael; Gathon, Henry-Jean] Univ Liege, Dept Econ, B-4000 Liege, Belgium",University of Liege; University of Liege,"Hiligsmann, M (通讯作者)，Univ Liege, Dept Publ Hlth Epidemiol & Hlth Econ, Ave Hop 3,Bat B23, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.",m.hiligsmann@ulg.ac.be,"Reginster, Jean-Yves/AGC-6097-2022; Bruyere, Olivier/H-8302-2019","Bruyere, Olivier/0000-0003-4269-9393",ESCEO-Amgen Fellowship,ESCEO-Amgen Fellowship(Amgen),Source of financial support: This study was supported by an ESCEO-Amgen Fellowship grant received at the 6th European Congress on Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis ( Vienna 2006).,,81,62,71,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2009,12.0,5,,,,,687,696,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00497.x,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,459SR,19508659.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267130200009,0

We focused on daily per capita inpatient health-care expenditures, and examined the impact of inpatient characteristics such as sex, age, survived or deceased, length of stay, adult disease, and type of medical care received during the duration of each stay. We analyzed data from the Survey of Medical-Care Activities in Public Health Insurance by multinomial logistic regression analyses. Age of patient had little impact on per capita inpatient health-care expenditures per day. As regards length of stay, inpatient stays of 8-14 days had a little impact on health-care expenditures. This study suggested that these results might be due to the kind of medical care received. More research is needed to determine the appropriate medical services to reduce long-term hospitalization. In the last month of care for patients who died, medical examinations had a great influence on health-care expenditures. This study showed that increasing medical examinations in the end-of-life care needs further investigation.

To that end, we use Theil's second measure of inequality for decomposing cross-country disparities in per capita health-care expenditure into the contributions of various factors: health-care expenditure expressed as a share of GDP, labour productivity, employment rate, activity rate and the ratio of working-age population to total population. Our results show that cross-country differences in the share of GDP devoted to health-care expenditure and labour productivity are the main determinants of the level of dispersion in per capita health-care expenditure. On the contrary, existing disparities in the remaining explanatory factors considered play a less relevant role in this context. In any event, the analysis performed reveals that the overall inequality in per capita health-care expenditure decreased throughout the Study period. This was due to the process of international convergence observed in most of the factors used to break down the level of per capita health-care expenditure.

To understand why the drift parameters are more difficult to estimate than the diffusion parameter, as observed in previous studies, we first develop expansions for the bias and variance of parameter estimators for two of the most employed interest rate processes, Vasicek and CIR processes. Then, we study the first order approximate maximum likelihood estimator for linear drift processes. A parametric bootstrap procedure is proposed to correct bias for general diffusion processes with a theoretical justification. Simulation studies confirm the theoretical findings and show that the bootstrap proposal can effectively reduce both the bias and the mean square error of parameter estimates, for both univariate and multivariate processes. The advantages of using more accurate parameter estimators when calculating various option prices in finance are demonstrated by an empirical study. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Elective surgical options for AAA include open repair (OR) and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). EVAR is less invasive than OR, and therefore may have less surgical risk than OR. However, the graft used for EVAR is much more expensive then the graft used for OR. A decision model with a 10-year time horizon was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of EVAR versus OR. The primary outcome measure was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The model incorporated the costs and benefits of both perioperative outcomes and postoperative outcomes. A systematic review was conducted to derive clinical outcome rates. Cost and utility model variables were based on various literature sources and data from a recent Canadian observational study. Parameter uncertainty was assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. In the base-case model, the incremental cost per QALY of EVAR was estimated to be $268,337, whereas the incremental cost per life-year was found to be $444,129. The incremental cost per QALY of EVAR remained above $295,715 under different assumptions of cohort age and model time horizon. Based on commonly quoted willingness-to-pay thresholds, EVAR was not found to be cost-effective compared to OR.","[Blackhouse, Gord; Hopkins, Robert; Bowen, James M.; Tarride, Jean-Eric; O'Reilly, Daria; Xie, Feng; Goeree, Ron] PATH Res Inst, Hamilton, ON L8P 1H1, Canada; [Blackhouse, Gord; Hopkins, Robert; Bowen, James M.; Tarride, Jean-Eric; O'Reilly, Daria; Xie, Feng; Goeree, Ron] McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [De Rose, Guy; Novick, Teresa] LHSC, London, ON, Canada; [De Rose, Guy] Univ Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada",McMaster University; London Health Sciences Centre; Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Blackhouse, G (通讯作者)，PATH Res Inst, 25 Main St W 2000, Hamilton, ON L8P 1H1, Canada.",blackhou@mcmaster.ca,"Greiver, Michelle/N-8764-2015; Bowen, James/L-3077-2019","Bowen, James/0000-0002-6457-2337",,,,,29,31,31,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2009,12.0,2,,,,,245,252,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00446.x,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,408WY,18783394.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000263467500009,0

The model shows that investors' perceptions of the fund market play the key role in the fund's fee-setting mechanism. The managers' true ability to deliver performance is not relevant. Along with a simple relation between fees and funds' performance, empirical evidence suggests that most Romanian domestic equity mutual funds have added high markups in recent years. We show that, for these fees to be justified, investors would have expected the fund managers to be able to deliver an overall annual excess-return of 3% over the S&P 500, net of fees, irrespective of the investment style and of the risk level of the funds. Therefore, we interpret these high markups as resulting from the investors' optimism bias whose root can be found in their lack of financial literacy as well as in funds' marketing report.","[Bondrea, Aurelian A.] Spiru Haret Univ, Bucharest, Romania",Spiru Haret University,,aurelianbondrea@yahoo.com; brindusa.covaci@yahoo.com,"Covaci (Sterpu), Brindusa/B-6931-2009","Covaci (Sterpu), Brindusa/0000-0002-0713-1068",,,,,19,0,0,1,1,WORLD SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING ACAD AND SOC,ATHENS,"AG LOANNOU THEOLOGOU 17-23, 15773 ZOGRAPHOU, ATHENS, GREECE",,,978-960-474-073-4,MA COMPUT SCI ENG,,,2009,,,,,,,188,193,,,,,,6,"Business; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Mathematics,BJK18,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000266630000030,0

Seedlings were planted in Land reclamation department experimental fields at the Lithuanian University of Agriculture. Seedlings were grown under standard nursery cultural practices until being transplanted into new fields in mid of April 2002 and 2004. In 2002 the mean temperature during the vegetation period was 2.2 degrees C above the long-term average (+15 degrees C). In the same period of 2003 mean daily temperature during the vegetation period was 0.7 degrees C above the long tem average, 2004-0.6 degrees C les than average, at 2005-0.3 degrees C above the long tern average. The precipitation at 2002 was 233 mm (average-337 mm) and at the same period at 2003-301 mm, 2004-312 mm, 2005-378 mm. Having analyzed the total evapotranspiration of individual months it was determined that first year seedlings growing under natural conditions have evaporated approx 10-30 mm.decade(-1) during May-June months, whereas during July and August months -10-30 mm.decade(-1), in September the evaporation varied (during the decade) within the limits of 7-14 mm.decade(-1). After compare values of biological coefficients at different seedlings grooving year it was determinate that biological coefficients for first year seedlings at the average of 23% smaller than coefficients of second growing year seedlings. Such bigger differences good seemed at May, and then differences reach from 56% of 1 decade, till 30% - third. At the next months differences reach about 15%, but it wasn't defining difference smaller than 10%.

Heat conductivity of dried unburnt clay samples with 2% to 4% sapropel additives does not change. When absolute humidity of samples increases during the measurements of heat conductivity, it becomes obviously dependable on the amount of sapropel. The amount of sapropel is more significant to heat conductivity (Beta = -0,723) than absolute humidity (Beta = 0,672).

Naturally occurring forces such as axial force from helical gears and centrifugal force from rotating mass are effectively and efficiently utilized in obtaining automatic transmission. The basic design consists of a planetary gear train, multiplate clutch pack and eight masses over the circumference of clutch pack. This design is meant for two speeds and complete assembly is considered as one module. The operation of gear shift is very simple. The input drive is always an annulus gear and the output drive is from the carrier in the planetary gear train. At lower speeds, the required reduction is obtained by the planetary gear train. At this position, the multiplate clutch pack between ring gear and planet carrier is in the disengaged position and sun gear is held. As the speed increases, the centrifugal force due to rotating mass engages the clutch and drive becomes direct. At this point the sun gear is freed to rotate.","[Iyer, Vijayan Gurumurthy] Dr MGR Univ, Madras 92, Tamil Nadu, India; [Mastorakis, Nikos E.] WSEAS European Off, Athens 15773, Greece",,,vijayaniyergurumurthy@rediffmail.com; mastor@wseas.org,"Iyer, Gurumurthy/E-7261-2010; Dr., Vijayan Gurumurthy Iyer/F-7375-2018","Dr., Vijayan Gurumurthy Iyer/0000-0003-2443-6573",,,,,6,0,0,3,4,WORLD SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING ACAD AND SOC,ATHENS,"AG LOANNOU THEOLOGOU 17-23, 15773 ZOGRAPHOU, ATHENS, GREECE",1792-4308,,978-960-474-073-4,MATH COMPUT SCI ENG,,,2009,,,,,,,62,+,,,,,,2,"Business; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Mathematics,BJK18,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000266630000008,0

Their preservation is one of the main technological stages for cultivation, harvesting and preparation for consumption of medicinal plants. It is most difficult to avoid loss of essential oils that are known as volatile substances. The amount and quality of essential oils of the medicinal plant is strongly influenced by the selected drying technologies and modes. A qualitative and quantitative analysis of essential oils accumulated in the medicinal raw material of Hyssopus officinalis L., dried by active ventilation, was performed. The beta-phellandrene, beta-pinene, germacrene-D, isopinocamphone, gamma-elemene, beta-mircene, pinocamphone, a-pinene, and alpha-caryophyllene were identified as dominating components of essential oils in Hyssopi herba in 2007-2008. The research helped find out the impact of ventilation intensity and temperature of drying agent on the loss and quality of essential oils. Although smaller amount of essential oils was identified in Hyssopi herba ventilated using heated ambient air than in the herbs dried by unheated ambient air, larger amount of components dominating in medicinal raw material were preserved, namely beta-phellandrene, beta-pinene, izopinocamphone, beta-mircene.

In order to clarify the optimal size of the plot single combined soil sample was taken from 2, 4 and 8 ha plots. Similar values of soil pH were achieved in a weakly rolling relief in context of distribution of soil acidity classes using different methods of soil sampling, except taking the samples for 2 ha plots on a regular grid, which outputs the shares of medium acid soils (pH 4.6-5.0) twice less than the other two methods. If 4 ha plots were used, the regular grid sampling resulted in a three times less share of relatively acid soils (pH <= 5.5) than mapped using other two methods. Characteristics of experimental variograms and Moran's I statistic were used to test the spatial continuity of soil pH. The main findings was that weak or moderate spatial dependence between the pH values was observed only for sampling schemes based on 2 ha plot size.","[Sumskis, Donatas; Staugaitis, Gediminas; Mazvila, Jonas] Lithuanian Inst Agr, Agrochem Res Ctr, Agrochem Res, Savanoriu PR 287, LT-50127 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Mozgeris, Gintautas] Lithuanian Univ Agr, Inst Environm, GIS Educ & Res Ctr, LT-53362 Akademija, Kaunas R, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Sumskis, D (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Inst Agr, Agrochem Res Ctr, Agrochem Res, Savanoriu PR 287, LT-50127 Kaunas, Lithuania.",sumskis@agrolab.lt; staugaitis@agrolab.lt; mazvila@agrolab.lt; gintas@hydrogis.lt,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,LITHUANIAN UNIV AGRICULTURE,KAUNO RAJ,"STUDENTU 11, AKADEMIJA, KAUNO RAJ, LT-53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2009,,,,,,,247,251,,,,,,5,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Engineering, Environmental; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Engineering; Public Administration,BNL17,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274845700044,0

Method: In 2005, from a stratified cluster sample of 3101 rural households, we identified 375 households that might be at risk of catastrophic payments by searching through NCMS claims and interviewing key informants. We interviewed these 375 households and confirmed that 231 had had catastrophic payments (>= 40% of file households' capacity to pay; CTP) during 2004. A validity test of our screening method found another eight cases among immediate neighbours of these 375 households; by extrapolation, we obtained an adjusted total of 289 catastrophic households in the sample of 3101. We measured the impact of the NCMS on hardship alleviation by counterfactual analysis, comparing catastrophic payments before and after NCMS reimbursements. Result: The effect was twofold. Before NCMS intervention 8.98% of Linyi population had had catastrophic out-of-pocket payments compared with 8.25% after reimbursements. Catastrophic severity for households remaining in catastrophe after reimbursement dropped by 18.7% to an average of 6.34 times the household's CTP. Conclusion: Out-of-pocket medical payments remain a burden for rural households. Financial protection from the NCMS, with ail average reimbursement of 17.8%, was modest and should be restructured to provide better benefits that are targeted to those in most need.

The regression analysis indicates that both the impact of FDI on economic growth and the enhancement of economic growth to FDI are remarkable. The difference of lag length leads to different Granger causality between FDI and GDP (Gross Domestic Product). Therefore we can not simply say that it is FDI that promotes the economic development and we can not always rely on the government's preferential policies to attract FDI.

Methods: A hypothetical cohort of 3,194,038 children born in Brazil in 2006 was followed for 10 years. A decision tree model was developed using the TreeAge Pro 2007 software program to compare universal infant vaccination with the current program. Epidemiological and cost estimates were based on data retrieved from National Health Information Systems and the literature. The analysis was conducted from the public health care system and societal perspectives. Costs are expressed in 2006 Brazilian reals (R$). Results: At 94% coverage, the program would avoid 1,218 cases, 210 deaths, and 14,473 life-years lost, a reduction of, respectively, 45%, 44%, and 44%, for the 10-year period. Vaccination costs of R$320.9 million would not be offset by R$ 4 to R$7.9 million decreases in disease treatment costs. A national vaccination program would cost R$ 21,620 per life-year saved from the perspective of the health-care system and R$ 21,896 per life-year saved from society's perspective. Results were most sensitive to case fatality rate, disease incidence, and vaccine cost. Conclusions: A universal childhood vaccination program against meningococcal C proved to be a cost-effective strategy, supporting the recent decision of the Brazilian government. These results could contribute to defining the most favorable price of the vaccine and to monitoring its impact on the population.","[de Soarez, Patricia Coelho; Itria, Alexander; Dutilh Novaes, Hillegonda Maria] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Med, Dept Med Prevent, BR-01246903 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Sartori, Ana Marli C.] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Med, Clin Molestias Infecciosas & Parasitarias, Hosp Clin, BR-01246903 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Lagoa Nobrega, Laura de Andrade] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Med, Programa Posgrad Doencas Infecciosas & Parasitari, BR-01246903 Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"de Soarez, PC (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Med, Dept Med Prevent, Av Dr Arnaldo,455-2 Andar Cerqueira Cesar, BR-01246903 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",pcsoarez@uol.com.br,"SOAREZ, PATRICIA/D-9710-2012; Iats, Inct/K-2300-2013; Sartori, Ana Marli Christovam/I-6663-2012; Novaes, Hillegonda/F-7060-2011","SOAREZ, PATRICIA/0000-0001-8383-0728; Sartori, Ana Marli Christovam/0000-0003-3777-0757; Novaes, Hillegonda/0000-0001-9849-0324",Ministry of Health of Brazil; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq),Ministry of Health of Brazil; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"Source of financial support: This study is part of a project to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of introducing new vaccines into the Brazilian National Immunization Program, supported by the Ministry of Health of Brazil and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq).

Methods: We modeled costs and outcomes of seasonal influenza with UMV and TVP, taking a societal perspective. The US population was stratified to model age-specific (<5, 5-17, 18-49, 50-64, and 65 + years) vaccine coverage and efficacy. Probability of influenza-related illness (ILI) and complications, health-care utilization, costs, and survival were estimated. For a season's intervention, ILI cases in that year, lifetime costs (2008 US$), and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost (both discounted at 3% per annum) were calculated for each policy and used to derive incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. A range of sensitivity and alternative-scenario analyses were conducted. Results: In base-case analyses, TVP resulted in 63 million ILI cases, 859,000 QALYs lost, and $114.5 billion in direct and indirect costs; corresponding estimates for UMV were 61 million cases, 825,000 QALYs lost, and $111.4 billion. UMV was therefore estimated to dominate TVP, saving $3.1 billion and 34,000 QALYs. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, UMV was dominant in 82% and dominated in 0% of iterations. In alternative-scenario analyses, UMV dominated TVP when lower estimates of vaccine coverage were used. Lower estimates of ILI risk among unvaccinated, vaccine effectiveness, and risk of complications resulted in ICERs of $2800, $8100, and $15,900 per QALY gained, respectively, for UMV compared with TVP. Conclusions: UMV against seasonal influenza is cost saving in the United States under reasonable assumptions for coverage, cost, and efficacy.","[Clements, Karen M.; DeLong, Kelly; Thompson, David] OptumInsight, Medford, MA USA; [Chancellor, Jeremy] Chancellor Hlth Econ Ltd, Beaconsfield, Bucks, England; [Nichol, Kristin] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Nichol, Kristin] VA Med Ctr, Minneapolis, MN USA",Optum; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Minneapolis VA Health Care System,"Clements, KM (通讯作者)，I3 Innovus, 10 Cabot Rd,Suite 304, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",karen.clements@i3innovus.com,"Thompson, David/C-3520-2008; Thompson, David/E-2431-2018","Thompson, David/0000-0001-8518-6307; Chancellor, Jeremy/0000-0003-1415-7554","GlaxoSmithKline, Philadelphia PA","GlaxoSmithKline, Philadelphia PA(GlaxoSmithKline)","GlaxoSmithKline, Philadelphia PA.",,42,22,26,0,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2011,14.0,6,,,,,800,811,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.03.005,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BJ,21914499.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299081600002,0

Methods: A stylised model of screening for a hypothetical cancer. The model was used to test different possible ages for 'once in a lifetime' screening under a variety of assumptions about model parameter uncertainty. Initial model runs only considered screening at ages which are multiples of 16 years, then multiples of 8 years were allowed, then 4 years, etc. Results: Effects of more refined choice sets on the cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier (CEAF) and EVPI are shown. The CEAF collapses to zero for threshold incremental cost-effectiveness ratios at which screening at some age is preferred to no screening, while the EVPI stabilises at a non-zero figure. Conclusions: The CEAF is likely to be highly dependent on the choice of options when these are a selection from a very large set of possible options. In contrast, the EVPI can be reasonably approximated by a model with a slightly limited choice set.

Since many performed services merely differ by intensity, physicians have an incentive to upcode services to increase profitability of a visit. Using nationally representative data from the 2001 to 2003 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, this paper explores the effect of Medicare Part B fee differentials on the upcoding of general office visits (i.e. for established patient visits with CPT codes of 99212-99215). It finds strong evidence that these fee differentials influence physician's coding choice for billing purposes across a variety of specialties. For general office visits, Medicare outlays attributable to upcoding may sum to as much as 15% of total expenditures for such visits. Medicare has much to gain financially by clarifying its classification rules. Until the distinctions between types of Medicare visits are redefined in a way that eliminates ambiguity, upcoding under Medicare Part B is likely to continue.

It is assumed that each unit or variable in the IVAR is related to a small number of neighbors and a large number of non-neighbors. The neighborhood effects are fixed and do not change with the number of units (N), but the coefficients of non-neighboring units are restricted to vanish in the limit as N tends to infinity. Problems of estimation and inference in a stationary IVAR model with an unknown number of unobserved common factors are investigated. A cross-section augmented least-squares (CALS) estimator is proposed and its asymptotic distribution is derived. Satisfactory small-sample properties are documented by Monte Carlo experiments. An empirical illustration shows the statistical significance of dynamic spillover effects in modeling of US real house prices across the neighboring states. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A secondary aim was to compare groups based on known COPD risk factors, such as smoking status and gender. Methods: Using an online panel survey organization, participants were randomized to internet or paper-and-pencil assessment where they completed the COPD-PS and other study forms. A subset of respondents also completed a test-retest reliability assessment. Finally, several thousand additional online respondents completed the COPD-PS for risk factor analyses. Results: A total of 1006 adults completed the randomized study (N = 504 online, N = 502 by mail). There were no differences between the arms in mean COPD-PS scores (mean difference: 0.12; 95% confidence interval: -0.14-+0.37; P = 0.365). In the web arm, 106/504 (21.0%) exceeded the screening cut-off compared to 101/502 (20.1%) in the paper-administration arm (difference in proportions: 0.9%; 95% confidence interval: -4.1%-+5.9%; P = 0.720). Subgroup analyses on a separate cohort of 3001 adults demonstrated hypothesized differences between groups defined by smoking status, presence of COPD, and shortness of breath. Conclusion: The methods of administration that were evaluated in this study (internet vs. paper and pencil) resulted in no significant differences in COPD-PS mean scores. Furthermore, the predictive utility of the COPD-PS was not different between methods of administration, even after accounting for age and smoking status.","[Beaumont, Jennifer L.; Victorson, David; Wortman, Katy; Cella, David] Northwestern Univ, Dept Med Social Sci, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Su, Jun; Shah, Hemal] Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceut Inc, Ridgefield, CT 06877 USA; [Baker, Christine L.] Pfizer Inc, New York, NY USA",Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine; Boehringer Ingelheim; Pfizer,"Beaumont, JL (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Med Social Sci, Feinberg Sch Med, 710 N Lake Shore Dr,7th Floor, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",j-beaumont@northwestern.edu,"Bedjeti, Katy/GZM-2902-2022; Beaumont, Jennifer/AAA-2825-2020","Beaumont, Jennifer/0000-0002-1484-260X","Boehringer-Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Pfizer, Inc.","Boehringer-Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.(Boehringer Ingelheim); Pfizer, Inc.(Pfizer)","This study was supported by Boehringer-Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Pfizer, Inc.

Since these securities generate no pecuniary externalities, this result implies that every stage of such sequential financial innovations is Pareto-improving.

Utilizing the empirical distribution functions of F and G, a statistical test is presented to test the null hypothesis of indifference between X and Y given k (.|theta) against the hypothesis that X dominates Y with respect to k (.|theta). This is a large sample testing application of stochastic dominance with respect to a function. The asymptotic distribution of the test statistic associated with the null hypothesis given a sub-set of the utility function parameter space is developed. Based on large sample rejection regions, the hypothesis of preference of one alternative over another is demonstrated with an empirical example.

We apply the expected utility model to analyze farmers' behavior under risk and assess how farmers' production decisions change in the presence of government programs. Specifically, we empirically evaluate the relative price and the risk-related effects of farm policy changes at the intensive margin of production, as well as the extra value that these policies add to farmers' certainty equivalent. We use farm-level data collected in Kansas to estimate the model. We find evidence that decoupled government programs have only negligible impacts on production decisions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A share equilibrium specifies one share index for each individual. These indices determine each individual's cost shares in any jurisdiction that he might join. We demonstrate that the same axioms as those that characterize the Lindahl equilibrium, as discussed in Lindahl's 1919 paper, also characterize the share equilibrium. Share equilibrium extends the notions of ratio equilibrium and cost share equilibrium (due to Kaneko, 1977; Mas-Colell and Silvestre, 1989) to economies with a local public good and possibly multiple jurisdictions.

The search for new institutional arrangements is natural. The use of the so-called risk-sharing agreements is one example. Recent discussions have somewhat neglected the economic fundamentals underlying risk-sharing agreements. We argue here that risk-sharing agreements, although attractive due to the principle of paying by results, also entail risks. Too many patients may be put under treatment. Prices are likely to be adjusted upward, in anticipation of future risk-sharing agreements between the pharmaceutical company and the third-party payer. An available instrument is a verification cost per patient treated, which allows obtaining the first-best allocation of patients to the new treatment, under the agreement. Overall, the welfare effects of risk-sharing agreements are ambiguous, and caution is urged regarding their use.

Methods: This retrospective cohort study identified adults aged 25 years and older with a diagnosis of breast, colorectal, or nonsmall cell lung cancer between 2002 and 2005 from the Western Washington Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Puget Sound registry. We linked these records to health insurance claims from four payers representing 75% of those insured in the state. Claims records were used to determine chemotherapy regimen type, CSF use, febrile neutropenia occurrences, and supportive care. Chemotherapy regimens were categorized as conferring high, intermediate, or low risk of myelosuppression according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. CSF use was described as primary prophylaxis, other, or none. Antibiotics and antifungal and antiviral agents per National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for supportive care for cancer infection were categorized using Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System and National Drug Code assignments. Results: Use of CSF as primary prophylaxis is not significantly associated with a reduction in antibiotic use or inpatient or outpatient visits. Primary prophylactic CSF use was associated with less use of antiviral drugs. Conclusions: CSF use is not associated with a reduction in health care use, with the exception of antiviral drug use. Given the expense associated with CSF use, pragmatic trials and additional research are needed to further assess the affects of CSF on health care use.

The average GP had an annual net income of 97 pound 500 and worked 43 h per week. The mean wage was 51 pound per h. Net income and wages depended on gender, experience, list size, partnership size, whether or not the GP worked in a dispensing practice, whether they were salaried of self-employed, whether they worked in a practice with a nationally or locally negotiated contract, and the characteristics of the local population (proportion from ethnic minorities, rurality, and income deprivation). The findings have implications for pay discrimination by GP gender and ethnicity, GP preferences for partnership size, incentives for competition for patients, and compensating differentials for local population characteristics. They also shed light on the attractiveness to GPs in England of locally negotiated (personal medical services) versus nationally negotiated (general medical services) contracts.

We find that, for realistic sample sizes encountered in practice, the asymptotic results derived for the proposed estimators may provide unsatisfactory representations of their finite sample properties. In addition, the existing asymptotic results might not offer sufficient guidance for practical implementations. We show how to optimize the finite sample properties of kernel-based integrated variance estimators. Empirically, we find that their suboptimal implementation can, in some cases, lead to little or no finite sample gains when compared to the classical realized variance estimator. Significant statistical and economic gains can, however, be recovered by using our proposed finite sample methods.

The observation was conducted at Napajedla stud farm in 2011 and a total of 15 foals (descendants of 9 stallions) have been examined; five of them colts and ten fillies. The observation was performed on foals at the age 2, 14 and 30 of every foal and an ethological frame has been created for every individual. We were focusing mainly on suction, racy feed consumption, fodder consumption and coprophagy. For all of the above mentioned events their frequency and duration were watched. It has been found out that as the age of the foal rises, the suction frequency decreases. The average duration time of suction was growing in foals up to 14 days of age, but it was decreasing in older foals (up to 30 days of age). The data were further statistically processed using Pearson correlation and with this approach it was confirmed foals, which suck milk for a short time, suck it more frequently than the ones that suck for longer time. The interest of foals in racy feed consumption was particularly watched at the age of 14 days of each individual. The foals were often reproducing the behavior pattern of their mothers. At the age of 30 days an independent racy feed and fodder consumption could already be notified in the foals, as they were sometimes interested in consumption regardless of what the adult mare was doing. Coprophagy was detected both in 14 and days old foals; it was, however a rare event with a relatively short duration period.","[Cernohorska, H.; Jiskrova, I] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Breeding, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Cernohorská, H (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Breeding, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xcernoh1@mendelu.cz,"Jiskrová, Iva/L-2939-2018",,,,,,13,0,0,0,5,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-563-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,214,219,,,,,,6,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2HX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341783400022,0

Methods: Data were derived from the Adalimumab Trial evaluating Long-term efficacy and safety for Ankylosing Spondylitis (ATLAS). The study team specified 90 a priori hypotheses regarding the direction and magnitude of the expected associations between the overall and single-attribute scores of the HUI-3 and other health status and quality-of-life measures: Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36), Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality-of-Life Questionnaire, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index, and Patient's and Physician's Global Assessments of Disease Activity. With baseline data, correlation coefficients were calculated and interpreted according to the guidelines suggested by Guyatt for negligible (0-0.19), weak (0.20-0.34), moderate (0.35-0.50), and strong (>0.5) associations. The a priori hypotheses were tested using Pearson's correlation coefficients. Results: A total of 315 patients with active AS were randomized and enrolled in ATLAS. The correlation coefficients between the HUI-3 scores and other health-related quality-of-life instruments confirmed 61.1% of the a priori hypotheses, with an additional 35.5% being under-or overestimated by one correlation category. Conclusion: These results provide evidence of the cross-sectional, convergent, and discriminative validity of the HUI-3 for deriving utility scores in patients with AS.

The required indicators are annually computed on the basis of surveyed and estimated gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), price indexes and also determined by the main model parameters (the average service life of assets, the type of mortality function, depreciation pattern). The paper deals with the modelling of gross capital stock as a part system dynamics model of fixed capital. This means change from discrete time model to continuous alternative. The principles of system dynamics modelling and national accounts based on former econometric research are compared. The advantages of both models are presented. This comparison is necessary for full model testing. The system dynamics model allows extensions of the model that lead to more precise estimations. But the implementation of extensions biases comparison of dynamic model with non-improved original data. That's why the continuous alternative of PIM is essential.","[Krejci, Igor; Svasta, Jaroslav] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Syst Engn, Prague 6, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,,krejcii@pef.czu.cz; svasta@pef.czu.cz,"Krejci, Igor/R-9263-2016","Krejci, Igor/0000-0003-2723-7289",,,,,15,0,0,0,4,PROFESSIONAL PUBLISHING,PRAHA 4,"MIKULOVA 1572 13,, PRAHA 4, 149 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7431-058-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,380,384,,,,,,5,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BBZ07,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000309074600064,0

The term aberration corresponds with the act of deviation in comparison with soil original most frequent characteristics. The objective was to point at changes of soil characteristics in the localities, which are under the pressure of human interventions. The soil samples were collected in the same places as the soil samples during the 1960s. Soil texture, soil organic matter content, soil reaction and the content of carbonates were under examination. Finally, the level of aberration was calculated by the statistical methods. The significant difference is shown in soil reaction. This could be interpreted by acidity. Rapid acidification was determined in a studied area of arable land in Vilemovice, where pH decreased from 6.60 to 5.10 in average, which is really alarming in the context of agricultural practices. The aberration was also observed in soil texture, to be specific in the content of coarse silt (0.01-0.05 mm) and fine sand (0.05-0.25 mm). This could be explained by weathering, erosion processes and soil particles changes.","[Krenovska, I; Vicek, V.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Appl & Landscape Ecol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Krenovska, I (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Appl & Landscape Ecol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",iva.krenovska@email.cz,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,1,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-563-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,378,387,,,,,,10,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2HX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341783400046,0

Costs are given for the straight routes between each pair of the cities and represent the time necessary for going through. Each path must not exceed a given time limit. The sum of time for all routes is to be minimized. For the exact definition see [8]. This problem is NP-hard. One of the possibilities how to solve the TLVRP is to use heuristics (approximation methods), and thus to obtain a sufficiently good solution.

So far, in the literature, instantaneous causality effects have either been excluded or cannot be identified separately from Granger type causality effects. By giving explicit moment conditions for observed returns over (random) duration intervals, we are able to identify an instantaneous causality effect. The documented causality effect has significant impact on inference for tick-by-tick data. We find that instantaneous volatility forecasts for, e.g., IBM stock returns must be decreased by as much as 40% when not having seen the next quote change before its (conditionally) median time. Also, instantaneous volatilities are found to be much higher than indicated by standard volatility assessment procedures using tick-by-tick data. For IBM, a naive assessment of spot volatility based on observed returns between quote changes would only account for 60% of the actual volatility. For less liquidly traded stocks at NYSE this effect is even stronger. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Renault, Eric] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Werker, Bas J.

These variants have changed substrate specificity towards either natural (trans-zeatin-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, cis-zeatin-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside) or artificial substrates (p-nitrophenyl-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, 4-methylumbelliferyl O-beta-D-glucopyranoside). This work deals with generating a mutant library of Zm-p60.1. Based on the previous description of the mutant W373K and bioinformatics analysis of seven plant enzymes similar in sequence to Zm-p60.1 the position 373 was chosen as suitable for combinatorial amino acid mutations.","[Turek, D.; Filipi, T.; Mazura, P.; Brzobohaty, B.] Inst Biophys AS CR, Vvi, Plant Mol Biol Lab, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Biophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Turek, D (通讯作者)，Inst Biophys AS CR, Vvi, Plant Mol Biol Lab, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",dusanturek@seznam.cz,"Brzobohaty, Bretislav/D-7212-2012","Brzobohaty, Bretislav/0000-0002-1552-1314",,,,,3,0,0,0,7,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-563-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,1046,1050,,,,,,5,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2HX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341783400128,0

On the basis of these factors and measurement of their relation to the insured accident, it is possible to determine the probability of insured accident for each policyholder and also to differentiate the paid insurance premiums in compliance with risk factors. The insurance premium is proposed in this way that it corresponds to undertaken risk, i.e. occurrence probability. In the purpose of identifying and modelling this relation, the logistic regression model is primarily employed, but potential interactions among factors during the proposing and estimating are often neglected. It results in the inaccurate parameter estimates and also in misinterpreting and incorrect assessing relation to the outcome generally. In the paper, the model with and without interaction is proposed and estimated and then, in compliance with both models, the relation of selected risk factor and the insured accident are interpreted and assessed. The differences are explained including the recommendation concerning the rules for differentiation of paid insurance premiums.","[Valecky, Jiri] VSB TU Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,,jiri.valecky@vsb.cz,"Valecký, Jiří/I-3625-2018","Valecký, Jiří/0000-0002-5978-6111",,,,,11,0,0,1,4,PROFESSIONAL PUBLISHING,PRUHONICE,"NA SIDLISTI 152, PRUHONICE, PRAGUE 252 43, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7431-058-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,745,750,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BBZ07,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000309074600124,0

The method aggregates any number of mortality outcomes into a single indicator via a two-stage procedure. In the first stage, mortality outcomes are risk- adjusted using a system of seemingly unrelated regression equations. These risk-adjusted mortality rates are then aggregated into a single quality indicator in the second stage via weighted least squares. This method addresses the dimensionality problem in measuring hospital quality, which is multifaceted in nature. In addition, our method also facilitates further analyses of determinants of hospital quality by allowing the resulting quality estimates be associated with hospital characteristics. The method is applied to a sample of heart-disease episodes extracted from hospital administrative data from the state of Victoria, Australia. Using the quality estimates, we show that teaching hospitals and large regional hospitals provide higher quality of care than other hospitals and this superior performance is related to hospital case-load volume.

The embodied technological change involves a continuous component and technological innovations (breakthroughs, technology shocks). The provided analytic and numeric investigation reveals the qualitative structure of optimal regimes. It demonstrates that the optimal investment is zero immediately before and after a technological breakthrough (direct anticipation effect) and contains a set of zero-investment boundary intervals (anticipation echoes) before the breakthrough time.

The estimator is consistent for the integrated variance and we present feasible central limit theorems which show that it converges at the best attainable rate and has excellent efficiency. Asymptotically, the quantile-based realised variance is immune to finite activity jumps and outliers in the price series, while in modified form the estimator is applicable with market microstructure noise and therefore operational on high-frequency data.

A sufficient condition for the existence is given without any topological assumptions when the dominance relation is finite valued. The condition says that there is a point such that all dominance sequences starting from this point are reducible. A dominance sequence is reducible, if it is possible to remove some elements from it so that the resulting subsequence is still a dominance sequence. Necessary and sufficient conditions are formulated for closed acyclic relations on compact Hausdorff spaces. Reducibility is the key concept also in this case. A representation theorem for such relations is given. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We assume that hospitals provide two alternative treatments for a given diagnosis: a less intensive one (for example, a medical treatment) and a more intensive one (a surgical treatment). We assume that prices are set equal to the average cost reported by the providers, as observed in many OECD countries (yardstick competition). The purchaser has two options: (1) to set one tariff based on the diagnosis only and (2) to differentiate the tariff between the surgical and the medical treatment (i.e. to refine the tariff). We show that when tariffs are refined, the provider has always an incentive to overprovide the surgical treatment. If the tariff is not refined, the hospital underprovides the surgical treatment (and overprovides the medical treatment) if the degree of altruism is sufficiently low compared with the opportunity cost of public funds. Our main result is that price refinement might not be optimal.

A criteria for identification by linear restrictions on individual relations is given. The asymptotic distribution of the estimators of alpha and beta is derived when they are identified by linear restrictions on beta, and when they are identified by linear restrictions on alpha. It it shown that, in the latter case, a component of (beta) over cap is asymptotically Gaussian. Finally we discuss identification of shocks by introducing the contemporaneous and permanent effect of a shock and the distinction between permanent and transitory shocks, which allows one to identify permanent shocks from the long-run variance and transitory shocks from the shortrun variance.

Elevated weight is associated with health problems and increased medical expenditures. This paper analyzes Waves 1 and 2 of the National Epidemiological Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions to investigate the role of alcohol consumption in weight gain. Alcohol is not only an addictive substance but also a high-calorie beverage that can interfere with metabolic function and cognitive processes. Because men and women differ in the type and amount of alcohol they consume, in the biological effects they experience as a result of alcohol consumption, and in the consequences they face as a result of obesity, we expect our results to differ by gender. We use first-difference models of body mass index (BMI) and alcohol consumption (frequency and intensity) to control for time-invariant unobservable factors that may influence changes in both alcohol use and weight status. Increasing frequency and intensity of alcohol use is associated with statistically significant yet quantitatively small weight gain for men but not for women. Moreover, the first-difference results are much smaller in magnitude and sometimes different in sign compared with the benchmark pooled cross-sectional estimates.

Methods: We built a decision analytical model to replicate the NAPA trial with 1000 hypothetical patients in both nesiritide and placebo arms. The incident rates of dialysis, hospital death, and their composite were predicted based on the renal function data obtained from the NAPA trial. All analyses were further repeated for two subgroups stratified by the presence of preoperative renal dysfunction (RD). Results: The base-case analyses significantly favored nesiritide for the three clinical end points. In the total NAPA sample, the absolute risk reductions (ARRs) for dialysis, hospital death, and their composite across 100 simulated trials were 1.3%, 3.3%, and 4.1%, respectively. The improvement was more pronounced in the preoperative RD subgroup with the three ARRs of 4.1%, 7.1%, and 9.4%, respectively. The beneficial effect diminished in the normal preoperative renal function (NRF) subgroup with the three ARRs of 0.6%, 3.0%, and 3.4%, respectively. The best case analyses confirmed the robustness of the base-case results in the total NAPA sample and RD subgroup, but not in the NRF subgroup. Conclusion: If the demonstrated renal preservation can be extrapolated, nesiritide may reduce dialysis and hospital death in cardiac surgery patient with preoperative RD, but to a much lesser extent or not in patients with normal preoperative renal function.","[He, Jinghua] Univ Florida, Dept Pharmaceut Outcomes & Policy, Coll Pharm, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"He, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Dept Pharmaceut Outcomes & Policy, Coll Pharm, POB 100496, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA.",hjh1232@ufl.edu,"winterstein, almut/ABH-1838-2020; Winterstein, Almut/A-3017-2014","Winterstein, Almut/0000-0002-6518-5961",,,,,23,6,6,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2010,13.0,5,,,,,643,648,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00710.x,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,635RQ,20345547.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280674200018,0

Methods: An economic evaluation was conducted based on evidence from the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled GPRF [General Practice Research Framework] Nasal Steroids for Otitis Media with Effusion (GNOME) trial. Participants comprised 217 children aged 4-11 years who had at least one episode of otitis media or related ear problem in the previous 12 months and had tympanometrically confirmed bilateral OME. Children were randomly allocated to receive either mometasone furoate 50 mu g or placebo spray once daily into each nostril for 3 months. The main outcome measure was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for topical steroids compared with placebo. The nonparametric bootstrap method was used to present cost-effectiveness acceptability curves at alternative willingness to pay thresholds. Results: Children receiving topical steroids accrued nonsignificantly higher costs (incremental cost/child: 11 pound, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -199 pound to 222) pound and nonsignificantly fewer QALYs (incremental QALY gain/child: -0.0166, 95% CI: -0.0652 to 0.0320) than those receiving placebo. Topical steroids had a 24.19% probability of being cost-effective at a 20,000 pound per QALY gained threshold, a 23.82% probability of being more effective and a 46.25% probability of being less costly. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses showed incremental costs and benefits to be highly sensitive to the methods used and the patient group considered, although differences between groups did not reach statistical significance in any analysis. Conclusions: Topical steroids are unlikely to be a cost-effective treatment for OME in general practice.","[Petrou, Stavros] Univ Oxford, Natl Perinatal Epidemiol Unit, Dept Publ Hlth, Oxford OX3 7LF, England; [Petrou, Stavros; Dakin, Helen; Abangma, Giselle] Univ Oxford, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Dept Publ Hlth, Oxford OX3 7LF, England; [Benge, Sarah; Williamson, Ian] Univ Southampton, Aldermoor Hlth Ctr, Southampton, Hants, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Southampton,"Petrou, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Natl Perinatal Epidemiol Unit, Dept Publ Hlth, Old Rd Campus,Old Rd, Oxford OX3 7LF, England.",stavros.petrou@npeu.ox.ac.uk,"Dakin, Helen A/X-2860-2018; Petrou, Stavros/ABD-8323-2021","Dakin, Helen A/0000-0003-3255-748X; Petrou, Stavros/0000-0003-3121-6050","UK National Institute for Health Research Health Technology [01/72/02]; UK Medical Research Council Senior Non-Clinical Research; National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit, University of Oxford; Department of Health in England; Health Economics Research Centre, University of Oxford; National Co-ordinating Centre for Research Capacity Development, England; MRC [G0501681] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [G0501681] Funding Source: researchfish","UK National Institute for Health Research Health Technology; UK Medical Research Council Senior Non-Clinical Research(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit, University of Oxford; Department of Health in England(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Health Economics Research Centre, University of Oxford; National Co-ordinating Centre for Research Capacity Development, England; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))","Source of financial support: The GNOME trial was funded by the UK National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 01/72/02).

Methods: Commercial insurance claims data between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2006 from the Ingenix Impact (formerly Integrated Health Care Information Services) database were retrospectively analyzed. Chronic HCV patients with one or more prescriptions for an HCV-specific treatment within 6 months before or at any time after their first observed diagnosis of chronic HCV were selected. Prescribing patterns, treatment cost, and duration of treatment were assessed over the entire therapy period. Medication adherence rates and the relationship between adherence and health-care costs were assessed over the 24-week period after treatment initiation. The results were stratified by key clinical characteristics such as genotype, sustained virologic attainment, and disease severity. Results: Results showed that peginterferon and ribavirin combination regimens were the most common treatments for chronic HCV. The patients underwent treatment for approximately 30-32 weeks on average, and treatment costs were over $20,000 per patient. Adherence to medication was suboptimal, especially among patients with severe disease. Adherent patients had higher pharmacy costs but significantly lower total costs when pharmacy was excluded. Conclusions: New and improved treatments that promote better adherence and impose a lower cost burden on patients and payers are needed.","[Mitra, Debanjali] RTI Hlth Solut, Hlth Econ, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Beam, Cynthia] Human Genome Sci Inc, Rockville, MD USA; [Medjedovic, Jasmina] Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland; [Rustgi, Vinod] Georgetown Univ, Med Ctr, Washington, DC 20007 USA",Research Triangle Institute; GlaxoSmithKline; Human Genome Sciences Inc; Novartis; Georgetown University,"Mitra, D (通讯作者)，RTI Hlth Solut, Hlth Econ, 3040 Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",mitra@rti.org,,"Davis, Keith/0000-0002-0044-7107",Human Genome Sciences Inc.; Novartis Pharma AG,Human Genome Sciences Inc.(GlaxoSmithKline); Novartis Pharma AG,"This study and the writing and preparation of this manuscript were funded in full by Human Genome Sciences Inc. and Novartis Pharma AG.

Maternal report of child health status is predicted as a function of exogenous variation in maternal employment associated with random assignment to the experimental group. IV estimates show a modest adverse effect of maternal employment on children's health. Making use of data from another welfare-to-work program we propose that any adverse effect on child health may be tempered by increased family income and access to public health insurance coverage, findings with direct relevance to a number of current policy discussions. In a secondary analysis using fixed effects techniques on longitudinal survey data collected in 1998 and 2001, we find a comparable adverse effect of maternal employment on child health that supports the external validity of our primary result.

Recent articles demonstrated that generalized gamma models (GGMs) and extended estimating equations (EEE) models provide flexible approaches to deal with a variety of data problems encountered in expenditure estimation. To date there have been few empirical applications of these models to expenditures. We use data from the US Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to compare the bias, predictive accuracy, and marginal effects of GGM and EEE models with other commonly used regression models in a cross-validation study design. Health-care expenditure distributions vary in the degree of heteroskedasticity, skewness, and kurtosis by type of service and population. To examine the ability of estimators to address a range of data problems, we estimate models of total health expenditures and prescription drug expenditures for two populations, the elderly and privately insured adults. Our findings illustrate the need for researchers to examine their assumptions about link functions: the appropriate link function varies across our four distributions. The EEE model, which has a flexible link function, is a robust estimator that performs as well, or better, than the other models in each distribution.

We develop a theoretical model in which monitoring IT may complement or substitute for integration and test these relationships using a novel data source. Physician labor market heterogeneity identifies the empirical model. We find that monitoring IT utilization is increasing in integration, implying that expanded firm boundaries complement monitoring IT adoption. We argue that the relationship between monitoring IT and firm boundaries depends upon the contractibility of the monitored information. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A cohort simulation model was developed to determine from a health systems perspective the cost-effectiveness of the 21 alternative CCS strategies that incorporated combinations of Papanicolaou's smear test (PAP), liquid-based cytology (LBC) or human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid (HPV-DNA) testing. The model was calibrated to categorize total costs into four budgetary authorities: testing, physician, inpatient, and outpatient services. Within each category, alternative screening strategies were contrasted in terms of their cost impacts and the percent change calculated within each category. Epidemiologic data and costs were derived from administrative health databases. Estimates of test characteristics and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were derived from available literature. Results: Three-year screening with PAP and HPV-DNA triage testing for women older than 30 years of age (3-year PAP + HPV + PAP-age) is less costly and more effective saving $16,078 per additional QALY gained. Although there was an associated net cost decrease of 4.2% driven by a reduction in testing and physician costs of 22.1% and 18.6%, respectively, there is a cost increase of 0.8% and 27.7% in inpatient and outpatient services, respectively. Conclusion: There is economic evidence to support adopting 3-year PAP + HPV + PAP-age. Budgetary resources can potentially be shifted from testing and physician services to fund the additional resource requirements for inpatient and outpatient services.","Inst Hlth Econ, Decis Analyt Modeling Unit, Edmonton, AB T5J 3N4, Canada",,"Chuck, A (通讯作者)，Inst Hlth Econ, Decis Analyt Modeling Unit, 1200,10405 Jasper Ave, Edmonton, AB T5J 3N4, Canada.",achuck@ihe.ca,,,Alberta Health Technologies Decision Process initiative,Alberta Health Technologies Decision Process initiative,Source of financial support: Supported by a financial contribution from Health and Wellness under the auspices of the Alberta Health Technologies Decision Process initiative: the Alberta Model for health technology assessment and policy analysis.

J,"Hausman, DM",,,,"Hausman, Daniel M.",,,VALUING HEALTH: A NEW PROPOSAL,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,QALYs; health measurement; values; preferences,QUALITY-OF-LIFE; VALUATIONS; PREFERENCE,"After criticizing existing systems of health measurement for their unargued commitment to evaluating health states in terms of preferences or well-being, this essay argues that public rather than private values of health states should help guide the allocation of health-related resources. Private evaluation of health states is relative to a prior individual choice of specific activities and goals, while public evaluation is relative to the whole range of important activities and goals. Public evaluation is concerned with securing a wide range of choices as well as with success given one's choice. A reasonable simplification from the public perspective is to focus on just two features of health states: the subjective feelings attached to health states and the limitations that health states imply oil the range of important activities that individuals can pursue. Focusing on just these two dimensions permits the construction of a parsimonious classification of health states with regard to what matters most from the public perspective. This classification, which resembles those in the HALex and the Rosser and Kind Disability and Distress Index, might best be built on top of existing health-state classifications, by mapping the health states they define to activity-limitation/feeling pairs. To assign values to these pairs, I propose relying on deliberative groups to make comparisons among the pairs with respect to the relation 'is a more serious limitation oil the range of objectives and good lives available to members of the population'. A ranking according to this property, is not a preference ranking, because it is not a ranking in terms of everything that matters to individuals. Working back from the weights attached to the activity-limitation/feeling pairs, one can impute weights for the health states in other classification systems that were mapped to those pairs. If those weights coincide roughly with Current weights, then one legitimizes current weights and provides a vehicle for their public discussion and possible revision. If those weights do not coincide, then one has both all argument for revising current views of the cost effectiveness of treatments and policies and a method to carry out such a revision.

We compare the small sample performance of the alternative tests in a Monte Carlo study, and find some discrepancies with their asymptotic properties.

The usual instrumental strategy based on the independence between the outcome and the instrument is likely to fail when selection is directly driven by the dependent variable. Instead, we suggest to rely on the independence between the instrument and the selection variable, conditional on the outcome. This approach may be particularly suitable for nonignorable nonresponse, binary models with missing covariates or Roy models with an unobserved sector. The nonparametric identification of the joint distribution of the variables is obtained under a completeness assumption, which has been used recently in several nonparametric instrumental problems. Even if the conditional independence between the instrument and the selection variable fails to hold, the approach provides sharp bounds on parameters of interest under weaker monotonicity conditions. Apart from identification, nonparametric and parametric estimations are also considered. Finally, the method is applied to estimate the effect of grade retention in French primary schools.

An instrumental variable (IV) is strongly related to the exposure under study, but not directly or indirectly (through other variables) with the outcome. Theoretically, analyses using IVs to control for both observed and unobserved confounding may provide unbiased estimates of influenza vaccine effects. We assessed the usefulness of IV analysis in influenza vaccination studies. Methods: Information on patients aged 65 years and older from the computerized Utrecht General Practitioner (GP) research database over seven influenza epidemic periods was pooled to estimate the association between influenza vaccination and all-cause mortality among community-dwelling elderly. Potential IVs included in the analysis were a history of gout, a history of orthopaedic morbidity, a history of antacid medication use, and GP-specific vaccination rates. Results: Using linear regression analyses, all possible IVs were associated with vaccination status: risk difference (RD) 7.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.6%; 12.0%), RD 2.8% (95% CI 1.7%; 3.9%), RD 8.1% (95% CI 6.1%; 10.1%), and RD 100.0% (95% CI 89.0%; 111.0%) for gout, orthopaedic morbidity, antacid medication use, and GP-specific vaccination rates, respectively. Each potential IV, however, also appeared to be related to mortality through other observed confounding variables (notably age, sex, and comorbidity). Conclusions: The potential IVs studied did not meet the necessary criteria, because they were (indirectly) associated with the outcome. These variables may, therefore, not be suited to assess unconfounded influenza vaccine effects through IV analysis.","[Groenwold, Rolf H.

This text characterizes the first stage of the longtime experiment. Freshly cut grass was used as a composted material in five composters, each with the 290 dm(3) cubic capacity. Each composter was labeled and fully filled with the grass. Two composters are used as a reference. Three composters enriched with the product contain each a different product concentration. Chemical analysis of the input material was also purchased. The temperature in all composters is measured during the whole experiment. Although the experiment is still in progress, there is some evidence so far that the product affects the temperature scale in the composters. Maximum temperatures in the composters enriched with the product achieve higher levels compared to the reference composters. Higher temperature indicates more intense microbial activity and faster process of the mineralization phase of the composting. Significant mass losses in the enriched composters were also detected.

This branding of heritage sites fails to highlight other significant aspects of their history. For example, Portuguese merchants established what later came to be known as Elmina Castle in the late 15(th) century, yet the details surrounding this are not emphasized in contemporary guided tours of the castle. Culture and history are significant factors that serve to explain how sites become sacralized (MacCannell 1976) and meanings reified through the process of memory construction. Memories are mediated through the interpretation of tour guides, museum exhibitions, visitors' comments, public performances, and television, films, and the internet. This paper considers the processes that contribute to heritage production by examining ethnographic data from two notable heritage tourism destinations in Ghana, Cape Coast Castle and Elmina Castle. This paper also addresses broader theoretical questions of why certain features are obscured from view while others are underscored in the place-making of heritage sites for tourism more broadly.","[Reed, A.

Methods: The Stress Urinary Incontinence Treatment (SUIT) study was a 12-month observational study in four European countries that evaluated the cost-effectiveness of duloxetine compared with other forms of nonsurgical intervention in the treatment of the symptoms of SUI. Four hundred thirty-one physicians observed women seeking treatment for their SUI, and recorded the care provided and the outcomes of that care at enrollment and at 3, 6 and 12 months afterward The impact of SUI on baseline HRQoL as expressed by the EQ-5D index score was assessed by linear and logistic regression. Results: Three thousand seven hundred sixty-two women were enrolled into SUIT, with the largest patient group from Germany. Overall, the majority of women were postmenopausal, had a mean age of 58.0 years, were not current smokers, and tended to be overweight (mean body mass index [BMI] = 27.7 kg/m(2)), with at least one comorbidity. The health state index scores were significantly and independently influenced by the presence of comorbidity(ies) affecting quality of life, total number of stress and urge incontinence episodes, urinary incontinence subtype, comorbidity(ies) affecting incontinence, BMI, socioeconomic status, educational status, age, and country. Conclusion: This article describes the characteristics of patients at the SUIT enrollment visit, and demonstrates that the number of incontinence episodes has a significant impact on the EQ-5D index score.","[Tincello, Douglas] Univ Leicester, Leicester Royal Infirm, Reprod Sci Sect, Leicester LE2 7LX, Leics, England; [Sculpher, Mark] Univ York, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Sculpher, Mark] Oxford Outcomes Ltd, Oxford, England; [Tunn, Ralf] St Hedwig Hosp, Berlin, Germany; [Quail, Deborah; Timlin, Louise] Eli Lilly & Co Ltd, Windlesham, Surrey, England; [van der Vaart, Huub] Univ Med Ctr, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Falconer, Christian] Danderyd Hosp, Karolinska Inst, Stockholm, Sweden; [Manning, Martina] Lilly Deutschland, Bad Homburg, Germany",University of Leicester; University of York - UK; Eli Lilly; Utrecht University; Utrecht University Medical Center; Danderyds Hospital; Karolinska Institutet; Eli Lilly; Lilly Deutschland GmbH,"Tincello, D (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Leicester Royal Infirm, Reprod Sci Sect, Clin Sci Bldg,POB 65, Leicester LE2 7LX, Leics, England.",dgt4@leicester.ac.uk,,"Sculpher, Mark/0000-0003-3746-9913",Eli Lilly and Company Ltd.; Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH,Eli Lilly and Company Ltd.(Eli Lilly); Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH(Boehringer Ingelheim),"This study was funded by Eli Lilly and Company Ltd., and Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH.

It shows that when firms compete in quantity, market prices increase as the degree of multi-market contact increases. However, the welfare consequences of multi-market contact are more complex and depend on how two fundamental forces play out. The first is the selection effect, which acts to increase welfare, as shutting down the relatively more inefficient firm is beneficial. The second opposing effect is the internalisation of the Cournot externality effect; reducing the production of good 2 allows firms to sustain a higher price for good 1. This works to increase prices and, therefore, decrease consumer surplus (but increase producer surplus). These two effects are influenced by the degree of asymmetry between markets 1 and 2 and the degree of substitutability between goods 1 and 2. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

There has been pressure on Korea's National Health Insurance system to control its skyrocketing expenditures on drugs. As a result, a series of cost-containment policies have been implemented. The idea of economic evidence-based decision-making was first introduced in Korea in 2001 when the government announced cost-effectiveness as one of the criteria for reimbursement decisions. After this announcement, the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) developed guidelines, which became the standard for economic evaluations. In 2006, the drug listing system for reimbursement was changed from a negative to a positive system under the drug expenditure rationalization plan. Under this new system, only drugs that are proven economically and clinically valuable can be listed, and applicants have to submit economic evaluation studies to support the cost-effectiveness of their drugs. Once new applications are submitted, HIRA reviews them, and the Drug Reimbursement Evaluation Committee (DREC) decides whether or not to recommend the submitted drugs. In its reimbursement decisions, the DREC considers not only cost-effectiveness but also the availability of therapeutic alternatives, the severity of the condition treated, and the impact on the budget, among other measures. After the introduction of the positive list system, 56% of drugs were determined to be appropriate for reimbursement by the DREC. Despite limited human resources, experience, and quality local data, Korea is continuing to make efforts to establish a system of evidence-based decision-making.","[Lee, Eui Kyung] SookMyung Womens Univ, Grad Sch Clin Pharm, Seoul 140742, South Korea; [Bae, Eun Young] Sangji Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Wonju, South Korea",Sookmyung Women's University; Sangji University,"Lee, EK (通讯作者)，SookMyung Womens Univ, Grad Sch Clin Pharm, Hyochangwongil 52, Seoul 140742, South Korea.",ekyung@sm.ac.kr,,,,,,,14,32,35,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,NOV-DEC,2009,12.0,,,3,2,,S36,S41,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00625.x,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,524KG,20586979.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272141600008,0

Methods: The Benefits of Smoking Cessation on Outcomes model was modified to reflect major smoking-related diseases in Korea. Transitional probabilities, resource utilization, and costs were obtained from Korean public data. The analysis was carried out from a societal perspective for the lifetime period. Also, series of sensitivity analyses, including probabilistic sensitivity analysis, were performed. Results: With the exclusion of bupropion, which is subject to extended dominance, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for varenicline versus NRT was analyzed as $US4809 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) during the lifetime. The results of sensitivity analysis are quite stable across most of the included parameters. The acceptability curves showed that the probability of varenicline being cost-effective was 83.3% at the willingness to pay of $US15,000. Conclusions: Even though the maximum willingness to pay for a QALY has not officially been defined, varenicline can be regarded as cost-effective because the ICER is at the 24.0% level of per capital gross domestic product, which is an implicit reference for decision-making in Korea.","[Bae, Jung Youn; Lee, Eui Kyung] SookMyung Womens Univ, Grad Sch Clin Pharm, Seoul 140742, South Korea; [Kim, Cheol Hwan] Family Med Seoul Paik Hosp, Seoul, South Korea",Sookmyung Women's University,"Lee, EK (通讯作者)，SookMyung Womens Univ, Grad Sch Clin Pharm, Hyochangwongil 52, Seoul 140742, South Korea.",ekyung@sm.ac.kr,,,"Pfizer, Ltd., Seoul, South Korea","Pfizer, Ltd., Seoul, South Korea(Pfizer)","Source of financial support: This study was sponsored by Pfizer, Ltd., Seoul, South Korea.

Methods: Adults with CAP receiving IV moxifloxacin or IV levofloxacin for >= 3 days were identified in the Premier Perspective comparative database. Primary outcomes were LOS and costs. Secondary outcomes included treatment consistency, which was defined as 1) no additional IV moxifloxacin or levofloxacin after >= 1 day off study drug; 2) no switch to another IV antibiotic; and 3) no addition of another IV antibiotic. Results: A total of 7720 patients met inclusion criteria (6040 receiving moxifloxacin; 1680 receiving levofloxacin). Propensity matching created two cohorts (1300 patients each) well matched for demographic, clinical, hospital, and payor characteristics. Before the patients were matched, mean LOS (5.87 vs. 5.46 days; P = 0.0004) and total costs per patient ($7302 vs. $6362; P < 0.0001) were significantly greater with moxifloxacin. After the patients were matched, mean LOS (5.63 vs. 5.51 days; P = 0.462) and total costs ($6624 vs. $6473; P = 0.476) were comparable in both cohorts. Treatment consistency was higher for moxifloxacin before (81.0% vs. 78.9%; P = 0.048) and after matching (82.8% vs. 78.0%; P = 0.002). Conclusions: In-hospital treatment of CAP with IV moxifloxacin 400 mg or IV levofloxacin 750 mg was associated with similar hospital LOS and costs in propensity-matched cohorts.","[Friedman, Howard] Analyt Solut LLC, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Song, Xue] Thomson Reuters Healthcare, Cambridge, MA USA; [Crespi, Simone] Schering Plough Pharmaceut, Kenilworth, NJ USA; [Navaratnam, Prakash] Informagen LLC, Worthington, OH USA",Clarivate; Merck & Company,"Friedman, H (通讯作者)，Analyt Solut LLC, 26 Prince St,Suite 2B, New York, NY 10012 USA.",howard@analytic-consulting.com,,,"Rete Biomedical Communications Corp.

The log EL ratios are constructed through the estimating equations satisfied by the local linear estimators. Limit theories are developed by means of increasing time span and shrinking observational intervals. The results apply to both stationary and nonstationary recurrent diffusion processes. Simulations show that for both drift and diffusion functions, the new procedure performs remarkably well in finite samples and clearly dominates the conventional method in constructing confidence intervals based on asymptotic normality. An empirical example is provided to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
