This article uses a dynamic aggregate translog cost function with inputs of capital, labor, and imports to examine the likely impact of closer world economic ties on France. This technique allows one to estimate short- as well as long-run direct price elasticities of demand for the inputs and cross-price elasticities for each respective input pair. The findings of the article include that (1) the French economy is becoming more sensitive to changes in import prices and (2) all the inputs are substitutes for one another. These results suggest that continuing international economic integration will present substantial challenges to the French economy. The short-run estimates of direct and cross-price elasticities are consistent with the Le Chtelier principle, except for the cross-price elasticities between capital and labor. Some possible reasons for the latter result are discussed in the article.

Using an efficient estimator called fixed effect vector decomposition (FEVD) we employ a set of panel data from 54 developing countries for the period 1993-2004. Our results indicate that on average financial development is conducive for poverty reduction but the instability accompanying financial development is detrimental to the poor. The major policy recommendations suggested by the paper indicate that financial sector reforms should be directed at easing credit restrictions while taking into consideration the effects of financial instability on the poor.

In contrast, retirement plans in the public sector remain primarily defined benefit plans. The stock market crash of 2008 had a dramatic effect on pension balances across all types of plans; private defined benefit, private defined contribution, and state and local plan assets all fell by more than 25 percent in 2008.

The L-performance is an alternative to the Sharpe performance, which is commonly used in practice despite its inability to account for skewness and heavy tails of unconditional return distributions. The L-performance improves upon the Sharpe measure in this respect. Technically, it resembles the Sharpe measure in that it is defined as a ratio of the first- and second-order moments, which are the trimmed L-moments instead of the conventional (power) moments. The trimming parameters allow for focusing the L-performance on specific risk levels of interest, according to financial risk criteria. For illustration, a set of L-performances is Computed for a variety of hedge funds. The empirical study shows the use of L-performance for fund ranking and return smoothing (manipulation) control.

Over the last several decades, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has experimented with both rental equivalence and user cost approaches for accounting for owner occupied housing (OOH) services in the CPI. We explain the basics of these approaches, and outline the BLS experiences with using them. This assessment leads us to conclude that the time has come to try a new approach: the opportunity cost approach. We argue this approach has advantages over both the conventional rental equivalence and user cost approaches, though it embeds components of the measures for both those approaches and builds solidly on the research of Verbrugge and others at the BLS. Also, we take up empirical issues that must be faced regardless of which of the approaches discussed is adopted. We explain how the repeat-sales and various hedonic regression methods can be placed in a common framework, thereby facilitating understanding of the properties of and the tradeoffs between the methods. We also consider measurement complications that arise because the land and structure components of properties depreciate at different rates. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Diewert, W.

An important new finding is that only for export markets outside Africa must firms be efficient prior to entry. The probability of exporting to other African countries increases if production is intense in physical and human capital. For export activities outside Africa, firm size is more important. Contrary to many other studies, it is also found that export participation yields learning effects. When testing the hypothesis that the main source of learning effects is trade with developed countries (south-north), as opposed to trade with other developing countries (south-south), yet another new finding is that learning effects only obtain in south-south trade. Therefore, one can conclude that controlling for the destination of exports importantly improves the understanding of the relationship between firm efficiency and exports.","[Graner, Mats] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Isaksson, Anders] United Nations Ind Dev Org, Res & Stat Branch, Vienna, Austria",University of Gothenburg,"Granér, M (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden.",,,,,,,,42,29,32,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

We estimate cost of capital effects implied by market prices and analyst forecasts, which accounts for changes in growth expectations around cross-listings. Firms with cross-listings on U.S. exchanges experience a decrease in their cost of capital between 70 and 120 basis points. These effects are sustained and exist after the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We find smaller reductions for cross-listings in the over-the-counter market and for exchange-listings from countries with stronger legal institutions. For exchange-traded cross-listings, the cost of capital reduction accounts for over half of the increase in firm value, where as for other types of cross-listings the valuation effects are primarily attributable to contemporaneous revisions in growth expectations.

Our results suggest convergence in per capita CO2 emissions among all the countries under scrutiny in the early years of our sample. However, there seem to be two separate convergence clubs in the recent era that converge to different steady states. Interestingly, we also find evidence of transitioning between the two convergence clubs suggesting either a slow convergence between the two clubs or a tendency for some countries to move from one convergence club to the other.","[Panopoulou, Ekaterini] Univ Piraeus, Dept Stat & Insurance Sci, Piraeus 18534, Greece; [Pantelidis, Theologos] Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Econ, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland; [Pantelidis, Theologos] Univ Crete, Dept Econ, Rethimnon, Greece",University of Piraeus; Maynooth University; University of Crete,"Panopoulou, E (通讯作者)，Univ Piraeus, Dept Stat & Insurance Sci, 80 Karaoli & Dimitriou St, Piraeus 18534, Greece.",apano@unipi.gr,"Pantelidis, Theologos/AAP-8448-2021","Panopoulou, Ekaterini/0000-0001-5080-9965; Pantelidis, Theologos/0000-0003-1511-0360",,,,,44,168,174,1,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

To this purpose, the econometric tool is a Bayesian numerical approach based on a three-equation vector autoregression model where the unemployment effects are derived residually from the difference between employment and labor-force participation effects. By simultaneously estimating the labor market effects of changes in labor taxes, the current analysis points to the importance of the supply side of the labor market from a macroeconomic perspective and empirically supports the view that either the individual's or the aggregate labor participation decisions have to be taken explicitly into account when evaluating whether or not tax progressivity is a useful policy device against unemployment.","Univ Piemonte Orientale, Fac Econ, SEMEQ, I-28100 Novara, Italy",University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro,"Sonedda, D (通讯作者)，Univ Piemonte Orientale, Fac Econ, SEMEQ, Via Perrone 18, I-28100 Novara, Italy.",daniela.sonedda@eco.unipmn.it,"Sonedda, Daniela/H-9232-2019","Sonedda, Daniela/0000-0002-0587-3308",,,,,38,0,0,0,6,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,SEP,2009,65.0,3,,,,,271,296,,10.1628/001522109X477778,0.0,,,26,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,529FK,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272501200001,0

Most studies use linear regression techniques to forecast changes in output or dichotomous choice models to forecast recessions. Others use time-varying parameter models, such as Markov-switching models and smooth transition models, to account for structural changes or other nonlinearities. Many studies find that the term spread predicts output growth and recessions up to one year in advance, but several also find its usefulness varies across countries and over time. In particular, many studies find that the ability of the term spread to forecast output growth has diminished in recent years, although it remains a reliable predictor of recessions.

In this paper, we ask if those options will also provide information related to other moments of the objective distribution of interest rates. Based on dynamic term structure models within the class of affine models, we find that interest rate options are useful for the identification of interest rate quantiles. Two three-factor models are adopted and their adequacy to estimate Value at Risk of zero-coupon bonds is tested. We find significant difference on the quantitative assessment of risk when options are (or not) included in the estimation process of each of these dynamic models. Statistical backtests indicate that bond estimated risk is clearly more adequate when options are adopted, although not yet completely satisfactory. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Firms with lowest takeover defense (democracy) pay a 25% higher spread on their bank loans as compared with firms with the highest takeover defense (dictatorship), after controlling for various firm and loan characteristics. Further investigations indicate that banks charge a higher loan spread to firms with higher takeover vulnerability mainly because of their concern about a substantial increase in financial risk after the takeover. Our results have important implications for understanding the link between a firm's governance structure and its cost of capital. Our study suggests that firms that rely too much on corporate control market as a governance device are punished by costlier bank loans.","[Chava, Sudheer] Texas A&M Univ, Mays Sch Business, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Livdan, Dmitry] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Purnanandam, Amiyatosh] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Mays Business School; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Chava, S (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Mays Sch Business, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",schava@mays.tamu.edu,"Livdan, Dmitry/F-8079-2016","Livdan, Dmitry/0000-0001-7014-8754",,,,,38,190,221,5,50,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

The second is leverage-when an arbitrageur chooses a privately optimal leverage ratio, he may create a fire-sale externality that raises the likelihood of a severe crash.

Then, we investigate the role of central bank interventions for explaining the switching properties between the two types of agents.

We first define Granger non-causality in all quantiles and propose testing non-causality by a sup-Wald test. Such a test is consistent against any deviation from non-causality in distribution, as opposed to the existing tests that check only non-causality in certain moment. This test is readily extended to test non-causality in different quantile ranges. In the empirical studies of three major stock market indices, we find that the causal effects of volume on return are usually heterogeneous across quantiles and those of return on volume are more stable. In particular, the quantile causal effects of volume on return exhibit a spectrum of (symmetric) V-shape relations so that the dispersion of return distribution increases with lagged volume. This is an alternative evidence that volume has a positive effect on return volatility. Moreover, the inclusion of the squares of lagged returns in the model may weaken the quantile causal effects of volume on return but does not affect the causality per se. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Towards its objective of social co-education, its assessment can seem quite disappointing. The map of school catchment areas is indeed a relatively ineffective instrument in the urban spaces marked by a strong spatial segregation, which it even tends to increase. Besides, its functioning is strongly unegalitarian (with by-pass strategies implemented by wealthier and/or insiders and screening devices of schools). In this context; the system ends exactly in what against what it tries to fight. a strong polarization of schools, strong disparities and poor performances in internationals comparisons. Its abolition announced for 2010 and the related stake in competition can appear as a means to unbolt the system and to increase average quality, Applied econometrics realized from foreign experiments show however that efficiency gains to be waited are at best modest. On the other hand, competition rather tends to increase inequalities. We develop a model where pupils differ with respect to their parental income and their ability and where achievements depend on own ability and on peers'abilities. Each school chooses an admission policy to maximize a quality index. We show that abolition of school enrolment zoning will imply a stronger school segregation even more based on academic results. A computational example also demonstrates that this stronger scholastic segregation will probably come with a more pronounced social segregation. All in all, the debate can then seem relatively orthogonal to the challenges which the school has to raise. The crucial questions for the future of the school indeed concern more social mixity, redistribution of the means in the direction of the pupils in academic failure, or still the improvement of the educational spending efficiency.",,,,,,,,,,,63,2,2,0,6,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

The first is that people are more altruistic towards individuals that agree with them and the second is that people's well-being rises when other people share their personal opinions. The act of voting is then a source of vicarious utility because it raises the well-being of individuals that agree with the voter. Substantial equilibrium turnout emerges with nontrivial voting costs and modest altruism. The model can explain higher turnout in close elections as well as votes for third-party candidates with no prospect of victory. For certain parameters, these third party candidates lose votes to more popular candidates, a phenomenon often called strategic voting.

The results confirm strong improvements in both economic and political CBA over the past couple of decades, although more progress is needed to boost political autonomy of the central banks in emerging market and developing countries. Our analysis confirms that greater CBA has on average helped to maintain low inflation levels. The paper identifies four broad principles of CBA that have been shared by the majority of countries. Significant differences exist in the area of banking supervision where many central banks have retained a key role. Finally, we discuss the sequencing of reforms to separate the conduct of monetary and fiscal policies.

The aim of the study was to research the customer level of loyalty toward Romanian organizations acting in the retail banking sector. According to similar researches in the field, loyalty is a complex construction, which comprises both psychological and behavioural components, fact also proved by the results of the present research. As the survey results show, Romanian customers remain in relationships with banks due to the existence of both favourable attitudes or positive motivations (representing 46,36% of the total retention motivations) and constraint factors or inertia (representing 52,44% of the total retention motivations). At the same time, the results prove that the level of loyalty stated by customers is supported not only by the level of satisfaction, but also by factors like: bank's attitude towards its own customers, the level of customer trust toward the organization or its employees in ensuring the financial interests of clients, and also by the level of customer commitment. Customer switching behaviour is determined in 58% of cases by the high level of dissatisfaction toward the banks' policy of price.","[Filip, Alina; Anghel, Laurentiu-Dan] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Filip, A (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",filip.alina@gmail.com; langhel@ase.ro,"Anghel, Laurentiu Dan V/E-6918-2013; Anghel, Laurentiu-Dan V/P-1592-2016; Filip, Alina/AAR-8642-2021","Filip, Alina/0000-0002-4753-9244",,,,,10,6,7,0,24,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2009,11.0,26,,,,,288,297,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,462KQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267351800006,0

We use a nonparametric approach to analyze the variation in labor productivity growth across China's provinces. This approach imposes less structure on the data than the standard growth accounting framework and allows for a breakdown of labor productivity into efficiency gains, technological progress, and capital deepening. We have the following results. First, we find that on average capital deepening accounts for about 75 percent of total labor productivity growth, while efficiency and technological improvements account for about 7 and 18 percent, respectively. Second, technical change is not neutral. Third, whereas improvement in efficiency contributes to convergence in labor productivity between provinces, technical change contributes to productivity disparity across provinces. Finally, we find that foreign direct investment has a positive and significant effect on efficiency growth and technical progress.

We test this hypothesis using panel data on outward foreign direct investment (FDI) flows of various industries in the German manufacturing sector and account for several econometric issues that have been ignored in previous studies. Most importantly, we demonstrate that externalities associated with FDI agglomeration can bias estimates away from finding a pollution haven effect if omitted from the analysis. We include the stock of inward FDI as a proxy for agglomeration and employ a GMM estimator to control for endogenous time-varying determinants of FDI flows. Furthermore, we propose a difference estimator based on the least polluting industry to break the possible correlation between environmental regulatory stringency and unobservable attributes of FDI recipients in the cross-section.

Monetary authorities have to decide whether to intervene or not, and if so, when and how. Since the successive steps of this procedure are likely to be highly interdependent, we adopt a nested logit approach to capture their relationships and to characterize the prominent features of the various steps of the intervention decision process. Our estimations based on Japanese data from 1991 to 2004 indicate that the Bank of Japan: (i) mainly reacted to deviations of the exchange rate with respect to fundamentals and (ii) tended to favour secrecy when its credibility was low. We also provide new insights on the so-called secrecy puzzle by modeling explicitly the risk for a secret intervention to be detected. Our results have important implications in terms of exchange rate policy, such as the emergence of a trade-off between intervention size, communication policy and secrecy. Our results tend to provide some explanation for the observed persistence of ineffective intervention policy during some sub-periods. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This paper uses changes in technology to identify the same set of parameters. Estimates based on technology shocks differ substantially from those based on monetary policy shocks. In the post-World War II United States, a positive technology shock reduces inflation and increases hours worked, significantly and rapidly in both cases. Relative to policy shock identification, technology shock identification implies: (i) long duration durability in preferences instead of short duration habit, (ii) built-in inflation inertia disappears and price flexibility increases. In response to technological improvement, consumption durability increases hours worked because households temporarily increase labor supply to accumulate durables towards a new, higher steady state level. Limited nominal rigidities allow inflation to fall because firms are able to immediately cut prices when households' labor supply increases.

Firstly we have a system in which every university is supposed to offer equivalent degrees and this means that more than half of the students disappear without getting a degree. We cannot offer the sort of courses which would be appropriate for different types of students. Secondly, the quality of teaching is not satisfactory and this can be seen by examining the text books which are not aimed at communicating a desire to learn about economic phenomena. Lastly, the contents of the courses do not reflect such modern concerns as the problems of contagion, psychological elements, out of equilibrium behaviour.

This paper argues that in order to assess the default risk of a bank, it is important to consider its financing decisions as an endogenous dynamic process. We provide a continuous-time model, where banks choose the deposit volume in order to trade off the benefits of earning deposit premiums against the costs that occur at future capital structure adjustments. The bank's asset value may suffer from shocks and follows a jump-diffusion process. Our main finding is that the dynamic endogenous financing decision introduces an important self-regulation mechanism, where it is crucial to distinguish between the diffusion risk and the jump risk component.

The data that is used comes from a Swedish travel habit survey where the respondents' trip frequencies of both types of trips on a certain day are recorded. This is likely to introduce a correlation structure, which is incorporated in the model. Special attention is paid to the effect of travel cost on trip frequencies for different regions and income groups.

An econometric model parameterizes the influence of two programs, PROCAMPO and Alianza para el Campo, on cultivation. Consistent with an economic environment characterized by market barriers, results suggest that program support, even when decoupled from production decisions, significantly determines land use and deforestation.

Some countries remain predominantly in the low-tech industries whereas other countries succeed in becoming competitive in high-tech industries as well. The authors postulate that a country positioning itself at the lower end of the spectrum of high-tech industries is more favorable to its long-term development than aiming at the upper end of low-tech industries. They argue that countries which specialize in the lower end of the medium-high-tech activities are rewarded by faster productivity increases also in the upper end of the high-tech industries. In contrast, early specialization in medium-low-tech branches yields positive spillovers, mainly in the low-tech sector, which is not conducive to increasing activity in high-tech industries. The authors sketch a theoretical outline of this idea and present econometric results, including four aggregate manufacturing branches across 37 countries.","[Stehrer, Robert] Vienna Inst Int Econ Studies Wiiw, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Woerz, Julia] Oesterreich Natl Bank, Foreign Res Div, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies,"Stehrer, R (通讯作者)，Vienna Inst Int Econ Studies Wiiw, Oppolzergasse 6, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",Robert.Stehrer@wiiw.ac.at; julia.woerz@oenb.at,,,,,,,34,8,9,0,16,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1363-6669,,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Using behavioral definitions of sexual orientation based on the previous year and the previous 5 yr of sexual activity, we find the familiar wage premia/penalties for lesbian/gay workers in our ordinary least squares estimations, but we find that these wage differences are falling over time. Furthermore, in contrast to the earlier results, for our regressions over the entire sample period, correcting for differential selection into full-time work reduces the estimated penalties for unmarried gay men and eliminates the entire wage premium for all lesbians.

International evidence suggests a clear overall impact on consumption, although the nature of the pattern depends on the way in which the data are analysed. However, the key policy issue is the impact of the VAT change on output and, to examine that, a simulation model of the whole economy is needed. Evidence from the National Institute's Global Economic Model suggests that the impact of the recent VAT reduction is likely to build up during the course of 2009. The reduction in VAT from 171/2 per cent to 15 per cent is likely to result in consumption being augmented by less than 1 per cent by the fourth quarter of 2009. However, GDP is likely to be raised by less than half a per cent relative to what would have happened without the VAT increase.

We find great interdependence between the interest rate setting and real stock prices. Real stock prices immediately fall by seven to nine percent due to a monetary policy shock that raises the federal funds rate by 100 basis points. A stock price shock increasing real stock prices by one percent leads to an increase in the interest rate of close to 4 basis points. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It also shows how these gains have been distributed among consumers, producers, and government, and between Canadians and non-Canadians. The article uses the costs of Canadian Pacific Railway to create a more credible comparison than in previous privatization studies. Based on a conservative counterfactual, we estimate that CN's privatization generated welfare gains of at least $4 billion (in 1992 dollars). However, the welfare gain was possibly as high as $15 billion. The Canadian government captured almost half of these gains, while CN shareholders captured most of the rest.","[Boardman, Anthony E.] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Moore, Mark A.; Vining, Aidan R.] Simon Fraser Univ, Segal Grad Sch Business, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Laurin, Claude] HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada",University of British Columbia; Simon Fraser University; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Boardman, AE (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",,"Laurin, Claude/J-4206-2012; Moore, Mark/S-4057-2019","Moore, Mark/0000-0001-6626-1180",,,,,38,16,19,4,12,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

The stock price follows a jump-diffusion process with price jumps up and price jumps down, where each type of jumps can have different means and standard deviations. Price jumps can be negatively autocorrelated as it has been observed in practice. We investigate the volatility surfaces generated by this class of two counters of jumps option pricing models. Our formulae, like the jump-diffusion models with a single counter of jumps, are able to generate smiles, and skews with similar shapes to those observed in the options markets. More importantly, unlike the jump-diffusion models with a single counter of jumps, our formulae are able to generate term structures of implied volatilities of at-the-money options with boolean AND-shaped patterns similar to those observed in the marketplace.

This paper offers a simple explanation for these facts based on asymmetries in the forecasters' costs of over- and underpredicting inflation. Our model implies (i) biased forecasts, (ii) positive serial correlation in forecast errors, (iii) a cross-sectional dispersion that rises with the level and the variance of the inflation rate, and (iv) predictability of forecast errors at different horizons by means of the spread between the short- and long-term variance of inflation. We find empirically that these patterns are present in inflation forecasts from the Survey of Professional Forecasters.

They ignore possibly conflictive intrahousehold dynamics and assume that imperfections in rural financial markets are gender-neutral. This paper addresses both issues theoretically and empirically. The Semi-Cooperative Household model developed for this analysis formalizes the conditions under which spouses', and particularly women's, individual access to credit can be affected by their own position in the financial market its well as by intrahousehold dynamics. These notions are then explored empirically using husbands' and wives' individual perceptions of their access to credit in rural Paraguay. The most significant empirical findings of the paper are that (i) compared to men. women are more likely to be credit constrained (ii) women's rationing status responds to a different set of factors than men's; and (iii) husbands may choose not to intermediate capital to their wives even when they are able to do so. Results from this exercise provide empirically sound support for the assumptions underlying women-targeted credit programs.

Quantile regression analysis provides a way of understanding how the relationship between hedge fund returns and risk factors changes across the distribution of conditional returns. We propose a Bayesian approach to model comparison which provides posterior probabilities for different risk factor models that can be used for model averaging. The most relevant risk factors are identified for different quantiles and compared with those obtained for the conditional expectation model. We find differences in factor effects across quantiles of returns, which suggest that the standard conditional mean regression method may not be adequate for uncovering the risk-return characteristics of hedge funds. We explore potential economic impacts of our approach by analysing hedge fund single strategy return series and by constructing style portfolios. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Such simulations were run in the GLOBE model then adjusted and used as a policy shock to the PROVIDE model. The results show that the weighed average world price (adjusted) changes will range between -19.6 to +3.8% for imports and between -3.0 and +29.7% for exports at 75% liberalisation. The results from the single country CGE model show that the South African economy would respond positively to the world price changes, with government and macro variables showing minimal but positive responses.

We contend that the expected benefits derived from the liquidity provided by secondary markets are relevant for understanding important decisions made in preparation for an IPO. We hypothesize that the potential losses caused by an IPO failure induce firms that benefit more from going public to hire more reputable underwriters and to adopt more conservative pricing policies. We use several proxies for the benefits firms derive from post-IPO liquidity. The results indicate that firms that benefited more from liquidity were taken public by more prestigious underwriters and exhibited substantially larger levels of price revisions and underpricing. Post-IPO liquidity is also important for understanding the decision to retain the lead underwriter in subsequent SEOs. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We find that institutional investors, unlike individuals, are not prone to the disposition effect. Instead, institutions aggressively reduce risk following losses and mildly increase risk following gains. This asymmetry is more pronounced later in the calendar year and among older and more experienced funds. We show that such performance dependence is consistent with dynamic loss aversion (Barberis, Huang, and Santos (2001)) and overconfidence. In addition, prior institutional gains and losses have palpable implications for future prices.","[O'Connell, Paul G.

Based on empirical evidence regarding the recent national exercises in the field of science and technology (S&T), as described by the resumes of the European Foresight Monitoring Network, and on in-depth analysis of the Romanian S&T foresight exercise, the paper explores the relevance of the adaptive foresight framework for the extension of foresight functions towards supporting strategic planning. The demand for policy relevant foresight in S&T seems to be stronger in countries with developing knowledge based economies (e. g. new EU member states, Turkey); while in countries with larger foresight tradition the push comes from the improving abilities of foresight practitioners in involving decision-makers. Strongly integrated into strategic planning, the Romanian S&T foresight shows the adaptability characteristics in a restructuring R&D system and further suggests the relevance of multi-level negotiations for transforming consensus into commitment.","[Paunica, Mihai] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Gheorghiu, Radu] Inst World Econ, Bucharest, Romania; [Holeab, Cosmin] Politehn Univ, Ctr Strateg Management Higher Educ, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest,"Paunica, M (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",mihai.paunica@medu.edu.ro; gheorghiu.radu.cristian@gmail.com; adrian.curaj@uefiscsu.ro; cosmin.holeab@gmail.com,"Holeab, Cosmin/HMD-9063-2023; CURAJ, Adrian/B-4055-2014; curaj, adrian/G-5322-2019; Curaj, Adrian/AAE-3143-2019","CURAJ, Adrian/0000-0003-0852-5728; curaj, adrian/0000-0003-0852-5728; Curaj, Adrian/0000-0003-0852-5728",,,,,11,8,8,0,14,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2009,11.0,25,,,,,201,210,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,437LN,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000265489100018,0

Their approach identifies optimal strategies of the Social Security Administration to guarantee the financial sustainability of existing retirement pensions in a Pareto-improving way. Hence, no cohort will pay the cost of the demographic shock.

From analyzing the determinants of debt relief, our results suggest that governance quality did not play it role in the decision of creditor countries to forgive debt in the 1990s. Furthermore, even the actual debt burden of highly indebted poor countries was not crucial in deciding whether or not debt forgiveness was granted. Rather. debt relief followed it strong path dependence: those countries whose debt had been forgiven in the first hall of the 1990s were also granted debt forgiveness in the second half of the decade. However. this allocation pattern changed at the beginning of the 21st century, when path dependence diminished and some dimensions of governance quality were taken into account by donor Countries.

The findings show that there is no evidence of long memory in the return series of ISE indexes and foreign currencies futures contracts. The long memory tests therefore support the evidence that futures contracts return series are not fractionally integrated.

This study argues that the advancement of a field is predicated on defining a field's set of fundamental questions or issues because resolution of such issues serves to elevate the field to a high level of research inquiry. In order to advance the domain of agribusiness management in agricultural economics, this study examines four questions of strategy and outlines the pertinent theories used in resolving such concerns. Theories which we feel can advance agribusiness management to be a distinct discipline include Coase's (1937) treatment on the nature of the firm, Simon's (1957, 1976) concept of bounded rationality, Penrose's (1959) theory of the growth of the firm, and subsequently Barney's (1986, 1991) Resource-Based View. The relevance and implications of this early work should serve as a guide to those seeking to explain an agribusiness firm's existence, behavior, growth and heterogeneity.","[Ng, Desmond; Siebert, John W.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Ng, D (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 349B Blocker, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",dng@ag.tamu.edu; j-siebert@tamu.edu,,,,,,,76,14,17,0,15,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

To understand the collective activities of a workforce separated by space and time, this paper describes a complexity science-based management framework for virtual organisations. Specific focus is on a South African virtual organisation as a complex adaptive system. A single, embedded case study strategy was followed, and multiple data sources used to generate theory. In this paper, results are reported that clarify the management of an organisation where technology replaces conventional face-to-face contexts for socialisation and assimilation. The paper shows how managers create a virtual context for sharing meaning and interaction through synergy, empowerment, participation and an accountable, committed workforce.","[Papastefanou, Nicolette] Tshwane Univ Technol, Dept Publ Relat & Business Commun, Pretoria, South Africa",Tshwane University of Technology,"Papastefanou, N (通讯作者)，Tshwane Univ Technol, Dept Publ Relat & Business Commun, Pretoria, South Africa.",papastefanoun@tut.ac.za,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,1,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,978-953-253-061-2,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2009,5.0,,,,,,319,+,,,,,,2,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BMP23,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273265800026,0

Kaplan and R.B. Kaiser and of their 360-degree feedback tool Leadership Versatility Index (LVI). Versatility can be generally defined as a mastery of opposites, as the ability to play multiple roles, even contradictory ones, without emphasizing some at the expense of others. The LVI has been designed to help managers understand their repertoire and how they can become more versatile leaders. It employs an innovative rating scale on which ideal score of 0 is in the middle of it (the right amount), flanked by underdoing to the left (tool ittle) and overdoing to the right (too much). The idea is to avoid the more is better design trap by providing a way for raters to indicate when managers go to counterproductive extremes. The LVI works with two-sided view of leadership based on two major pairs of opposites: Forceful and Enabling leadership and Strategic and Operational leadership. Interventions based on the LVI results help to overcome traditional behaviorism as they combine the outer work (behavioral change) with the inner work (personal change) of development Application of the LVI on a sample of the managers from Skoda Auto a.s. and verification of its practical value represent the core of the SAVS IGA project MM/07/02. The paper finishes with a presentation of the first findings from this project. It is possible to say already now that LVI can help Czech organizations and their management in many respects - i.e. it overcomes traditional primitive Darwinism in careers management; it has been well accepted by the managers, it stimulates their motivation for development and learning.","[Pavlica, Karel] Skoda Auto Univ, Inst Mng & Mkg, Tr V Klementa 869, Mlada Boleslav 29360, Czech Republic; [Kaiser, Robert B.] Kaplan DeVries Inc, Greensboro, NC 27455 USA; [Jarosova, Eva] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Prague 13200 3, Czech Republic",Skoda Auto University; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Pavlica, K (通讯作者)，Skoda Auto Univ, Inst Mng & Mkg, Tr V Klementa 869, Mlada Boleslav 29360, Czech Republic.",karel.pavlica@skoda-auto.cz; rkaiser@kaplendevries.com; evajar@vse.cz,,,,,,,8,1,1,1,6,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-523-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,284,+,,,,,,2,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BMK17,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272657000032,0

This is one of the most important risks carried by banks especially in the current context of the international financial crisis. There are not many books which treat in detail this type of risk; generally they focus on interest rate and foreign exchange risk. The bank's management should assure that these risks are effectively managed, that appropriate regulations are established in order to control and limit these risks. This is the task of the Asset/Liability Management Committee (ALCO).

The internal control of enterprises is of great significance to responding to antidumping, which is a battle of accounting and cost and more a test of the effectiveness of enterprise internal control.

It has had a significant impact on the decrease of growth and employment rate and the decrease of production and exports.

We analyse a four-year household panel data set of frozen pizza purchases of 14,000 households in Germany to study differences in consumers' repurchasing behaviour between national brands and private labels. We consider dynamic aspects of repurchase behaviour as well as household characteristics applying a hazard approach.

Because debt can shield a firm's revenue from the threat of transaction partner with strong bargaining power, a firm can decides its capital structure according to upstream & downstream firm's bargaining power. Based on it, this paper makes the hypothesis that a firm's debt level is positively related to its upstream & downstream firm's bargaining power. Furthermore, we choose a set of China's listed companies as research sample, treats the numbers of upstream & downstream firms as the proxy variable for the bargaining power, then conduct an empirical research using static model and dynamic adjust model respectively. It was found that (1) If the product market competition intensity is controlled, a firm's financial leverage is obviously correlates negatively with the numbers of upstream & downstream firms, and the more the number of firms in an industry, the stronger the negative correlation; (2)a firm's capital structure adjusts dynamically according to its upstream & downstream firm's bargaining power. The more the upstream & downstream enterprises bargaining power decreased, the less deviation of a firm's capital structure from the target level.","[Wu Gang] Shenzhen Polytech, Fac Construct, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China",Shenzhen Polytechnic University,,szwug@163.com; xlpsyhn@gmail.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,M D FORUM,ALLAWAH NSW,"17 AUGUSTA ST, ALLAWAH NSW, 2218, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9806854-2-8,,,,2009,,,,,,,1118,1124,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BPO33,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279533000137,0

We found that intrinsic motivation can exert significant incentive effect to the agent's behavior, which can improve the agent's effort. We argue that the need to motivate workers may make it beneficial for a self-interested, short-sighted manager to pursue the long-term viability of a firm. When the firm is in a stable environment, this implicit control mechanism may not contradict shareholder value maximization. However, when the firm needs restructuring, this mechanism diminishes firm value. We discuss when external governance is desirable, and when it is not. Our model also offers economic explanations for some related issues in managerial behavior, such as restructuring aversion and excessive risk aversion.","[Wu Yong; Zhu Weidong] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Management, Hefei 230009, Peoples R China",Hefei University of Technology,,wuyong@hfut.edu.cn,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,1,M D FORUM,ALLAWAH NSW,"17 AUGUSTA ST, ALLAWAH NSW, 2218, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9806854-2-8,,,,2009,,,,,,,1388,1395,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BPO33,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279533000173,0

This approach allows us to employ volatility estimators that achieve very low Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSEs) compared to other estimators that have been proposed to deal with market microstructure noise at high frequencies. Furthermore, this price series decomposition allows us to estimate the variance covariance matrix of n assets in a more efficient way than the methods so far proposed in the literature.

An important extension to this rule is the assumption of a forward-looking behaviour of central banks. Now they are assumed to target expected inflation and output gap instead of current values of these variables. Using a forward-looking monetary policy reaction function, this paper analyses whether central banks' monetary policy can indeed be described by a linear Taylor rule or, instead, by a nonlinear rule. It also analyses whether that rule can be augmented with a financial conditions index containing information from some asset prices and financial variables. The results indicate that the monetary behaviour of the European Central Bank and Bank of England is best described by a nonlinear rule, but the behaviour of the Federal Reserve of the United States can be well described by a linear Taylor rule. Our evidence also suggests that only the European Central Bank is reacting to financial conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Useful information about demand elasticity at a given point on the envelope function can be recovered from the hedonic regression and limited information on marginal costs. In particular, the elasticity of the envelope with respect to any characteristic such as interior area provides information on the elasticity of demand. Relative price elasticities (i.e., elasticities that vary from a base value in a known way with interior area, unit type or neighborhood characteristics) can be computed from the elasticity of the hedonic envelope. Like Yinger (2010), our method is based on a single hedonic equation. We test our method using sales of new high rise condominiums in two districts within Shenzhen, China: Futian and Longgang. The results strongly confirm the main hypothesis of this paper: price elasticity with respect to size is increasing for more complex types of units. Together with estimates of marginal costs of production, these results imply that relative demand elasticity is declining for larger, more complex units. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Bivariate cointegration analysis indicates that the fund NAV respond to HSI and CPI, but not respond to M2 and HIBOR; while multivariate cointegration analysis adds further evidence that the fund NAV are cointegrated with a set of these macroeconomic variables. The fund NAV is found to be Granger caused by HSI, CPI, and M2; however, HIBOR does not have any Granger causal relations with the fund NAV. A multivariate error correction model (ECM) of each fund's NAV on all macroeconomic variables is finally constructed, which adds further evidence that fund price is not causal related with HIBOR. This suggests that any movements in selected macroeconomic variables can be used to predict the movement of NAV and the MPF scheme participants may ignore the effects of changes in interest rates on the changes in NAV when they consider reallocating the distribution between equity funds and other types of funds.

We derive the optimal cooperative fiscal response to a global liquidity trap in a two country world economy. Surprisingly, we find that the optimal fiscal spending response for a partner country to a negative aggregate demand shock in a source country may be negative. If fiscal policy can be chosen under policy commitment, the optimal response involves current fiscal expansion combined with future fiscal contraction, after the liquidity trap has ended. J.

The paper explains this phenomenon. We argue that the fragile nature of the capital structure of hedge funds, combined with low market liquidity, creates a risk of coordination in redemptions among hedge fund investors that severely limits hedge funds' arbitrage capabilities. We present a model of hedge funds' optimal asset allocation in the presence of coordination risk among investors. We show that hedge fund managers behave conservatively and even abstain from participating in the market once coordination risk is factored into their investment decisions. The model suggests a new source of limits to arbitrage. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Finally, a large scale empirical analysis using individual stock options and options on an index is performed comparing the estimated prices from discrete time models to the corresponding continuous time model prices.

The literature has paid limited attention to this issue so far. Employing a multivariate regression analysis with monthly data from 2000 to 2009, the impact of LCCs on tourism demand to a popular destination in Korea, Jeju Island, is examined, focusing on two specific questions: Have LCCs generated new tourism demand and brought more tourism revenue into the island's economy? Have LCCs mitigated tourism seasonality on the island? Controlling for the effects of a number of factors, results showed that LCCs have generated new demand in addition to existing tourist flows to the island. Korean LCCs accounted for 35% of total passengers in 2009, which indicates an average growth rate of 161.7% over the last 4 years, compared to a -0.3% growth rate for all full-service carriers in Korea. However, LCCs seem to have had little impact on reducing seasonal fluctuations in passenger traffic to Jeju Island. The findings of this study will be of interest to researchers, policy makers, and a variety of stakeholders in the tourism industry interested in the relationship between no-frills airlines and island economies.

While Harvey sees ABD as an economic process of over-accumulated capital finding new outlets, I argue that it is an extra-economic process of coercive expropriation typically exercised by states to help capitalist overcome barriers to accumulation - in this case, the absence of fully capitalist rural land markets. In India's privately developed SEZs, the accumulation generated by this dispossession - which represents the disaccumulation of the peasantry - occurs through capitalist rentiers who develop rural land for mainly IT companies and luxury real estate, and profit from the appreciation of artificially cheap land acquired by the state. While such development has only minimally and precariously absorbed the labour of dispossessed farmers, it has generated a peculiar agrarian transformation through land speculation that has enlisted fractions of the rural elite into a chain of rentiership, drastically amplified existing class and caste inequalities, undermined food security and, surprisingly, fuelled non-productive economic activity and pre-capitalist forms of exploitation.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Sociol, Berkeley, CA 94705 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Levien, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Sociol, 410 Barrows Hall, Berkeley, CA 94705 USA.",mlevien@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,64,155,170,2,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

A standard mean-adjusted returns model as well as the GJR-GARCH specification point towards underreaction to negative events in the medium and small capitalization indices. Also, the pre-event coefficients are generally negative and statistically significant, regardless of the sign of the shock, thus ruling out information leaks. We uncover a stable abnormal volatility pattern which increases monotonically a few days before the shock before suddenly decreasing in magnitude on the event day and beyond. We suggest uncertainty avoidance as a potential explanation of these features. The results are fairly robust across alternative event selection procedures, time, and size-conditioned shocks.

First, managers who believe that their firm is undervalued view external financing as overpriced, especially equity financing. Such overconfident managers use less external finance and, conditional on accessing external capital, issue less equity than their peers. Second, CEOs who grew up during the Great Depression are averse to debt and lean excessively on internal finance. Third, CEOs with military experience pursue more aggressive policies, including heightened leverage. Complementary measures of CEO traits based on press portrayals confirm the results.","[Malmendier, Ulrike] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Malmendier, Ulrike] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Tate, Geoffrey] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Malmendier, U (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,"Malmendier, Ulrike/0000-0002-2786-4365",,,,,56,757,880,39,486,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

This paper presents new empirical evidence for asymmetry in the exchange rates volatility of major currencies against the US dollar, which have bilateral nature. Interestingly, the asymmetry of Japanese yen is the opposite of that of others and the global financial crisis highlights the opposite asymmetry. Some of traditional hypotheses, such as the leverage effect and the volatility feedback effect, do not adequately explain these findings; however, a significant asymmetric herding effect is observed and appears to be time-varying. Further, the clear link between asymmetric herding and volatility strongly supports the hypothesis of the asymmetric herding effect. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from Japanese policy changes Although education voucher programs for students attending private high schools have existed in Japan for decades, to date there have been no studies that examine their effectiveness. In this study, we estimate the programs' preventative effect on dropout by using school-track level (academic or vocational) panel data covering all high schools in northern Japan. Prefectural governments have faced increasing dropout rates stemming from financial difficulties, and expanded the scope and amount of their private high school tuition support programs since the late 1990s. We use this variation to identify the effect of tuition support on students' dropout decisions, controlling for initial academic ability of students entering the schools and unobservable school-track effects. We also apply the instrumental variable method to account for the possible endogeneity of policy changes. Our results suggest that increasing tuition support is particularly effective in preventing the dropout of private high school students on nonacademic tracks. J. Japanese Int.

These revised MSI are available at five levels of aggregation, including a new broad level of aggregation that includes all of the assets currently reported on the Federal Reserve's H.6 statistical release. Several aspects of the new MS] differ from those previously published. One such change is that the checkable and savings deposit components of the MSI are now adjusted for the effects of retail sweep programs, beginning in 1994. Another change is that alternative MSI are provided using two alternative benchmark rates. In addition, the authors have simplified the procedure used to construct the own rate of return for small-denomination time deposits and have discontinued the previous practice of applying an implicit return to some or all demand deposits. The revised indexes begin in 1967 rather than 1960 because of data limitations.","[Anderson, Richard G.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA; [Jones, Barry E.] SUNY Binghamton, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Res Dept, Minneapolis, MN USA; Lund Univ, Dept Econ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton; Federal Reserve System - USA; Lund University,"Anderson, RG (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Management, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",,"Jones, Barry/HRE-2456-2023","Jones, Barry/0009-0000-5180-3231",,,,,62,32,34,0,9,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

By examining the effects of dividend policies on 475 British firms existing between 1895 and 1905, and consequently operating in an environment of very low taxation with an absence of institutional constraints, we find strong support for asymmetric information theories of dividend policy, and little support for agency models.

The interest stems from the increasing weight economists assign to corruption when explaining economic growth. A great deal of the research focuses on how political institutions influence perceptions of corruption. We move this debate in a new direction by addressing a previously ignored dimension: ideological polarization. We contend perceptions of corruption are determined not only by specific institutional features of the political system-such as elements of voting systems, ballot structures, or separation of powers-but by who sits at the controls. We employ panel data from a broad variety of countries to test our theoretical argument. Contrary to recent findings by both economists and political scientists, we show that ideological polarization predicts perceptions of corruption. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Our results show that on average mortgage rates respond more quickly to changes in the cost of funds than base business lending rates. We also find an asymmetry in the initial (short-run) response of banks to changes in funding costs: in particular, our results show banks adjust mortgage rates downwards faster than upwards. The speed to which lending rates revert back to their equilibrium relationship with funding costs varies across the lending markets. We find the adjustment speed is faster when mortgage rates are below equilibrium, whereas it is slower when business lending rates are above long-run levels in relation to funding costs. Our analysis suggests that banks prefer the plain-vanilla type of lending such as mortgages in comparison to small business lending consistent with asymmetric information associated with business loans.

This study examines a proposal to apply this strategy to small-scale farmers in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), using soybeans as feedstock for biodiesel production. First, it is argued that value-adding cooperatives established under South Africa's current Cooperatives Act, No. 14 of 2005 (hereafter the Cooperatives Act) would fail to attract the capital and expertise needed to process biodiesel owing to ill-defined voting and benefit rights. Second, a mixed integer linear programming model is used to determine the viability of producing biodiesel from soybeans, viewed from the perspective of the smallholder as grower and co-owner of the processing plant. It is concluded that smallholder participation would require a rental market for cropland, co-ownership of the processing plant in a non-traditional cooperative or investor-owned firm, information and training, and a high level of government subsidy.","[Sparks, G.

Politically Motivated Allocation of Program Benefits and the New Fertilizer Subsidies,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Africa; Ghana; fertilizer; subsidy; politics,INDIA,Fertilizer subsidies have been reinstituted in many African countries with innovations seeking to avoid the downsides of past programs. The new subsidy paradigm however does not address how to curtail political manipulation which exacerbated inefficiencies of previous programs. This paper analyzes whether politics affected voucher allocations in Ghana's 2008 fertilizer subsidy program. We find that more vouchers were targeted to districts that the ruling party had lost in the previous presidential elections and more so in districts that had been lost by a higher percentage margin. This evidence shows that a significant threat to the efficiency of fertilizer subsidies remains. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

More specifically, using the Local Whittle estimator and its variants we examine whether relative per capita CO2 emissions are fractionally integrated, that is they are long memory processes which, although highly persistant, may revert to the mean/trend in the long run. Our results suggest that CO2 emissions within 13 out of 18 OECD countries are indeed fractionally integrated implying that they converge over time, albeit slowly. Interestingly though, the countries whose emissions are not found to be fractionally integrated are some of the highest polluters within the OECD, at least in per capita terms.

The results show that residential density, land use diversity and proximity of facilities influence daily travelled distances when these variables are measured in the immediate vicinity of the residential location of the respondent (within a radius of 1 km). When aggregating these variables at a larger geographical scale, in most cases the impact proves no longer significant. Variables based on the spatial distribution of jobs, or on the global accessibility of the entire population in the study area, do not show any significant effects on the travel distance. Despite the statistical significance only a fraction of the observed variance in reported distances is explained by characteristics of spatial proximity. However, we can assume that the importance of spatial structure in the genesis of mobility patterns will increase in case the cost of transport would rise (cf. peak oil). For this reason, the application of the mapped results of the proposed model could contribute to the practice of sustainable spatial planning. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In the meantime, global economic integration has made it easier to ignore the agrarian roots of violent conflict in Mindanao, enabling national and sub-national actors, including the international community and the Muslim or Moro separatists, to dismiss the issue of agrarian justice. We counter these arguments by using an agrarian political economy framework to uncover the roots of resilient violence in Mindanao, using historical narratives of the region from the end of the nineteenth century that accentuate the links between state-making, control of land and labour, and processes of agrarian modernization. We emphasize the critical role played by the Muslim landed elites who shaped processes of state-making by brokering the interests of their clans with exogenous actors at the national and international level. We shed light on emerging state policies and competing interests among other landed and agribusiness elites that resulted in the spread of a parallel underground economy, renewing opportunities for violence and crime within semi-autonomous social worlds.","[Vellema, Sietze] Wageningen Univ, Technol & Agrarian Dev Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Borras, Saturnino M., Jr.] Erasmus Univ Rotterdam ISS, Int Inst Social Studies, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands; [Lara, Francisco, Jr.] Philippine Social Sci Ctr PSSC, Alert Int UK, Quezon City 1104, Philippines; [Lara, Francisco, Jr.] London Sch Econ, Crisis States Res Ctr, London WC2A 2AE, England",Wageningen University & Research; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Vellema, S (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Technol & Agrarian Dev Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",sietze.vellema@wur.nl; borras@iss.nl; F.Lara-jr@lse.ac.uk,"Vellema, Sietze/I-6862-2013","Vellema, Sietze/0000-0002-6476-4558",,,,,89,39,44,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

When banks have relative expertise in employing risky assets, the market for these assets clears only at fire-sale prices following a large number of bank failures. The gains from acquiring assets at fire-sale prices make it attractive for banks to hold liquid assets. The resulting choice of bank liquidity is countercyclical, inefficiently low during economic booms but excessively high during crises. We present evidence consistent with these predictions. While interventions to resolve banking crises may be desirable ex post, they affect bank liquidity in subtle ways: Liquidity support to failed banks or unconditional support to surviving banks reduces incentives to hold liquidity, whereas support to surviving banks conditional on their liquid asset holdings has the opposite effect.","[Acharya, Viral V.] NYU, Stern Sch Business, Dept Finance, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Shin, Hyun Song] Princeton Univ, Bendheim Ctr Finance, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Yorulmazer, Tanju] Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA",New York University; Princeton University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York,"Acharya, VV (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, Dept Finance, 44 W 4th St,Room 9-84, New York, NY 10012 USA.",vacharya@stern.nyu.edu; hsshin@princeton.edu; Tanju.Yorulmazer@ny.frb.org,"Acharya, Viral V./HCH-4349-2022",,,,,,64,115,140,3,59,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Following a long period of steady (and at times quite rapid) growth beginning in the early twentieth century, real spending on public agricultural R&D has essentially flat lined since the 1970s. There has also been an erratic pattern of funding per scientist and a loss of scientific personnel in recent decades. Notably, South Africa has lost ground relative to its competitors in international commodity markets, such as the United States (US) and Australia in terms of the intensity of investment in agricultural R&D. In the absence of changes to these trends, these developments may well have enduring, and detrimental, consequences for the productivity performance and competitiveness of South African agriculture. They deserve serious policy attention as the twenty-first century unfolds, with a firm eye to the long-run given the lengthy lags (often many decades) that typify the relationship between public agricultural R&D spending and productivity growth.","[Liebenberg, F.] Agr Res Council, Pretoria, South Africa; [Pardey, P.

The purpose of this paper is to re-examine the acquisition versus greenfield versus exporting question under fixed versus free entry assumptions for local firms. Our finding is that greenfield entry and exporting options are more attractive relative to acquisition when the local market structure adjusts to foreign entry through local entry or exit than when it is fixed. With respect to welfare in the host economy, existing theory models and policy discussions maintain that the effects of greenfield versus acquisition entry differ substantially. We show that under free entry and exit, there is no difference between the two for consumer surplus, but acquisition improves welfare a little through rent extraction by the local acquired firm. Thus the existing conventional wisdom may be leading to inappropriate policy choices by host governments.","[Markusen, James] Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Markusen, James] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Staehler, Frank] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Econ, CESifo, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University College Dublin; University of Wurzburg; Ifo Institut,"Markusen, J (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",James.Markusen@colorado.edu; frank.staehler@uni-wuerzburg.de,,,,,,,30,28,28,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

This was called the time-saving bias by Svenson (2008) which describes that time savings following speed increases of high speeds are overestimated relative to time savings following increases of low speeds. The present contribution tested the hypothesis that the time-saving bias would predict unaided decisions about productivity. The results showed that the predicted bias distorted decisions both when productivity increase of a factory was measured in units produced per hour and when it was measured in number of units produced per man-year. When productivity was increased from an initial low production speed, the relative gain (e.g., in number of less workers needed for the same production) was underestimated in comparison with gains obtained when productivity was increased from an initial high productivity.

We argue that the needs of this clientele and the inadequacies of existing legal and financial system create an opportunity for reputable stock exchanges to play the role of an information and reputation intermediary and in so doing allow exchanges to leverage on their reputation capital to compete more effectively for the growing business from the emerging and developing economies. We contribute further by developing a parsimonious model to analyze the interaction between an exchange playing the new role and firms seeking to list their equity on the exchange. We show that a subgame perfect equilibrium is obtained and provide an explanation for the spike in delisting in the latter half of 2007.

Conduit lenders, who originate loans for direct sale into securitization markets, mitigate problems of asymmetric information and adverse selection in loan sales. Our theory provides an explanation for the pricing puzzle observed in CMBS markets, whereby conduit CMBS loans are priced higher than portfolio loans, despite widespread belief that conduit loans are originated at lower quality. Consistent with theoretical predictions of a lemons discount, our empirical analysis of 141 CMBS deals and 16,760 CMBS loans shows that, after controlling for observable determinants of loan pricing, conduit loans enjoyed a 34 basis points pricing advantage over portfolio loans in the CMBS market.

We bridge this gap by comparing the welfare of a host country from vertical foreign direct investment (VFDI) vis-a-vis international outsourcing. Our model finds that the ability to maximize welfare in the alternative modes of organizing offshore production is contingent on the absorptive capacity of the host country. If a host country's absorptive capacity is above a critical threshold, outsourcing is more welfare enhancing vis-a-vis VFDI; while even with an absorptive capacity lower than this critical threshold, outsourcing being welfare improving over VFDI cannot be ruled out.","World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Goswami, AG (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",agrover1@worldbank.org,,,,,,,32,5,5,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1363-6669,,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Finally, minimizing liquidity's influence on the estimated idiosyncratic volatility, by orthogonalizing the percentage of zero-return and spread effects on the estimated idiosyncratic volatility, demonstrates that the resulting idiosyncratic volatility estimate has little pricing ability.","[Lesmond, David] Tulane Univ, Freeman Sch Business, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Han, Yufeng] Univ Colorado, Denver, CO 80202 USA",Tulane University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver,"Lesmond, D (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Freeman Sch Business, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",Yufeng.Han@ucdenver.edu; dlesmond@tulane.edu,,,,,,,38,105,117,5,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Whereas firms in economically and technologically stable environments could apparently follow conventional wisdom when trying to reduce moral hazard through tight supervision and incentive packages, the increasingly innovative and competitive environment is pushing firms to follow human resource practices that explicitly and consciously make managers more vulnerable to opportunistic conducts. We explain this paradox through a generalization of Akerlof and Yellen's fair-wage-effort hypothesis. We argue there is a tradeoff between the effort that firms can capture from their workers (controllable effort) and the level of discretionary effort that employees can offer, upon which the particular excellence and innovative performance of the firm relies. We test our proposition on a wide dataset composed of 2882 workers. After controlling for several firm and industry traits, evidence confirms the potential role of moral hazard as an opportunity for excellence at work.","[Arocena, Pablo; Villanueva, Mikel] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Gest Empresas, Pamplona 31006, Navarra, Spain; [Arevalo, Raquel; Vazquez, Xose H.] Univ Vigo, REDE, Vigo, Spain; [Arevalo, Raquel; Vazquez, Xose H.] Univ Vigo, Dept Business Management, Vigo, Spain",Universidad Publica de Navarra; Universidade de Vigo; Universidade de Vigo,"Arocena, P (通讯作者)，Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Gest Empresas, Campus Arrosadia, Pamplona 31006, Navarra, Spain.",pablo@unavarra.es; mikel.villanueva@unavarra.es; arevalo@uvigo.es; xhvv@uvigo.es,"Vázquez, Xosé H./AAC-3466-2019; Arocena, Pablo/K-6375-2017; Arévalo, Raquel/ABH-4657-2020","Vázquez, Xosé H./0000-0002-2919-7404; Arocena, Pablo/0000-0002-4035-4597; Arévalo, Raquel/0000-0001-7474-0245",,,,,40,10,12,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

This paper examines the relationships between adverse liquidity shocks on main developed-country banking systems to emerging markets across Europe, Asia, and Latin America, isolating loan supply from loan demand effects. Loan supply in emerging markets was significantly affected through three separate channels: a contraction in direct, cross-border lending by foreign banks; a contraction in local lending by foreign banks' affiliates in emerging markets; and a contraction in loan supply by domestic banks resulting from the funding shock to their balance sheet induced by the decline in interbank, cross-border lending. Policy interventions, such as the Vienna Initiative introduced in Europe, influenced the lending channel effects on emerging markets of head office balance sheet shocks. Moreover, openness to international funding was not the main vehicle of propagation. Rather, it was exposure to international funding from source country banking systems that were ex ante more likely to suffer from the liquidity shock.

As a result of their greater ability to diversify idiosyncratic risk in the capital market, public firms' owners tolerate higher profit variability than owners of private firms. Consequently, public firms adopt riskier and more aggressive output market strategies than private firms, which improves the competitive position of the former vis-a-vis the latter. This strategic benefit of being public, and thus, the proportion of public firms in an industry, is shown to be positively related to the degree of competitive interaction among firms in the output market, to demand uncertainty, and to the idiosyncratic port ion of this uncertainty.

This paper augments the existing literature with a comprehensive analysis of postbankruptcy borrowing using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances. We find that filers generally have more limited access to unsecured credit, but borrow more secured debt after bankruptcy, than comparable households that have never filed for bankruptcy. Filers also pay higher interest rates on all types of debt. In addition, as more time passes after filing, credit access and borrowing costs improve. However, filers remain more prone than comparable nonfilers to experience financial distress, accumulate less wealth, and use expensive credit sources like payday loans, even more than 10 years after filing.","[Han, Song] Fed Reserve Board, Capital Markets Sect, Washington, DC USA; [Li, Geng] Fed Reserve Board, Household & Real Estate Finance Sect, Washington, DC USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Han, S (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board, Capital Markets Sect, Washington, DC USA.",Song.Han@frb.gov; Geng.Li@frb.gov,,,,,,,36,53,60,2,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Using a multilevel model allows estimation of the effects of state and local policies on earnings and of variation in the effects of sexual orientation across local labor markets. The results suggest that gay men face an earnings penalty that varies significantly (though not sizably) across local areas, and that state antidiscrimination policies may decrease that penalty in private sector employment. There is, however, no evidence that lesbians in any sector average higher earnings or wages in areas with antidiscrimination policies. The strongest evidence of effects for antidiscrimination policies is for weeks of employment and for gay men who are in the private sector, white, and in the upper half of the earnings distribution.

Second, to study differences in psychological distress between the poor and the relatively wealthy in Latin America. Third. to study how economic growth impacts the psychological well-being of the poor. This paper uses micro-level information from the Gallup 2007 Survey for 16 Latin American countries to study psychological distress of the poor in Lain America: the survey is representative at the country level. The investigation works with approximately 12,500 observations. Psychological distress is measured on the basis of a set of questions regarding a person's emotional situation the day before he/she answered the questionnaire. The investigation finds out that the poor show greater psychological distress than the wealthy and that the gap is statistically significant. However, it would be inappropriate to attempt predicting a person's psychological well-being on the basis of his/her poverty condition alone, since many factors affect people's psychological well-being. The paper also shows that rapid economic growth seems to be detrimental to the psychological well-being of the poor, and that the impact of economic growth on psychological well-being differs between the poor and the relatively wealthy.

Three agents influence the wildlife stock: a parks agency determines hunting quotas, outside poachers hunt illegally, and a local community may choose to protect wildlife by discouraging poaching. Wildlife generates revenues from hunting licenses and tourism; it also intrudes on local agriculture. We consider two benefit-sharing regimes: shares of wildlife tourism rents and shares of hunting licenses. Resource sharing does not necessarily improve community welfare or incentives for wildlife conservation. Results depend on the exact design of the benefit shares, the size of the benefits compared with agricultural losses, and the way in which the parks agency manages hunting quotas.","[Fischer, Carolyn] Resources Future RFF, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Muchapondwa, Edwin] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa; [Sterner, Thomas] Gothenburg Univ, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden",Resources for the Future; University of Cape Town; University of Gothenburg,"Fischer, C (通讯作者)，Resources Future RFF, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",fischer@rff.org; Edwin.muchapondwa@uct.ac.za; Thomas.Sterner@economics.gu.se,"Fischer, Carolyn/M-4362-2016; Sterner, Thomas/AGZ-2537-2022; Fischer, Carolyn/JCD-8689-2023","Fischer, Carolyn/0000-0001-6179-1377; Muchapondwa, Edwin/0000-0002-3400-7548",,,,,28,41,48,1,49,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Yet, the measurement of the ways in which such groups differ and are unequal remains underdeveloped. Accordingly, this paper introduces three distinct but interlinked concepts relating to inequality between groups which can be used in empirical estimation of group based inequality. We define and discuss the concepts of representational inequality, sequence inequality, and group inequality comparison. Representational inequality captures the extent to which a given level of attribute is shared between members of distinct groups, sequence inequality captures the extent to which groups are ordered hierarchically in their possession of the attribute and group inequality comparison captures the extent to which differences between groups account for the overall inequality of individuals. These concepts can be used to measure the degree of segregation, clustering, and polarization between groups. In order to illustrate the merit of these concepts and their joint application to understanding group based inequality we provide an example using Demographic and Health Surveys data for five societies. It may be seen that the choice of measures is greatly consequential in applied work. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, we demonstrate that informational asymmetries may not translate into a financing hierarchy or pecking order over securities.

The aim of this study is to gain a better understanding of how Corporate Social Responsibility is incorporated in medium sized enterprise operations by focusing on how these companies describe, integrate and monitor Corporate Social Responsibility and how they allocate financial resources for it. In order to shed light on this issue, three case studies were conducted in the Bamberg-Forcheim Region of Germany. Documentation and interviews were used as data collection methods for this study. The conclusions drawn from the findings of this study include the following: the working methods of medium sized enterprises regarding Corporate Social Responsibility are new and therefore not yet established. Corporate Social Responsibility is not yet considered an important part of medium sized enterprise operations. Neither are enterprises very eager to implement and monitor this concept because of the high investment of time and finances involved. Businesses prefer to concentrate on their employees (training, social activities, extra-work activities etc) rather than to integrate, monitor and allocate resources for Corporate Social Responsibility.","[Serban, Viorica] Bosch Rexroth AG, Hassfurt, Germany; [Serban, Viorica; Kaufmann, Malte] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Kaufmann, Malte] Kaufmann Immobilien, Heidelberg, Germany",Bosch; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Serban, V (通讯作者)，Bosch Rexroth AG, Hassfurt, Germany.",viorica.serban@boschrexroth.de,,,,,,,29,5,5,0,23,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2011,13.0,29,,,,,180,194,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,710QA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000286525100013,0

As a key hindrance, this article considers gendered meanings of housework undertaken in male-headed households of Siem Reap, Cambodia. Encompassing cooking, cleaning and child-care as forms of unpaid labour performed in the home, the article uses in-depth interviews to reveal the differential discourses that men and women draw upon to explain current variances in the (non)-sharing of this work. It brings to the fore the diversity, and divergence, of meanings surrounding this everyday practice, discursive domains of domestic inequality which must inform future development interventions and programmes. Until such time that these underlying discourses are taken seriously in the development arena, the article argues that women's housework will remain largely tied to appeals to cultures, traditions and customs that guard against the 'cleaning up' of housework injustice.","Univ London, Dept Geog, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England",University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"Brickell, K (通讯作者)，Univ London, Dept Geog, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England.",katherine.brickell@rhul.ac.uk,,,,,,,40,27,31,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Within our framework the central bank is less efficient than private intermediaries at making loans but it has the advantage of being able to elastically obtain funds by issuing riskless government debt. Unlike private intermediaries, it is not balance sheet constrained. During a crisis, the balance sheet constraints on private intermediaries tighten, raising the net benefits from central bank intermediation. These benefits may be substantial even if the zero lower bound constraint on the nominal interest rate is not binding. In the event this constraint is binding, though, these net benefits may be significantly enhanced. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Monetary policy - expanding reserves by buying Treasuries - transfers all revenue from money creation directly to the fiscal authorities. Credit policy - selling Treasuries to fund loans or acquire non-Treasury securities - is debt-financed fiscal policy. Interest on reserves frees monetary policy to fund credit policy independently of interest rate policy. An ambiguous boundary of responsibilities between the Fed and the fiscal authorities contributed to economic collapse in fall 2008. Accord principles are proposed to clarify Fed credit policy powers and secure its independence on monetary and interest rate policy.

In this decade, the importance of ICT cannot be denied in every stage of work by individuals, businesses or organizations. Hence, services for ICT become critical activities that need to measure from time to time to ensure the quality and advantages of ICT usage. It was proven since many researches in the concern of service quality areas including ICTSQ had discussed about the assessment, measurement and improvement of services by proposing models or frameworks to improve the service quality. However, there is still a lack of providing a quantifiable approach to measure the ICTSQ since most of the previous researches had only focused on the initial stage of service quality and ICTSQ measurement. So far, most of them had only concern on analyzing and identifying various factors and attributes of service quality based on the particular context involved. Due to this problem, it has come to the significance of this study to develop relevance KPIs for measuring ICTSQ. This paper proposed a development of KPI as a quality measurement approach for ICT services (ICTS). KPI is suggested as well as the latest and effective measureable approach for measuring performance in many aspects and contexts including in the aspect of ICT. For measuring purposes, this study reviewed the ICTS scope and ICTSQ factors based on the context involved. The investigation is done within the context of Malaysian Universities (MUs). Interviews and surveys to ICTS stakeholders are conducted within the context to gather the empirical data. The KPI development framework is hoped to give ideas and guidelines for ICTSQ measurement.","[Haizan, Rozi Nor Nor; Abdul, Abdul Rahman] UTM, FSKSM, IS Dept, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Alinda, Rose Alias] UTM, Sch Grad Studies SPS, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Haizan, NRN (通讯作者)，UTM, FSKSM, IS Dept, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia.",rozinor@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,3,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9173-2,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,12.0,,,,,,274,279,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8ZM,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000392895700049,0

The activities were extracted from raw global positioning system (GPS) data collected in South Africa over a six-month period for more than 30,000 commercial vehicles. The analyses of the activity chains provide useful characteristics such as activity and chain durations, number of activities per chain, and the spatial extent of the activity chains. Key results indicate that about 60% of activity chains have between 5 and 15 activities per chain while 25% of the chains have 4 or less; 89% of the chains have a duration of 24 hours or less; and approximately 75% of all activities start between 08:00 and 17:00. The paper's contribution is twofold: it firstly demonstrates a methodology to extract and evaluate vehicle activities and activity chains from raw GPS data. Novel results and characteristics about transport geographies in Gauteng, the economic centre of South Africa, are presented. We also report on the sensitivity of the analyses to certain parameters.

E.",,,The Macroprudential Toolkit,IMF ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,EQUILIBRIUM,"Most treatments of financial regulation worry about threats to the banking system and the economy from defaults or credit crunches. This paper argues that the recent crisis points to fire sales through capital markets as another source of financial and economic instability. Accounting for fire sales implies several changes to the standard approach. First, if there are three channels of instability, then three regulatory tools are needed to deliver stability. Second, if only a single capital tool and a single liquidity tool are available, then there is a risk that using them pushes activity into the shadow banking system. Third, liquidity requirements on the asset side of bank balance sheets are conceptually different from liquidity requirements on the liability side. The paper starts with a review of the recent theoretical work on fire sales that farm the building blocks jar a next generation of models of the financial system. A summary of some evidence suggesting that fire sales were present in the crisis is offered. Next, the paper outlines a general equilibrium framework that can be used to think about A financial system in which default, credit crunches, and fire sales are all possible. The paper concludes with a discussion of the regulatory options and some speculation on how such a framework could be extended.

These indicators represent financial and non-financial efficiency of project activities. Among these, the monitoring of financial indicators is an important function of project management. Therefore, during the construction phase, it is the prime responsibility of project managers to monitor cost and avoid any overruns to maintain the cost baseline. Cost monitoring is an ongoing process and its importance cannot be undermined during the project life cycle. It can be monitored by using traditional approach of direct reporting of actual cost against budget. However, the comparison of budget versus actual spending does not indicate the worth of the work which is completed at any given time. This approach does not portray the true cost performance of the project. Because of these limitations, this paper discusses the applications of Earned Value Analysis (EVA) for cost management of construction projects in Malaysia. Besides traditional approach, EVA is a three-dimensional technique that compares the budgeted value of work scheduled with the earned value of physical work completed and the actual cost of work completed. Therefore, cost management by EVA is an objective measure of actual work performed. This paper uses a case study, an example application of EVA as a cost monitoring tool. This case study reaffirms the benefits of using EVA for project cash flow analysis and forecasting.","[Khamidi, Mohd Faris; Khan, Waris Ali; Idrus, Arazi] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Civil Engn, Tronoh 31750, Perak, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Petronas,,mfaris_khamidi@petronas.com.my; alwaris2002@yahoo.com; arazi_idrus@petronas.com.my,"Khamidi, Mohd Faris/AAE-1023-2020",,,,,,7,0,0,0,20,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8720-9,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,4.0,,,,,,129,133,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX59,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303217400026,0

We analyze the intra-day behaviour of option bid-ask spreads and find that cross-listing has a differential impact on spreads, affecting quoted but not effective spreads under oligopoly. We also find that the impact of the change in structure on effective spreads comes mostly from an increase in limit orders and is consistent with a switch from Cournot to Bertrand-type strategic behaviour for such orders. We conclude that market structure effects within an options exchange are enough to realize most of the benefits of inter-market competition even in the context of market thinness.

Due to the long-term systematic manipulation of interest rates, within the operational framework of the stabilization of consumer prices and the output gap, as well as of anti-deflationary fundamentalism, the economy can transform itself into a kind of black box, gradually and over time causing an escape of credit and monetary aggregates. Money supply tends to be more endogenous and elastic, changing the causality within a link between the money supply and its effective economic materialization, both in production processes of the real economy as well as in banking and financial services. Thereby, the economy lacks a needful defensive mechanism that would pull the overheating economy back through more exogenous and inelastic money supply, automatically adjusting market interest rates. In the empirical part we employed VECM tests to show that the money supply was exogenous before the implicit adoption of inflation targeting in the USA (1985), but endogenous after it.","[Munzi, Tomas; Hlavac, Petr] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Hlavac, Petr] Czech Natl Bank, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Czech National Bank,"Munzi, T (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",tomas.munzi@gmail.com; petr.hlavac@vse.cz,,,,,,,43,1,1,0,18,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

In that sense, national Supreme audit institutions have an important role and accountability. This paper considers several important topics about the accountability of governmental audit. The main goal of this research is to define and test main areas of national Supreme audit institutions' accountability. Paper shows that most of the EU countries ensure accountability of Supreme audit institution (SAI) using several mechanisms and here are presented these mechanisms and theirs main features. Authors test whether accountability of SAI is connected to the organisational type of SAI and the results shows that there is not the strong relationship between the SAI's organisational status and its accountability. Further, most of SAIs in the EU has financial and functional independence. SAIs prepare theirs draft annual budget of their own but, in most of the countries, Parliaments approve this budget. SAI's budget is a part of national budget. Results show that the most of SAIs in the EU can expend resources budged independently, as well. SAIs in the EU have functional independence in recruitment of their staff and in forming working plan. One part of the article considers state of independence and accountability of Croatian supreme audit institution in the comparison with the EU countries. Considering that Croatia is the EU candidate country, this comparison is the source of information of possible changes in the field of independence and accountability of Croatian national audit office. Also, this is a good overview for other non EU countries. Authors use several scientific research methods. Comparative method is used during comparison of 27 EU SAIs. Analysing some parts of governmental audit authors use an analysis method. Induction method is important in considering information about the countries and setting general conclusions about governmental audit in the EU; generalizing the observed behaviour and creating opinion about the possible changes of SAI in Croatia after its entry in the EU.","[Sacer, Ivana Mamic; Zager, Lajos; Sever, Ivana] Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,,imamic@efzg.hr; lzager@efzg.hr; isever@efzg.h,"Pavic, Ivana/H-7941-2018; Zager, Lajos/H-7750-2018; Mamic Sacer, Ivana/H-9069-2018","Pavic, Ivana/0000-0002-1597-3652; Zager, Lajos/0000-0001-5279-6504; Mamic Sacer, Ivana/0000-0001-9125-8637",,,,,5,0,0,0,9,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

Based on the contingency theory, value for money is abroad term that captures both elements of financial and non-financial aspects in the evaluation. Several diverse approaches to assess value for money had been applied in different countries. Nevertheless, value for money assessment method has been criticised on numerous grounds with respects to: accuracy of risk transfer; discount rate methodology; limitation scope of non financial and consideration of long term evaluation. For these reasons, the research aim is to draw a complete value for money assessment methods (financial and non-financial aspects) by means of 2 objectives (1) to investigate the criteria to be integrated in the evaluation of PPP bids for value for money, and (2) to identify the elements at each stage of PPP in the value for money assessment process. This research uses a postal questionnaire technique conducted among all public private partnership stakeholders (public and private sectors) in Malaysia. In total 216 valid responses were received, constituting a response rate of 23.6%. The results were analysed by descriptive and analytical statistical analysis. The results revealed that the six criteria of Public Private Partnership bids for value for money are: optimum whole life cost; innovation in operation; fit for purpose; comprehensive specification, compliance to time and innovation in technology. In addition, the respondents believed that financial and non-financial aspects are vital elements to be captured in the development of value for money assessment methods at each phase of PPP project life cycle.","[Takim, R.; Ismai, K.; Nawawi, A.

A number of activities and measures have been conducted to improve business environment, attract foreign and domestic investments, enable accelerated growth and the development of a real sector, enhance the level of competitiveness and productivity, and decrease unemployment. The reform of the financial system plays a significant role in the overall reform process. Thus, it is necessary to create a new regulatory framework based on European Union directives that provides a considerable level of security and protection for all participants in the financial market. This would create a fertile ground for modern trading and the implementation of new instruments in the national and international markets.

Kudumbashree operates through female-only Neighbourhood Groups, which aim to contribute to their participants' economic uplift, and to integrate them with the activities and institutions of local governance. As such, Kudumbashree echoes poverty alleviation programmes elsewhere in the Global South designed to link poverty alleviation to 'active citizenship'. This article evaluates the programme, looking in turn at its impacts on women's participation in public space, its attempts to engineer participatory citizenship through engagement with the local state, and the wider consequences of its particular linking of participation and poverty alleviation for processes of exclusion within Kerala. It argues that although the programme has undoubtedly been successful in its scale and in supporting women's public participation, questions remain over both the autonomy of the invited spaces' it has created, and the underlying vision of poverty alleviation it embodies.","[Williams, Glyn] Univ Sheffield, Dept Town & Reg Planning, Sheffield S10 1TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Thampi, Binitha V.] Indian Inst Technol, Madras 600036, Tamil Nadu, India; [Narayana, D.] Ctr Dev Studies, Trivandrum, Kerala, India; [Nandigama, Sailaja] Univ Wageningen, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Bhattacharyya, Dwaipayan] Ctr Studies Social Sci, Kolkata, W Bengal, India",University of Sheffield; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras; Wageningen University & Research,"Williams, G (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Town & Reg Planning, Sheffield S10 1TN, S Yorkshire, England.",glyn.williams@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Thampi, Binitha/0000-0001-8998-420X; Williams, Glyn/0000-0003-0293-5574",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/E021964/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/E021964/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,27,35,38,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Development of the global economy place requires the harmonization of accounting method that would lead to the creation of a single global worldwide used and acceptable accounting system. The European Commission decided to gradually harmonize the accounting and reporting system of the EU with the IAS/IFRS system, which is (together with US GAAP) worldwide applicable and acceptable accounting system. International financial reporting standard for small- and medium-sized entities (IFRS for SME) has been valid since 2009 and its purpose is to create the set of rules for financial reporting, which will balance the costs and benefits connected with their application. From the point of view of accounting entities, standard-setters on national accounting legislation and standard-setters of IFRS for SMEs, the harmonization of financial accounting in Europe face many issues. However, overcoming these obstacles would increase the usefulness of the final statements of small- and medium-sized entities. This paper presents original results of differences among IAS/IFRS full version for public traded companies and version for small- and medium-sized (non-public traded) entities. These differences were caused by abandoning alternative approaches for accounting policies and partial areas in simplified version for small- and medium-sized entities, simplification of bookkeeping methods, assessment and presentation.","[Zborkova, Jitka; Hinke, Jana] Univ W Bohemia, Plzen, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,,prochaz2@kfu.zcu.cz; hinke@kfu.zcu.cz,"; Hinke, Jana/C-7048-2016","Zborkova, Jitka/0000-0003-2716-1536; Hinke, Jana/0000-0001-6767-1253",,,,,11,4,4,0,11,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-6-9,,,,2011,,,,,,,1895,1903,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEO28,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000317550001076,0

The empirical analysis based on firm-level data from the Microdatabase Direct Investment provided by the Deutsche Bundesbank first signals the validity of the original Lintner model for cross-border intrafirm dividend payments of German affiliates abroad. Second, results imply that high dividend taxes indeed have a statistically significant negative effect on dividends repatriated. Our calculations suggest that a one-percentage-point decrease in the dividend tax rate would increase dividends repatriated by about 3.75%. Evaluated at the mean of positive dividend payments, a semielasticity of -1.71 is derived.","[Bellak, Christian] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Bellak, C (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Augasse 2-6, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",bellak@wu.ac.at,,,,,,,55,5,5,1,18,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,DEC,2010,66.0,4,,,,,350,383,,10.1628/001522110X540847,0.0,,,34,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,715SS,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000286908400002,0

Evidence from Unemployment Insurance,JOURNAL OF POLICY ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PARTICIPATION; PROGRAMS; RECEIPT; DETAILS; UNIONS; IMPACT,"Application inconvenience is one popular explanation for why many individuals do not receive the social benefits for which they are eligible. Applications take time and some individuals may decide that the financial benefits do not outweigh these time costs. This paper investigates this explanation using cross-state variation in administrative changes that made applying for unemployment insurance (UI) benefits substantially more convenient over the past decade. We find that the introduction of phone- and Internet-based claiming did not have an appreciable impact on overall UI take-up, nor did it lead to a shift toward recipients that are higher income or likely to be receiving the maximum benefit amount. These findings are inconsistent with a time- and transaction-cost explanation for low take-up, since remote UI claiming is less time intensive. This suggests that reducing application barriers alone may not be an effective tool for increasing program participation.

According to three national art market indices, built by hedonic regressions based on auction sales prices, the geometric annual returns are 10.00%, 5.70%. and 42.20% for Russia (1985-2008), China (1990-2008), and India (2002-2008), respectively. The Russian art market exhibits positive correlations with most common financial assets and a positive market beta, whereas the Chinese art market demonstrates a negative correlation overall and a negative market beta, and the Indian art index reveals a negative market beta and varying correlation results. Portfolio optimization under a power utility framework suggests limited diversification potential, but with a downside beta of 0.43, investing in Chinese art offers hedging potential during financial market downswings. Investigating the linkages between art and the economy through co-integration and causality analyses proves that emerging art markets share a significant long-term relation with other financial market instruments, but short-term relations are largely absent.

We contrast this perspective with the study of an ethnic Nigerian militia, the Oodua People's Congress (OPC). It appears that the success of this militia over time was jointly sustained by important preexisting social connections and numerous opportunities for economic gains.

Moreover, we document that industry investment experience lends legitimacy to lead VCs, allowing them to enter syndicate relationships to enhance their network positions. In general, greater industry experience is associated with more syndication.

Abnormal bond returns over a two-day event window that includes the downgrade (upgrade) are negative (positive) and statistically significant, although the reaction to upgrades is economically small. Monthly abnormal bond returns around downgrades and upgrades are statistically significant but overstate the magnitude of the reaction relative to two-day abnormal returns. Unlike the bond market, the stock market reaction to upgrades is statistically insignificant. Evidence suggests that the differing inferences on the effect of upgrades in the two markets can be attributed to wealth transfer effects rather than relative market inefficiencies. In the cross-section, the bond market response is stronger for rating changes that appear more surprising, rating changes of lower rated firms, and upgrades that move the firm from speculative grade to investment grade.

We extend CRS to a comprehensive sample of all NYSE firms and examine the dynamics between liquidity and market efficiency during informational periods. Our results indicate that although all NYSE firms experience an overall improvement in market efficiency across periods of different tick size regimes, this improvement varies significantly across the portfolios of sample companies formed on the basis of trading frequency, market capitalization, and trading volume. After controlling for these factors, we further document a positive association between a continuous measure of liquidity and market efficiency, and show that this effect is amplified during periods that contain new information, as reflected in high adverse selection component of the bid-ask spread.

Indeterminacy is due to a vacancy channel of monetary policy that makes inflation expectations self-fulfilling. The effect of this channel strengthens as the sluggishness of the adjustment of employment relative to that of consumption increases. When this relative sluggishness is high, the Taylor principle fails to ensure determinacy, regardless of whether the policy is forecast-based or outcome-based, whether it is strictly or flexibly inflation targeting, or contains policy rate smoothing.

But is it still possible to drive agricultural growth through small farms, as happened in the green revolution? Whether small farms have a future was debated at a workshop held in Wye, United Kingdom, in June 2005. It concluded that small farm development is not just desirable for poverty reduction, but also feasible, even in changing circumstances and particularly those of more concentrated supply chains with more demanding buyers. That said, while much that needs to be done is straightforward, such as provision of public goods, fostering the institutional innovations to allow small farmers to deal with the emerging supply chains will require patient work, tailored to specific circumstances. The future of all smallholders may well not lie in farming, but the measures to stimulate the rural nonfarm economy and provide jobs for those leaving fanning a favorable rural investment climate, provision of public goods, institutional development are largely the same as those for agricultural development as well.

Following extant literature in behavioral finance, we argue that a society's culture and the cultural distance between two markets play an important role in explaining the foreign bias. In particular, we hypothesize that the degree of a nation's uncertainty avoidance affects the foreign bias (more uncertainty-avoiding countries allocate less to foreign markets), as does the degree of a country's individualism (in individualistic countries performance is more directly attributed to a person and less to teams, causing these individuals to be more aggressive in their foreign asset allocations). We further expect that the degree of cultural distance between two countries affects the amount of money allocated to that market. Based on extensive robustness analyses, we find support for our hypotheses on the role of culture in international asset allocation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We link this fact to another one: the low geographical mobility rates in the South of Europe relative to the North. To interpret these facts, we build a model of local social capital and mobility. Investing in local ties is rational when workers do not expect to move to another region. We find that observationally close individuals may take different paths characterized by high local social capital, low mobility and high unemployment, vs. low social capital, high propensity to move and higher employment probability. Employment protection reinforces the accumulation of local social capital and thus reduces mobility.

Due to dramatic changes in the agricultural decision-making environment over the past 15 years, farmers have to realise that farming requires effective risk management. A successful farmer is one who can identify these risks, match them up with expected returns and make the best decision on future actions. The farmer must be able to look strategically into the future and position the business in a way that ensures long-term sustainability and survivability. To forecast effectively, it is vital for the agribusiness to predict the effects of various risks on the financial position of the business. This research attempts to develop a simulated dairy management model that can be used as a farm management tool. Normal distributions were used to simulate the movement of maize prices under different scenarios. This model was applied to a 2007 case study, and it was found to be a suitable tool for financial analysis and scenario planning. By utilising different sets of input values, the model gives an indication of the possibility of risks involved in different scenarios. However, the model is in a rather crude form, and further development should be undertaken to account for the interaction between variable inputs. The model highlights the importance of a change in strategic direction, while it is useful in analysing the scenario outcomes of new strategies.","[Malan, D. J.

The CF likelihood approximation does not integrate to 1; it is very close to 1 when in the center of the distribution but can differ markedly from 1 when far in the tails. We propose an MCMC algorithm that addresses the problems that arise when the CF approximation is applied in a Bayesian context. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated in a simulation study of the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross and Heston models and is applied to two well-known datasets.","[Stramer, Osnat] Univ Iowa, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Schneider, Paul] Warwick Business Sch, Warwick, England",University of Iowa; University of Warwick,"Stramer, O (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",osnat-stramer@uiowa.edu,,"Schneider, Paul/0000-0001-7069-7147",,,,,62,15,17,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

The balance sheet conditions of financial intermediaries provide a window on the macro risk premium. The tightness of intermediaries' balance sheet constraints determines their risk appetite,' which in turn, determines the set of real projects that receive funding, and hence determines the supply of credit. Monetary policy affects risk appetite by changing intermediaries' ability to leverage their capital. This paper estimates the time-varying risk appetite of financial intermediaries for the United States, Germany, United Kingdom, and Japan, and studies the joint dynamics of risk appetite with macroeconomic aggregates for the United States.

We find that various deal characteristics are major determinants of the cross-sectional variation in bondholder returns. In particular, a single private equity acquirer mitigates bondholder losses. On the other hand, bondholders have larger losses when a reputable buyout firm is involved in the deal. Bondholders experience losses in the 1980s and 2000s, but enjoy gains in the 1990s. Our findings remain robust to consideration of deal financing, relative cost of credit, and level of market overheating.

By applying daily data for 18 countries from May 25, 1988, through April 24, 2009, we find evidence of herding in advanced stock markets (except the US) and in Asian markets. No evidence of herding is found in Latin American markets. Evidence suggests that stock return dispersions in the US play a significant role in explaining the non-US market's herding activity. With the exceptions of the US and Latin American markets, herding is present in both up and down markets, although herding asymmetry is more profound in Asian markets during rising markets. Evidence suggests that crisis triggers herding activity in the crisis country of origin and then produces a contagion effect, which spreads the crisis to neighboring countries. During crisis periods, we find supportive evidence for herding formation in the US and Latin American markets. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We obtain theoretical predictions and, using the EVS dataset, we test them via latent class analysis to estimate the distribution of these behaviors across EU15.

However, non-representative surveys provide imprecise estimates of income, so quantifying poverty and inequality has been difficult. This paper estimates poverty and inequality using poverty mapping. In contrast to the previous studies, however, we use ethnicity rather than geography as a basis for disaggregation. We find that indigenous Chileans are indeed poorer, although we also find significant heterogeneity among ethnic groups. In addition, income inequality is generally lower for indigenous groups. These reliable estimates of poverty and inequality may improve the antipoverty targeting criteria used in Chile. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To do this, we use a dataset of about 350 Dutch insurers from all major lines of business during the pre-Solvency II period 1995-2005. We find that the levels of insurers' actual solvency margins are related to their risk characteristics and not to regulatory solvency requirements. Consequently, the vast majority of insurers hold much more capital than required, i.e. non-risk based capital requirements generally are not binding. Requirements are found to affect solvency adjustment behaviour, though. More specifically, below-target capital ratios are raised most rapidly by those insurers whose targets are relatively close to the regulatory minimum. One implication from our results is that, because insurers already follow a risk-based approach, the transition to the new European regulatory framework, Solvency II, is likely to be smooth.

This paper presents a theoretical model for such decision making. Our model indicates that the optimal holding period is affected by both systematic and non-systematic factors market conditions (illiquidity and transaction cost) and property performance (return and return volatility). Other things being equal, higher illiquidity and transaction costs lead to longer holding periods, while higher return volatility implies shorter holding periods. Our empirical application suggests that the optimal holding period based on our model is quite consistent with previous empirical findings. In addition, we find that when illiquidity risk is incorporated the true real estate risk is significantly higher than the conventional risk estimate. Therefore, the current practice of real estate valuation, which is naively borrowed from finance theory, substantially underestimates real estate risk. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The framework is applied to Israel's economy, by using an unique and extensive dataset: a combination of new national balance sheet data and foreign currency balance sheet data. The analysis using the BSA shows that Israel's economy was highly vulnerable to a depreciation of the shekel in 1997, but from then until 2005 it became more resilient. The improvement was due mainly to the lowering of the business sector's high level of exposure to depreciation and its greater financial strength. This, together with higher capital adequacy in the banking system, made the latter more resilient to indirect damage that could be caused by depreciation. The analysis shows further that despite the heavy exposure of the economy as a whole and most sectors within it to appreciation of the shekel at the end of 2005, the economy was quite resilient to such appreciation, as the private sector and the banks suffered little direct or indirect damage through it. The analysis stresses the central, but not exclusive, role played by the banks' resilience in the economy's financial stability, and thus also favors the continuation of the process of reducing the banks' dominance in financing the business sector, so that their indirect exposure to financial risks will fall. The findings yielded by the BSA are highly significant, because an analysis using the traditional approach leads to very different results, viz., that in 1997 the economy was not vulnerable to changes in the exchange rate, and that in 2005 it was highly vulnerable to shekel appreciation. The conclusions in the paper support the use of the balance sheet approach as an important instrument in surveillance of financial stability, the formulation of other similar frameworks for analyzing financial risks, and the provision of more detailed data in the national balance sheet that would enable a deeper analysis of overall economic risks and the risks in the major sectors.

Total trade between PTA partners is a poor proxy for preferential trade (trade in tariff lines where preferences are likely to matter): while the former was one-third of global trade in 2000-2002, the latter was between one-sixth and one-tenth. Gravity model estimates indicate that using total trade to assess the impacts of PTAs leads to a significant downward bias in the PTA coefficient: the semi-elasticity of trade with respect to PTA membership rises from 87% for total trade to 119% for preferential trade. Product exclusions and long phase-in periods significantly limit preferential trade; the marginal impact of South-South agreements on preferential trade is much higher than North-South PTAs, while the effect of North-North agreements is insignificantly different from zero.","World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Medvedev, D (通讯作者)，World Bank, I4-198,1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",dmedvedev@worldbank.org,,,,,,,32,24,27,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

This helps incumbents to coordinate their entry deterrence efforts. If entry is sufficiently costly for each incumbent, only the dynamic auction has an equilibrium where entry is deterred for sure.

Addressing these issues, a sensitivity analysis is performed on a dataset concerning implementation of the Swedish predator policy. The results show that the estimated income-elasticity of WTP varies between 0.12 and 0.40 for the models estimated. The main conclusion drawn from the analysis is that controlling for the number of adults in the household is important for finding a significant income effect, when the household income measure is used. Besides this finding the empirical analysis finds little support for the hypothesis that the choice of income measure and modelling assumptions significantly influence the overall model fit.","Natl Inst Econ Res, S-10362 Stockholm, Sweden",,"Broberg, T (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Econ Res, POB 3116, S-10362 Stockholm, Sweden.",thomas.broberg@konj.se,,,,,,,36,17,18,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Land that is converted may or may not be lost as habitat for many species. In some cases, monoculture production for example, land conversion reduces the number niches and hence the level of biodiversity. In other cases, it has the opposite effect. We address the problem of anthropogenic biodiversity change due to the effects of both harvest rates and land use decisions on landscape heterogeneity. If the optimal structure of the landscape is extremely homogeneous, forces of competitive exclusion will lead to a single surviving species. If it is extremely heterogeneous, multiple species will coexist, with each species exclusively dominating the patch type to which it is best suited. Where changes in biodiversity due to changes in landscape heterogeneity are not taken into account in land use decisions, they are external effects of those decisions. We identify measures of these effects.","[Kinzig, Ann; Perrings, Charles] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Brock, William] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Perrings, C (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, POB 874501, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",wbrock@ssc.wisc.edu; kinzig@asu.edu; Charles.perrings@asu.edu,,,Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences [0832858] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Emerging Frontiers & Multidisciplinary Activities; Directorate For Engineering [0836046] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Emerging Frontiers & Multidisciplinary Activities; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)),,,20,7,10,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Future predications show an even more drastic reduction of the ice cap which will open new areas for the exploration of natural resources and maritime transportation. Shipping through the Arctic Ocean via the Northern Sea Route (NSR) could save about 40% of the sailing distance from Asia (Yokohama) to Europe (Rotterdam) compared to the traditional route via the Suez Canal. However, a 40% reduction in distance using the NSR does not mean a corresponding 40% in cost savings due to many factors, including: higher building costs for ice-classed ships, non-regularity and slower speeds, navigation difficulties and greater risks, as well as the need for extra ice breaker service. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the economic potential of using the NSR as an alternative route between Asia and Europe by taking all the main factors into consideration. It focuses on economic aspect of the NSR, therefore navigation/environmental/cultural/legal issues are not discussed. The economic study is conducted by a case study in which 4300 TEU container ships (both non-ice classed and ice classed) are employed to make year round service. The annual profit gained from regular service by a non-ice-classed ship via the Suez Canal for the entire year is compared to the annual profit gained from an ice-classed ship taking the NSR during the navigable months and Suez Canal for the rest of the year. There are three factors that influence the NSR the most: the navigable time of the NSR, Russian NSR fees and bunker prices. To make this study flexible, three scenarios for navigable time, three scenarios for Russian NSR fees as well as three scenarios for bunker prices are proposed. These assumptions are all combined with each other and the profit under each condition is then calculated. The overall comparison is made in order to see under which conditions the NSR is competitive with the Suez Canal. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Because culture shapes the way people think about and behave in regard to risk, opportunities, and rewards, it should influence the nature of entrepreneurial activity and, by extension, economic outcomes. Using structural equation modeling on a sample of 63 countries, we propose and test a comprehensive explanation of how culture as an umbrella construct (as opposed to an analysis of its constituent parts) affects innovation and national prosperity. We propose a two-stage model of innovation, and find support for our hypothesized relationship that economic creativity influences innovation implementation. At the national level, we find that culture does indeed influence economic creativity. We also find that innovation implementation explained some of the variation in prosperity across countries. By establishing that big picture culture matters to innovation, the door has opened for researchers to evaluate this relationship using data from any one of a number of rival culture frameworks. Moreover, these empirical finding buttress the theoretical arguments that culture powerfully shapes the character of national innovation.","[Williams, Leslie K.; McGuire, Stephen J.] Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA; [Williams, Leslie K.] Menlo Coll, Atherton, CA USA",California State University System; California State University Los Angeles,"Williams, LK (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA.",lwillia8@calstatela.edu,,"McGuire, Stephen/0000-0003-0695-297X",,,,,128,89,102,5,71,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Most well-developed theories exploring change in commuting time are based on neo-classical economic theory. This paper argues however that in the case of China institutional factors of the housing provision system and labour mobility management have been more important. The paper conceptualizes an institutionalist approach incorporating housing and controls over labour mobility and applies it to analyse these influences on workers' commuting time in Beijing. The analysis shows that the interaction of housing provision, the market system and the Hukou system together have significant impact upon individual commuting time allowing for worker's annual household income, occupation and transport mode. The findings suggest that the market-oriented housing reforms have changed the local jobs-housing balance that prevailed in pre-reform era and have thus induced growth of commuting time; the remaining the unfair treatment of residents according to their Hukou status may influence the floating worker's ability to connect housing and workplace opportunities that could reduce commuting time. With respect to future studies, the institutionalist approach seems to be an efficient means of exploring particular factors that emerge in the transformation of an economy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We employ an empirical setup in which participants make hypothetical choices between gain or loss prospects in which the outcome depends on whether a high or low knowledge event occurs. We infer decision weighting functions for high and low knowledge events from choices using a representative agent preference model. For gains, we replicate the results of Kilka and Weber (Manage Sci 47:1712-1726, 2001), finding that decision makers are more attracted to choices that they feel more knowledgeable about.

Yet a substantial minority, particularly young males, reported engaging in risky driving behaviours such as speeding and impaired driving. Self-reported speeders and impaired drivers had significantly higher odds of reporting injuries from subsequent motor vehicle collisions. Specifically, those who reported sometimes/rarely or never obeying the speed limits were two and a half times more likely to report a subsequent motor vehicle injury, while those who reported impaired driving one or more times in the past 12 months were two times more likely to report a subsequent motor vehicle injury.

However, little or no scientific work exists to guide the design of ratings systems to properly account for the amount of earnings power lost due to disability. In this article, we examine the effectiveness of disability ratings using matched administrative data on ratings and earnings for a large, representative sample of permanent disability claimants in California. We find that while workers with higher ratings do experience larger earnings losses on average, there are large and persistent differences in average earnings losses for similarly rated impairments in different parts of the body. We then explore how adjusting permanent disability ratings to reflect cross-impairment differences in earnings losses can affect the equity of permanent disability benefits. Adjusting disability ratings to account for typical earnings losses reduces cross-impairment differences substantially. The adjusted ratings result in a more equitable distribution of disability benefits across workers with different impairments.","[Bhattacharya, Jayanta] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Bhattacharya, Jayanta] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Neuhauser, Frank] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Reville, Robert T.; Seabury, Seth A.] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA 90406 USA",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; RAND Corporation,"Bhattacharya, J (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",seabury@rand.org,,,,,,,28,6,6,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

It focuses on the creation of road and rail networks in French West Africa during the colonial period and in the land-locked States during the national period, which involves post-independence development policies. The network is perceived in this paper as the manifestation of the political will to facilitate traffic within a delimited space. Within the colonial and then the national periods roads and railways were thus constructed as part of a process that can be interpreted as the outcome of a compromise between a territorial project and the capacity to implement it. This geohistorical study thus allows us to identify, with reference to the link between borders and networks, the successive geographical linkages (railway and port combinations with their subsequent branches, national roads, economic roads, external connections) which have been applied in the delimited spaces in question. This exercise has concentrated particularly on continental West Africa. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Results of a ridge regression analysis show that dairy herd size, the level of farm debt, annual production per cow, technology and policy changes over time, and the ratio of trading income to total milk income influence the long-term competitiveness of these milk producers. To enhance their competitiveness in a deregulated dairy market, relatively small and profitable EG milk producers should consider increasing their herd sizes, as the importance of herd size in explaining competitiveness suggests that size economies exist. All EG milk producers should consider utilising more pasture- and forage-based production systems to lower feed costs and select dairy cattle of superior genetic merit to improve milk yields on pasture.","[du Toit, J.

Results confirm in general what recently found for the US by De Graeve (2008), namely that the model with financial frictions can generate a series for the premium, without using any financial macroeconomic aggregates, highly correlated with available proxies for the premium (about 65% with the A graded corporate bonds spread). The advantage of using a structural model to obtain the premium lies in the fact that it allows for the dynamic analysis above mentioned, whose main achievement is to highlight that the estimated premium is not necessarily: (1) counter-cyclical (this depends on the shock considered) and (2) pro-cyclical during a recession.

There are common problems among the various schemes: (1) low take-up rates, (2) high claim rates, and (3) low renewal rates. In the present paper, we investigate take-up decisions using household data collected in Karnataka, India, focusing on prospect theory, hyperbolic preference, and adverse selection. Prospect theory presumes that people behave in a risk-averse way when evaluating gains but in a risk-loving way when evaluating losses. Because insurance covers losses, the risk-loving attitude toward losses might explain the low take-up rates, and we find weak empirical support for this. Households with hyperbolic preference were more likely to purchase insurance, consistent with our theoretical prediction of demand for commitment. We also find some evidence on the existence of adverse selection: households with a higher ratio of sick members were more likely to purchase insurance.","[Ito, Seiro; Kono, Hisaki] JETRO, Inst Developing Econ, Chiba, Japan",,"Ito, S (通讯作者)，JETRO, Inst Developing Econ, Chiba, Japan.",,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [20402029] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,25,39,42,0,16,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0012-1533,,,DEV ECON,Dev.

This may create an incentive for outside stakeholders or the firm's debtholders to bail out the firm as bankruptcy looms. Because of this implicit guarantee, firm shareholders have an incentive to increase volatility in order to exploit the implicit protection. However, if they increase volatility too much they may induce the guarantee-extending parties to walk away. I derive the optimal risk management rule in such a framework and show that it allows high volatility choices, while net worth is high. However, risk limits tighten abruptly when the firm's net worth declines below an endogenously determined threshold. Hence, the model reproduces the qualitative features of existing risk management rules, and can account for phenomena such as flight to quality. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This type of rank-order competition has the advantage that it can eliminate the negative externality a group's performance imposes on other groups. However, it has the disadvantage that incentives to outperform others are absent, and therefore it does not eliminate equilibria where all groups cooperate at an equal but low level. We find that all-can-win competition produces a universal increase in cooperation and benefits a majority of individuals if the incentive to compete is sharp. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This asymmetric evolution of information between lenders and prospective lenders grants the former an information monopoly. This article empirically investigates whether relationship banks exploit this advantage by charging higher interest rates than those that would prevail were all banks symmetrically informed. My identification strategy hinges on the notion that large information shocks that level the playing field among banks erode the relationship bank's information monopoly. I use the borrower's initial public offering (IPO) as such an information-releasing event, and build a panel dataset in which the unit of observation is a firm's lending relationships before and after its IPO. Prior to a firm's IPO, I find a U-shaped relation between borrowing rates and relationship intensity. After the IPO, interest rates are decreasing in relationship intensity. Furthermore, mean interest rates drop after an IPO. The results are robust to firm and loan-year fixed effects, and to controls for firm leverage pre- and post-IPO. Thus, the reported interest rate pattern is clean of any confounding effects that might arise from changes in financial risk.

Yet, measurements of this relationship are still scarce and not always reliable. The authors present additional evidence at both the sectoral and household levels based on recent data. Results show that rural poverty reduction has been associated with growth in yields and in agricultural labor productivity, but that this relation varies sharply across regional contexts. GDP growth originating in agriculture induces income growth among the 40 percent poorest, which is on the order of three times larger than growth originating in the rest of the economy. The power of agriculture comes not only from its direct poverty reduction effect but also from its potentially strong growth linkage effects on the rest of the economy. Decomposing the aggregate decline in poverty into a rural contribution, an urban contribution, and a population shift component shows that rural areas contributed more than half the observed aggregate decline in poverty. Finally, using the example of Vietnam, the authors show that rapid growth in agriculture has opened pathways out of poverty for farming households. While the effectiveness of agricultural growth in reducing poverty is well established, the effectiveness of public investment in inducing agricultural growth is still incomplete and conditional on context.","[de Janvry, Alain; Sadoulet, Elisabeth] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"de Janvry, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",alain@berkeley.edu; esadoulet@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,22,172,199,1,45,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

We find that people with high levels of education allocate to the small formal sector, while less educated workers allocate to the informal sector. While high levels of education are given more value in the relatively smaller sectors of salaried employment, observed skills like education appear to be fairly unprofitable in the larger self-employment sector. The fact that only the small formal sector in urban West Africa both seems to absorb highly educated workers and provide high skill premiums may be an important reason for the observed low demand for education and high dropout rates.","[Nordman, Christophe J.; Roubaud, Francois] DIAL, IRD, F-75010 Paris, France; [Dimova, Ralitza] Brunel Univ, Fac Econ & Finance, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England",Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Brunel University,"Nordman, CJ (通讯作者)，DIAL, IRD, 4 Rue Enghien, F-75010 Paris, France.",ralitza.dimova@brunel.ac.uk; nordman@dial.prd.fr; roubaud@dial.prd.fr,,"Nordman, Christophe Jalil/0000-0002-8368-4086",,,,,27,9,9,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

In our regressions we use macro-level panel data on 60 developing countries for the period 1975-2004, including other potential determinants of energy intensities, and carry out robustness checks with more specific data.

By examining county-level data for the last two decades, the analysis in this paper is built around two main questions. First, in what proportion does local employment growth reduce local unemployment, increase labor force participation and attract outsiders who will likely take the newly created jobs? Second, to what extent regional migration rates respond to regional relative wages and unemployment differentials? Both questions aim to gain a better understanding of the San Joanquin Valley labor market and the migrants' decisions to move there, which might shed light in the design and implementation of development policies aimed at reducing unemployment. Results provide evidence that market forces alone are insufficient to correct regional unemployment disparities. Three main findings are offered.

Evidence suggests that industry components have become more important in recent years, but the reasons for this are unclear. Existing research concentrated mainly on stock returns in industrial countries. In this paper we consider instead the decomposition of stock risks within emerging equity markets. We provide a rationale for this procedure and its relationship to return decompositions. The results provide new firm-specific evidence on the debate over country and industry components, their stability over time, and the implications for portfolio diversification.

Instead, they represent their actions as challenging injustice, inequality and/or development models with which they disagree, and reject the simplifying and sectoral orientation of poverty reduction interventions. In today's engagement with the poverty-reducing state, their challenge is to secure resources and influence without becoming themselves subject to, or even the subjects of, the practices of government.","[Bebbington, A.

After 1989, an accounting reform began in Romania in order to adapt the accounting system at the new economic environment. At that time, the accounting system was characterised by a legal approach for the recognition of assets and liabilities. The nature and extent of disclosures were imposed by the regulator, leaving little freedom for accounting professionals to choose specific forms of presentation. A few years later (1999), the regulators expanded the field of professional judgement by introducing IASC's conceptual framework and elements of International Accounting Standards. The aim of this paper is to show that the conceptual elements of IAS/IFRS have influenced only to a small extent the professional judgement of accountants. For this we chose to analyse questions and answers posted on accounting forums regarding the accounting treatment of factoring agreements for which the accounting regulator has not yet issued specific regulations.","[Calu, Daniela Artemisa; Olimid, Lavinia; Guse, Raluca Gina; Avram, Viorel] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,danielacalu@yahoo.com,"St. Calu, Daniela Artemisa/C-3786-2011; Guse, Raluca Gina/GVT-2621-2022; Calu, Daniela Artemisa/N-5763-2017","Guse, Raluca Gina/0000-0001-5424-3364; Calu, Daniela Artemisa/0000-0002-2306-5275",,,,,6,0,0,0,3,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",,,978-606-505-347-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,441,454,,,,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BSE06,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284258100029,0

Price to Income Ratio (PIR) is an index in literatures that has mostly used to measure the 'pressure' of housing price to household income. However, the application of the PER index is rough and is limited in deep insight to the detail of affordability. Gan (2009) provide a concept of estimating housing affordable limit (AL) and compute the risk probability of housing affordability of individual household. In this study, the housing affordable price for a given household income is empirically estimated based on the assumptions of rate of living expenses and mortgage parameters. The estimated price of affordable limit is then used to compare to the real price for the current housing unit to calculate the price gap. By assuming the probability density function (pdf) of housing prices to be following with any given specific probability distribution, Normal Distribution for instance, the risk probability of housing affordability can be then computed. We adopted empirical data of Taipei city and Kaohsiung city in 2008, and computed the affordable risk for households by different income strata. Our empirical results show that household in the lowest-income level has the most high the risk probability of housing affordability in both cities. However, in Taipei city, household in the highest-income level also has high risk probability. That implies some rich people in Taipei risk themselves by purchasing a housing unit with too high prices.","[Chen, Yen-Jong; Weng, Hui-Wen] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Urban Planning, Tainan 70101, Taiwan",National Cheng Kung University,,yj_chen@mail.ncku.edu.tw; p2697411@mail.ncku.edu.tw,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,1,CHINA ARCHITECTURE & BUILDING PRESS,BEIJING,"BAIWANZHUANG XICHENGGU, BEIJING, 10037, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-112-12328-5,,,,2010,,,,,,,129,142,,,,,,14,Economics; Urban Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,BRM62,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000283112400009,0

Alternatively, informed traders may trade purely on their estimate of stock value. This paper examines the trading behavior of a large institutional insider that periodically trades in the wrong direction, i.e., makes occasional sell (buy) trades within packages of buy (sell) trades. Using a hand-collected data set, we find that three quarters of the trade packages include wrong-direction trades. Wrong trades appear to be used mostly to disguise right-direction trades. We find that the wrong-trade stocks are larger and have less noisy returns. hence, they lack natural disguise. Wrong trades are relatively small, used to accentuate return volatility, distributed evenly during a package of trades. and are not consistently profitable. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The attractiveness of these economies is conditioned, in its turn, by the importance of economic factors and the quality of existing infrastructures, which is at their turn facing an increasing complexity of technology. Business relocation of foreign investors is influenced also by the institutional environment, because foreign investors hope to capitalize on the collateral effects offered by the investment environment in the host country, such as research laboratories and existing infrastructure, without neglecting the benefits of a highly qualified workforce at reduced costs, some geopolitical advantages, etc. After EU accession, the attractiveness index of business environment in Romania has increased from (-59%) in 2005 to 66% (2008), and Romania was considered among the most attractive economies in Central and Eastern Europe, along with Russia where the attractiveness index increased from 63% (2007) to 72% (2008) and Ukraine which has seen an increase in the attractiveness index of the business environment from 56% (2007) to 67% (2008).

Remittances from abroad are a far more important source of income for SIDS, and some depend very heavily on export revenues. The quality of governance varies tremendously among SIDS, they are over-represented among countries classified as fragile states and many are prone to state failure. These and other factors combine to make SIDS highly vulnerable to external economic shocks. Achieving development in SIDS is as a consequence an especially complex task that requires an understanding of the roles played by aid, trade, remittances and governance in these countries.

The relative weight of the explanatory variables is examined (price, income, competition coming form both television and video), which enables to see how cinema's perception changed in people's mind. The obtained price elasticity made us consider cinema as pretty close to the higher performing arts of Throsby [1994]. The income elasticity of demand reinforces this point of view, as it classifies cinema as a luxury good. Regarding television and video recording, we obtain significant results in the long run. They both have a negative impact on cinema attendance. They might have become more popular ways to watch a movie, making the cinema only available for some sections of population. Finally, it's seems that cinema became a luxury good.

J,"Shrestha, R",,,,"Shrestha, Ranjan",,,The village midwife program and infant mortality in Indonesia,BULLETIN OF INDONESIAN ECONOMIC STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,HEALTH,"Indonesia introduced over 50,000 midwives into villages in the 1990s to provide primary care to women lacking easy access to health facilities. It seems plausible to argue that the significant reduction in infant mortality that occurred from about 1993-94 was a consequence of this. The paper estimates the village midwife program's impact on infant mortality, using data from the Indonesia Family Life Survey. Regressing mortality outcomes against choice of services would lead to biased estimates because of the correlation between service choice and unobserved individual characteristics. Furthermore, non-random placement of midwives could bias estimates of their impact on infant mortality. This study overcomes such endogeneity problems by aggregating mortality outcomes and program prevalence at district level and taking account of district fixed effects in estimating the program's impact. Surprisingly, the results do not support the hypothesis that the midwife program was responsible for the observed decline in infant mortality.","[Shrestha, Ranjan] Univ Montana, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Shrestha, Ranjan] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",University of Montana System; University of Montana; Australian National University,"Shrestha, R (通讯作者)，Univ Montana, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",,"Shrestha, Ranjan/AAY-4931-2021",,,,,,14,9,11,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Our target is to find out how straightforward it is for such country to switch to the Anglo-Saxon accounting culture and get into the international accounting harmonization. A review of some related work in the literature was examined. Then, a qualitative study based on semi-directive interviews with Tunisian CPAs was pursued in order to evaluate the accounting harmonization de jure and de facto in Tunisia, thirteen years after the switch in 1997 from a General Accounting Plan to the new Accounting System. The results show that, in the present, in spite of de jure harmonization efforts, particularly shown by the Tunisian accounting system, widely inspired by the international one, professionals maintain that those efforts are insufficient. In fact, on one hand, the new system includes lacunas in comparison with international standards, and on the other hand even when Tunisian accounting standards are perfectly harmonized with the international ones, accounting practices do not follow. This is due to numerous pressures, notably cultural and juridical, that prevent the success in Tunisia of de facto harmonization.","[Trabelsi, Raoudha] Univ Montpellier 1, F-34960 Montpellier 2, France",Universite de Montpellier,,raoudhatrabelsi@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,5,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",,,978-606-505-347-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,210,231,,,,,,22,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BSE06,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284258100014,0

J,"Wie, TK; Negara, SD",,,,"Wie, Thee Kian; Negara, Siwage Dharma",,,Survey of recent developments,BULLETIN OF INDONESIAN ECONOMIC STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Little has happened to dispel concern that reform momentum is dissipating. New National Economic and Innovation Committees to help accelerate development will probably achieve little: resolving many key economic policy issues is straightforward technically, so the real obstacle to doing so is lack of political will and leadership. It appears that economic growth has stabilised rather than continuing to accelerate. Investment is still strong, but fiscal policy is no longer providing a stimulus. Soeharto-era attachment to small budget deficits remains evident in the 2011 budget, which persists in spending heavily on subsidies at the expense of investment in sorely needed infrastructure. The demand for net exports had temporarily constrained growth, but by Q2 2010 this was no longer the case. Manufacturing has been in the doldrums, partly because of surging export commodity prices and volumes, but its recent growth seems more promising. International reserves continue to accumulate because of the commitment of Bank Indonesia (BI) to avoiding rupiah appreciation, which makes monetary policy difficult and costly to implement. BI has responded by allowing some appreciation, an acceleration of inflation and a small increase in the interest rate on its certificates of deposit, and by forcing banks to place more funds with it at low or zero interest. At last it has begun to tighten monetary policy, but this is likely to increase capital inflow, despite the introduction of a new capital control. The incompatibility of BI's monetary and exchange rate policies will therefore continue to cause problems. Rapid rice price inflation, however, is not the fault of the central bank, but a consequence of the policy of preventing Indonesia from participating more fully in the world rice market. Official indicators suggest that the banking sector is in good condition. One concern is that interest margins are too high, which seems to be attributable to inefficiency in government-owned banks. If pressure to prevent or roll back increased foreign ownership of Indonesian banks is successful, this is likely to make the banking system even less efficient. Indonesia continues to have difficulty competing for foreign investment with comparator countries such as Thailand, Vietnam and Brazil: much remains to be done to improve the climate for doing business. The government appears to be pondering more serious approaches to tackling the problem of Jakarta's congestion, although conflicting signals on this have emerged. Solutions are seen in expansion of transport infrastructure and improvement of its management, and in the introduction of electronic tolling on main roads.","[Wie, Thee Kian; Negara, Siwage Dharma] Indonesian Inst Sci LIPI, Jakarta, Indonesia",National Research & Innovation Agency of Indonesia (BRIN); Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI),"Negara, SD (通讯作者)，Indonesian Inst Sci LIPI, Jakarta, Indonesia.",,,"Negara, Siwage/0000-0002-8869-8946",,,,,34,10,10,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Buffer zones are areas of uncultivated land between cultivated land and watercourses meant prevent water pollution associated within the application of pesticides and fertilizers associated with agricultural production. A riparian zone is a zone within urban area that is natural for that environment. Since a buffer zone in PEI cannot be cultivated, it could potentially serve the dual function as both an area that mitigates pollution (a buffer zone) and an area that is natural for that environment (a riparian zone): A buffer zone could potentially be a riparian zone. This paper is concerned with the ecosystem creation problems existing in PEI in Canada. Specifically, the purpose of the study to is analyze the costs and benefits associated with turning buffer zones into riparian zones in PEI. The benefits of buffer zones are two types: forage buffer zones and woodlot buffer zones. Forage buffer zones do little to promote species diversity and therefore would preclude the development of a riparian from a forage buffer zone. Woodlot buffer zones have far more potential for species diversity. Three types of costs for forage buffer zones and woodlot buffer zones are studied in this research: establishment costs, opportunity costs and control costs. This study traces out the marginal cost of diversity on forage and woodlot buffer zones by examining marginal control, opportunity and establishment costs. Once these marginal costs have been deduced, various scenarios regarding marginal revenue functions (government incentive programs) are discussed to determine optimal species diversity policies on buffer zones and as a guide to public policy. On the base of the results of the analyses, it is possible to say the following: (1) A woodlot buffer zone has much more potential to promote species diversity than a forage buffer zone; (2) It would be extremely costly to existing commercial farms in PEI to establish complete or perfect riparian zones; (3) Most of the species diversity of a PEI riparian zone (approximately 90%) could be achieved from a woodlot buffer zone with a modest incentive system from the PEI government.

We propose a method to compute an Intraday Value at Risk based on irregularly spaced high-frequency data and an intraday Monte Carlo simulation. A log-ACD-ARMA-EGARCH model is used to specify the joint density of the marked point process of durations and high-frequency returns. We apply our methodology to transaction data for three stocks actively traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Compared to traditional techniques applied to intraday data, our methodology has two main advantages. First, our risk measure has a higher informational content as it takes into account all observations. On the total risk measure, our method allows for distinguishing the effect of random trade durations from the effect of random returns, and for analyzing the interaction between these factors. Thus, we find that the information contained in the time between transactions is relevant to risk analysis, which is consistent with predictions from asymmetric-information models in the market microstructure literature. Second, once the model has been estimated, the IVaR can be computed by any trader for any time horizon based on the same information and with no need of sampling the data and estimating the model again when the horizon changes. Backtesting results show that our approach constitutes reliable means of measuring intraday risk for traders who are very active in the market. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, there are differences in the country-specific reaction function to changes in the economic environment.

The case study concerns preferences for protecting different types of landscape from road encroachment when building new motorways in Denmark. Two samples of respondents are surveyed-one by internet and one by mail. The performances of the two samples are compared over six different criteria; response rates, protest responses, demographics, preferences and WTP, estimation precision, and, finally, certainty in choice. Differences are observed for some of these criteria, implying that analysts should be aware that choosing internet over mail could be accompanied by a survey mode effect. However, the observed differences do not translate into significant differences in the unconditional WTP estimates. In most applied economic valuation studies of non-market goods, the main objective is in fact estimation of WTP. Hence, in the present case, the identified survey mode effects do not severely invalidate the applicability and continued use of the internet as a suitable means of collecting data for choice experiment economic valuation of non-market goods.","Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Olsen, SB (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",sobo@life.ku.dk,"Olsen, Søren B/M-2949-2014","Olsen, Søren B/0000-0002-1278-3749",,,,,73,150,170,1,53,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We find that better capitalized banks tend to be more profitable. The same is true for banks with a relatively larger share of deposits and for more X-efficient banks. In addition, a less concentrated banking system increases bank profitability, which basically reflects that the four state-owned commercial banks China's largest banks - have been the main drag for system's profitability. We find the same negative influence for China's development banks (so-called Policy Banks), which are fully state-owned. Instead, more market-oriented banks, such as joint-stock commercial banks, tend to be more profitable, which again points to the influence of government intervention in explaining bank performance in China. These findings should not come as a surprise for a banking system which has long been functioning as a mechanism for transferring huge savings to meet public policy goals. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Besides this form of contagion, interdependence shows up by the effect of interest rates, bond returns and stock market volatility on crash probabilities. When it comes to forecasting global crashes, our model outperforms a binomial model for global crashes only. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We explore the productive contributions of foreign ownership (FDI), emphasizing its linkages with plant size and input composition, for plants in the Turkish motor vehicle and parts industry. We evaluate the implications of FDI for overall productivity, input-specific contributions, and returns to scale, using OLS, stochastic production frontier, and quantile (size-specific) regression estimates of a translog production function model. We find significantly higher productivity of plants with foreign ownership, driven by a higher marginal product of labor, particularly for smaller plants. This effect augments the productive contributions of technical progress, capital intensity, and increasing returns to scale. FDI is also associated with a greater productive contribution of imported capital investment.","[Yasar, Mahmut] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Econ, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Paul, Catherine J.

Most existing studies use large companies as the research sample; studies that explicitly investigate the influence of family ownership on the performance of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) remain sparse. This study raises this issue explicitly by investigating the influence of founding-family ownership on the return on assets and Tobin's q of 341 public SMEs in Taiwan, during the period of 2002-2006. It emerges from the data that family ownership is prevalent and substantial in Taiwan, representing half of the public SMEs and accounting for more than 11 percent of their outstanding equity. It was found that the influence of family ownership on SME performance is positive and significant. Overall, the results suggest that family ownership is an effective organizational structure for SMEs in Taiwan.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei 10764, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Chu, WY (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.",wenyichu@management.ntu.edu.tw,,,,,,,78,79,95,5,64,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

At issue is whether the social and economic preconditions for capitalist industrialization existed before, or emerged only after the American Revolution and the establishment of an independent US state. The two major interpretive models - the 'staples/commercialization' and 'frontier/demographic' models - provide insights into the process of economic development in colonial North America. However, their inability to root their analyses in specificities of different forms of social labour leave them inadequate.

In the context of Bayesian learning such a bias may result in diverging posterior beliefs and attitude polarization even if agents receive identical information. Such patterns cannot be explained by the standard model of rational Bayesian learning that implies convergent beliefs. Based on Choquet expected utility theory, we therefore develop formal models of Bayesian learning with psychological bias as alternatives to rational Bayesian learning. We derive conditions under which beliefs may diverge in the learning process despite the fact that all agents observe the same sample drawn from an i.i.d. process. Key to our approach is the description of ambiguous beliefs as neo-additive capacities (Chateauneuf et al., J Econ Theory 137:538-567, 2007), which allows for a flexible and parsimonious parametrization of departures from additive probability measures.","[Zimper, Alexander] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, ZA-2006 Auckland Pk, South Africa; [Ludwig, Alexander] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Res Inst Econ Aging, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",University of Johannesburg; University of Mannheim,"Zimper, A (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, POB 524, ZA-2006 Auckland Pk, South Africa.",azimper@uj.ac.za; ludwig@mea.uni-mannheim.de,"Zimper, Alexander/KBQ-4867-2024","Zimper, Alexander/0000-0002-3730-3086",,,,,64,20,27,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

We show that this can have two opposing consequences for banking stability. First, the hold-up problem between bank managers and shareholders becomes less severe. Consequently, banks' capital structure needs to be less concerned with disciplining the management. Deposits - the most effective disciplining device - can be reduced, increasing banks' resilience to adverse return shocks. However, limiting the hold-up problem also diminishes bank managers' rents, reducing their incentives to properly monitor and screen borrowers, with adverse implications for asset quality. Thus, the default risk of banks does not necessarily decline. We argue that this delivers a novel explanation for the origin of the recent subprime crisis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

These results are robust to adjustments for fund fees, serial correlation, backfill bias, and incubation bias.

We propose a new approach which instead relies on the historical distribution of religious preferences. Specifically, we find that county-level Catholic shares measured at the end of the 19th century are far more strongly associated with Catholic school attendance than are current Catholic shares. Using several strategies, we show that historical Catholic shares are likely to be exogenous to student outcomes conditional on the current distribution of religion. Estimates based on this identification strategy point to smaller Catholic schooling effects than those implied by OLS, in contrast to instrumental variables estimates from previous studies.

Earlier studies documented widespread spillover of the reputation effect, suggesting a strong commonality in Big 5 audit practices. We examine whether the market is more discriminating in its assessments. We focus on the roles industry specialization of auditors and the geography of clients' audit offices play in accounting for the contagion. Our results are supportive of investors who differentiate audit practices by industry and who account for the location of the specific office where the audit work is done. We find that losses suffered by energy firms or firms located close to Houston are equivalent to approximately 90% of the aggregate abnormal losses suffered by Big 5 clients. Our evidence suggests the possibility of more localized impact of accounting scandals and supports accounting regulations targeted at individual industries. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Forecasts by Macroeconomic Advisers (MA) have long anticipated a marked slowing in trend growth of the labor force that would contribute to a slowing in potential GDP growth. This is reflected in MA's forecast that the aggregate rate of labor force participation will trend down, especially after 2010, largely in response to the aging of the baby boom generation, whose members are beginning to approach typical retirement ages. Expectations for a downward trajectory for the participation rate and a slowing in trend labor force growth are not unique. However, this article reports on MA research suggesting that the opposite is possible: that the slowdown in trend labor force growth could be relatively modest and that the trend in the aggregate rate of labor force participation will decline little, if at all, over the next decade.

In particular, residential investment increases both consumption, as well as non-residential investment palpably more than in years past. Additionally, in the pre-deregulation years, non-residential investment appeared to crowd out housing activity. However, the results indicate that this effect is smaller in the present era than before the early 1980s, in all likelihood due to the switch from thrift-based financing of home mortgages to the current system in which secondary mortgage markets play a predominant role.","Wichita State Univ, Wichita, KS 67260 USA",Wichita State University,"Miles, W (通讯作者)，Wichita State Univ, Wichita, KS 67260 USA.",william.miles@wichita.edu,,,,,,,24,10,14,0,16,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

The paper tests the explanation in a rigorous design. The analyses show a positive, robust effect of generalized social trust on public good provision, but no effect is found in a joint product situation.

In this paper, we examine how contested water rights impede water trade. To show this, we use a model in which property rights to water are contested because countries have overlapping claims to water. In the model. countries decide whether to bargain over the allocation of contested river water or not. If not, they engage in conflict. In the conflict, countries spend their resources on production, which also requires water, or on fighting to secure part of the contested water. The resulting equilibrium is inefficient as both countries spend a positive amount of resources on fighting which is not productive. However, a third party may be requested to intervene in the looming conflict and allocate the water in an equitable way. The results show that for certain model parameters countries prefer not to bargain an efficient allocation, but to engage in conflict, hoping for third party intervention. The mere possibility of third party intervention may give rise to an inefficient equilibrium. Two new features of this paper are the application of a conflict model to the issue of water rights and the introduction of (overlapping) claims to non-cooperative bargaining problems.

Anticipation of these merger opportunities can lead to defensive acquisitions, where managers acquire other firms to avoid losing private benefits if their firms are acquired, or positioning acquisitions, where firms position themselves as more attractive takeover targets to earn takeover premia. The identity of acquirers and targets and the profitability of acquisitions depend on the distribution of firm sizes within an industry, among other factors. We find empirical support for some unique predictions of our theory.","[Gorton, Gary] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Gorton, Gary] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kahl, Matthias] Univ N Carolina, Kenan Flagler Business Sch, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Rosen, Richard J.] Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL USA",Yale University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago,"Gorton, G (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",,,,,,,,72,105,135,3,82,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

Markets are an alternative to such negotiations. This paper develops a market-based approach that is appropriate if claimants are severely cash-constrained and there is merit in having existing owners-managers remain in control. This approach was developed in response to the 1997 Asian Crisis, where the sheer numbers of over-indebted firms, creditors with poor incentives, and inexperienced courts stymied negotiated resolution. The scheme, however, can be applied to other crisis settings that exhibit particular characteristics. One such setting could be the resolution of external sovereign debts, a situation where creditors obviously cannot take possession of a country. The scheme arranges creditors in a queue to be serviced in sequence from the firm's operating cash flows. Creditors bid for their position in this queue, and those accepting a greater proportionate reduction in the face value of their claims are placed ahead of the others. Any existing hierarchy of claims is honored by having claimants bid for their positions within the relevant segment of the queue. No one in the queue (including owners who are last) is paid anything until the (reduced) debts of the first in line are fully discharged using the firm's operating cash surpluses. The queue then moves up and the next claimant in line is serviced. The paper shows that, in equilibrium, the aggregate debts of the firm are reduced enough to provide a positive expected residual return to the owner-managers, which improves their incentives to efficiently operate the firm and can result in an outcome that is Pareto superior to other bankruptcy procedures. We discuss the efficiency properties of this scheme and its appropriateness to situations of systemic financial distress. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

As a result of evaluation conducted within this framework, a set of factors, sometimes contradicting each other, such as staff focusing, top-executive leadership, quick decision making, project organization, function based structure, authority transfer, detailed planning, centralized control, and massive communication,, with each other are observed to be influential in the outcomes of mergers.","[Bas, Tuerker; Yildiz, Gueltekin] Sakarya Univ, IIBF, Isletme Bolumu, Sakarya, Turkey",Sakarya University,"Keskin, N (通讯作者)，Halkbank Genel Mudurlugu, Sogutozu Mah 2 Cadde 63, TR-06520 Sogutozu Ankara, Turkey.",nurzahit.keskin@halkbank.com.tr; turkerbas@hotmail.com; yildizg@sakarya.edu.tr,"Bas, Turker/AAH-2080-2020",,,,,,49,1,1,1,10,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

Such altruistic behavior has been well documented in experimental games between unrelated, anonymous individuals. Matters of social distance between giver and receiver, or between giver and a potential bystander, are also known to be relevant to giving behavior. This paper reports results of an experiment manipulating an extremely weak social cue in the dictator game. Prior to making their decision, we present dictators with a simple visual stimulus: either three dots in a watching-eyes configuration, or three dots in a neutral configuration. The watching-eyes configuration is suggestive of a schematic face - a stimuli that is known to weakly activate the fusiform face area of the brain. Our results demonstrate that such a weak social cue does increase giving behavior - even under a double-blind protocol - and this difference in behavior across treatments is entirely explained by differences in the dictator behavior of males.

This paper uses firm-level data on investment and measures corruption at the firm and country level, and allows the effect of corruption to vary by region. Our dependent variable is firms' investment growth and we employ six measures of corruption from four different sources-two firm-level measures and four country-level measures. We find that the effect of corruption on investments varies significantly across regions: corruption has a negative and significant effect on investment growth for firms in Transition countries but has no significant impact for firms in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa.

The qualitative employment, growth, and relative-wage effects of globalization are shown to depend crucially on the degree of Northern labor market frictions. I demonstrate that only Northern countries with particularly large labor market adjustment costs for both firms and workers benefit from globalization in terms of permanently lower unemployment, temporarily faster growth, and permanently higher wages. This is because of the resulting general-equilibrium feedback effects of Northern labor market frictions that deter Southern imitation incentives. The result does not imply the recommendation to increase Northern labor market rigidities, but it challenges the common belief that labor market flexibility helps Northern countries to better adjust to the globalization threat coming from the South.","Univ Konstanz, D-78457 Constance, Germany",University of Konstanz,"Grieben, WH (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Univ Str 10,POB 146, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",heimo.grieben@uni-konstanz.de,,,,,,,19,2,2,0,4,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1363-6669,,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

By carrying out laboratory sessions of this game in which subjects' overconfidence is a treatment variable, I find that overconfidence affects the information aggregation process by increasing the dispersion of estimates and decreasing the rate of estimates' convergence. However, even when subjects are not overconfident, qualitatively similar deviations from the fully rational model predictions are observed.

We show that cross-industry differences in inventory holding costs, demand elasticities, and price rigidities potentially all affect employment decisions in the face of productivity shocks. In particular, the employment response to a permanent productivity shock is more likely to be positive the less costly it is to hold inventories, the more elastic industry demand is, and the more flexible prices are. Using data on 458 4-digit U.S. manufacturing industries over the period 1958-1996, we find statistically significant effects of variations in inventory holdings and demand elasticities on short-run employment responses, but less conclusive evidence pertaining to the effects of measured price stickiness.

The question of whether this bias survives in market equilibrium is an issue that can be tackled with experimental economics methods. Here, we use the 4-door Monty Hall as a tool to measure the lure of choice both at the individual as well as the market level. We find that if individuals exhibit this bias then market prices also reflect this bias, hence, trading activity alone is not sufficient to reduce or eliminate the lure of choice. The bias, both at the individual as well as the market level, is robust to learning. If at least two traders strongly exhibit this bias, then market prices also strongly reflect this bias. This result has important implications for models with heterogeneous traders. Furthermore, the lure of choice is found to be compatible with event-style market efficiency. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Many things are correlated with the seasons so it is difficult to distinguish between them when we try to explain the well-known summer winter pattern in stock returns. Finding an isolated seasonal affective disorder (SAD) effect without proper control variables does not disprove our point but strengthens it. To sidestep all of the issues they raise and take our point to the extreme, we show using plain vanilla regressions that the seasonal stock market pattern they attribute to SAD can also be explained by variables like ice cream consumption or airline travel. The new variations of SAD variables (onset and incidence) KKL propose in their recent work for North America are even more problematic than the original SAD variables. We find that these new SAD proxies are not significant in countries where according to KKL they should be: Canada and the United States. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

When the crisis hit in 1997, several major firms, including a large number of highly leveraged conglomerates (Chaebols), experienced bankruptcies. We show how diversified Chaebols obtain higher equilibrium leverage than non-Chaebols (a cosigner effect). In the event of a low probability macro-economic shock, the model predicts a systematic change in relative bankruptcy risks of Chaebol firms. To examine this implication, we introduce an empirical methodology that decomposes equilibrium debt into demand, supply and Chaebol-specific factors, for use in a bankruptcy prediction model. We find that the primary cause of Chaebol firm bankruptcies was not idiosyncratic leverage, but leverage systematically related to greater equilibrium access to debt during normal times.

We do find that NFHEs increase income and reduce between-household inequality. However, the role of the NFHE sector has been diminishing, especially in urban areas, and the NFHEs have been affected by trade liberalization in the period 1993-2002. In terms of policy, this suggests that there is increasing scope for targeting NFHE sector policies at those NFHEs that are in the best position to benefit from the new opportunities in the liberalizing environment.

So far it is mostly the mobility effects of business-to-consumer (b2c) e-commerce that have been studied. However, consumer-to-consumer (c2c) e-commerce is becoming popular and may have important implications for mobility as well. Moreover, most studies conducted thus far have looked at the consequences of b2c e-commerce for either personal or freight travel, but not for both. This paper takes a more comprehensive approach. Using a nationwide sample of 3000 Dutch e-shoppers we calculated the potential impacts of both types of e-commerce on personal and freight travel. The results indicated that personal travel in the Netherlands has only marginally decreased as a result of e-shopping, while freight transport has slightly increased. The outcomes showed a net mobility effect, as the reduction in personal travel was not fully compensated by the increase in freight transport. However, this mobility reduction was fully attributed to b2c e-cornmerce, as c2c e-cornmerce led to an increase in both personal travel and freight transport. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

By exploring the links between credit risk and macroeconomic developments, we observe that in periods of economic growth there may be some tendency towards excessive risk-taking. Using an extensive dataset with detailed information for more than 30000 firms, we show that default probabilities are influenced by several firm-specific characteristics. When time-effect controls or macroeconomic variables are also taken into account, the results improve substantially. Hence, though the firms' financial situation has a central role in explaining default probabilities, macroeconomic conditions are also very important when assessing default probabilities over time.

Series such as interest rate spreads, inflation rates, money stocks, aggregate Output, unemployment rates, federal funds rates, federal government debt, and nominal exchange rates are evaluated. After using parametric and nonparametric approaches to identify recession periods in the stock market, we consider both in-sample and out-of-sample tests of the variables' predictive ability. Empirical evidence from monthly data on the Standard & Poor's S&P 500 price index suggests that among the macroeconomic variables we have evaluated, yield curve spreads and inflation rates are the most useful predictors of recessions in the US stock market, according to both in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting performance. Moreover, comparing the bear market prediction to the stock return predictability has shown that it is easier to predict bear markets using macroeconomic variables. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The Diana Project has investigated the supply and demand side of growth capital for women entrepreneurs. The research contributes to entrepreneurship theory as well as to practice, filling a void in knowledge on growth-oriented women entrepreneurship. In this article we present and discuss the research contribution of the Diana Project, in the areas of entrepreneurship, women entrepreneurship and venture capital. We specifically discuss the value of researching a specific group of women entrepreneurs, those who want to grow their businesses, that very clearly demonstrates the positive potential of female entrepreneurship. The Diana Project has also moved research on women's entrepreneurship forward since its framework does not treat women entrepreneurs as other, i.e., the project does not presuppose that women's entrepreneurship is similar to or different from men's entrepreneurship. It assumes that women's entrepreneurship is entrepreneurship and studies it from that point of view.","[Holmquist, Carin] Stockholm Sch Econ, Ctr Entrepreneurship & Business Creat, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden; [Carter, Sara] Univ Strathclyde, Sch Business, Hunter Ctr Entrepreneurship, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",Stockholm School of Economics; University of Strathclyde,"Holmquist, C (通讯作者)，Stockholm Sch Econ, Ctr Entrepreneurship & Business Creat, POB 6501, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden.",carin.holmquist@hhs.se; sara.carter@strath.ac.uk,,"Carter, Sara/0000-0001-5812-4354",,,,,52,23,29,4,56,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

As a part of their organizational competence, international managers need to possess a certain level of business and professional expertise, which is supplemented by multicultural communication and cooperation. They also have to know how to share knowledge in the working teams, cooperate and communicate with employees, business partners, and customers. Information and communication technology (ICT) plays an important role as a tool for increasing of communication competencies important for creating marketing strategies. Therefore the author is mapping (by the structured questionnaire and interviews) all possibilities of used learning materials, ways of sharing ideas and information sources in the company. The results from questionnaire and published researches indicate that it is necessary to use all the variety of knowledge together with the information sources and to share them among the colleagues in an intuitive way.

The support reorientation form market one to the single payments should be assessed positively as a more efficient method in stabilising farming incomes. A step in a good direction is the strengthening the financing of rural areas via the modulation system, since Pillar II plays an important modernisation and pro-development role, and further more it meets the social expectations. In a situation of new challenges it is necessary to implement efficient methods of risk management such as: the new insurance against natural disasters and animals' diseases insurance.","[Czyzewski, Andrzej; Stepien, Sebastian] Poznan Univ Econ, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Czyzewski, A (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ, Poznan, Poland.",,,,,,,,18,1,1,0,2,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-9937-1-3,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2009,,18,,,,,231,239,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BTX02,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288345600032,0

The parliamentary election will be held in April, followed by the presidential election in July. The public is now experienced at voting, and these events are expected to be peaceful and successful. The impact of the GFC is of much greater concern. The economy continued to perform well in 2008. With quite robust economic growth, commendable progress with administrative reform in the finance ministry, and higher than expected oil prices, both tax and non-tax revenues significantly exceeded their 2008 budget targets, leaving the government with unspent funds in excess of Rp 50 trillion. The banking sector also performed well, with lending continuing to expand rapidly. However, there was a significant fall in average capital adequacy as banks took on more risky assets and wrote down their capital in response to falling bond portfolio values. Signs of economic slowdown began to emerge in the second half of 2008, however. The collapse of the global financial services firm Lehman Brothers in September sparked massive sell-offs on stock exchanges and foreign exchange markets around the world, including in Indonesia. In the fourth quarter the disruption in the global economy finally hit Indonesia's real sector. General slowdowns were felt in both the tradable and non-tradable sectors, although the quarterly data were distorted by strong seasonal effects. The robust annual growth of non-oil and gas exports over the last four years came to an abrupt end in the fourth quarter, but the same was true of imports. Thus, although the GFC and a weak rupiah are likely to have a negative impact on export-oriented and high import content industries in 2009, potential balance of payments pressures are more likely to originate in the capital account than in the current account. With a growing expectation that the GFC's impact would intensify, a wide range of fiscal, monetary, finance and trade policy packages were announced in recent months. Financial sector safety net policies were given high priority initially, with the primary aim of supporting the balance of payments rather than avoiding worker lay-offs. Subsequently, fiscal stimulus packages have been introduced, expanded and modified, and the official stance of monetary policy has become more expansionary. However, institutional shortcomings and political bottlenecks seem likely to constrain the effectiveness of these policies as a whole.","[Gunawan, Anton H.] PT Bank Danamon Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Siregar, Reza Y.] IMF Singapore Reg Training Inst, Singapore, Singapore",,"Gunawan, AH (通讯作者)，PT Bank Danamon Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia.",,,,,,,,25,10,10,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-4918,,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Usually, a part of responders do not answer all the questions which we ask to them. There are many reasons why it happens. Responders do not understand the question, do not find a suitable answer among offered answers, can forget to answer some questions or do not have enough time for filling in the whole questionnaire. The paper gives a list of methods suitable for processing the data file with missing values. We focus on such methods which are useable without a need of the special statistical software. The choice of a certain method depends on various factors. The most important factors are type of a variable and a variability of a sample. Both samples with a high variability and samples with a low variability are researched. The used methods are compared then in term of their impact on sample properties. There are presented the methods suitable for work with ordinal, interval and ratio variables. Each of them has its own characteristics which cannot be missed out by a choice of the method. Lastly, the paper deals with the problem whether it is better to replace missing values or to work just with the data truly obtained.","[Gurinova, Katerina; Valentova, Vladimira Hovorkova] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Stat, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,,katerina.gurinova@tul.cz; vladimira.valentova@tul.cz,"Hovorkova Valentova, Vladimira/M-1370-2018","Hovorkova Valentova, Vladimira/0000-0001-5718-315X",,,,,8,0,0,0,0,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-523-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,110,117,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BMK17,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272657000012,0

Finally, a model of governance mechanism of modular organization is constructed.

Existing studies have not yet carefully considered the inter-relationship between public transfers and the existing private transfer network. In the context of the financial crisis in Korea, this paper investigates the possible crowding-out effect of public transfers on private transfers by explicitly considering the endogenous responses of private transfers against public transfers. By using two Korean household-level panel data sets for the periods of 1995-1998 and 1998-2003, we found a post-crisis, but not pre-crisis crowding-out effect of public transfers; more importantly, a crowding-in effect is observed during the crisis. The results suggest that private transfer networks were strengthened under the initial phase of the financial crisis, which possibly complemented public transfers due to the lack of effective formal safety nets, while public transfers became effective after the crisis, thereby replacing private transfers. Our results suggest that particularly at the initial stage of the crisis, the government could have played an important role in assisting households to weather the negative impacts of the crisis.","[Kang, Sung Jin] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea; [Sawada, Yasuyuki] Univ Tokyo, Tokyo 1138654, Japan",Korea University; University of Tokyo,"Kang, SJ (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Econ, 1,5-Ka, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",sjkang@korea.ac.kr,"Kang, Sung Jin/AAL-3546-2020","Kang, Sung Jin/0000-0003-1784-6304; Sawada, Yasuyuki/0000-0002-4167-7697",,,,,21,8,8,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

In this work we develop a partial equilibrium model of an oligopolistic industry in which a number of domestic and foreign firms compete in the market for a homogeneous good in a host country. It is assumed that the number of foreign firms is endogenous and can be affected by the government policy in the host country. The government sets the policy (subsidies) to maximise social welfare. We allow domestic mergers. Our main results suggest that when the host country government imposes discriminatory lump-sum subsidy in favor of foreign firms, a merger of domestic firms will increase the number of FDI if the subsidy level is exogenous. With an endogenous level of subsidy, a merger of domestic firms will decrease (increase) the welfare if the domestic firms are more (less) efficient. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The author thinks it is both congenital factor and acquired factor that make the industry into a state of Dysphasia. Congenital factor decides the features of high-tech industry. As it's known, high-tech industry is of high input, high-risk and high-yield. For acquired factor, Chinese high-tech industry enjoys so little financial-support that it is difficult for debt-financing; let alone long-term debt-financing.

We are discussing whether the current level of foreign exchange reserves of the CNB is excessive or adequate. Special attention is paid to the monetary and financial impact of the loss of the central bank. We are pointing out that losing the central bank means profit for market subjects at the same time.

The empirical results show that: the more long-term debt as a proportion of total debt, the higher possibility the firms fall into financial distress, and this correlations between them is more obvious when the ultimate controlling shareholder is state owned company and in the area where the government intervention is stronger; in contrast, the more the short term debt debt as a proportion of total debt is, the lower possibility the firm falls into financial distress, however, this correlations is much weaker when the ultimate controlling shareholder is private owned company compared with state owned company. The results indicate that the governance mechanism of short-term debt is more effective than that of long-term debt in China because that government mainly give their influence on the long-term debt, however, the governance effect of short term debt in privated owned companies is much weaker than state owned company because that ultimate controlling shareholder of the private owned company is more likely to tunnel the listed company by means of short term debt since they have no competitive power in competition with state owned companies for long-term loans.

Their activity is to organize food and accommodation, temporary and occasional employment of students, and cultural, sports and other activities. They are not the state budget users nor are they financed by their universities founders either. The Ministry of Science supports students by subsidizing, but without defraying the expenses of the student centres activities. As non-profit organizations, everything that centres book as revenues, they should return into the activity again. In accordance with the Act on Institutions, (National Gazette No 76/1993, 29/1997, 47/1999, and 35/2008) student centres are managed by Governing body, and the principal is the manager of the student centre. The Centre can also have Professional body that discusses and makes decisions about professional issues of the centre activity. Internal structure is established by the statute and the surveillance of student centres is conducted by the ministry in charge. The main issue in management of student centres is the answer to the question; how, from the existing revenues, meet all the expenses necessary to easily conduct the activity, regarding the fact that the prices of food and accommodation for students and subsidies from the Ministry of Science, Education and Sport were established by the decision of the Ministry in 1994, and they have not been changed since. Based on the conducted researches, we are of belief that it is possible to significantly improve student centres activity; primarily by introducing permanent mechanisms for automatic correction of food and accommodation prices correspondingly to life expenses, subsidizing from the national budget based on the number of students, improving food quality, ensuring transparent public tender procedures on determining the most suitable suppliers, and providing own additional resources.","[Marinac, Antun] Polytech Pozega, Pozega, Croatia; [Culo, Ivica; Pernar, Lidija] State Audit Off, Pozega, Croatia",,"Marinac, A (通讯作者)，Polytech Pozega, Pozega, Croatia.",amarinac@vup.hr; ivica.culo@revizija.hr; lidija.pernar@revizija.hr,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,978-953-253-061-2,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2009,5.0,,,,,,155,+,,,,,,2,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BMP23,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273265800014,0

Real income stagnation is a conceptually distinct phenomenon from low average growth and other features of the growth sequence that have been previously considered. We find that real income stagnation has affected a significant number of countries (103 out of 168), and resulted in substantial income loss. Countries that suffered spells of real income stagnation were more likely to be poor, in Latin America or sub-Saharan Africa, conflict ridden and dependent on primary commodity exports. Stagnation is also very likely to persist over time.

Our study shows that following the two pollution incidents, some heavy polluting listed companies undertook actions to reduce profits as well as disclose additional environmental information.

The paper analyzes the economic results for the sample of agricultural holdings that are part of our own database of about 150 farms per year. Considering the share of agricultural land in the LFA, farms were divided into the following groups: group I - less than 25%; group II - from 25 (including) to 75% and group III - more than 75%. The average values of each group of the farms calculated as a weighted average were used to determine the resulting values from the data base. Using methods of financial ratio analysis, the following groups of indicators: profitability, including the profit/loss assessment, activity, the debt ratio, and liquidity were calculated for years 2003-2007. The assessment of the profit/loss revealed the necessity of the subsidy policy of the agrarian sector as the share of subsidies in the yields of farms is approximately 20%. Fluctuations of the profit/loss not exceeding 78 million CZK was mainly due to the specific types of farming in plant and animal production and climatic conditions in recent years and problems with sales, in competition with the import of cheap agricultural commodities. Total returns reflected the tendency of the profit/loss and ranged between 5-6%, with the turnover of assets ratio of approximately 0.8. The debt ratio (40%) and liquidity (with values ranged between 3 and 4) can be regarded as satisfactory. The absence of agricultural policy would lead to long-term non-profitability (loss) of all farms. The analysis revealed that there are no significant differences in the efficiency according to the division based on the share of the LFA. The paper contributes to the NAZV QG 60042 research project.","[Svoboda, Jaroslav] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Accounting & Finance, Studentska 13, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Novotna, Martina] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Svoboda, J (通讯作者)，Univ South Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Accounting & Finance, Studentska 13, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.",svoboda@ef.jcu.cz; novotna@ef.jcu.cz,"Svoboda, Jaroslav/AAG-2717-2019","Svoboda, Jaroslav/0000-0003-3831-7962",,,,,4,0,0,0,9,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-523-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,344,+,,,,,,2,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BMK17,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272657000039,0

Integrated Crop Management (ICM) is considered to be a sustainable way of farming that is friendly towards the environment, has a realistic economic potential, and uses up-to-date technology in order to produce high quality goods in the most efficient manner. The objective of this paper is to explore the willingness of producers to pay for the implementation of Integrated Crop Management, to examine the role of training for farmers using this sustainable farming system and, finally, to inquire into whether specific financial support measures are required for ICM implementation. A stratified random sampling procedure was used to collect primary data from a representative sample of certified farms, which were then analysed by means of the chi-square non-parametric statistic. According to the results, the financial support for the system's implementation ranges between 70 and 140 EUR/ha on average. The willingness to pay is at the level of 100 EUR/ha for the majority of farmers, mainly due to the reduction in expenditure for agrochemicals. The willingness to pay is not related to farm income but is significantly linked to the training farmers have received on this sustainable way of farming. The results of the present research can assist policy makers in introducing the required agricultural policy measures for implementing an effective financial support scheme and, by extension, for an effective endorsement of this sustainable farming system.","[Theocharopoulos, Athanasios; Papanagiotou, Evangelos] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Agr Econ, Thessaloniki, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Theocharopoulos, A (通讯作者)，Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Agr Econ, Thessaloniki, Greece.",,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,4,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-9937-1-3,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2009,,18,,,,,29,35,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BTX02,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288345600003,0

That is to say, the funds financing by Tomorrow Technology are not used for its own development, in contrast, most funds are transferred to other non-listed firms in the same group by the controlling shareholder. The results further prove that the alienation of investing and financial behaviors of listed companies would worsen the operating performance and damage the minority shareholders wealth of the listed firms.

In contrast to previous findings of downward-sloping demand curves for equities, we show that demand for newly issued FHLB notes is nearly perfectly elastic during normal market conditions.

If school hiring authorities are able to make good decisions about whom to hire, these reforms have the potential to benefit schools and students. Prior research on teacher transfers uses career history data, identifying the school in which a teacher teaches in each year. When such data are used to see which teachers transfer it is unclear the extent to which the patterns are driven by teacher preferences or school preferences, because the matching of teachers to schools is a two-sided choice. This study uses applications-to-transfer data to examine separately which teachers apply for transfer and which get hired and, in so doing, differentiates teacher from school preferences. Holding all else equal, we find that teachers with better pre-service qualifications (certification exam scores, college competitiveness) are more likely to apply for transfer; while teachers whose students demonstrate higher achievement growth are less likely. On the other hand, schools prefer to hire higher quality teachers across measures that signal quality. The results suggest that not only do more effective teachers prefer to stay in their schools but that schools are able to identify and hire the best candidates when given the opportunity (C) 2010 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.","[Boyd, Don] SUNY Albany, Ctr Policy Res, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Lankford, Hamp] SUNY Albany, Sch Educ, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Loeb, Susanna; Ronfeldt, Matthew] Stanford Univ, Inst Res Educ Policy & Practice, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wyckoff, Jim] Univ Virginia, Curry Sch Educ, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; Stanford University; University of Virginia,"Boyd, D (通讯作者)，SUNY Albany, Ctr Policy Res, Albany, NY 12222 USA.",,,"Wyckoff, James/0000-0002-5223-6221; Loeb, Susanna/0000-0003-1854-8843",,,,,20,96,209,1,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

We employ the Johansen cointegration technique, Toda and Yamamoto's Granger causality test, the generalized impulse response approach, and variance decomposition analysis to find out the extent and the magnitude of their relationships. The estimated long-run relationship between regional house prices appears to have remained stable throughout the sample period. Our empirical results show a bidirectional relationship between house prices in the most important economic center, Taipei City, and its suburban area, Taipei County. However, there are no causalities of house prices between Taipei City and other megacities in Taiwan. The mutual impacts of the shocks between house prices in Taipei City and Taipei County are significantly positive, while these impacts on Kaohsiung City, far from Taipei City, are insignificant. Finally, the results of the generalized impulse response approach indicate that the house prices indices of Taipei City are the most exogenous while those for Taipei County are the most endogenous.

This configuration of policy is argued to be of both historical and contemporary interest, in economies such as the US and Japan. It is shown that higher average levels and moderate average maturities of debt can induce macroeconomic instability for a range of policies specified as simple rules. However, interest-rate pegs combined with active fiscal policies almost always ensure macroeconomic stability. This suggests that in periods where the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates is a relevant constraint on policy design, a switch in fiscal regime is desirable. J. Japanese mt.

In this study we introduce a novel approach to investigating the endowment effect, the factorial survey design, which enables manipulation of variables potentially influencing the endowment effect. We consider the value and uniqueness of the possession, whether it is a gift from a close friend and whether the trade is with a stranger. We find a higher endowment effect for possessions received as gifts from a close friend and this effect is entirely due to responses from women. Furthermore, we find significantly higher endowment effects for valuable possessions.

Apart from the determinants of capital flows the possibility of speculative attacks is also considered. Applying the ordinary least squares (OLS) method it is found that variables linked to external factors such as the differential of domestic and foreign interest rates and financial crises, such as the Asian and Russian financial turmoil of 1997 and 1998 respectively, are the main factors influencing capital inflows and outflows in Greece during the period 1983-2009. Additionally the results of probit analysis support that the same factors are significant in determining the probability of speculative attacks to the Greek economy.","Univ Aegean, Dept Business Adm, Chios 82100, Greece",University of Aegean,"Pappas, AP (通讯作者)，Univ Aegean, Dept Business Adm, Michalon 8 str, Chios 82100, Greece.",anastasios1977@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,4,6,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Also, corporate leverage declines when creditor rights are stronger. These relations are usually strongest in countries where management is dismissed in reorganization and are also observed over time following changes in creditor rights. Our results thus identify a potentially adverse consequence of strong creditor rights. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We focus on banks' historical leverage ratios. The overall leverage ratio of the Turkish banking system is lower than the US especially after the 2001 crisis. Bank-level panel regressions using both annual and quarterly data covering 1994-2009 period reveal that similar to US banks, Turkish banks adjust leverage procyclically. That is, they increase (decrease) leverage when their balance sheets expand (contract). Although procyclical leverage could be destabilizing, we find that Turkish banks exhibit a quantitatively smaller degree of leverage growth compared to US. We also find that tight regulatory and supervisory reforms implemented in Turkey after the 2001 crisis significantly reduced leverage growth. This is in contrast with the financial deregulation trend in the US in the years before the global crisis.","Fatih Univ, Ekon Bolumu, TR-34500 Istanbul, Turkey",Fatih University,"Çaliskan, A (通讯作者)，Fatih Univ, Ekon Bolumu, TR-34500 Istanbul, Turkey.",ahmetcaliskan@fatih.edu.tr,,,,,,,24,3,3,0,4,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

Typical analyses of gains from trade ignore the effects of free trade on factor prices. When Europe forms a free trade area with a high-wage economy, the equalized wage rises and rent declines, while the price of the importable declines. Workers unambiguously benefit, but integration has an ambiguous effect on capitalists. However, consumers as a whole benefit from the integration and workers can more than offset the losses of the capitalists. On the other hand, Europe's integration with a low-wage economy raises rent but lowers the wage and the price of the labor-intensive good. Accordingly, capitalists unambiguously benefit, but integration has an ambiguous effect on workers. Again, welfare of all consumers rises and the capitalists can more than offset the losses of workers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Choi, E.

Estimates from within-group panel data models indicate that financial capability has significant and substantial effects on psychological health over and above those associated with income and material wellbeing more generally. For men, having low financial capability has an effect larger than that associated with being unemployed, while for women it is similar to that of being divorced. Furthermore having low financial capability exacerbates the psychological costs associated with unemployment and divorce, while high financial capability reduces these costs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Using a unique and a manually collected dataset, we identify 698 CBAs made by emerging country firms during the period January 1991 through December 2008. Targets tend to be small (by U.S. transaction value measures) - the median ranging between $10 million and $40 million (in 2008 dollars). However, from 2000 to 2008, 24 acquisitions were worth more than a billion dollars each. Emerging country acquirers experience a positive and a significant market response of 1.09% on the announcement day. Additionally, in the cross-section, acquirer returns are positively correlated with (better) corporate governance measures in the target country. The positive announcement return and the cross-sectional relation between these returns and governance measures are consistent with Martynova and Renneboog's (2008) and Khanna and Palepu's (2004) bootstrapping hypothesis: the acquirer voluntarily bootstraps itself to the higher governance standards of the target - resulting in a positive valuation impact for the acquirer.

Cash payment offers made during nontrading hours are more likely to deter potential bidders and complete proposed transactions. However, we find no such relationship for daytime announcements.

The first corresponds to a high mean-low variance regime and the second regime is characterized by a low mean and a high variance.

In the field of mortality risk reductions elicited willingness to pay values in one risk context, say road safety, are frequently applied in other risk contexts like air pollution. However, differences in risk perception and the population at risk across contexts are likely to result in diverging VSL estimates. In a meta-analysis of 26 international stated preference studies, a Bayesian model is estimated regressing contingent values for mortality risk reductions, originating from three different risk contexts, on the characteristics of the risk reduction itself and additional variables characterizing the underlying studies. A willingness to pay (WTP) premium for mortality risk reductions in the air pollution and general mortality risk context relative to improving road safety is observed. Evaluated at the mean, road safety VSL estimates should be multiplied by a factor 1.8 before being applicable in the air pollution context. Moreover, in an illustrative BT exercise we find limited overlap in the set of context specific predictive VSL distributions. Consequently, 'out of context' BT results in a substantial over- or underestimation of the VSL.","[Dekker, Thijs; Brouwer, Roy; Hofkes, Marjan] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Moeltner, Klaus] Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Dekker, T (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",thijs.dekker@ivm.vu.nl,"Dekker, Thijs/M-7763-2013; Hofkes, Marjan/L-1281-2013; Brouwer, Roy/M-9437-2013","Dekker, Thijs/0000-0003-2313-8419; Hofkes, Marjan/0000-0001-8185-8014; Brouwer, Roy/0000-0002-0525-2050",,,,,107,46,46,1,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

As more people become obese, the social stigma of obesity may be reduced. Marriage has typically been used as a positive signal to employers. If obese individuals possess other characteristics that are valued in the labour market they may no longer face a wage penalty for their physical appearance. This paper investigates the relationship between marital status, body mass index (BMI), and wages by estimating a double selection model that controls for selection into the labour and marriage markets using waves 14 and 16 (2004 and 2006) of the British Household Panel Survey. Results suggest that unobserved characteristics related to marriage and labour market participation are causing an upward bias on the BMI coefficients. The BMI coefficient is positive and significant for married men only in the double selection model. The findings provide evidence that unobserved characteristics related to success in the marriage and labour market may influence the relationship between BMI and wages.","Univ Aberdeen, Aberdeen AB9 1FX, Scotland",University of Aberdeen,"Brown, H (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Aberdeen AB9 1FX, Scotland.",,"Brown, Heather/GYU-1759-2022","Brown, Heather/0000-0002-0067-991X","Chief Scientist Office [HERU1] Funding Source: researchfish; Medical Research Council [G0802291] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [G0802291] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [G0802291(89853), G0802291] Funding Source: Medline; Chief Scientist Office [HERU1] Funding Source: Medline",Chief Scientist Office(Chief Scientist Office - Scotland); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Chief Scientist Office,,,36,10,13,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0036-9292,,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

Using a Chinese firm-level panel dataset covering 2001-05, the paper decomposes productivity growth into technical change and efficiency improvement and examines the impact of indigenous and foreign innovation efforts on these changes. Indigenous firms are found to be the leading force on the technological frontier in the low- and medium-technology industries, while foreign-invested firms enjoy a clear lead in the high-technology sector. Collective indigenous R&D activities at the industry level are found to be the major driver of technology upgrading of indigenous firms that push out the technology frontier. While foreign investment appears to contribute to static industry capabilities, R&D activities of foreign-invested firms have exerted a significant negative effect on the technical change of local firms over the sample period.

In the absence of pension insurance, the firm minimizes costs by rendering promised benefits free of risk to workers, who are assumed to be unable to hedge firm-specific risk. Various forms of government intervention, such as benefit guarantees, can alter this outcome dramatically by providing the firm with an incentive to shift risk to other parties. In this case, we find that the firm's decisions depend on, among other influences, the degree of insurance mispricing, the amount of guaranteed benefits, the stringency of minimum funding requirements, and the costs of financial distress.

Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), which administered the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale during its 1980 and 1987 interviews, I provide further evidence for the existence of a self-esteem premium by exploiting variation in these measures between the 2 years. I show that self-esteem in 1980 has a sizeable impact on wages 8 years later, controlling for a wide set of individual characteristics and addressing problems of omitted variable bias and reverse causality. The instrumental variables estimate of the effect of self-esteem in 1987 on earnings is about two times greater than previous OLS estimates would imply. The main explanation for this discrepancy is that the previous OLS estimates are biased downward as a result of measurement error in the reported self-esteem measure. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

These tables present statistical-model-based estimates of the educational effectiveness of schools, together with 95 per cent confidence intervals to communicate their statistical uncertainty. However, this information, particularly the notion of statistical uncertainty, is hard for users to understand. There is a real need to make school performance tables clearer. The media attempt to do this for the public by ranking schools in so-called 'school league tables'; however, they invariably discard the 95 per cent confidence intervals and, in doing so, encourage the public to over-interpret differences in schools' ranks. In this paper, we explore a simulation method to produce simple graphical summaries of schools' ranks that clearly communicate their associated uncertainty.","[Leckie, George; Goldstein, Harvey] Univ Bristol, Ctr Multilevel Modelling, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Leckie, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Ctr Multilevel Modelling, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England.",g.leckie@bristol.ac.uk; h.goldstein@bristol.ac.uk,"Leckie, George/F-4599-2010","Leckie, George/0000-0003-1486-745X; Goldstein, Harvey/0000-0003-3878-4122",ESRC [ES/F031904/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F031904/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,7,30,33,1,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0143-5671,,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

I propose a new index of bank loan portfolio liquidity which can be thought of as a weighted average of the potential to securitize loans of a given type, where the weights reflect the composition of a bank loan portfolio. I use this new index to show that by allowing banks to convert illiquid loans into liquid funds, securitization reduces banks' holdings of liquid securities and increases their lending ability. Furthermore, securitization provides banks with an additional source of funding and makes bank lending less sensitive to cost of funds shocks. By extension, the securitization weakens the ability of the monetary authority to affect banks' lending activity but makes banks more susceptible to liquidity and funding crisis when the securitization market is shut down.

The results show that economic gains under the trade agreements are only significant if foreign investment increases or value added taxes are modified. Winners and losers depend on the agreement; however, unskilled labor-intensive sectors always progress. Consequently, these agreements seem to be good for the poorest groups. Some natural resource intensive sectors significantly increase their production with the EU and the US agreements, also increasing the environmental pressures.

Using panel data covering the period 1970 to 2000 for up to 115 countries, results indicate the existence of a differentiated effect in the relationship between age structure and international capital flows. Good institutions allow for a differentiated impact of age structure on saving and investment, opening the scope for an impact of age structure in driving international capital flows. In contrast, bad institutions result in no effect of age structure on international capital flows. Despite increased credit availability contributing to reduced aggregate saving, this will nevertheless magnify the role of the population age structure in driving international capital flows. Over the past three decades, age structure changes are estimated to have contributed to improve the current account position by five per cent of GDP in more advanced aging countries. However, around the year 2020, population age structure changes are projected to deteriorate the current account position in the latter countries which will experience a drop in saving. In other regions, the faster the current aging process, the sharper the projected improvement in the current account position. This improvement is projected to reverse itself, at a later stage in time in regions with a slower aging process. Also, our results suggest that in order to take advantage of their younger population in the form of increased foreign capital inflows, countries that are less advanced in the demographic transition would need to improve the quality of their institutional arrangements before the window of opportunity closes.

Analyzing Chinese SEOs during 1994-2008 and controlling for other factors reflecting features of Chinese corporate finance, we find that Chinese SEOs are mostly motivated by timing the market. Financing for investment and growth receives weak empirical support. We do not obtain any consistent evidence supporting both the tradeoff and the agency theories. In addition, we find that the firm's SEOs behavior varies between rights issues and public offerings and across different periods along with the progress of China's market transition. Our results show that Chinese listed firms in general behave similarly as their counterparts in other countries concerning SEOs decisions in that they issue SEOs when there are opportunities to take advantage of market overvaluation. These results are consistent with the well-documented convergence trend of corporate SEOs behavior of firms around the world. In addition, our findings challenge the conventional perception on Chinese SEOs that controlling shareholders use SEOs as a means to expropriate minority shareholders. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Although there is no measure in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that directly addresses the use of product labeling, WTO and others have been skeptical to mandatory product labeling on the grounds that they may be used as hidden protectionism hampering global welfare. This study has two foci. First, we examine how different policies for the production and use of GMOs might influence the market outcome in consumer food markets. Second, we evaluate the welfare effects of the policy measures. We find that mandatory labeling often increases domestic welfare and, may also enhance global welfare.

In the first type, stable smallholder farming bringing high returns puts upward pressure on wages. In the second type, smallholder farming that does not bring sufficient returns leads to semi-proletarianization in which workers' access to rural sources of income functions as wage subsidy and puts downward pressure on wages. This paper argues that the situation in Turkey between 1950 and 1980 fits the second type. By pointing out the factors that changed the attitude of the migrant labourers towards class struggle from relative passivity to increasing militancy, it suggests that instead of the rural ties of the emerging working class, the main reason behind the dramatic rise in urban wages in Turkey in the 1960s and 1970s was the working-class struggle throughout the period.","Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Sociol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Johns Hopkins University,"Gürel, B (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Sociol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",gburak1@jhu.edu,"GUREL, BURAK/I-4503-2019","GUREL, BURAK/0000-0002-1666-8748",,,,,69,17,19,1,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

We extend the current literature by analyzing how relationship lending affects loan contract terms and credit availability in an empirical model that simultaneously accounts for all three of these factors. Based on Japanese survey data we find evidence that the benefits from stronger bank-borrower relationships in terms of credit availability are limited to smaller banks. However, when the benefits are measured as improved credit terms, we find little additional benefit, and in some cases increased cost, from stronger relationships for opaque borrowers and for borrowers who get funding from small banks. These latter findings suggest the possibility that relationship borrowers may suffer from capture effects. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Because it is expected that EMS implementation increases a firm's value added through an increase in demand and an improvement in productivity, a simple model to identify how these effects influence a firm's value added is developed and is empirically investigated using panel data for Japanese manufacturing firms in the period 1996-2007. The main findings are as follows. For the full sample, EMS implementation increases a firm's value added through an increase in demand and improvement in productivity. Among these firms, however, the positive effect of the implementation through an increase in demand mainly exists for export-oriented firms. At the industry level, the effects of EMS implementation vary among different industries. These results empirically prove that there are plural paths for EMS implementation to improve a firm's economic performance.","Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Int Dev & Cooperat, Hiroshima 7398529, Japan",Hiroshima University,"Nishitani, K (通讯作者)，Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Int Dev & Cooperat, 1-5-1 Kagamiyama Higashi Hiroshima, Hiroshima 7398529, Japan.",kimitakan@hiroshima-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,45,55,57,1,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

For a sample of 134 bidding banks, we employ the Merton distance to default model to show that, on average, bank mergers are risk neutral. However, for relatively safe banks, mergers generate a significant increase in default risk. This result is particularly pronounced for cross-border and activity-diversifying deals as well as for deals completed under weak bank regulatory regimes. Also, large deals, which pose organizational and procedural hurdles, experience a merger-related increase in default risk.

Factor analysis reveals that rates on large loans and small loans with long rate fixation periods have weakly converged in the sense that, up to a fixed effect, their evolution is driven by common factors only. In contrast, the price evolution of small loans with short rate fixation periods is still affected by country-specific dynamic factors. There are few signs that bank loan rates are becoming more uniform with time. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Wagenvoort, Rien J. L.

Higher investment bank reputation is associated with 1) more active filing price revisions and 2) reduced secondary market volatility, indicating greater resolution of uncertainty before trading begins. Revisions of nonreputable banks cluster on exactly zero dollars. Finally, the partial adjustment phenomenon - often attributed to information aggregation - is primarily due to the behavior of reputable underwriters.

The analysis of the data showed that the Ghana Private Road Transport Union (GPRTU) continues to dominate in the intra-urban commuter service. Also, in spite of persistent complaints from consumers about the high cost of transport fares, it is rather the cost of food, children's education, clothing and to some extent personal entertainment which consume a disproportionate share of residents' disposable incomes. Notwithstanding this finding, respondents' expectation is to pay less than they are doing now for commuting within the study areas. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that the overall governance structure has a significant impact on how managers make decisions on investment policy: strong bondholder governance motivates more low-risk investments such as capital expenditure and lower high-risk investments such as R&D expenditures, whereas weak shareholder governance (entrenched managers) leads to more R&D expenditures. Moreover, we find that the effects of governance on investment policy differ significantly between speculative and investment-grade firms. For speculative firms, strong bondholder or shareholder governance leads to more capital expenditures and low R&D investments. For investment-grade firms, strong bondholder or shareholder governance leads to low capital expenditures and an insignificant impact on R&D investments. Furthermore, financing and investment covenants exhibit strong binding power to deter risky investments. Finally, a more dependent (or a less independent) board is associated with low capital expenditures and high R&D investments. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Concentration and deconcentration patterns for different markets have been identified. For this purpose, we use the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), the Concentration Ratio (CR) and the Lorenz curve. From our analysis, we conclude that seat capacity follows a deconcentration pattern due to the growth of low-cost carriers at small- and medium-sized Spanish airports. This is in line with earlier studies for Europe as a whole. Intercontinental seat capacity still remains very much concentrated in Madrid and, to a lesser extent, in Barcelona. However, new strategies by long-haul airlines bypassing the primary European hubs foster the deconcentration of seat capacity in the Asian and North American markets. In the case of Spain, the recent liberalization of the EU-US market may become an important enabler of such network strategies, e.g., Delta has operated a route from Valencia to New York-JFK since 2009. In other intercontinental markets, capacity is more and more concentrated in Madrid. We highlight the restructuring of Iberia's network as an important factor behind the increasing dominance of Madrid in intercontinental markets. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Fearsome risks are highly available. The availability bias tells us that this leads people to overestimate their frequency. Therefore, they also overreact to curtail the likelihood or consequences of such risks. More generally, fear can paralyze efforts to think clearly about risks. We draw on a range of environmental risks to show the following: (1) Fear leads us to neglect probability of occurrence; (2) As fearsome environmental risks are usually imposed by others (as externalities), indignation stirs excess reaction; (3) We often misperceive or miscalculate such risks. Two experiments demonstrate probability neglect when fearsome risks arise: (a) willingness-to-pay to eliminate the cancer risk from arsenic in water (described in vivid terms) did not vary despite a 10-fold variation in risk; (b) the willingness-to-accept price for a painful but non dangerous electric shock did not vary between a 1 and 100% chance. Possible explanations relate to the role of the amygdala in impairing cognitive brain function. Government and the law, both made by mortals and both responding to public pressures, similarly neglect probabilities for fearsome risks.

Analyzing patterns of communal identity politics, this article revisits the spatial history of Jaffa since 1948. Against theories of urban ethnocracy predicated on the convergence of state policies and capitalist accumulation, which in turn engender longstanding spatial segregation between Jews and Arabs and between new and old residents, I argue that it is precisely the indeterminate contact zones between communities and spaces that constitute the political and cultural realities in these cities. Proposing a relational reading of these spatial dynamics, this article shows that in contradistinction to the basic premise of the nation-state, in Jaffa as well as other mixed towns, the coupling between space and identity collapses. The concepts of spatial heteronomy and stranger relations are proposed to characterize the challenge raised by ethnically mixed towns to the Jewish state and to the ethnonational logic that guides it.

They find that regulatory policy instruments aimed at reducing local air pollution have been introduced in most countries in the world. On the other hand, fiscal policy instruments aimed at reducing congestion or greenhouse gas emissions are limited mainly to industrialized economies. Although traditional fiscal instruments, such as fuel taxes and subsidies, are normally introduced for other purposes, they can also help to reduce externalities. Land-use or urban planning, and infrastructure investment, could also contribute to reducing externalities; but they are expensive and play a small role in already developed megacities. The main factors that influence the choice of policy instruments include economic efficiency, equity, country or city specific priority, and institutional capacity for implementation.

Little empirical research on the effect of environmental disclosure together with environmental performance on firm performance is done in Southeast Asian countries. This study extends the literature that has been done mostly in western societies by proposing a further linkage between environmental disclosure, environmental performance, and financial performance, which is rarely investigated in developing societies. The study analyzed 33 Indonesian manufacturing firms that are listed in Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX) and report their environmental performance assessment to the Ministry of Environment Indonesia. Statistic methods used for testing the hypothesis are T-test and multivariate regression model. The empirical results reveal that environmental performance has significantly influenced financial performance of the Indonesian manufacturing firm. However, one striking finding in this study is the insignificant influence of environmental disclosure on firm financial performance. Meanwhile, environmental performance and disclosure simultaneously have significant effect on firm financial performance.

A model is presented where rich voters can block redistribution by buying the votes of some poor voters. In equilibrium there is only limited redistribution and income tax rates are a negative function of government corruption. When rich voters can bribe the government, an additional equilibrium with zero taxation is possible. The link between corruption and tax rates is tested using cross country data; the empirical evidence is fully consistent with the predictions of the model.","Univ Innsbruck, Dept Publ Finance, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria",University of Innsbruck,"Balafoutas, L (通讯作者)，Univ Innsbruck, Dept Publ Finance, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",loukas.balafoutas@uibk.ac.at,"Balafoutas, Loukas/Q-6025-2018","Balafoutas, Loukas/0000-0002-3477-5096",,,,,44,2,3,1,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2011,146.0,1-2,,,,,185,203,,10.1007/s11127-009-9589-6,0.0,,,19,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,691TK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285103500010,0

Prior to TPS issuance and the LTCM bailout, SND yield spreads are sensitive to conventional firm-specific default risk measures, but not after the bailout.

In order to determine organizational competences or technological capabilities for open innovation, we explore the characteristics of open source software development projects as successful examples how organizations can enhance their businesses by using the ideas of open innovation. Hafkesbrink & Schroll, 2009, clustered organizational competences for open innovation in digital economy in three dimensions of organizational readiness, collaborative capabilities and absorptive capacities. As a backbone of each of these dimensions appear the technological enhancement and existing of adequate collaboration and communication tools. One of the main benefits of the Semantic Web (SW) approach is the ability to model a knowledge structure using ontology as the starting point. Ontologies are highly suitable to represent consensus knowledge and its structure. This is exactly what is needed to exchange information within a community of interest and to enable automated processing of information items. SW technologies have the potential to improve information processing and knowledge sharing, increasing the quality of current applications and providing more sophisticated features for end users, but most of these theoretical advantages are not easily exploitable by real world applications (Lara et all, 2002). In this article we explore possibilities of semantic web infrastructure development to support organizational competences for open innovation. The idea is not new and it seems that the SW is very suitable for OI infrastructure requirements, but both disciplines recorded a decade of development without significant mutual application of research results. In order to identify the obstacles to intensive common development, we made the SWOT analysis for introduction of SW technologies in this stage of development as a main infrastructure for open innovation organization.","[Bevanda, Vanja; Turk, Marko] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Dept Econ & Tourism, Pula 52100, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,,vbevanda@efpu.hr; mturk@efpu.hr,"Bevanda, Vanja/N-1639-2018",,,,,,23,0,0,0,4,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

The industry usually has existing CAD and CAE procedures that can handle large-scale finite element calculations for complex geometries. Structural optimization using TOSCA structure helps to find optimized design proposals in a very early phase of the product development cycle and dramatically reduces the overall development costs and time. In the industry structural calculations is often done by finite element modeling. Normally, the degrees freedom of the finite element models is constrained by the capacity of computer power available for solving the model. Frequently, an industrial designer will also prefer to use his daily preprocessor for constructing the finite element models for the optimization. The purpose of the present paper is to show that optimization allows to be conducted in an already existing CAD flow for large-scale models having a high number of degrees freedom, a realistic geometry and boundary conditions, which finally can be done in an earlier faze of design product which assure the robustness reliability of product.","[Boca, Gratiela Dana] North Univ Baia Mare, Fac Sci, Baia Mare, Romania",Technical University of Cluj Napoca,,bocagratiela@yahoo.com,"BOCA, Gratiela Dana/HZL-1079-2023","BOCA, Gratiela Dana/0000-0003-3684-2384",,,,,8,1,1,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-6-9,,,,2011,,,,,,,2122,2129,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEO28,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000317550001100,0

The turn-of-the-year is hypothesized to be a time of renewed optimism. Indeed, investor sentiment, as measured by the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Confidence, peaks in January. Thus, optimists are expected to bid up the stock prices of firms with higher levels of uncertainty in January. These firms will subsequently underperform as they disappoint investors during the remainder of the year. Despite the disappointment, the January pattern persists due to the false hope syndrome described in the psychology literature. Using forecast dispersion to proxy for uncertainty, the results are consistent with the optimism hypothesis. Similar reasoning may help explain other anomalies.","Univ New Hampshire, Whittemore Sch Business & Econ, Durham, NH 03824 USA",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire,"Ciccone, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ New Hampshire, Whittemore Sch Business & Econ, McConnell Hall,15 Acad Way, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",stephen.ciccone@unh.edu,,,,,,,40,24,27,3,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1542-7560,,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

Setting as a leading goal the client's rational/emotional fidelity, the strategy of gaining customer fidelity implies two positive effects for the company: individualizing the relationship with the client and improving the company's performance. The development of the strategy implying gaining customer fidelity is conditioned by the manner in which a company can operate with three variables: customer satisfaction, customer fidelity and customer loyalty. Modeling in a correct manner these three variables enables the company to segment the relevant market in profitable ways.

The Hispanic diaspora, however, has resulted in very large Hispanic public school enrollment growth in 30 new settlement metropolitan areas (such as Atlanta and Charlotte). The percentage of the nation's Latino public school students that are educated in the schools of the new settlement areas has nearly doubled since 1993. The quality of public schools varies across states and metropolitan areas. On average, the public schools educating Hispanics in the 30 new settlement areas have different characteristics than the schools in the 48 traditional Hispanic metro areas. Examination of the rudimentary characteristics of the public schools educating Latinos in the new settlement areas suggests that the diaspora has not necessarily diminished the educational context of Hispanic youth. The new settlement public schools are more suburban. They tend to be smaller, are less likely to be high poverty schools (as measured by Title I status), and have smaller pupil-to-teacher ratios. At the school level, Hispanic students in the new settlement schools have more exposure to white students than their peers educated in schools in the traditional Hispanic metros. The impact of the Hispanic enrollment boom in the 30 new settlement metros was concentrated in about one-out-of-eight public schools. Compared to other public schools in the new settlement metros, the high Hispanic growth schools experienced abrupt changes since 1993. The highly impacted schools went from being majority white schools to majority minority schools by 2004. Unlike other schools, they grew substantially in size in spite of white student enrollment declines. These changes are noteworthy because although only about one-in-eight schools was affected, these schools educate 40% of Latinos in the new settlement areas.","[Fry, Richard] Pew Hispan Ctr, Washington, DC USA",,,rfry@pewhispanic.org,,,,,,,23,10,17,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4419-6681-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,15,36,,10.1007/978-1-4419-6682-7_2,0.0,,,22,Economics; Ethnic Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Ethnic Studies,BTU03,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288059300002,0

Although channels through which disruptions in financial markets can affect economic activity are relatively well understood from a theoretical perspective, assessing their quantitative implications for the real economy remains a considerable challenge. This paper examines the extent to which the workhorse New Keynesian model augmented with the standard financial accelerator mechanism is capable of producing the dynamics of the U.S. economy during the recent financial crisis. To do so, we employ the methodology of Gilchrist and Zakrajsek (2011) to construct a measure of shocks to the financial sector, which is then used to simulate the model over the crisis period. The results indicate that a reasonably calibrated version of the model can closely match the observed decline in economic activity and can account for the sharp widening of nonfinancial credit spreads, a decline in nominal short-term interest rates, and for the persistent disinflation experienced in the wake of financial disruptions. Given its empirical relevance, we then use this framework to analyze the potential benefits of a monetary policy rule that allows the short-term nominal rate to respond to changes in financial conditions as measured by movements in credit spreads. The results indicate that such a spread-augmented policy rule can effectively dampen the negative consequences of financial disruptions on real economic activity, while engendering only a modest increase in inflation.

Assets of the fund are invested in cash, stocks, and a rolling bond. Interest rates are driven by a Vasicek model. The objective is to minimize both the quadratic spread between the contribution rate and the normal cost, and the quadratic spread between the terminal wealth and the mathematical reserve required to cover benefits. The optimization is done under a budget constraint that guarantees the actuarial equilibrium between the current asset and future contributions and benefits.

Attitudes factored into four: energy-saving, general energy/environment concerns, don't care and price/convenience motivation; differences in these and other measures were found between Czech and UK drivers. The focus group findings indicated some use for telematics devices, either to present drivers with targets and challenges or in relation to feedback-informed insurance premia for younger drivers.

Nevertheless, the curtailments in the government's budget as well as the major downturn in the global economy have significantly affected the public infrastructure provision. Therefore, the government has invited the private concessionaires to partake in the provision of the public infrastructure projects via Public Private Partnership (PPP) in reducing the government's burden, yet minimal is responded. Among the reasons obstructing the private concessionaires' participation is the negative perception by the concessionaires on the development of monopolies by certain groups of private concessionaires embedded in the public infrastructure provision in Malaysia which consequently reduces the healthy competition among concessionaires and ultimately demotivates the concessionaires to participate in the public infrastructure provision. Thus, this paper is materialized with the aim of developing the framework of relational contract elements in public infrastructure project provision, which are observed as the better solution for this dilemma. Questionnaire surveys on 22 respondents of construction industry players are undertaken to determine the elements of relational contract suitable to be adopted in public infrastructure provision in Malaysia in encouraging the involvement of private concessionaires. The results show that relational contract elements of clearly defined scope, integrated project team, mutual alignment of goals and open honest communication should be included in the relational contract elements frameworks due to its potential in overcoming the current recession of private concessionaire's initiatives and ultimately improving the public infrastructure provision in Malaysia.","[Ismail, Syuhaida] Univ Technol Malaysia Int Campus, RAZAK Sch Engn & Adv Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,,syuhaida@ic.utm.my; aminahyusof@utm.my; shwai2@live.utm.my,"Ismail, Syuhaida/K-6892-2019","Ismail, Syuhaida/0000-0001-6058-7497; Wai, SoonHan/0000-0003-1082-5746",,,,,27,0,0,0,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-6-9,,,,2011,,,,,,,1936,1949,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEO28,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000317550001080,0

Facility management was first introduced in the US in the 1950s as a tool for enhancing business interaction and productivity. Today there are numerous international and national FM/AM associations and institutes, the most important among them are IFMA, BIFM, Global FM, Global Asset Management, ABRAMAN, SLURP USA, AMC, EFNMS and in Croatia it is Croatian Maintainers Association - HDO which covers both disciplines in management. The common goal of all associations is transfer of knowledge and expertise through various programmes of education, certification and gaining skills for a new profession facility and asset manager. Management of physical assets (their selection, maintenance, supervision and renewal) plays a key role in performance and profitability of any industry in which physical asset operations represent core activities. Good asset management practice can assist managers in making the right decision, optimisation of processes and minimisation of total costs during assets life cycle. In Croatia there is no education, comprehensive methodology and standard that would regulate this area, but parts of these activities are taken to cover under Croatian Association for Mainteners (HDO) activities. The future work of Croatian practitioners will be focused on education and harmonization of standards and participation in developing of the EU asset management strategy model. Generally, the businesses dealing with operations in which physical assets make up a large portion of balance sheet and income statement must treat facility and asset management as a strategic activity and not just maintenance cost. Academic and business communities recognised the importance of asset management as a fast developing, multidisciplinary field of science, making part of strategic management. Surveys conducted in Croatia indicated considerable discrepancy between envious technology level of production and the level of management and particularly asset management (survey included construction industry). Knowledge and competencies are crucial for sustainable economy which is a strategic orientation of Croatia's future development. Lack of adequate education has significant negative impact on the whole country and the companies, but also on our lives and environment including nature, ecology, health but also overall competitiveness.","[Katicic, Ljiljana] HDO, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",,,ljiljana.katicic@gmail.com; ivan.susnjar@ina.hr,,,,,,,30,0,0,2,10,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

An important step in the process of consolidation of the tax laws of Romania and its harmonization to the European Union regulation framework was the entering into force of the Tax Code Act in 2004, which represents fundamental regulations on taxation. In the year 2005, the Tax Code was amended, and new regulations have marked a new approach in fiscal policy. The system of compulsory social security contributions has been changed. The application of these regulations determined changes the tax and social security structure, and, in the consolidated budget, the rate of the tax burden and the rate of social pressure decreased. During the economic crisis, also, there were adopted fiscal and social measures. In this paper, we will conduct an analysis on the impact of tax measures on employment in Romania.

Simulation studies were performed to evaluate the performance measures like average machine utilization, average work-in-process (WIP) and average WIP holding time in these production lines when each of them was run with the optimized number of Kanbans. In other words, the three pull control systems were compared in their optimum situation. According to the results, CONWIP has the fewest average WIP and average WIP holding time as compared to the other systems. In terms of average machine utilization, all the three production control systems behaved almost the same. Overall, it can be said that CONWIP outperformed BSCS and KCS, and BSCS showed the worst performance in the above criteria.","[Mirbirjandian, Ehsan; Wong, Kuan Yew] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Mech Engn, Utm Skudai 81310, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,,ehsan.birjandian@gmail.com; wongky@mail.fkm.utm.my,"Wong, Kuan Yew/D-1577-2010",,,,,,8,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-6-9,,,,2011,,,,,,,1437,1444,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEO28,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000317550001030,0

In order to certify our opinion, we take samples from the credit database of SMEs in Beijing, China. By comparing the fitness of models with different candidate indicators and the order of variables picked up according to the improvement of likelihood ratio with Binary logistic regression, we find the qualitative indicators, which reflect the features of enterprises and their owners, turn, out to be more effective in default forecasting of SMEs than traditional financial indicators.

Although both the systematic and idiosyncratic components of slope are priced, the idiosyncratic component dominates the systematic component in explaining the return predictability of slope.

While capital structure is pro-cyclical at dates when firms re-lever, it is counter-cyclical in aggregate dynamics, consistent with empirical evidence.

We propose that the current methodological void at the heart of Basel II, Pillar 2 is filled with the recommendation that banks develop fully-integrated models for economic capital that relate asset values to fundamental drivers of risk in the economy to capture systematic effects and inter-asset dependencies in a way that crude correlation assumptions do not. We implement a fully-integrated risk analysis based on the balance sheet of a composite European bank using an economic-scenario generation model calibrated to conditions at the end of 2007. Our results suggest that the more modular, correlation-based approaches to economic capital that currently dominate practice could have led to an undercapitalisation of banks, a result that is clearly of interest given subsequent events. The introduction of integrated economic-scenario-based models in future can improve capital adequacy, enhance Pillar 2's application and rejuvenate the relevance of the Basel regulatory framework.

By conducting a case study on six advertising agencies operating in Turkey, each representing a different performance level and ownership status, methods of knowledge gathering, sharing, and accumulation in knowledge intensive business firms are examined and the knowledge related factors that may help to increase competitiveness of these firms are explored. The results indicate that the nature of ownership is a strong determinant of using knowledge in knowledge intensive businesses. In addition, accumulating knowledge by getting experienced in different industries and serving for different clients may become a competitive advantage for these firms.","[Sahin, Cigdem] Dogus Univ, TR-34722 Istanbul, Turkey; [Ansal, Hacer] Isik Univ, Fen Edebiyat Fak, Insan & Toplum Bilimleri Bolumu Sile, Istanbul, Turkey",Dogus University; Isik University,"Sahin, Ç (通讯作者)，Dogus Univ, TR-34722 Istanbul, Turkey.",csahin@dogus.edu.tr; ansalh@isikun.edu.tr,,,,,,,45,1,1,1,28,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

In considering this choice, we distinguish between racing strategies, which attempt to fight off the rise of the new technology by extending the performance of the old technology, and retreat strategies, which attempt to accommodate the rise of the new technology by repositioning the old technology in the demand environment. Underlying our arguments is the observation that the emergence of a new technology does more than just create a substitute threat-it can also reveal significant underlying heterogeneity in the old technology's broader demand environment. This heterogeneity is a source of opportunities that can support a new position for the old technology, in either the current market or a new one. Using this lens, we explore the decision to stay with the old technology as a rational, proactive choice rather than as a mark of managerial and organizational failure. We then consider the distinctive challenges and organizational dynamics that arise in technology retreats, and their implications for the ways in which managers and scholars should approach questions regarding the management of capabilities, lifecycles, and ecosystems.","[Adner, Ron] Dartmouth Coll, Tuck Sch Business, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Snow, Daniel] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Soldiers Field, Boston, MA 02163 USA",Dartmouth College; Harvard University,"Adner, R (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Tuck Sch Business, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",Ron.Adner@dartmouth.edu; dsnow@hbs.edu,,,,,,,40,150,173,5,108,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

We use ultra-high-frequency data for blue-chip companies to motivate a particular choice of waiting-time distribution and then calibrate risk-neutral parameters from options data. We also show that the convexity commonly observed in implied volatilities may be explained by the presence of duration between trades. Furthermore, we find that, ceteris paribus, implied volatility decreases in the presence of longer durations, a result consistent with the findings of Engle (2000) and Dufour and Engle (2000) which demonstrates the relationship between levels of activity and volatility for stock prices. Finally, by directly employing information given by time-stamps of trades, our approach provides a direct link between the literature on stochastic time changes and business time (see Clark (1973)) and, at the same time, highlights the link between number and time of arrival of transactions with implied volatility and stochastic volatility models.","[Cartea, Alvaro] Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain; [Meyer-Brandis, Thilo] Univ Oslo, N-0316 Oslo, Norway",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; University of Oslo,"Cartea, A (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",,,"Cartea, Alvaro/0000-0002-7426-4645",,,,,27,12,12,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

We find that riskier firms and firms with fewer investment opportunities select tighter financial covenants. We also find that selection of tight covenants is associated with improvements in the covenant variable and declines in investment spending and net debt issuance. We observe these changes also for borrowers that do not breach their covenants, suggesting that they are not simply the result of creditor influence conditional on a technical default. Furthermore, we find that violations of tightly set covenants have significantly less of an impact on the borrower's investment spending and net debt issuance than violations of loosely set covenants. Overall, our results suggest that the selection of tight covenants conveys information concerning future changes in covenant variables, investment and financial policies, and the outcome of covenant violations.","[Demiroglu, Cem] Univ Florida, Warrington Coll Business, Coll Adm Sci & Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Demiroglu, Cem] Koc Univ, TR-34450 Istanbul, Turkey",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Koc University,"Demiroglu, C (通讯作者)，Koc Univ, TR-34450 Istanbul, Turkey.",cdemiroglu@ku.edu.tr; christopher.james@cba.ufl.edu,,"Demiroglu, Cem/0000-0003-4865-1411",,,,,35,193,236,4,49,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Such conflicts - which often turn out to be 'environmental' - have largely remained understudied. By focusing on the establishment of an industrial eucalypt monoculture in a coastal Ecuadorian canton, this paper investigates the effects of the penetration of capital into the rural sphere, emphasizing the resulting resistance campaign of a local NGO originating from a peasant organization. We analyse the evolution of land conflicts in the region - historically as well as operationally during the latest eucalypt campaign. We find that displacement of local peasants is a recurrent theme, while environmental issues have recently been incorporated into the resistance to landowners. We thus argue that the agrarian question also includes - now perhaps more than ever - an environmental dimension, thereby providing space for a fruitful dialogue between political ecologists and students of agrarian conflicts.","[Gerber, Julien-Francois; Veuthey, Sandra] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol ICTA, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Gerber, JF (通讯作者)，Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol ICTA, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",JulienFrancois.Gerber@campus.uab.es,,"Gerber, Julien-Francois/0000-0002-4024-2480",,,,,106,33,34,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Their confidence appears to be justified by the encouraging conclusions reached by academic studies on the performance and impacts of GM crops, which seem to provide convincing evidence of substantial benefits for smallholders in developing countries. However, a detailed, critical examination of studies on transgenic, insect-resistant cotton in China, India and South Africa demonstrates that the technology's impacts have been evaluated and represented in selective and misleading ways. The performance and impacts of GM crops have in fact been highly variable, socio-economically differentiated and contingent on a range of agronomic, socio-economic and institutional factors. The shortcomings of the GM crop-impacts literature have done a disservice to public and policy debates about GM crops in international development and impeded the development of sound, evidence-based policy.","Wageningen Univ, Technol & Agr Dev Grp, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Glover, D (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Technol & Agr Dev Grp, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands.",dominic.glover@wur.nl,"Glover, Dominic/F-2365-2010","Glover, Dominic/0000-0003-2055-1996",,,,,97,53,57,0,43,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1471-0358,,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Several main findings emerge from the analysis. First, in the market equilibrium aggregate output and consumption under the vertical integration regime are greater than under the vertical separation regime, while the product price index under the vertical integration regime is lower than that under the vertical separation regime. Secondly, the level of real aggregate profits under the vertical integration regime will be higher (lower) than that under the vertical separation regime if the degree of monopoly power is relatively large (small). Third, the welfare level under the vertical integration regime will be higher than that under the vertical separation regime regardless of the degree of monopoly power. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In that, intellectual conformism, interests, and ideology produced the dominant pre-crisis policy package. Second, it briefly reviews alternative streams of thought well present before the crisis that addressed major properties of actual economic systems such as asymmetric information, irrational behaviors, destabilizing speculation and herd-type dynamics. Against this background, third, it discusses some major current policy and institution-building issues, namely, the ramifications and consequences of the Too-Big-to-Fail argument; fractional reserve banking; and more generally, the inherent potential for instability and rent-extraction of liquid and seemingly efficient financial markets.","Financial Serv Author, London E14 5HS, England",,"Turner, A (通讯作者)，Financial Serv Author, 25 N Colonnade, London E14 5HS, England.",adair.turner@fsa.gov.uk,,,,,,,12,5,5,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

The estimators are appropriate for data with a large (small) number of cross-sectional observations and a small (large) number of time series observations. The estimation procedure is simple and robust to the configurations of idiosyncratic errors encountered in practice. In addition, the method can be used to evaluate the validity of observable candidate factors. Monte Carlo experiments show that the proposed estimators have good finite-sample properties. Applying the estimators to international stock markets, we find that international stock returns are explained by one strong global factor. This factor is highly correlated with the Fama-French factors from the U.S. stock market. This result can be interpreted as evidence of market integration. We also find two weak factors closely related to markets in Europe and the Americas, respectively. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Perez, M.

To do so, we first analyze the patterns in where referenda are held and in which finance mechanisms they employ. Controlling for these two selection patterns, we then investigate the factors determining the success of the referenda. Our findings suggest that conservation groups are pursuing a successful strategy, targeting communities with above-average probabilities of passing referenda and higher ecological value.

R&D and export activities are found to facilitate both firm growth and survival. The primary focus of this study is to examine the effects of industrial networking, such as subcontracting and clustering, on firm growth. The results show that subcontracting does not yield any positive effect for firm growth, but encumbers survival, which may be accounted for by the high subcontracting intensity among small firms. Clustering, on the other hand, is found to promote firm growth and survival. There is, however, little evidence that such a positive effect of clustering is derived from network externalities through cooperation and competition among firms in a cluster per se.","[Park, Younsuk] Univ Reading, Ctr Inst Performance, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England; [Shin, Jaeun; Kim, Taejong] KDI Sch Publ Policy & Management, Seoul 130868, South Korea",University of Reading; KDI School of Public Policy & Management,"Shin, J (通讯作者)，KDI Sch Publ Policy & Management, 87 Hoegi Ro, Seoul 130868, South Korea.",y.park@reading.ac.uk; jshin@kdischool.ac.kr; tjkim@kdischool.ac.kr,,,,,,,89,61,71,2,56,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We show that, in an optimal contracting framework with imperfect renegotiation, having multiple creditors increases a firm's debt capacity while increasing its incentives to default strategically. The optimal debt contract gives creditors claims that are jointly inconsistent in case of default. Bankruptcy rules are therefore a necessary part of the overall financing contract, to make claims consistent and to prevent a value-reducing run for the assets of the firm. We characterize these rules, with predictions about the allocation of security rights, the right to trigger bankruptcy, and the symmetry of treatment of creditors in default.

Rather, diversification increases bank profitability and, as a consequence also market valuations. This indirect performance effect does not depend on whether diversification was achieved through organic growth or through M&A activity. We further demonstrate that previous results in the literature on the impact of diversification on bank value presumably differ due to the way diversification is measured, and the negligence of the indirect value effect via bank profitability.

(2003) argues that changes in mood resulting from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) drive changes in investor risk aversion and cause seasonal patterns in aggregate stock returns around the world. In this paper we reexamine the so-called SAD effect by replicating and extending Kamstra et al. (2003). We study the psychological underpinnings of the SAD hypothesis and show that the time-series predictions of the SAD model do not correspond to the seasonal patterns in depression found in the general population. We also investigate the cross-sectional prediction that SAD has a greater effect on stock markets in countries where SAD is more prevalent and find no relation between the prevalence of SAD and stock returns. Finally, we document that the SAD effect is mechanically driven by an overlapping dummy-variable specification and higher returns around the turn of the year. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Such a sentiment sits uncomfortably with a large number of empirical studies suggesting that the process of determining executive pay seems to be more readily explained by recourse to arguments of managerial power and influence. This article investigates the micro-underpinnings of boardroom behavior in order to explain this departure from principal agency theory's argument that executive compensation serves to align interests between the owners of the company and its senior managers. We find that there are strong interaction effects among social influence variables and the social setting of boardroom activity. Generous pay awards, bearing only a weak connection to corporate performance, are explained in the context of the social psychology of the boardroom. These results and a review of the empirical research, suggest the need for a more comprehensive model of executive compensation that incorporates both economic and psychological determinants.","[O'Reilly, Charles A., III] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Main, Brian G.

Three leading examples of such innovative programs are (1) public disclosure and voluntary programs to address industrial pollution; (2) programs that inform households about environmental health risks; and (3) payments for environmental services. Although (1) and (2) have reduced emissions of industrial pollutants and household exposure to environmental health risks in some cases, the reductions are small relative to the size of the problems. Conservation benefits from (3) have been similarly small so far. Evidence on the effectiveness of these programs is limited, both because the programs are relatively new and because there has been limited use of rigorous impact evaluation methods. Despite this weak performance record, continued experimentation with innovative programs appears to be warranted, especially if the opportunity cost is not too high in terms of redirecting resources away from formal environmental management programs and if rigorous impact evaluations are built in to determine whether and why innovative programs have worked. Future research needs to pay attention to the great heterogeneity among developing countries (i.e., successful implementation in one country is no guarantee of success elsewhere), and to the relationship of innovative programs to formal environmental management programs.","Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Vincent, JR (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",Jeff.Vincent@duke.edu,"Vincent, Jeffrey/JZU-1149-2024",,,,,,35,19,19,0,24,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1750-6816,1750-6824,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

This particular type of year-round calendar allows for schools to house more students within the same facility than other calendars and is often motivated by its potential to alleviate overcrowding as well as to save costs relative to new school construction. This paper finds that these financial savings come at a cost in terms of the quality of education produced, as measured by a school's national percentile rank on standardized tests. Being on a multi-track year-round calendar results in a drop of 1-2 percentile points relative to a traditional calendar in national rank on reading, math and language scores. The policy implications are especially relevant to the current condition of the US education system, where many states are facing overcrowding problems and have implemented or are seriously considering implementation of multi-track year-round calendars as a remedy.

The limited-liability option gives rise to a second risk factor, in addition to aggregate consumption growth risk. This liquidity risk is created by binding solvency constraints, and it is measured by the growth rate of one moment of the wealth distribution. The economy is said to experience a negative liquidity shock when this growth rate is high and a large fraction of agents faces severely binding solvency constraints.

The model not only incorporates the special roles housing plays in the portfolio of households: collateral, a source of service flows, as well as a source of potential capital gains or losses, but also adds to existing models of wealth accumulation some unique institutional features present in Korea, namely the rental system ('chonsae') and the lack of a mortgage system. When the model is calibrated to match the Korean economy, several key features of the data are better able to be reproduced. The paper also analyzes the role of institutional features by comparing several alternative housing market arrangements to assess their impact on wealth accumulation, portfolio choices, and homeownership. A 10 percentage points reduction in down-payment requirement is associated with approximately I percentage point increase in the aggregate homeownership ratio in Korea. Lower down-payment also increases the fraction of aggregate wealth held in housing assets but lowers aggregate net worth with mixed demographic implications. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We use these dynamic responses to estimate a DSGE model with imperfect information about the disinflation shock.

We examine ex-dividend price behavior of Hong Kong ADRs to assess the impact of differing tax environments in US and Hong Kong. These ADRs typically go ex-dividend before their underlying stock. They experience significant abnormal returns of 1.16% on their ex-day: the average ex-day price drop is only 30% of the dividend. However, ADR prices drop when the underlying stock goes ex-dividend subsequently. The cumulative ADR price drop is equal to the dividend.

Although mines that supply most construction products have traditionally been located near major points of consumption, population pressures have raised the possibility that these small, widely scattered operations might be replaced by large, megaquarry operations. This study uses network analysis to compare transportation-related energy and cost for cement production from highly centralized facilities, or megaquarries, to that from smaller production facilities dispersed throughout the Great Lakes region of the United States. Results show that a transition to megaquarries can increase trans port-related energy and associated environmental impacts by almost 50%. This suggests that decisions involving the location of mining operations for construction products are best made on a regional rather than local basis. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The results are a part of the research undertaken inside the doctoral thesis by the first author of this article. Logistics is the group of activities of the firm which insure the flow of materials, parts and final products from firm's suppliers to its customers, but also inside the firm. At firm's level logistics is usually perceived as a cost. We believe it is necessary that firm's management to observe that logistics insures goods transfer, at a certain costs level, but also at a certain customer service level. The interest of management should be though expanded from cost management at demand planning and customer service management. We exposed further best practices regarding customer service planning in logistics. The article has in the first part theoretical details regarding customer service, but also regarding management best practices, in the second the elements of customer service, in the third management best practices found at international level, while the fourth part contains the evaluation of best practices usage and knowledge by the Romanian managers. In conclusion, Romanian managers could be considered sooner reactive than proactive regarding logistics customer service planning.

In this article, we model the optimal employment contract when two features of human capital are present: (i) private information of the employee about his skills; and (ii) the inability to contract on the output of the employment activity. Our model shows how firms can use delegation (i.e., the employee's job autonomy) to provide the incentives to a privately informed employee. The model novelty resides in turning a classic source of potential inefficiency like asymmetric information into a factor that firms can use to design incentives. Our model provides a new explanation of why, in technologically dynamic environments, one observes more intense formations of start-ups and a greater inter-firm mobility of human capital. Our setting also suggests how established companies can use their complementary assets to provide better incentives to their skilled employees.","[Gambardella, Alfonso] Bocconi Univ, Dept Management, Milan, Italy",Bocconi University,"Gambardella, A (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Dept Management, Milan, Italy.",alfonso.gambardella@unibocconi.it; marco.giarratana@uc3m.es; claudio.panico@unibocconi.it,"Gambardella, Alfonso/K-2641-2012; Giarratana, Marco/N-1056-2016","Gambardella, Alfonso/0000-0002-8714-5813; PANICO, CLAUDIO/0000-0002-8537-9325; Giarratana, Marco/0000-0002-0015-6529",,,,,30,11,13,0,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

We question whether the macroeconomic performance of the new Member States is furthered through the overall positive impact of FDI on the trade balance or whether FDI can actually worsen the performance. Our findings suggest that in some new Member States the positive impact, foreseen by the financial markets, may be reflected in a sustainable appreciation of the real exchange rate. Such real appreciation is in most cases moderate enough to allow for smooth nominal convergence required for euro adoption. In some cases, however, this appreciation is very fast, especially in the new Member States with an initial low net external debt and massive inflows, making it challenging to fulfill the Maastricht criteria. The Maastricht criteria may be difficult to meet also in those new Member States where FDI has been channeled predominantly into services, housing construction, or non-tradable sectors in general, and where it might be required to depreciate currencies in real terms to sustain the external balance. In these countries we observe increasing net external debt without a corresponding improvement in the trade balance.","[Babecky, Jan; Smidkova, Katerina] Czech Natl Bank, Econ Res & Financial Stabil Dept, Prague, Czech Republic; [Bulir, Ales] Int Monetary Fund, IMF Inst, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Smidkova, Katerina] Czech Natl Bank, ECO Res & Financial Stabil Dept, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech National Bank; International Monetary Fund; Czech National Bank,,Jan.Babecky@cnb.cz,"Babecký, Jan/C-9851-2013","Bulir, Ales/0000-0002-2334-7176",,,,,37,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-3-642-12515-7,,,,2010,,,,,,,153,+,,10.1007/978-3-642-12516-4_9,0.0,,,3,Economics; International Relations,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BUC56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288879000009,0

There has been some controversy regarding the burden that it casts on companies and whether the benefits outweigh the costs of compliance. Reporting under SOX is meant to improve investor confidence concerning the stock of a specific company by adding credibility to its financial statements. In this paper we review research on financial reporting and voluntary disclosure of information by management, disclosures of internal control material weaknesses, summarize key research findings, and identify areas for future work. Previous research shows that firms which disclose material weaknesses tend to be smaller, younger, financially weaker, more complex, growing rapidly, or undergoing restructuring (Doyle et al., 2007). Internal control deficiencies (ICDs) can affect firms' information quality in two principal ways. One way is through random, unintentional misstatements due to the lack of adequate policies, training, or diligence by company employees. The second is through intentional misrepresentations or omissions by employees or by management such as overstating earnings for the current period, but also opportunistic understatement of current earnings, by setting up unnecesary reserves in anticipation of future underperformance. Although the initial impact in stock price of such disclosures is negative, our conclusion is that internal control risk matters to investors and that firms reporting effective internal controls or firms remediating previously disclosed ICDs benefit through lower cost of equity and higher accruals quality.","[Dobre, Maria Mirela] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,mirela_dobre@yahoo.com,,,,,,,48,1,1,0,7,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",,,978-606-505-347-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,13,37,,,,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BSE06,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284258100001,0

It shows that even though Detroit experiences the greatest distance between African Americans and jobs of any region in the country, most central city neighborhoods offer an advantage in accessibility to jobs compared to most other places in the metropolitan region - as long as a resident has a car.

First, there are the intermediaries who just focus on the high prices. Second, there is the cooperative, which participates in the international market and provides benefits to its members [9]. The Acopagro Cooperative, a Peruvian organization, for example, has contributed to the shift from illegal crops like coca to an alternative crop like cocoa which gives small scale farmers a sustainable welfare. This study analyzes Peruvian cocoa farmers' socio-economic characteristics as these personal attributes affect their decision-making process in the cocoa commercialization for their long term self-improvement. As part of this analyis, a survey of 243 farmers in Juanjui, San Martin-which is the main cocoa production area in Peru-was carried out between December 2009-January 2010. A binary logistic model was then used in order to show how these characteristics impact on the farmers' choice of which marketing channel to distribute their products. The results demonstrated that those farmers who possess willingness to receive technical assistance among other features would like to participate as cooperative members. Moreover, although, former studies showed that education had a positive effect on being a cooperative member, in this particular case, the findings indicate a non significant impact due to the elementary school level of the farmers who chose Acopagro. In addition, these characteristics also illustrated that farmers who join the cooperative not only think about commercializing their cocoa but are also concerned about their own knowledge and wellbeing. Therefore, policy makers and farmers' organizations should consider how these socioeconomic attributes encourage farmers' marketing channels for contributions not only towards the development of these organizations' but also to that of their communities as a whole.","[Higuchi, Angie] Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Bioresource & Bioenvironm Sci, Fukuoka 812, Japan; [Moritaka, Masahiro; Fukuda, Susumu] Kyushu Univ, Fac Agr, Fukuoka, Japan",Kyushu University; Kyushu University,"Higuchi, A (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Bioresource & Bioenvironm Sci, Fukuoka 812, Japan.",,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,11,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2123-6,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2010,,,,,,,71,76,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA6AE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000337077600009,0

The body of knowledge in this area is extensive. There are two basic approaches to present production management: (1) Automatic Process Control (APC), (2) Statistical Process Control (SPC). The analytical nature of APC is quite different from SPC. In APC is used to see a related, but different, vocabulary as well as a more extensive focus on process modeling in a quantitative sense. Whereas we see primarily output data analysis in SPC, focused on both location and dispersion, we see input-output process modeling in APC, focused mainly on location. In contemporary management, in whatever system is employed, we must also consider the possibility that the required output may not always be reliably obtained. In general, we can formalize the uncertainty of the output system to be like the probability of a failure of the system element during its activity time. If we know the probability of any components failure-free working during its lifetime, then we can determine a value of the components unreliability, by way of simple subtraction from the expected reliability. Generally is possible to represent a methodology for reducing unreliability in the following ways: (1) Couplers safety optimalization, (2) Adding duplicate or standby components. The number of standby units must continue to respect the requirement that the implementation and maintenance costs demand minimum resources, namely to achieve the result of what was the cheapest. It is based on a combination of two strategies - from optimization of the reliability of the serial link, as well as the involvement of additional parallel links generating standby elements. Usually, according to cost criteria, we prefer to optimize the reliability of the elements. This paper aims to present the design of production concept, which combines two approaches that are: automatic process control and improve the reliability of production management. This concept will be presented on the example of Heinz Fit ketchup production system.","[Hron, Jan; Macak, Tomas] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Hron, J (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",hron@pef.czu.cz; macak@pef.czu.cz,"Macak, Tomas/G-7396-2014; Hron, Jan/C-6378-2017","Macak, Tomas/0000-0002-6737-239X; Hron, Jan/0000-0001-6618-7136",,,,,4,0,0,0,1,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2123-6,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2010,,,,,,,211,218,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA6AE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000337077600023,0

One of the commonly used techniques to analyse corporate governance practices is to review corporate annual reports. However, in Malaysia, annual reports are seen to be less effective in conveying useful corporate governance information to the users either due to the disclosure of information that is not relevant to them or that current users demand more from the contents of annual reports. Users also consider other sources of information about the companies as more reliable, trusted and easily accessible relative to a firm's annual report. This has brought attention to the limitations of the present rule-based governance system. Annual reports have failed to communicate corporate governance information to the public. Ticking off boxes for compliance only leads to a false sense of security that the right judgements and right actions are being taken. In this study, interviews with 'boards of directors' and 'governance experts' uncovered some of the inadequacies pertaining to corporate governance reporting in Malaysia and identified how they could be addressed. The findings provide clearer views regarding this issue and can assist security regulators to improve and promote good corporate governance among Malaysian government link companies.","[Ismail, Aida Maria] Univ Teknol MARA Malaysia, Corp Governance Res Program, Shah Alam, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA,,aidamaria.ismail@live.vu.edu.au,"Armstrong, Anona/AFW-6439-2022",,,,,,42,0,0,0,4,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",,,978-606-505-347-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,594,618,,,,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BSE06,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284258100036,0

Whereas the vast income disparity between urban and rural households is confirmed, it is found that, remarkably, rural households report higher subjective well-being than do their richer urban counterparts. A decomposition analysis explores the reasons for this reversal. It finds that there are many determinants of happiness other than absolute income, and that the determinants differ in the two sectors. An explanation for the puzzle is advanced in terms of relative concepts, income inequalities, orbits of comparison, and degrees of insecurity. Positive and normative implications are discussed.","[Knight, John] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Gunatilaka, Ramani] Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Clayton, Vic, Australia",University of Oxford; Monash University,"Knight, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd Bldg, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",john.knight@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,43,162,180,6,76,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Starting from the idea that pension promises in DB schemes are part of a financial contract between a sponsor and participants to a sponsored pension plan we argue that plan participants are not ordinary creditors and should he given the same priority as other claimants in the event of underfunding and a sponsoring firm's bankruptcy. We build up a model consistent with this view. which gives room for more participants' involvement in pension fund management. We assume that the sponsoring firm chooses the optimal share of a pension fund deficit that it commits to cover in case of underfunding, while participants choose the contribution rates that maximize their expected utility. We show that two regimes govern the pattern of the relationship between the optimal level of funding chosen by the sponsor and the Optimal contribution rates chosen by the plan participants. Allowing plan participants to determine their desired contribution rates gives the entrepreneur the proper incentive for funding the pension plan. In a certain way, our pension contract resembles a cash-balance contract and our model suggests that more security can be given to plan participants ill their pension savings by offering them a cash-balance plan which states a priority of unfunded pension rights in case of a firm's bankruptcy.","[Lavigne, Anne; Nze-Obame, Jesus Herell] Univ Orleans, CNRS, UMR6221, LEO, F-45067 Orleans 2, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Orleans,"Lavigne, A (通讯作者)，Univ Orleans, CNRS, UMR6221, LEO, Rue Blois,BP6739, F-45067 Orleans 2, France.",jesus-herell.nze-obame@univ-orleans.fr,,,,,,,18,1,1,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

During a long time, we attended an opposition between a sociology that benefited from exhaustive empirical studies on the demand side, producing important debates about cultural stratification; and economics that benefited from very seminal analysis tools stressing the importance of market competition and information. This contribution takes as an example of new reciprocate exchanges the domain of artistic labor supply and three related issues (the evolution of the artistic occupations' categorization; the relevant criteria of professionalization; the distribution of the corresponding incomes). Then, P.M. Menger shows that sociology and economics are cross-fertilizing and mutually benefit from their specific researches programs. Very likely, the polarization of such disciplinary perspectives on the seminal concept of uncertainty has contributed to this mutual enrichment.","CNRS EHESS Paris, Ctr Etud Sociol & Polit Raymond Aron, Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Menger, PM (通讯作者)，CNRS EHESS Paris, Ctr Etud Sociol & Polit Raymond Aron, Paris, France.",menger@ehess.fr,,,,,,,89,1,1,0,17,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

We try to identify if changes in Argentina's trade policy toward a set of countries had a differential effect, depending on whether goods were already traded, or on the contrary, if tariff changes affected mostly imports of new goods. We distinguish between the effects of changing tariffs and changing trade preferences. The econometric evidence shows that the effect of changes in tariff preferences on the probability of Argentina importing from other Asociacion Latinoamericana de Integracion (ALADI) members has been rather small, with most of the effect being explained by changes in tariff rates levied on imports from these countries.

The ability to quickly enter and respond to the opportunities of this market is critical to an agribusiness' success. Understanding entry into this rapidly growing bio energy market, however, is not well understood. In drawing on management theories of the Resource Based View (RBV) and that of Organizational Ecology, this study develops a conceptual and dynamic programming model to explain the entry behaviors of different types of bio energy businesses. A contribution of this study is it demonstrates that bio energy entry decisions emphasize a basic trade-off involving gains from a commitment to specialized, and correspondingly higher cost assets, and gains from remaining flexible with lower levels of fixed and less specific assets. This commitment-flexibility trade-off not only underlies entry, but such a trade-off is argued to be influenced by the population and uncertain conditions of the market. Importantly our work also sheds light on the implicit risks of the ethanol industry, and in part explains how corn-based dry mills and cellulosic-ethanol conversion technologies may be ideal depending on the type of market conditions upon entry.","[Goldsmith, Peter D.] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Ng, Desmond] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77845 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Goldsmith, PD (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, 318 Mumford Hall,1301 W Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",dng@ag.tamu.edu; pgoldsmi@illinois.edu,"Cuadros, Renzo/B-8684-2012",,,,,,61,7,7,0,10,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Analysis is carried out using common as well as not so common structural changes indicators, thus mutual changes of the structure components in the sense of divergence from homogene and uniform development of all areas. These changes can basically get two forms. Firstly there are quantitative changes in proportions; secondly there are qualitative changes as a result of the qualitative time changes. It is necessary to note, that evaluation of the acquired characteristics according to the mathematical approach on one side and their substantial meaning on the other side is not the same.

However, this uncertainty provides both opportunities and threats for New Zealand dairy farms and often it is the capacity of the farm manager to interpret and respond to external (and internal) information that determines the extent of the advantage or disadvantage that is eventually realized. The research question in this study is to determine whether the perceptions of risk (importance and likelihood) differ according to time horizon and according to whether the risk is viewed as an opportunity or a threat. Subsequent to this question is whether presenting farmer perceptions in a format that better illustrates and informs on the relativity between the sources of risk can enhance the capacity of farm managers to either avoid or exploit the threat and opportunity respectively. This paper reports on the development and application of a methodology to answer these questions. The methodology is then tested on a selected group of farmers with the results analyzed and presented.","[Shadbolt, Nicola Mary] Massey Univ, IFNHH, Palmerston North 4442, Manawatu, New Zealand; [Olubode-Awasola, Femi; Dooley, Elizabeth] AgResearch Ltd, Ruakura Res Ctr, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Gray, David] Massey Univ, INR, Palmerston North 4442, Manawatu, New Zealand",Massey University; AgResearch - New Zealand; Massey University,"Shadbolt, NM (通讯作者)，Massey Univ, IFNHH, Private Bag 11222, Palmerston North 4442, Manawatu, New Zealand.",N.M.Shadbolt@massey.ac.nz; femi.olubode-awosola@agresearch.co.nz; D.I.Gray@massey.ac.nz; liz.dooley@agresearch.co.nz,,,,,,,25,4,4,0,12,INT FOOD & AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW,COLLEGE STATION,"333 BLOCKER BUILDING, 2124 TAMU, COLLEGE STATION, TX 77843-2124 USA",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

We discuss the roles of economics and cost-benefit analysis in regulation under administrative law as well as counting and line-drawing exercises and the nature of the unintended consequences of regulation. Among the specific examples of securities regulation that the review highlights using economic principles are short-sale regulation (including the economic costs associated with short interest) and enforcement sanctions against corporations. We also note some of the successes (options backdating) and failures (Madoff and mutual fund market timing) of the securities regulator in identifying new enforcement challenges.

Along with the prevailing of copula function, the model, regardless of the non-normal distribution for rate of returns, could be used to capture the tail dependence among different capital markets or the large co-movements during crisis. This article, on the basis of previous researches, studies the short-term co-movement, specifically the tail dependence between the China mainland stock market and overseas markets. The results prove that: before the global financial crisis, there is no tail dependence among the stock markets, so the mainland market is relative immune to the abroad shock; but during the global financial crisis, the under tail dependence is significant. Above all, the existence of tail dependence caused by the influence of financial contagion should be focused, and our research demonstrates that the Chinese consumer and governor should pay more attention to the international capital flow and the construction of the order of capital market.","[Zhao Xijun; Duan Xiwen] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,,zhaoxj@ruc.edu.cn,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,ORIENT ACAD FORUM,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-646-54627-8,,,,2010,,,,,,,64,69,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYZ54,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300799000011,0

We investigate impacts of public pension funds upon the minority VC sector. These funds, providing over half of all capital invested in minority VCs, selectively invest, seeking to fund only those VCs likely to generate high returns. Although they attempt to pick the winners, our findings indicate that they have failed to do so. The influence of public pension funds upon the minority VCs is nonetheless real, skewing investing away from traditional practices and toward those of the venture capital mainstream. In the process, minority VCs funded by pension fund money invest in high-tech fields more than other minority-oriented VC funds do. Further, they are less likely to fund minority-owned small firms, focusing increasingly upon firms owned by nonminority Whites. Neither of these trends has resulted in increased returns. Rather, diverting minority-oriented VCs away from their traditional mission of investing in minority firms operating in a broad range of industries has resulted in lower returns over the years studied.","[Bates, Timothy] Wayne State Univ, Dept Econ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Bradford, William] Univ Washington, Dept Finance & Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Wayne State University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Bates, T (通讯作者)，Wayne State Univ, Dept Econ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA.",Tim.bates@wayne.edu; Bradford@u.Washington.edu,"Bates, Timothy C/C-9637-2010",,,,,,14,6,10,1,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We document the high profits of this strategy. The advisory stake is positively related to the likelihood of deal completion and to the termination fees. However, these deals are not wealth creating: there is a negative relation between the advisory stake and the viability of the deal.","[Massa, Massimo] INSEAD, F-77300 Fontainebleau, France; [Bodnaruk, Andriy] Univ Notre Dame, Mendoza Coll Business, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Simonov, Andrei] Michigan State Univ, Eli Broad Grad Sch Management, SITE, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",INSEAD Business School; University of Notre Dame; Michigan State University,"Massa, M (通讯作者)，INSEAD, Blvd Constance, F-77300 Fontainebleau, France.",massimo.massa@insead.edu,"Simonov, Andrei/C-1697-2015","Simonov, Andrei/0000-0001-6452-0214",,,,,27,79,103,3,61,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

In a two-period model with heterogeneous agents, this paper investigates the political determinants of this bias. In the first period. public education is financed by the incumbent government by issuing bonds. Investments in basic and higher education have conflicting effects on future labour income distribution and net returns to these investments depend on the tax and transfers system being selected in the following period through the democratic process. Our idea is that public investment in basic education. by decreasing future labour income inequality, may induce future policy-makers to redistribute resources through financial rents taxation. thus making unfeasible the issuing of debt to finance basic education. This will be the more probable the greater wealth inequality is. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

European Economic Review 40,1037-1047] by modeling both the government's side and speculators' side and introducing uncertainty about each party's payoff. We argue that a speculative attack (defense) can be well modeled as a war of attrition between the government and speculators under asymmetric information. We then solve for a pure strategy, weakly perfect, Bayesian rational expectation equilibrium in which each party's time until concession depends on her benefits from winning and her costs of fighting. Using this model, we are able to explain important facts of currency crises. First, the model shows that failed defenses (attacks) can be ex-ante rational for governments (speculators). Second, the model predicts systematic variations in the durations of defenses. Finally, we also show that currency crises can be self-fulfilling in the sense that there exist multiple rational expectation equilibria in our model. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper attempts to separate the historical and contemporaneous components of this income-temperature relationship. Following ideas by Acemoglu et al. (Am Econ Rev 91(5):1369-1401, 2001), we use colonial mortality data to account for the historical role of temperature since colonial mortality was highly correlated with countries' average temperatures. The remaining income-temperature gradient, after colonial mortality is accounted for, is most likely contemporaneous. This contemporaneous effect can be used to estimate the consequences of global warming. We predict that a 1A degrees C temperature increase across all countries will cause a decrease of 3.8% in world GDP. This prediction is robust across functional forms and an alternative method for separating historical effects.","[Horowitz, John K.] Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Horowitz, John K.] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Horowitz, JK (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",jhorowit@umd.edu,,,,,,,37,42,45,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Our approach departs from the usual explanation of competition as a phenomenon related to money functions (means of payment and store of value). We interpret competition from the two circulations perspective, developed by Tooke and Smith: income circulation, between entrepreneurs and workers, and capital circulation, between entrepreneurs. We claim that monetary authorities can generally assure that outside money is used in income circulation transactions regardless of workers' choice. However, authorities cannot affect the means of payment used in equilibrium in capital circulation transactions. If half of entrepreneurs adopt inside money instead of outside money, all of them will choose the former regardless of authorities' decisions. The distinction between 'circulations' is crucial to explain the equilibrium that corresponds to Tooke's description: outside money is chosen for income circulation transactions whereas inside money (assumed to be less costly) is chosen in capital circulation.","[Cartelier, Jean; Breu, Mariana Rojas] Univ Paris Ouest, F-92001 Nanterre, France; [Breu, Mariana Rojas] Univ Bale, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland",Universite Paris Saclay,"Cartelier, J (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest, Batiment K-125,200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France.",jean.cartelier@u-paris10.fr; mrojasbr@u-paris10.fr,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,5,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

The forward densities and SPDs depend significantly on the slope and volatility of LIBOR rates, and mortgage markets activities have strong impacts on the shape of the forward densities. The SPDs exhibit a pronounced U-shape as a function of future LIBOR rates, suggesting that the state prices are high at both extremely low and high interest rates, which tend to be associated with recessions and periods of high inflation, respectively.

In order to make the transhipment easy and efficient standard loading units are used, such as containers or swap-bodies. As for the main haul, more environmental friendly modes are used (rail and inland waterways) and a modal shift towards these modes can help in reducing the congestion. Therefore several policies are directed to stimulate the intermodal transport market. In this paper, a location analysis model for Belgian intermodal terminals (LAMBIT) is developed and used to assess different policy measures in Belgium. The simulations show that the different policy measures oriented towards the rail/road and inland waterways/road combinations should be incorporated in a coherent, integrated vision, in order to not create a modal shift between the different intermodal transport options. The methodology can easily be extended towards a European scale. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, institutional equity investors may also affect cost of debt through their influence on information asymmetry condition of firms. To distinguish between the two effects, we break down institutional investors into different groups: transient institutional investors (TRA who are sensitive to information asymmetry but unlikely to participate in corporate governance, and the dedicated ones (DED) who act oppositely. Based on a most up-to-date and comprehensive bond data spanning the past 20 years, we find that credit spreads narrow (widen) with an increase in equity ownership by TRA (DED). The effects are most prominent among short-term bonds, bonds with lower ratings, higher leverage and higher volatilities. The results persist after controlling for potential endogeneity and other information asymmetry measures, and are unlikely due to an asset substitution effect. Overall, our findings provide strong support for the effect of information asymmetry on credit spread, and highlight the importance of distinguishing various types of institutional investors.

Rather. they also exert non-production-related effort in order to obtain greater control over their jobs, achieve balance with non-work activities and to further such personal goals as flexibility, self-growth and job-satisfaction. By contrast, the large accounting literature on incentive mechanism design has focused solely on production-related effort, making the implicit assumption that omitting non-production-related effort is without loss of generality. In this paper we develop a model with both types of effort in order to endogenously determine whether non-production-related effort impacts the ability of the firm to achieve its goal through incentive contracts. We show that while introducing non-production-related effort to the principal/agent model limits the power of contracting - meaning that the firm cannot guarantee that it can achieve its desired production-related effort and profit goals - that is not to say that the firm will always be worse off. Depending on the nature of the interaction between the two kinds of effort and their impact on the worker's utility, it is also conceivable that both firm and worker become better off than the standard principal/agent model would predict.","[Gupta, Mahendra] Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",Washington University (WUSTL),,alles@business.rutgers.edu,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,12,"CITY UNIV HONG KONG, DEPT ECONOMICS & FINANCE",HONG KONG,"83 TAT CHEE AVE, KOWLOON, HONG KONG, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",1608-1625,,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

We find that firm-level changes in liquidity are significantly influenced by exchange-level changes across most of the world's stock exchanges. Emerging Asian exchanges have exceptionally strong commonality, while those of Latin America exhibit little if any commonality. After documenting the pervasive role of commonality within individual exchanges, we examine commonality across exchanges. We find evidence of a distinct, global component in bid-ask spreads and depths. Local (exchange-level) sources of commonality represent roughly 39% of the firm's total commonality in liquidity, while global sources contribute an additional 19%. We also investigate potential sources of exchange-level and global commonality.

Although accounting firms are banned by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act from providing non-auditing services to their auditees, the debate is far from over. Despite the negative publicity generated by NAS purchases, why do managers continue to purchase increasing quantities of NAS? We contribute to this debate by offering an alternative explanation on determinants of NAS purchase decisions. We find that (1) the association between NAS purchases and earnings management documented in extant literature is affected by the way top managers are compensated and by managers' shareholdings, and (2) NAS purchases are positively associated with the proportion of performance-based compensation paid to the top five executives and this association is more pronounced for firms with high investment opportunities.","[Su, Xijia] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Accountancy, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Du, Jun] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Krishnan, Gopal] Lehigh Univ, Bethlehem, PA USA",City University of Hong Kong; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Lehigh University,"Su, XJ (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Accountancy, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",acsu@cityu.edu.hk,"Krishnan, Gopal/AFL-3621-2022","Krishnan, Gopal/0000-0002-1037-3527",,,,,33,1,1,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

We find that safety first plays a crucial role in decision-making, inducing choices that cannot be explained by, and even contradict, risk-aversion, Prospect Theory, and loss-aversion in general. Yet, safety first alone cannot explain individual choice. Therefore, we propose an expected utility - safety first (EU-SF) model where decisions are made based on a weighted average of the safety first criterion and standard expected utility maximization.

Based on a sample of Canadian public firms traded oil the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), we find that investors value employee stock option expenses differently prior to and after the implementation of the new standard. Specifically, pro forma compensation expenses disclosed prior to the new accounting regulation are negatively associated with annual stock returns, suggesting that the market interprets these expenses to have negative Valuation consequences. In contrast, recognized stock option expenses from using the fair value approach mandated by the HB 3870 are positively associated with stock returns, indicating that the market now interprets these expenses as a type of asset that contributes positively to firm valuation. Overall. the evidence suggests that the mandatory expensing of employee stock options increases the perceived quality of financial statements and mitigates the perception that firms use stock Options opportunistically. Consequently, the market is able to translate the incentive effect of employee stock options into firm value.","[Niu, Flora] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada",Wilfrid Laurier University,"Niu, F (通讯作者)，Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada.",fniu@wlu.ca,,,,,,,28,15,16,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

To the author's knowledge, there is no existing study on dynamic futures hedging investigating both the effects of regime switching and conditional jumps. This might be the fact that there is no existing hedging model encompassing both of these features. The JSGO solves this problem by introducing a jump switching filtering algorithm to infer ex post both the distributions of jumps and state variables and a recombining procedure to solve the path-dependency problem. To justify the usefulness of the JSGO on dynamic futures hedging, hedging exercises are performed using FTSE 100 futures data traded in the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE). JSGO exhibits good out-of-sample performance compared to its jump-free and state-independent counterparts in terms of both criteria of variance reductions and utility improvements.

We depart from the conventional wisdom by examining not only the effect of protection on inward foreign direct investment (FDI), but also a country's ability to anchor potential outward investment. Based on our simple theoretical framework, we estimate an empirical model, using data on bilateral FDI and employment protection indices for OECD countries, and controlling for other labour market institutions and investment costs. We find that, while an unfavourable employment protection differential between a domestic and a foreign location is inimical to FDI, a high domestic level of employment protection tends to discourage outward FDI. The results are in line with our conjecture that strict employment protection in the firm's home country makes firms reluctant to relocate abroad and keeps them anchored at home.","[Dewit, Gerda] Natl Univ Ireland, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland; [Goerg, Holger] Univ Kiel, Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Montagna, Catia] Univ Dundee, Dundee, Scotland; [Montagna, Catia] Univ Nottingham, GEP, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Goerg, Holger] CEPR, London, England",Maynooth University; University of Kiel; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Dundee; University of Nottingham; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Görg, H (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Kiel Inst World Econ, Dusternbrooker Weg 120, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",holger.goerg@ifw-kiel.de,,,,,,,21,43,46,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Whether out of reason or out of emotion, taxpayers may also be willing to punish intentionally unfair tax setters by working less than they would under the same exogenous circumstances. We conduct a real effort experiment in which a player A (the tax receiver) is matched with a player B (the worker) to elicit the conditions under which tax revenues will increase under a certain threshold and decrease thereafter. We ran four different treatments by manipulating work opportunities and the power to tax. Consistent with the history of tax revolts, the working partner overreacts to the perceived unfairness of taxation when the tax rate exceeds 50%, most strongly so in the high effort treatment. With two types of players, selfish and empathic, our model predicts the emergence of a social norm of fairness under asymmetric information, and elicits the optimal and emotional patterns of punishments and rewards consistent with the norm's enforcement. The social norm allows players to coordinate tacitly on a focal equilibrium, which offers a solution to the indeterminacy raised by the Folk theorem for infinitely-repeated games and a behavioral justification for the tit-for-tat strategy. The social norm of fairness enhances productive efficiency in the long run. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The conventional view is that real wage rigidities can be a useful mechanism to generate a slump in output after a credible disinflationary policy because they prevent the immediate adjustment of inflation. This view is flawed, since it depends on analyzing the model in a linearized framework. Once nonlinearities are taken into account, the results change both qualitatively and quantitatively. Disinflations actually lead to a permanently higher level of output, and real wage rigidities increase the output during the adjustment to the new steady state.","[Ascari, Guido] Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Merkl, Christian] Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",University of Pavia; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Ascari, G (通讯作者)，Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Via San Felice 5, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",gascari@eco.unipv.it; christian.merkl@ifw-kiel.de,,"ASCARI, GUIDO/0000-0002-5037-1964; Merkl, Christian/0000-0001-5607-8286",,,,,21,21,21,0,9,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-2879,,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Additionally, dividend maintenance is associated with higher returns for losers but not for winners. Finally, buying winners that increased their dividends and shorting losers that decreased their dividends enhances momentum profits. Consistent with the evidence, the behavioral models suggest that investors underreact to the losers' positive dividend-maintaining news, reducing their return momentum and shrinking the payers' momentum profit. Also, underreaction to positive news from winners' dividend-increasing announcements as well as to negative news from losers' dividend-decreasing announcements explains the higher momentum profits for strategies based on these stocks.

We find that large cities are more skilled than are small cities, but only to a modest degree. We also show that the increase in productivity associated with agglomeration, as measured by the urban wage premium, is larger for workers with stronger cognitive and people skills. In contrast, motor skills and physical strength are not rewarded to a greater degree in large cities. Urbanization thus enhances thinking and social interaction, rather than physical abilities.

Prior literature suggests that synergies could arise due to taxes, market power, or efficiency improvements. Based on Value Line forecasts, we estimate the average synergy gains in a broad sample of 264 large mergers to be 10.03% of the combined equity value of the merging firms. The detailed data in Value Line projections allow for the decomposition of these gains into underlying operating and financial synergies. We estimate that tax savings contribute only 1.64% in additional value, while operating synergies account for the remaining 8.38%. Operating synergies are higher in focused mergers, while tax savings constitute a large fraction of the gains in diversifying mergers. The operating synergies are generated primarily by cutbacks in investment expenditures rather than by increased operating profits. Overall, the evidence suggests that mergers generate gains by improving resource allocation rather than by reducing tax payments or increasing the market power of the combined firm.","[Krishnamurthy, Srinivasan] SUNY Binghamton Univ, Sch Management, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Kadapakkam, Palani-Rajan] Univ Texas San Antonio, Coll Business, San Antonio, TX USA; [Devos, Erik] Univ Texas El Paso, Coll Business Adm, El Paso, TX USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton; University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); University of Texas System; University of Texas El Paso,"Krishnamurthy, S (通讯作者)，SUNY Binghamton Univ, Sch Management, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",srinik@binghamton.edu,"devos, erik/Q-9341-2019; Krishnamurthy, Srinivasan/B-1746-2008","Krishnamurthy, Srinivasan/0000-0001-7798-4819; Kadapakkam, Palani-Rajan/0000-0001-7350-0629",Gardner Fellowship of Ohio University,Gardner Fellowship of Ohio University,"We thank Malcolm Baker/Erik Stafford (discussant at the AFA meetings), Alex Butler, Honghui Chen, Upinder Dhillon, Melissa Frye, Jon Garfinkel (session chair and discussant at the FMA meetings), Murali Jagannathan, Rajesh Narayanan, John Puthenpurackal, Kasturi Rangan, Kristian Rydqvist, Ajai Singh, Sam Thomas, Kelsey Wei, and seminar participants at AFA annual meetings, FMA annual meetings, Binghamton University, Case Western Reserve University, University of Central Florida, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Hofstra University, Kent State University, Ohio University, and University of South Florida for helpful comments.

We then study optimal strategies of technological improvement and show that for a small country it is optimal to choose export-biased technological improvement. For a large country, it is optimal to improve technology in both sectors at a rate proportional to the consumers' expenditure share. Therefore, if the expenditure share of the import sector is larger than that of the export sector, a large country will choose a relatively import-biased technological improvement, which will hurt its trading partner.

We examine management fees, total expense ratios, and total shareholder costs (including load charges). Fees vary substantially across funds and from country to country. To explain these differences, we consider fund, sponsor, and national characteristics. Fees differ by investment objectives: larger funds and fund complexes charge lower fees; fees are higher for funds distributed in more countries and funds domiciled in certain offshore locations (especially when selling into countries levying higher taxes). Substantial cross-country differences persist even after controlling for these variables. These remaining differences can be explained by a variety of factors, the most robust of which is that fund fees are lower in countries with stronger investor protection.","[Servaes, Henri] London Business Sch, CEPR, London NW1 4SA, England; [Servaes, Henri] ECGI, London NW1 4SA, England; [Khorana, Ajay] Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Tufano, Peter] Harvard Sch Business, Boston, MA USA; [Tufano, Peter] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of London; London Business School; University of London; London Business School; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Servaes, H (通讯作者)，London Business Sch, CEPR, Sussex Pl,Regents Pk, London NW1 4SA, England.",hservaes@london.edu,"Servaes, Henri/M-3048-2013","Servaes, Henri/0000-0002-8142-9903",Division of Research of the Harvard Business School; Research and Materials Development Fund of London Business School; Georgia Tech.; Inquire Europe,Division of Research of the Harvard Business School; Research and Materials Development Fund of London Business School; Georgia Tech.; Inquire Europe,"We would like to thank Tuugi Chuluun, Elizabeth Darst, Arik Motskin, Debbie Strumsky, Lei Wedge, and Stefano Rossi for valuable research assistance and an anonymous referee, Francesco Bova, Peter Bowen (Fidelity Canada), Marc Buffenoir (Morningstar), Sally Buxton (Cadogan Financial), John Campea (Morningstar Canada), Kurt Cerulli (Cerulli Associates), Elizabeth Corley (Merrill Lynch Investment Managers), Joanne De Laurentiis (The Investment Funds Institute of Candada), Neil Fatherly (KPMG), Sylvester Flood (Morningstar), Vito Gala, Michele Gambera (Morningstar), Javier Gil-Bazo, Francisco Gomes, Dan Hallett, Ken Kivenko, Rudy Luukko (Morningstar Canada), Diana Mackay (FERI Fund Market Information), Wolfgang Mansfeld (Union Asset Management and FEFSI), Ed Moisson (Lipper Fitzrovia), Paul Moulton (Lipper Fitzrovia), Ben Phillips (Putnam Lovell NBF), Matt Spiegel, Mark St. Giles (Cadogan Financial), Paolo Volpin, Rodney Williams (FERI Fund Market Information), and seminar participants at the Autorite des Marches Financiers, Boston College, the C.D.

General machinery heavily depends on domestic subcontractors, while outsourcing overseas is prevalent in apparel. Based on firm-level data explicitly distinguishing foreign outsourcing from domestic outsourcing in all manufacturing industries, this paper finds that firms tend to prefer domestic outsourcing to foreign outsourcing when they are R&D-intensive. This finding is consistent with incomplete contracting models, since technologically complex products are likely to require high-quality contracting environment and assembler-supplier proximity. This paper also finds that firms connected with computer networks are actively outsourcing. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

To investigate whether these firm-specific variables capture the sensitivity of returns to unobserved systematic risk, two sets of principal component factors are used. The first set is constructed from individual stock returns and the second set is from size- and book-to-market-sorted portfolio returns. The evidence from the first set of factors shows that size and the book-to-market ratio have little to do with factor betas. The evidence from the second set of factors shows that the forces underlying size and the book-to-market ratio are indeed systematic risks, although they explain very little return variation at the firm level, and that the betas of size- and book-to-market-sorted portfolio returns with respect to the corresponding systematic factors do explain the size and book-to-market effects.

J,"Zhao, B; Bradbury, K",,,,"Zhao, Bo; Bradbury, Katharine",,,Designing State Aid Formulas,JOURNAL OF POLICY ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FISCAL DISPARITIES; ALLOCATION,"This paper designs a new equalization-aid formula based on fiscal gaps of local communities. When states are in transition to a new local aid formula, the issue of whether and how to hold existing aid harmless poses a challenge. The authors show that some previous studies and the formulas derived from them give differential weights to existing and new aid in filling the gap and hence effectively treat communities receiving greater amounts of existing aid more favorably than communities receiving less or no existing aid. As a fairer alternative, the authors propose a new approach that considers existing and new aid as completely equivalent in filling the gap by focusing on the equalizing impact of combined (new and existing) aid. In addition, unlike most previous research that focuses only on a single yearn new aid distribution, the authors simulate the dynamics of aid distributions over multiple years using Massachusetts data. They further provide and compare several possible methods by which state policymakers could direct extra aid dollars to communities with larger unfilled gaps in dollar terms. Although the proposed aid formula is designed for municipal aid and tailored to Massachusetts, the authors note that foundation aid formulas for education implicitly treat existing aid in the same way and suggest that the framework, principles, and policy recommendations might also be applicable to other states.

We model the incompleteness and flexibility of traditional grazing rights using fuzzy set theory. We compare individual and social welfare under the traditional system to individual and social welfare under a private property system and a common property system. Whether the traditional system is preferred to private property depends on whether the value of mobility, as defined by the traditional system, is more valuable than the right of exclusion inherent in private property.

It explores different labor responses to private social standards in East African Cut flower industries. The analysis incorporates the concept of labor agency in global value chain analysis and reveals how retailer-driven chains offer more room for labor organizations to exercise their agency than the traditional cut flower value chains. Labor organizations have been able to influence social standard setting and implementation, and to use standards to further labor representation at production sites. However, labor organizations' ability to seriously challenge the prevailing governance structure of the cut flower value chain appears extremely limited. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

As the institutional investors in China are thriving in recent years, the market has placed great expectation on their role in the improvement of corporate governance. Thus this paper devotes itself to discussing whether institutional investors in China could bring positive influence to compensation mechanism and equity incentive of corporate executives. Using data of listed companies from 2004 to 2008, this paper applies linear probability model, Probit, Logit, Tobit and OLS to conduct empirical tests on the relationship between institutional shareholdings and compensation incentive, especially equity incentive. The empirical result suggest that institutional investors in China failed to restrain the growth of equity incentive nor fixed salary of corporate executive and their improvement impact on compensation design is also far from perfect.

This paper uses a calibrated general equilibrium model of lending from the wealthy to the middle class to evaluate the welfare effects of this reform quantitatively. We find that the indirect effects of endogenous interest rate and other relative price changes dominate the direct effect of relaxing the constraint.

Specifically, we assume that households have uninsurable idiosyncratic labor efficiency shocks and consider policy choices by a median voter which are required to be consistent with a sequential equilibrium. We choose the transition matrix to match observed mobility in wages between 1978 and 1979 in the panel study of income dynamics (PSID) data set and then evaluate the response of social insurance policies to a new transition matrix that matches the observed mobility in wages between 1995 and 1996 and is consistent with the rise in wage inequality and the decrease ill median to mean wages between 1979 and 1996. We deal with the problem that policy Outcomes affect the evolution of the wealth distribution (and hence prices) by approximating the distribution by a small set of moments. We contrast these numbers with those from a sequential utilitarian mechanism, as well as mechanisms with commitment. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Using Standard and Poor's U.S. corporate rating transition and default data over the period 1980-2005. we directly estimate the default and rating cycle from micro data. We relate this cycle to the business cycle, bank lending conditions, and financial market variables. In line with earlier studies, the macro variables appear to explain part of the default cycle. However, we strongly reject the correct dynamic specification of these models. The problem is solved by adding an unobserved dynamic component to the model. which can be interpreted as an omitted systematic credit risk factor. By accounting for this latent factor, many of the observed macro variables loose their significance. There are a few exceptions, but the economic impact of the observed macro variables for credit risk remains low. We also show that systematic credit risk factors differ over transition types. with risk factors for downgrades being noticeably different from those for upgrades. We conclude that portfolio credit risk models based only on observable systematic risk factors omit one of the strongest determinants of credit risk at the portfolio level. This has obvious consequences for current modeling and risk management practices. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
