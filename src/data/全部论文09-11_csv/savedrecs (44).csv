That is, vertical separation is not synonymous with deregulation; more competitors is not equivalent to more competition. We assume a public interest regulator that is constrained to set a unit price that maximizes expected welfare subject to a break-even constraint.

An analysis of three case studies in KwaZulu-Natal,AGREKON,,,English,Article,,,,,,Agricultural cooperatives; Cooperatives Act; new institutional economics; case study,,"The new Cooperatives Act 14 of 2005 was promulgated in August 2005 to promote the development of sustainable cooperatives in South Africa and their use as a vehicle to develop small enterprises. This paper uses the new institutional economics (NIE) to highlight problems created by the Act. Case studies were done of three producer groups in KwaZulu-Natal that formally registered as cooperatives after August 2005. It is clear that the cooperative model was adopted because it was seen as a precondition for government support. All of these cooperatives displayed symptoms of institutional problems and two of them had mitigated these problems by shedding their poorest members and creating their own rules to reward investors with capital gains. The first of these 'solutions' is not consistent with the objective of pro-poor economic development; the second is at odds with the new Act. It is recommended that the new Act should be amended so that cooperatives can at least issue tradable equity shares that offer benefits proportional to shareholding. In addition, it is recommended that the same level of start-up support should be made available to all producer groups that formally register their business, regardless of the business model chosen, and that member empowerment should be an essential requirement for registration and public funding.","[Nganwa, P.; Lyne, M.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Sci & Agribusiness, Kwa Zulu, South Africa; [Lyne, M.] Lincoln Univ, Fac Commerce, Lincoln, New Zealand; [Ferrer, S.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Econ & Finance, Kwa Zulu, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal; Lincoln University - New Zealand; University of Kwazulu Natal,"Nganwa, P (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Sci & Agribusiness, Kwa Zulu, South Africa.",peace.nganwa@gmail.com; michael.lyne@lincoln.ac.nz; ferrers@ukzn.ac.za,"Ferrer, Stuart Richard Douglas/AAL-3812-2021; Lyne, Michael C/V-8732-2018","Ferrer, Stuart Richard Douglas/0000-0003-4001-5007; Lyne, Michael/0000-0002-4530-1195",,,,,21,13,18,1,7,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,MAR,2010,49.0,1,,,,,39,55,,10.1080/03031851003798561,0.0,,,17,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,621PU,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279594200003,0

We find that Australian stocks are more negatively skewed but less leptokurtic than US stocks. As a result, we find that co-skewness plays a more important role in explaining Australian returns while co-kurtosis is consistently influential for US stock returns. We postulate that the differences in results are related to the underlying firm characteristics of the companies in the two indices, where principally the Australian firms are noticeably smaller than their US counterparts and concentrated in a smaller number industry sectors. This implies that for many smaller exchanges around the world higher moment characteristics displayed by the US market may not be applicable.

While the former enhances the likelihood that individual creditors can realize their claims against a debtor, the latter ensures an orderly process for resolving multiple, and often conflicting, claims after a debtor has become insolvent.

In particular, we are interested in payments behaviour towards a bank that is, for operational reasons, unable to make but able to receive payments. If other banks did not sufficiently monitor their outgoing payments, these operational shocks could impact the entire payment system because the affected bank could absorb liquidity from the system. Our game-theoretic model predicts that only early in the day, when they are uncertain about the payment instructions they might have to execute, banks stop sending payments to a counterparty which is unable to make payments. Using a non-parametric method, we find that this prediction is supported by the data, implying that banks effectively contain the disruption caused by the operational outage: payment flows between healthy banks remain unaffected.

One important event which has taken place in the Greek banking industry, especially after 1998, is a wave of mergers and acquisitions. This study also measures and compares the degree of banking competition in two sub-periods, 1995-1998 and 1999-2004, in order to investigate the effect of mergers and acquisitions on the competitive structure of Greek banking. The empirical results of the three models indicate a shift from competitive to non-competitive conditions when moving from the first to the second sub-period. This finding suggests that mergers and acquisitions have affected the level of completion of Greek banking, rendering the industry less competitive. Furthermore, taking into consideration the negative effects of mergers and acquisitions on technical efficiency and the total factor productivity of Greek banking (Rezitis, 2008), the empirical findings of the present study provide some indications that one of the outcomes of the Greek banks' merging activities, at least in the short run, might be to attain market power and thus higher profits, rather than higher efficiency and lower costs.

However, a 'reverse' magnitude effect develops for gains (larger outcomes are discounted more). The 'magnitude effect' for gains observed in experimental settings can be rationalized either by introducing various transaction costs or by postulating that, as expected gains/losses get larger, subjects 'think twice' and try to suppress the emotional bias consciously. As a corollary to the 'reverse' magnitude effect, a wealth effect is identified: being poorer, the same subject will be less patient with regard to gains and losses. The presence of pre-outcome emotions raises discount rates for short resolution lags. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Prior to listing, about three quarters of the firms in our sample have a controlling shareholder. After listing, about half of the controlling shareholders' voting rights decrease, with an average decrease of 24% points that differs significantly from that of the controlling shareholders of benchmark firms that do not cross-list. Large decreases in voting rights are associated with controlling shareholder characteristics, domestic market constraints, and better stock market performance and liquidity. In addition, there is control change in 22% of the firms. Controlling shareholders are more likely to sell control, and are more likely to do so to a foreign buyer, than controlling shareholders of benchmark firms. The results suggest that controlling shareholders who want to sell shares or their control stake can use a US cross-listing to decrease the cost of transferring ownership. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We show this in a general equilibrium model with regionally segmented bank-based retail financial markets, in which money markets facilitate the reallocation of funds across banks from different regions. Counterparty risk creates an asymmetry between banks in savings-rich regions, which remain marginally financed by the abundant regional insured deposits, and in savings-poor regions, which have to pay large spreads in money markets. This asymmetry distorts the aggregate allocation of credit and, in the presence of demand externalities, can cause large output losses. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (Section 404) formulates requirements towards corporate respondents regarding monitoring and consolidating their own internal control over financial reporting.

Considering the INSEE data base on New Enterprises [SINE, 1998-2003], this contribution demonstrates three results. The rate of survival of new cultural enterprises is not actually different from the mainstream enterprise one: But some differences appear in terms of cultural subsectors. Whereas visual and live arts enterprises face difficult beginnings - due to the artisan or notoriety risk - audiovisual enterprises face better prospect. The opposite will appear after the three years when they face the industrial risk or the ability to change their own structure according to the need to satisfy new wants and design new organizations. A second important result deals with the role of the banks: When they look able to assess the potential prospect of any cultural enterprises, their financial support can discriminate against their survival due to the corresponding financial burden. Finally, cultural enterprises survival relies on the nature of their environment: linked to similar enterprises, they face an important competition effect; connected with other types of cultural enterprises they benefit from an important synergy effect. These conclusions support the case for new cultural policies designs.","[Greffe, Xavier; Simonnet, Veronique] Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Simonnet, Veronique] Ecole Econ Paris, Paris, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Paris School of Economics,"Greffe, X (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",xgreffe@univ-paris1.fr; v.simonnet@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,22,6,6,0,13,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

According to the financial risk in M&A, we can use the fault tree method and the flow chart method to obtain the hierarchy of financial risk. M&A financial risk is divided into three-level indicator system of X, Y, Z, and each level is divided into three two indicators. Indeed, each index should adopt the Delphi method to assess by experts. Because of being fuzzy features, it is difficult to accurately quantify. Therefore, it requires the use of fuzzy mathematics to model. Fuzzy analysis method and the concept of membership is adopted to divide risk into five score levels. Then we use the percentage method to assign each indicator.

More than 2000 dairy farmers from 16 countries participated in a Snapshot survey, organised by the European Dairy Farmers association (EDF) in spring of 2010. At the time of questioning the average farm had 148 cows and the average milk yield per cow and year was 8,660 kg. Herd sizes differ a lot between countries. The survey analyses the intentions of dairy farmers over the next five years. The results imply growth in milk production, thanks to the farmers plans to increase their herd sizes by 10 cows/farm/year to an EU-average of 198 cows/farm by 2015. Dairy farmers planning to increase their herd size often face considerable limitations. Being asked about their problems when expanding their dairy enterprise substantially, more than 30% of the participating farmers reported that the availability of land is a big problem. Finding workers, getting more quota, access to money or obtaining licences are only big problems for less than 25% of the farmers. Intensification of dairy farming seems to be the strategy most farmers with land scarcity want to achieve in the future (80%). Other strategies like buying feedstuff externally (60%), cooperating with other farmers (57%), exporting slurry (50%), paying higher prices (39%) or even changing farm location (8%) find less acceptance among the participating dairy farmers.

The analysis reveals a positive and significant effect of both farm programs on the area under cultivation, in particular on grassland, resulting in a decrease of cattle livestock density.

The results suggest that the sales growth rates of domestic companies mostly decrease in the presence of foreign companies, especially in upstream sectors.

However, their functions' exacerbation by growing the fiscal burden could lead to very negative social and economic consequences, since an old saying predicted that it might kill the goose with the golden eggs. The estimation of the fiscal burden derives from a classic index that expresses the part of GDP that state takes as taxes and that might be relatively bigger in the developed countries than in the developing ones, directly connected with the whole volume of the national revenue. Associated with the fiscal policy, the term of fiscal pressure is widely spread in the literature and indicates the magnitude of the national revenue redistribution through taxes. Generally, it is a specialized word that expresses the average of the fiscal burden's intensity as a tax-payers' obligation to the central and local public authority. The amplitude and dynamics of the fiscal pressure is measured and estimated through the fiscal taxation ratio that is established by law or fiscal regulations. It is a fiscal coefficient expressing the very share of the national revenue taken by the state and is calculated as a percentage ratio for tax payments/revenues to the GDP considering. There are three ratios usually employed (low ratios, high ratios and optimum ratios) according to the average values of the fiscal taxation ratios on relatively long term of a certain country or group of countries, and by reference to the average ratios existing at a given moment in the countries at the top of world economy as well. To a certain extent, the present rise of the Romania's economy and social development reflects the existing global tendencies which are materialized in what the specialists call the transitional path towards the informational society, i.e. the society of knowledge and consciousness. As another challenge for the country, the integrative process requires the substantiation of a strategy that aims at gradually catching up with the countries that have developed within normal parameters along the trajectory of social and economic progress. Both support and motivation, the present Romania's struggle for integration in the European Union is actually an effort towards its social and economic second modernity. Being permanently interdependent with other macro-economic processes and policies, tax planning and tax policy play an important role both in ensuring and improving the financial stability and in sustaining an adequate environment for all economic activities. Although their different approaches and methods, tax planning and tax policy deal with the management of the accumulated public financial resources, i.e., the dynamics of fiscal pressure itself. The present study aims at analyzing the impact of fiscal reforms as reflected in the dynamics of the fiscal pressure from the perspective of various tax ratios and also the way it was felt against the integration in the euro zone background. Considering the context of the global financial turbulences, the paper intends to offer a mirror of the efforts Romania made towards the challenge that were faced up to now and that are still to be faced in the years to come.","[Susanu, Monica] Dunarea de Jos Univ Galati, Galati, Romania",Dunarea De Jos University Galati,,susanu_mnc@yahoo.com,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,2,WORLD SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING ACAD AND SOC,ATHENS,"AG LOANNOU THEOLOGOU 17-23, 15773 ZOGRAPHOU, ATHENS, GREECE",2223-5779,,978-960-474-184-7,WOR MULTIC APP ECON,,,2010,,,,,,,120,125,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT01,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300068000026,0

Experiential learning is the process of making meaning from direct experience [10]. Active learning is a link between academic theory or concepts and experiential learning. As Revans (1940 in [5]) observed active learning has two components: learning garnered from authorities (academic theory, concepts) and learning from students questioning of their own experience. In the course of Marketing Communication we did involve these approaches in the form of theoretical lectures and practical workshops. The theoretical lectures were same for all students attending the course (cca 300 students). The workshops did differ. Students were able to choose in advance between practical workshops in the area of public relations (press conference), event management (organizing a conference), online advertising (Google Online Marketing Challenge), planning marketing communication (for Allianz insurance company) and marketing communication plan (for microbrewery in the small city). Aim of the research presented in this paper is to explore the students understanding and evaluation of results achieved by completing a course focused on experiential learning through live case studies in comparison with learning through mini-case studies with the support of multimedia class tools. The specific aims of the article are to verify the benefits of experiential learning to the students in the area of marketing communication and to find out which competencies were developed by used teaching approaches. Following methods had been used to fullfil the aims: observation, questionnaire, group discussion (for sets of competencies creation), non-parametrical statistical testing (Mann-Whitney test) and also analogy, induction, deduction, specification, abstraction, analysis and synthesis.","[Svec, Vaclav; Kaderabkova, Tereza] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Svec, V (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",svec@pef.czu.cz; kaderabkovat@pef.czu.cz,"?vec, Václav/A-2453-2013; Švec, Václav/AAG-5767-2019; Balcarova, Tereza/N-4869-2017","?vec, Václav/0000-0003-3005-6024; Švec, Václav/0000-0003-3005-6024; Balcarova, Tereza/0000-0003-0263-0076",,,,,19,1,1,0,4,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2123-6,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2010,,,,,,,257,264,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA6AE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000337077600029,0

Most of these studies estimate the first stage of a complete two-stage model as proposed by ROSEN. However, there are also a few studies that estimate the second stage, i.e. supply and demand functions for characteristics. The present paper reviews both the theoretical and applied literature on Rosen's two-stage model in the context of food and agricultural economics. Based on these findings, a theoretical model for specialty coffee auction data is proposed and tested empirically. The empirical model comprises non-linear hedonic bid functions at stage one and an inverse demand function for one characteristic, the sensory quality score (SQS), at stage two. The first-stage results indicate a high variability of the marginal price of the SQS across different auctions, i.e. across time and space. The second-stage results suggest that the marginal prices of the SQS increased in the analysed period 20032009 and that country-of-origin and buyer effects are important. The highest marginal prices are paid for Rwandan and Honduran coffee. At first glance, this is surprising, since at the first stage Honduran coffees are almost always sold at discounted prices compared to coffees of other origins. However, it seems that the SQS is a much more important quality cue for a coffee origin with a low reputation than for a coffee origin with a well-established reputation in the marketplace.","Univ Giessen, Inst Agr Policy & Market Res, D-35390 Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Teuber, R (通讯作者)，Univ Giessen, Inst Agr Policy & Market Res, Senckenbergstr 3, D-35390 Giessen, Germany.",Ramona.Teuber@agrar.uni-giessen.de,"Brain, Joshua/B-8769-2012; Teuber, Ramona/AAE-1925-2019; Teuber, Ramona/P-6565-2014",,,,,,37,5,6,1,15,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

The return predictability from augmenting with the jump mean easily dominates that offered by augmenting with options-implied volatility and realized volatility from high-frequency data. In out-of-sample forecasting exercises, inclusion of the jump mean can reduce the root mean square prediction error by up to 40%. The incremental return predictability captured by the realized jump mean largely accounts for the counter-cyclical movements in bond risk premia.

Our empirical results suggest that the volatility risk alone predicts 48% of the variation in CDS spread levels, whereas the jump risk alone forecasts 19%. After controlling for credit ratings, macroeconomic conditions, and firms' balance sheet information, we can explain 73% of the total variation. We calibrate a Merton-type structural model with stochastic volatility and jumps, which can help to match credit spreads after controlling for the historical default rates. Simulation evidence suggests that the high-frequency-based volatility measures can help to explain the credit spreads, above and beyond what is already captured by the true leverage ratio.","[Zhou, Hao] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Zhou, H (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board, Mail Stop 91, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",hao.zhou@frb.gov,,,,,,,63,253,288,2,57,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Our empirical results suggest that during the 1980s industry-level factors largely explained variations in entry rates, but that, following the economic federalism brought about by the post-1991 reforms, variations in entry rates during the 1990s were explained largely by state-level institutional and legacy factors. Past productivity growth affects net entry rates as well.","[Bhaumik, Sumon Kumar] Brunel Univ, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Gangopadhyay, Shubhashis; Krishnan, Shagun] India Dev Fdn, Gurgaon 122002, Haryana, India",Brunel University,"Bhaumik, SK (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",Sumon.Bhaumik@brunel.ac.uk; shubgang@gmail.com; skrishnan@idfresearch.org,,,,,,,34,12,13,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

This paper presents the findings from interviews with eight key stakeholders involved in UK P&R, which sought to provide insights into the popularity of P&R, particularly at the local government level, its success, and how the concept of P&R can be developed in the future to improve its role in reducing car use whilst maintaining its popularity. It is suggested that there are a range of goals for the use of P&R which extend beyond traffic reduction. It is discussed how there may be potential to develop the concept, particularly by decentralising P&R sites and developing their role as interchanges for public transport. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Their degree of integration combined with the universality of our institutions in the banking sector may then be an important factor to take into account in appreciating its resistance to systemic shocks. In this first part, the correlation between size and systemic risk will be discussed. The current financial deregulation has permitted the entry onto the market of institutions, which are traditionally non-banking institutions (insurance companies, institutional investors, pension funds). It would be interesting to measure the influence of these newcomers on the evolution of banking integration. This is the object of part two of this analysis. The last stage will consist in an attempt to evaluate the systemic risk in the framework of the new financial environment. The subprime crisis and the unequal reaction of banking institutions will lead us to two questions: Will this crisis lead to a renewal of the predominance for universal banks? and Will the new process of integration in banking sector guarantee stability at the international level?","ESCEM, Tours, France",,"Paulet, E (通讯作者)，ESCEM, Tours, France.",epaulet@escem.fr,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,8,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2009,11.0,,,,,,684,697,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,534HM,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272887200005,0

We consider the optimal number of merger investigations, both when the competition authorities commit to a particular activity level and when they do not commit. If they commit, it is shown that the low quality of final decisions may lead to the deterrence of mergers that would have been welfare improving. On the other hand, when potential mergers with the largest negative impact on welfare are deterred, we find that the merger investigations themselves might have a negative impact on welfare (enforcement effect). It is shown that the absence of commitment can lead to a less active merger policy and lower welfare than what is the case if the authority did commit to a certain level of activity. The results have important implications for how one should interpret the empirical studies of the effects of merger enforcement.","Norwegian Sch Econ & Business Adm, Dept Econ, N-5035 Bergen, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Sorgard, L (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ & Business Adm, Dept Econ, N-5035 Bergen, Norway.",lars.sorgard@nhh.no,,,,,,,38,18,19,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1821,1467-6451,,J IND ECON,J.

A classical game theory approach (fishwar model; Levhari-Mirman 1980) is revisited to take into consideration the macroeconomic dependence of ACP countries and analyse the role of coalitions and negotiation procedures in the rent-sharing process, In a 3-player game (two LOCs and the EU), the impact of a LDC coalition is analysed in terms of welfare gain/loss outcomes and re-allocation of catches between countries. A (( small-step)) negotiation procedure is first used to solve the cases of failure, before, in case of a new failure, using a multi-country mediation out of the coalition. One of the main results lies in the low incentives for LDCs to join the coalition in spite of the bilateral or multilateral mediations, as long as the LDCs do not have the same interest to harvest their own resources.","[Vallee, Thomas] Univ Nantes, LEMINA, IAE, F-44322 Nantes, France",Nantes Universite,"Vallée, T (通讯作者)，Univ Nantes, LEMINA, IAE, Chemin Cens Tertre,BP52 231, F-44322 Nantes, France.",Thomas.Vallee@univ-nantes.fr; Patrice.Guillotreau@univ-nantes.fr; enamile@yahoo.fr,"Guillotreau, Patrice/AAL-7482-2020; Vallee, Thomas/C-2601-2017","Guillotreau, Patrice/0000-0002-3083-1230; Vallee, Thomas/0000-0002-4620-3087",,,,,23,1,1,0,8,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

They find strong evidence that social capital and institutions enhance aid effectiveness. Moreover, once they account for the role of social capital and institutions, the impact of policies tends to disappear. These findings have important policy implications as they indicate that conditioning aid allocation on good policies may not lead to an optimal (or fair) allocation of aid, as countries with high social capital at the macrolevel could actually make good use of aid regardless of the quality of policy.

S. current account deficit. An influential literature says that as U. S. productivity surged, capital was attracted to the United States to take advantage of the high returns to investment. We show, however, that when we include emerging Asia, the gap in productivity growth between the United States and the rest of the world cannot explain the U. S. current account deficits, especially since 2000. This is because on a gross domestic product-weighted basis, the rest of the world actually had higher productivity growth during this period; and standard macroeconomic models would predict an out flow of funds from the United States to the rest of the world, and a consequent narrowing of the U. S. current account deficit. This paper shows that greater financial integration abroad can explain this anomaly. However, we still cannot explain why U.

Part of the difficulty lies in that the estimated response is sensitive to the specification of hours in structural vector autoregressions (SVARs). This paper uses a simple two-step approach to consistently estimate the response of hours. The first step considers a SVAR model with a relevant stationary variable, but excluding hours. Given a consistent estimate of technology shocks in the first step, the response of hours to this shock is estimated in a second step. Simulation experiments from an estimated dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model show that this approach outperforms standard SVARs. When applied to U.S. data, the two-step approach predicts a short-run decrease followed by a hump-shaped positive response. This result is robust to other specifications and data.","[Feve, Patrick] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Feve, Patrick] Banque France, Paris, France; [Guay, Alain] Univ Quebec, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Guay, Alain] CIREQ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Feve, Patrick] Univ Toulouse, Toulouse, France; [Feve, Patrick] IDEI, Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; European Central Bank; Bank of France; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Universite de Montreal; Universite de Toulouse,"Fève, P (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.",patrick.feve@univ-tlse1.fr; guay.alain@uqam.ca,,,,,,,28,9,9,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

However, in spite of the well-established advantages, not all value-chains have implemented such information exchanges. In this paper, we show that this lack of implementation Could arise due to strategic behavior of value-chain partners. Specifically, allowing for strategic behavior, we examine the conditions under which information exchanges might or might not be implemented. The value-chain partners' trade off their share of increased value-chain profits from information exchange against the loss of their information rent. We develop the model of a two-partner value-chain with a manufacturer and a privately informed retailer. We show that the value-chain partners will agree to move from the traditional (no information exchange) to the information exchange regime only if (a) the retailer is Sufficiently large, (b) the demand variability is Sufficiently high, and (c) the cost of manufacturing is Sufficiently low. This provides a rationale for why information exchange is not prevalent with small retailers.","[Radhakrishnan, Suresh] Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA; [Srinidhi, Bin] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Radhakrishnan, S (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA.",sradhakr@utdallas.edu,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

An ELC ceases to exist if the underlying breaches a contractual knockout level, if the holder exercises, or if she/he sells it back to the issuer. We use Monte Carlo analysis to value ELCs and find that due to limited liability, a typical ELC written on a typical DAX stock can be worth 0.3% more than its intrinsic value (the difference between the value of the underlying and the financing level). Empirically, we find that in January 2007, the 5129 ELCs issued on the thirty DAX stocks traded at an average premium of 0.67% over the intrinsic Value, and that the median bid-ask spread, expressed as a percentage of the underlying, was 0.18%. For covered warrants and options this spread measure was almost twice as high. Finally, we find that upon knockout, investors received on average 3.2% less than the theoretical knockout value, which is consistent with discontinuous trading of the underyling.

We examine how deviations from these targets affect how bidders choose to finance acquisitions and how they adjust their capital structure following the acquisitions. We show that when a bidder's leverage is over its target level, it is less likely to finance the acquisition with debt and more likely to finance the acquisition with equity. Also, we find a positive association between the merger-induced changes in target and actual leverage, and we show that bidders incorporate more than two-thirds of the change to the merged firm's new target leverage. Following debt-financed acquisitions, managers actively move the firm back to its target leverage, reversing more than 75% of the acquisition's leverage effect within five years.

Concurrently, many formerly poor people have escaped from poverty. Distinct subgroups are defined by these divergent trajectories. Members of different subgroups have diverse economic needs, political interests and mobilisation potential, making cohesive action as a political force unlikely (and certainly uncertain) among all of 'the poor'.

Sensitivity of willingness to pay (WTP) to varying risk exposure levels is tested in a 'natural experiment', targeting floodplain residents facing regular annual flooding and a disaster flood once every five to ten years. Accounting for price, income and education levels, both subjective risk aversion and objective baseline risk exposure affect stated WTP for a common level of flood protection. We find a number of problems with the CV application in this specific developing country context. Half of the respondents are unable to pay in financial terms, but are willing to contribute in kind. The combined use of a monetary and non-monetary measure of WTP Would have lowered the number of zero bids considerably. A test-retest carried out six months after the original survey shows that the stated WTP values are reliable.","[Brouwer, Roy; Brander, Luke] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Akter, Sonia] North South Univ, Dept Econ, Dhaka, Bangladesh",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; North South University (NSU),"Brouwer, R (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, De Boelelann 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",roy.brouwer@ivm.vu.nl,"Brander, Luke/M-8878-2013; Akter, Sonia/J-2208-2014; Brouwer, Roy/M-9437-2013","Akter, Sonia/0000-0001-5644-9403; Brouwer, Roy/0000-0002-0525-2050; Brander, Luke/0000-0002-5862-4030",,,,,37,51,55,0,22,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

In this paper we consider three routes of transition from work to formal retirement that rely on UI: (i) standard unemployment compensation, (ii) public early retirement program yielding benefits higher than the unemployment compensation and (iii) unemployment compensation along with an income supplement provided by the former employer.

Other effects included in the meta-analysis were the study year; habitat type; continent; scope as presented to respondents; whether WTP bids were for preventing a deterioration or gaining an improvement in conservation, whether a specific species or specific habitat was protected; whether the questionnaire used a dichotomous choice or an open-ended format; distribution format; and the choice of payment vehicle. GDP per capita seemed to perform as well as an explanatory variable as respondent's mean stated income, indicating that it is wealth in society as a whole which determines variations in WTP. Even if large variation, our main conclusion is, that the demand for biodiversity conservation rises with a nation's wealth, but the income elasticity of willingness to pay is less than one.","[Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ Policy & Management Planning Forest & L, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Hanley, Nick] Univ Stirling, Dept Econ, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland",University of Copenhagen; University of Stirling,"Jacobsen, JB (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ Policy & Management Planning Forest & L, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",jbj@life.ku.dk; n.d.hanley@stir.ac.uk,"Hanley, Nick/C-1759-2012; Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl/C-9354-2015","Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl/0000-0002-1313-6228; Hanley, Nick/0000-0002-1362-3499",,,,,97,143,152,3,52,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

In a model where the costs of earnings management are endogenous, we show that in equilibrium, low-productivity firms hire and invest too much in order to pool with high productivity firms. This behavior distorts the allocation of economic resources in the economy. We test the predictions of the model using firm-level data. We show that during periods of suspicious accounting, firms hire and invest excessively, while managers exercise options. When the misreporting is detected, firms shed labor and capital and productivity improves. Our firm-level results hold both before and after the market crash of 2000.

This paper will present: (1) contributions to a coherent point of view regarding the organizational memory from the perspective of the principles of quality management of services associated to organizational learning and based upon Knowledge Management; (2) the analysis of the main quality models that may be employed in organizational learning related services; (3) a study regarding the perception of successful organizational factors in the field of Knowledge Management-based training services amongst Romanian companies and institutions.","[Vrincianu, Marinela; Anica-Popa, Liana; Anica-Popa, Ionut] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Vrîncianu, M (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",marinela.vrincianu@gmail.com; liana.anica@gmail.com; ionut.anica@gmail.com,"Anica-Popa, Ionut/B-5737-2011; VRINCIANU, MARINELA/GWC-0653-2022; ANICA-POPA, Liana-Elena/AAR-5683-2021","VRINCIANU, MARINELA/0000-0001-9180-3578; ANICA-POPA, Liana-Elena/0000-0001-8837-061X",,,,,33,12,13,2,19,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2009,11.0,26,,,,,473,481,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,462KQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267351800026,0

The five models have surprisingly different predictions about the labor market at both the aggregate and micro levels. Using a suitable instrumental variable strategy, we estimate both micro and aggregate level regression models of wages and unemployment and compare the estimates to those predictions. We find that while homeowners are less likely to be unemployed, they also have lower wages, all else equal, compared to renters. In addition, higher regional homeownership rates are associated with a greater probability of individual worker unemployment and higher wages. The outcome of a horserace between our new search-theoretic models is mixed-the wage-posting model predicts observed unemployment impacts while a bargaining variant does a better job explaining observed wages and aggregate labor market outcomes. Overall, we conclude that firm behavior is important for understanding the labor market impacts of homeownership. Because this is the case, regional homeownership rates are not good instruments for individual tenure choice in empirical work. And while individual homeowners may have inferior labor market outcomes as compared to renters, from the viewpoint of society, higher homeownership rates may result in greater job creation and overall production, among other benefits.

The analysis is predicated on the notion that car mileage is a two-stage decision process, comprising the discrete choice of whether to own a car and the continuous choice of distance traveled. To capture this process, we employ censored regression models consisting of Probit and OLS estimators, which allows us to gauge the extent to which sample selectivity may bias the results. Our elasticity estimates indicate a significant positive association between increased fuel economy and increased driving, and a significantly negative fuel-price elasticity, which ranges between - 35% and - 41%. Taken together, these results suggest that fuel taxes are likely to be a more effective policy measure in reducing emissions than fuel-efficiency standards.","[Frondel, Manuel; Vance, Colin] RWI Essen, Rhein Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch, D-45128 Essen, Germany",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Vance, C (通讯作者)，RWI Essen, Rhein Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.",frondel@rwi-essen.de; vance@rwi-essen.de,,,,,,,18,24,25,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This paper uses a social identity framework to investigate whether perceptions of occupational taxpaying culture and related variables influence not only self-reported tax compliance, and tax minimization, but also how taxpayers position themselves in relation to the tax office. A questionnaire study (N = 511) with an Australian sample measured the way in which participants perceived their occupational taxpaying culture. Linear and logistic hierarchal regression analyses revealed that occupational taxpaying culture is important in explaining stances towards the tax office and tax minimization, even when more traditional economic tax variables (e.g., deterrence) are included. However, a more refined measure of culture is needed to determine the role that taxpaying culture plays in tax compliance. The analyses also indicate that the relationship between occupational identity and taxpaying culture is complex. Overall, we build a case for an integrated approach that marries traditional variables with social and cultural ones. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Using data from the past 35 years, we compare economic performance in episodes during which the U.S. trade balance declined against episodes during which it rose. We find that trade balance adjustment has been generally benign: U.S. real gross domestic product growth tended to fall but not to a statistically significant extent; housing construction slumped; inflation generally rose modestly; and although nominal interest rates tended to rise, real interest rates fell. The article then compares these outcomes to those in foreign industrial economies. We find that the economic performance of the United States during periods of external adjustment is remarkably similar to the foreign experience. Finally, we also examine the performance of the foreign industrial economies during the periods when the U.S. trade deficit widened and narrowed. Contrary to concerns that U.S. adjustment will prove injurious to foreign economies, our analysis suggests that the foreign economies fared reasonably well during past periods when the U.S. trade deficit narrowed.

This has led to a call for setting cost recovery policies to ensure that the tariffs charged for water supply cover the full cost of service provision. Identification of factors driving piped and non-piped water demand is a necessary prerequisite for predicting how consumers will react to such price increases. Using cross-sectional data of 1,800 households from Southwest Sri Lanka, we estimate water demand functions for piped and non-piped households using appropriate econometric techniques. The (marginal) price elasticity is estimated at - 0.15 for households exclusively relying on piped water, and at - 0.37 for households using piped water but supplementing their supply with other water sources.

It does so at two levels of analysis, which in turn reflect two possible ways of reading the WDR08. The first is to read the WDR08 as a document for policy guidance on 'agriculture for development'. In this respect the paper shows how NGOs expose and challenge the WDR08's optimism for the benign impact of unregulated agribusiness investment on poverty reduction, and put forward a convincing alternative. The second, and politically more fertile, way of reading the WDR08 is to make sense of its numerous internal contradictions. These contradictions are functional to the World Bank's hegemonic effort of establishing a common, and broader, agenda for rural development. Having highlighted the WDR08's incoherent messages on (i) rural labour markets and their role in poverty reduction and (ii) what constitutes the most promising driver of poverty reduction in agriculture (returns from wage labour vs from own account farming), the paper documents NGOs' failure to detect and politically exploit these contradictions.","[Rizzo, Matteo] Univ Oxford, African Studies Ctr, Oxford OX2 7ND, England; [Rizzo, Matteo] Univ Oxford, St Antonys Coll, Oxford OX2 7ND, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Rizzo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, African Studies Ctr, 92 Woodstock Rd, Oxford OX2 7ND, England.",matteo.rizzo@africa.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,20,8,9,0,3,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1471-0358,,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The following six years witnessed sharp growth in tourism; a restructuring of tourism around larger cruise ships and new, larger hotels; and rapid population growth. Our findings indicate that total income (that is, the gross domestic product) of the Galapagos increased by an estimated 78 per cent between 1999 and 2005, making the Galapagos economy among the fastest growing in the world. Tourism continued to be far and away the major driver of economic growth. Nevertheless, population growth via new migration to the islands nearly erased the effect of economic growth on per-capita household income. These findings raise questions about the compatibility of ecotourism and conservation in this unique ecological setting.","[Taylor, J.

Unlike conventional studies, we use two alternative approaches to control for the influence of size effect. One is the two-stage switching regression to correct for endogenous size effect on technical efficiency and, the other is, a metafrontier production function for firms in different groups. The main results are as follows. First, the average technical efficiency for large firms is higher than that of SMEs, without considering the size effect, and lower when considering the endogenous choice on firm size. This study cannot, therefore, conclude that there is a negative size-technical efficiency relationship. It however, sheds light on the importance of size effect on the size-technical efficiency nexus. Second, the estimates on the determinants of technical efficiency show that being a subcontractor has a statistically significant positive influence on SMEs' technical efficiency, but the effect decreases with firm size.","[Yang, Chih-Hai] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Econ, Jhongli 320, Taiwan; [Chen, Ku-Hsieh] Tamkang Univ, Dept Ind Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",National Central University; Tamkang University,"Yang, CH (通讯作者)，Natl Cent Univ, Dept Econ, 300 Jhongda Rd, Jhongli 320, Taiwan.",chyang@mgt.ncu.edu.tw; 124684@mail.tku.edu.tw,"Chen, Ku Hsieh/IJF-6060-2023",,,,,,51,84,91,0,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

While banks end the period handling upwards of 25% of equity underwriting, this increase results almost exclusively from acquisitions of investment banks with an already established market share of equity underwriting. We find a significant decline in the market share of equity underwriting that banks acquired in the post-merger period, a decline that is larger than that experienced by independent investment banks of comparable reputation. Banks lose market share because they originate fewer IPOs and their IPOs have a lower incidence of follow-on SEOs compared to independent investment banks. Following the merger, banks experience a large fall off in their ability to retain follow-on SEOs and are less successful in winning SEO mandates when an issuer switches from its IPO underwriter.

Two alternative methodologies are used: the estimation of factor intensity regressions on net exports and the direct computation of factor content in net exports. In the factor intensity regression, the authors incorporate technological changes that might have occurred over time, and these turn out to be significant.

This approach clearly informs the European Union's agenda in Africa, which has progressively integrated governance and security elements. This paper will show that this agenda is at least as much determined by the bureaucratic and national affiliations of the concerned EU actors as it is by African realities and international trends. African security indeed triggers a competition between the different European institutions, eager to be the driving force for a policy that can offer some additional resources and autonomy. The consistency and the credibility of the EU security policy in Africa will therefore depend on the responses provided to these institutional rivalries.","[Gibert, Marie V.] SOAS, Dept Polit & Int Studies, London WC1H 0XG, England; [Bagoyoko, Niagale] Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); University of Sussex,"Gibert, MV (通讯作者)，SOAS, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England.",mariegibert@soas.ac.uk,,"Gibert, Marie/0000-0003-1564-4469",ESRC [ES/G034079/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G034079/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,61,45,51,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

These costs are important because they reduce the rate of return on the investments of pension funds and consequently raise the cost of retirement security. This article examines the impact of determinants of these costs, such as the size, governance, pension plan design and outsourcing decisions, using data on all Dutch pension funds across the 1992-2004 period, including more than 10,000 observations. We find that economies of scale dominate the strong dispersion in both administrative and investment costs across pension funds. Industry-wide pension funds are significantly more efficient than company funds and other funds. The operating costs of pension funds' defined contribution plans are lower than those of defined benefit plans. Higher shares of pensioners make funds more costly, whereas the reverse is true when relatively many participants are inactive.","[Bikker, Jacob A.] DNB, Supervisory Policy Div, Strategy Dept, NL-1000 AB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [De Dreu, Jan] ABN AMRO, Grp Risk Management, NL-1082 PP Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Bikker, JA (通讯作者)，DNB, Supervisory Policy Div, Strategy Dept, POB 98, NL-1000 AB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",j.a.bikker@dnb.nl; jan.de.dreu@nl.abnamro.com,,,,,,,28,35,37,2,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

The final impact on poverty is not too large. but its dispersion across households is significant and should be considered when designing compensatory policies.

The results show that there are five factors determining the decision-making of the food producer while producing organic food, i.e. the price of organic food, the variation coefficient of productivity, capital capability, quality investment and government's subsidies. Besides, the higher price of organic food compared with conventional food can be decomposed into technical variation effect and quality investment effect, with the former as the primary factor. It is important for the certification authorities to supervise the production process of the organic food producer and establish an effective mechanism to supervise the certification authorities. Moreover, it's an effective path to encourage the producer of more capital capability (leading enterprises, cooperatives and so on) to enter the organic food industry to improve the agricultural production environment and to promote the present level of food safety and quality.","[Chen, Yusheng; Qiao, Juan] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University,"Chen, YS (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",nsfdtt@yahoo.com.cn,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,,,,,2009,,,,,,,241,252,,,,,,12,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BME64,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272028800017,0

We focus on three important dimensions of life: standard of living, health, and education. Inequality in the three dimensions shows a different trend during 1975-2000. We propose a flexible measure of well-being to quantify the evolution of overall intercountry well-being inequality. The empirical results are sensitive to different normative choices oil the trade-offs between the different dimensions. Especially the concave transformation of income turns out to be decisive for the evolution of world inequality in well-being. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach -This paper empirically investigates the possibility to access the loan from RCCs for farmers using the Logistic model, in which there are 7 factors include area, income per capita, major business, loan usage, access possibility, local loan rate of interest, and house size. Findings -The paper finds that major business, loan usage and local loan rate of interest significantly influence the possibility to access the loan from RCCs, while convenience of access to the RCCs' loan, major business, house space and pure income per capita insignificantly. In Guangdong, farmers from the north region can get easier access to the RCCs' loan. However, compare to other purposes, it is the lowest success odd for farmers to get loan in purpose of investment and produce. There will be the biggest possibility to get access to the RCCs' loan at the highest rate of loan. More specifically the paper finds that the inequilibrium development in rural finance area and the profit target is more focused by RCCs than policy target.

Among the large number of literatures, we are the first to use the method of laboratory experiment to verify this phenomenon. This paper designs a soft budget constraint market with 4 kinds of treatment variables. The experimental results indicate that: (1) soft budget constraint strengthens the risk preference of investors; (2) the continuous operation plays a reverse role in risk preference. That is to say, soft budget constraint strengthens the risk preference of investors, while continuous operation weakens it; in the same continuous operation circumstance, the soft budget constraint increases the risk preference of investors.","[Li Jianbiao; Wang Guangrong; Yuan Xue] Nankai Univ, Sch Business, Res Ctr Corp Governance, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China",Nankai University,,biaojl@126.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,M D FORUM,ALLAWAH NSW,"17 AUGUSTA ST, ALLAWAH NSW, 2218, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9806854-2-8,,,,2009,,,,,,,169,174,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BPO33,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279533000021,0

The effectiveness of activities in the area of development of the information society is determined by the IT level indicators such as: computer hardware availability, Internet access, IT skills of citizens, access to public services provided electronically, etc. Following Poland's accession to the European Union there has already been some progress in the development of the information society which is seen in: the growth in the number of rural households having computer equipment (up by 21%) and the increase in the households with Internet access (by 14%). Structural funds like the ERDF, the ESF, and the EAGGF have significantly contributed; however, the level of their absorption is unsatisfactory. The majority of projects approved for the years 2004-2007 were low-budget ones, poorly innovative and having a local appeal. Beneficiaries of such projects were focused on satisfying their primary needs relating to the purchase of hardware and software. For elimination the 'digital divide' between urban and rural areas more financial and organisation efforts are needed in the field of IT education towards rural area inhabitants, which would be prepared to use actively the possibilities that the information society brings about.","Agr Univ Szczecin, Dept Syst Anal, Szczecin, Poland",West Pomeranian University of Technology,"Marciniak, M (通讯作者)，Agr Univ Szczecin, Dept Syst Anal, Szczecin, Poland.",,"Marciniak, Mirosława/H-2052-2016","Marciniak, Mirosława/0000-0002-7872-4901",,,,,9,0,0,0,2,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-9937-1-3,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2009,,18,,,,,210,216,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BTX02,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288345600029,0

Our results show that the mean level of real PAC contributions garnered by non-moderate Democrats who send false signals exceeds that of the non-moderate Democrats who do not do so by $182,078.

It leads to sell winners too early and to hold losers too long. In this paper, we show that the consciousness of the disposition effect by investors lead them to require a greater risk premium to invest in stocks (when compared to rational investors). We also analyze the role of the evaluation period for disposition investors. We show that the risk premium they require is a decreasing function of the delay between two evaluations of their portfolio. The influence of the evaluation period on the equity premium looks like the one induced by myopic loss aversion (Benartzi-Thaler [1995]), but the origin is different. Valuing more often a portfolio gives more occasions to sell winning stocks and then decreases the expected return. This point is analyzed by assuming that returns are driven by a Brownian motion and that investors evaluate their portfolio at regularly spaced dates.","Strasbourg Univ, EM Strasbourg Business Sch, LARGE Res Ctr, F-67085 Strasbourg, France",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Roger, P (通讯作者)，Strasbourg Univ, EM Strasbourg Business Sch, LARGE Res Ctr, 61 Ave De la Foret Noire, F-67085 Strasbourg, France.",roger@cournot.u-strasbg.fr,,,,,,,40,4,4,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1542-7560,,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

Subjects managed a portfolio and made repeated asset allocations to stocks, bonds, and cash. The task was designed to be similar to what a typical investor would face in managing a 401(k) account for twenty years. The primary manipulation in the experiment was the introduction of portfolio future value projections. The results indicate that subjects who receive future value projections create portfolios with higher allocations to stocks and higher portfolio expected return, and allocations to stocks tends to increase with age. In the aggregate subjects do reasonably well in creating efficient portfolios. The results have implications for reducing myopic loss aversion and for the efficient financial engineering of defined contribution accounts.","[Sundali, James A.] Univ Nevada, Managerial Sci Dept, Reno, NV 89523 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno,"Sundali, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Managerial Sci Dept, MS 028, Reno, NV 89523 USA.",jsundali@unr.edu,,,,,,,30,7,13,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

Second, when discretion is undertaken, an exchange-rate-targeting policy is always superior to a monetary-aggregate-targeting one.

The on-going process of globalization has set off new trends and possibilities of production (e.g. outsourcing) which resulted in changes of firms' behaviour. This led to new approaches in their decisions concerning internationalization of production process, i.e. investment abroad, mainly realised by setting-up a new production facility in a foreign country, usually in the form of the foreign direct investment (FDI). Some of these influences are also connected with new types of production and its structure. The first part of the text is devoted to a brief review of theories which may be used by explaining different ways of internalisation of firm's production, to the latest empirical data concerning FDI and some thoughts concerning methodological problems linked to FDI statistics. The next part of the text tries to shed light on different producing methods, classification schemas and definition of selected modem forms of production and discusses possible links to the FDI. The third part of the text presents a simple model for assessing value of FDI which can be used for decision-making within a multinational firm.

In this way, we verify the hypotheses that investors' expectation can reverse according to the signals in the market in a short period. On the basis of that, we further investigate the aspects that effect this reversal. Specifically, we examine the expectations and behaviors of investors in the process for the market from booming to stagnancy to booming again and from stagnancy to booming then to stagnancy again respectively, as well as the behaviors of the other investors in the same market and the current market mood. We observe the reversal of expectation and convergence to a uniform action via the changing trade volume and the periods for adaption.

We focus on the role of stock price targeting to explain why the fiscal expenditure increased so much. After presenting a simple model to describe government behavior with an optimistic view about stock price and output growth, the paper tests whether the model can explain Japan's fiscal expenditure. The empirical results, using biannual and high-frequency data of the 1990s and the 2000s, show that the stock price targeting can track Japan's fiscal expenditure reasonably well, especially in the 1990s. They imply that without the stock price targeting, the total amount of biannual fiscal stimulus from 1992 to 2000 would have been lower by 2.5 trillion yen on average. J. Japanese Int.

We use daily time series for the three US five-year CDS index spreads for banking, financial services and insurance sectors, the S&P 500 index, the short- and long-term Treasury securities rates. Employing the Autoregressive Distributed Lag approach (ARDL), this study finds more long-run relationships between the five financial variables in Model II that includes the six-month T bill rate than Model I that includes the 10-year T bond rate. The long-run relationships have weakened in both models under the subperiod than the full period. Moreover, the short-run dynamics have changed under the subperiod but the changes are mixed.

Further, female household headship is associated with lower dietary quality than male headship. Thus, promoting female education and addressing the unique constraints faced by female headed households with respect to diet quality could be a significant policy instrument for addressing food insecurity in Bangladesh.

Specifically, firms that are overleveraged relative to their target debt ratios are less likely to make acquisitions and are less likely to use cash in their offers. Furthermore, they acquire smaller targets and pay lower premiums. Managers of overleveraged firms also actively rebalance their capital structures when they anticipate a high likelihood of making an acquisition. Finally, they pursue the most value-enhancing acquisitions.

However, literature lacks evidence on the specific role of credit channel in monetary policymaking. This paper estimates an extended version of the Taylor rule by incorporating credit channel variables explicitly. In particular, net worth capital ratio, bankruptcy cost and default rate are included in the model, motivated by the model of Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (1999). Among the added credit channel variables, net worth capital ratio is both statistically and economically significant during 1989-2008. We test the potential misspecification of the estimated model by allowing the serial correlation of errors arising from the omitted variables to enter the Taylor rule specification. This experiment confirms that our main findings are robust to such model misspecifications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Using data on corporate lobbying expenses between 1998 and 2004, and a sample of large frauds detected during the same period, we find that firms' lobbying activities make a significant difference in fraud detection: Compared to nonlobbying firms, on average, firms that lobby have a significantly lower hazard rate of being detected for fraud, evade fraud detection 117 days longer, and are 38% less likely to be detected by regulators. In addition, fraudulent firms on average spend 77% more on lobbying than nonfraudulent firms, and they spend 29% more on lobbying during their fraudulent periods than during nonfraudulent periods. The delay in detection leads to a greater distortion in resource allocation during fraudulent periods.

In particular, we investigate the role of time-varying jump risk premia in the AJD specifications. Our empirical analysis shows strong evidence in favor of time-varying jump risk premia in pricing cross-sectional options. We also find that, during a period of low volatility, the role of jump risk premia becomes less pronounced, making the differences across pricing performances of the AJD models not as substantial as during a period of high volatility. This finding can possibly explain poor pricing perfomances of the sophisticated AJD models in some previous studies whose sample periods can be characterized by low volatility. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Using an analysis of the introduction of the 'scrappage bonus' in both countries, against the background of the financial crisis, we show how distinct nationally specific discourses and political cultures are expressed within these. The German government was an early adopter of the policy, but the UK government was relatively late in introducing its own scheme. While the German scrappage scheme was introduced officially as an environmental bonus, the UK scheme did not make any reference to environmental concerns. We argue that these differences are important in the context of a wider research aim, to identify nationally specific mobility regimes and to develop an understanding of different possible pathways towards more environmentally friendly transport futures.

First, using data from six countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, the article demonstrates that the extent and significance of any productivity gap by gender depends critically on the criteria used to classify an enterprise. Using a definition of 'female participation in ownership,' there are few differences in average performance measures. However, a 12% productivity gap emerges when a tighter definition, based on decision-making control, is used. Second, the article examines which entrepreneurial characteristics (education, management skills, experience and the motivation for being an entrepreneur) are most associated with higher productivity. The findings reveal that there are some gender gaps in the prevalence of these characteristics, but that these do not account for the overall gender productivity gap. Rather, while women benefit as much as men from education and management skills, there are non-linear impacts by gender in the benefits of having a family background in entrepreneurship; sons rather than daughters benefit from having a father that was an entrepreneur or from joining a family enterprise.","[Aterido, Reyes; Hallward-Driemeier, Mary] World Bank, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Hallward-Driemeier, M (通讯作者)，World Bank, Res Dept, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",mhallward@worldbank.org,,,,,,,31,51,58,2,72,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

However, economic and financial structures as well as the pattern of shocks may differ substantially across regions, while a range of specifications is desirable to check robustness. Accordingly, in this paper we test the implicit pooling assumption in earlier multivariate work on Early Warning Systems using both logit and binary recursive tree specifications separately for crises in Asia and Latin America, as well as the pooled sample.

Some models view deposits as an input, while others view them as an output. Such disparity of approaches results in inconsistent efficiency estimates. In this study we propose an alternative Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) bank efficiency model that treats deposits as an intermediate product, thus emphasizing the dual role of deposits in the bank production process. Consequently, the effect of the amount of deposits on bank efficiency depends on the efficiency at both stages of the bank production process. The main advantage of our model is that it does not require a researcher to make a judgment call as to whether having more (production approach) or less (intermediation approach) deposits is better for bank efficiency. Our unified framework has the potential to produce more consistent efficiency estimates. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis shows that similarities outweigh differences as far as the housing market is concerned.

The final goal is to contribute to deepen the knowledge on market segmentation in order to define more people-oriented transport policies, focusing on a medium size Italian city, Alessandria. Six factors have been defined on which the k-means cluster analysis has been applied finding four travellers' profiles. Results confirm certain hypothesis from behavioural psychological theories. Attitude-behaviour relationships loosen when habits, consolidated in time, do intervene; moreover in small-medium urban context, as opposed to large and dense cities, insufficient transport supply does not favour the use of alternative modes to the motor vehicle, if not to the cost of a great loss in efficiency. In fact, the study shows how significant constraints such as necessity, time saving, and low transport supply (mainly designed around students going to school) are in determining a behavioural change, so that the right general attitudes are not sufficient to obtain a real modal shift. This leads to expect opportunistic behaviours, even within a overall positive attitude towards the environment. Actually, that overall positive attitude is not enough to prompt consistent behaviour unless a marked self-control and strong motivation are present. These two features seem to be missing in the interviewed sample of population, unlike what emerges from other studies undertaken in Northern Europe. The geographic location most likely plays a significant role in such a difference. Indeed, cultural background and the prevailing habits of the population may well explain the slackening of the bond between moral norms and behaviour, and the subsequent search for surrogates (e.g. the high willingness to pay for environmental protection) to justify the unwillingness to forgo the private vehicle on behalf of more sustainable modes. Finally, our study seems to prove that education could play a key role in transport policy formulation but, moreover, in social policy, as individuals more akin to modal shift are those showing higher levels of instruction.

Yet, relatively little is known about how individuals form the inflation expectations they report on consumer surveys. Medians of reported inflation expectations tend to track official estimates of realized inflation, but show large heterogeneity between respondents, due to some expecting seemingly extreme inflation. We present two studies to examine whether individuals who consider specific price changes when forming their inflation expectations report more extreme and disagreeing inflation expectations due to focusing on specific extreme price changes. In Study 1, participants who were instructed to recall any price changes or to recall the largest price changes both thought of items for which price changes were perceived to have been extreme. Moreover, they reported more extreme year-ahead inflation expectations and showed more disagreement than did a third group that had been asked to recall the average change in price changes. Study 2 asked participants to report their year-ahead expectations of inflation, without first prompting them to recall specific price changes. Half of participants nevertheless thought of specific prices when generating their inflation expectations. Those who thought of specific prices reported more extreme and more disagreeing inflation expectations, because they were biased towards various items associated with more extreme perceived price changes. Our findings provide new insights into expectation formation processes and have implications for the design of survey-based measures of inflation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, we find that prices for the AAA ABX.HE index CDS during the crisis were inconsistent with any reasonable assumption for mortgage default rates, and that these price changes are only weakly correlated with observed changes in the credit performance of the underlying loans in the index, casting serious doubt on the suitability of these CDS as valuation benchmarks. We also find that the AAA ABX.HE index CDS price changes are related to short-sale activity for publicly traded investment banks with significant mortgage market exposure. This suggests that capital constraints, limiting the supply of mortgage-bond insurance, may be playing a role here similar to that identified by Froot (2001) in the market for catastrophe insurance.","[Stanton, Richard; Wallace, Nancy] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Stanton, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, 545 Student Serv Bldg 1900, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",stanton@haas.berkeley.edu,"Stanton, Richard/AAW-2551-2021","Stanton, Richard/0000-0003-1222-6763",,,,,58,40,52,0,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

The material entry of a third rating agency (Fitch) to the competitive landscape offers a unique experiment to empirically examine how increased competition affects the credit ratings market. What we find is relatively troubling. Specifically, we discover that increased competition from Fitch coincides with lower quality ratings from the incumbents: Rating levels went up, the correlation between ratings and market-implied yields fell, and the ability of ratings to predict default deteriorated. We offer several possible explanations for these findings that are linked to existing theories. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Traditionally, this phenomenon has been explained by the financial leverage effect. This explanation has recently been challenged in favor of a risk premium based explanation. We develop a new, unlevering approach to document how well financial leverage, rather than size, beta, book-to-market, or operating leverage, explains volatility asymmetry on a firm-by-firm basis. Our results reveal that, at the firm level, financial leverage explains much of the volatility asymmetry. This result is robust to different unlevering methodologies, samples, and measurement intervals. However, we find that financial leverage does not explain index-level volatility asymmetry.

We discuss how this affects conclusions derived from standard models of capital taxation when applied to entrepreneurial income. Some defining features of entrepreneurship important for analyzing the effects of taxation of owner-managed firms are identified. These include the lack of a well-functioning external market for entrepreneurial effort, limited access to external capital and complementarities between entrepreneurial innovation, effort and capital. Due to these constraints, the entrepreneurial project is tied to the individual owner-manager. The entrepreneur is unable to decouple saving decisions from investment decisions, and makes joint decisions on the supply of effort and capital. The return from successful entrepreneurial ventures can therefore not be readily divided into labor and capital income, in deep contrast to what is typically assumed in taxation theory. It is argued that when distinct attributes of entrepreneurship are taken into account, certain conclusions of capital taxation models may no longer hold, including the neutrality of capital taxation in owner-managed firms. Cost of capital formulas derived from the behavior of public firms could underestimate distortions when applied to the investment behavior of entrepreneurial firms. For tax purposes and otherwise, it becomes useful to analyze return to entrepreneurial activity as income of a distinct factor of production. In this context, conceptual issues and the difficulties of measuring entrepreneurial income are discussed.","[Henrekson, Magnus; Sanandaji, Tino] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden; [Sanandaji, Tino] Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); University of Chicago,"Henrekson, M (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, POB 55665, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden.",Magnus.Henrekson@ifn.se; tino@uchicago.edu,"Henrekson, Magnus/JXL-1358-2024","Henrekson, Magnus/0000-0002-1640-7126",,,,,97,25,28,3,51,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We find that premiums paid in the global market for corporate control are clustered in waves and driven to some extent by the US premium. International takeover premiums have become more responsive to US premiums as the globalization process evolved over time. Short-run divergent dynamics due to idiosyncratic or country-specific factors have become less severe, which suggests that expected synergies have become increasingly integrated in the global market for corporate control. Furthermore, we find that the region's takeover premiums typically become more responsive to US takeover premiums when US economic conditions are relatively weak, when the US monetary policy is restrictive, when US credit risk is high, and when the region's corporate governance (as measured by legal system quality and accounting quality) is high.

The normal, the extreme value, and many other distributions commonly used in finance satisfy this property. We argue that the LS property is also sufficient for expected utility to imply drawdown-based performance measure rankings, because for investment funds satisfying the LS condition, the Sharpe ratio and drawdown-based performance measures result in identical rankings. Hence, the same conditions that provide an expected utility foundation for the Sharpe ratio also provide a foundation for drawdown-based performance measures.

This paper, in contrast, uses a detailed industry-level data set on FDI in a relatively skilled-labor and capital scarce country, Mexico, to shed light on the determinants of FDI between largely dissimilar countries. The results indicate considerably more support for a comparative advantage motive for FDI, although a market access motive is present as well. The correlation between skill differences and FDI is positive in all industries, but when differences are large, FDI flows into sectors that are intensive in total labor, regardless of skill level. The concentration of multinational activity in (unskilled) labor intensive industries suggests a potential for spillover effects.","Colby Coll, Dept Econ, Waterville, ME 04901 USA",Colby College,"Waldkirch, A (通讯作者)，Colby Coll, Dept Econ, 5244 Mayflower Hill, Waterville, ME 04901 USA.",andreas.waldkirch@colby.edu,,,,,,,28,9,13,1,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

While the behaviour of the financial sector was obviously pro-cyclical during the 1890s episode, there were signs of more prudent behaviour and stronger financial institutions leading up to the 1930s depression. This change was aided by a change in the competitive environment and by the experience of the preceding financial crisis.

This paper summarises the findings of such simulations, provides a critical assessment of the modelling assumptions on which they are based, and discusses their use in financial stability analysis. On the whole, such simulations suggest that contagious defaults are unlikely but cannot be fully ruled out, at least in some countries. If contagion does take place, then it could lead to the breakdown of a substantial fraction of the banking system, thus imposing high costs to society. However, when interpreting these results, one has to bear in mind the potential bias caused by the very strong assumptions underlying the simulations. Robustness tests indicate that the models might be able to correctly predict whether or not contagion could be an issue and, possibly, also identify banks whose failure could give rise to contagion. They are, however, less suited for stress testing or for the analysis of policy options in crises, primarily due to their lack of behavioural foundations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Equality holds remarkably well in Zimbabwe (the most developed country in the sample), but not at all in Tanzania (the least developed), while results are intermediate in Kenya. Where equality fails, the pattern is for more general human capital characteristics (such as experience) to receive a wage return that exceeds productivity, while the reverse applies to more firm-specific characteristics (such as tenure).

Based on an exploratory analysis of the Korean mobile handset industry over the period of the late 1980s to 2005 the paper shows that a transition to leadership in handsets was shaped and driven by domestic users, local service suppliers (mobile telecommunications operators), favorable government policies, and strong producer user links forged by manufacturers and operators. Traditionally, local demand in latecomer economies has been considered too small and unsophisticated to stimulate innovation and to enable catching up. However, in this case, local demand evolved and acted as an important test bed for new products, services, and technologies, shaping the rate and direction of the technological development of both local suppliers and operators. The conclusion argues that while direct implications for other developing countries cannot be drawn from a single case, future research could identify whether, under certain circumstances, the role of local demand and test bed markets could have wider relevance for other advanced developing nations and other sectors approaching the technology frontier.

These results suggest that announcement period returns underestimate the wealth effects of bidding. After accounting for anticipation, bidding activity is, on average, a significant wealth-creating event. Moreover, bidders pursuing public targets increase shareholder wealth and bidders in stock swaps do not lose. These results contradict conventional wisdom.

A case is made for regarding the civil war (1991-2002) as being an eruption of long-term, entrenched agrarian tensions exacerbated by chiefly rule. Evidence is presented to suggest that the main rebel movement embodied in its plans to reorganize agricultural production some grasp of these longer-term agrarian problems. Postwar attempts to implement co-operative farming and mining are then described. The failure of these schemes is linked to the reinstitution of customary land law and local patronage systems. Current struggles over land now involve international capital. Deep agrarian reforms will be required as the price of keeping international capital engaged in the Sierra Leone countryside.","[Peters, Krijn] Swansea Univ, Dept Polit & Cultural Studies, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales; [Richards, Paul] Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Technol & Dev Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Swansea University; Wageningen University & Research,"Peters, K (通讯作者)，Swansea Univ, Dept Polit & Cultural Studies, James Callaghan Bldg,Singleton Pk, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales.",k.peters@swansea.ac.uk; paul.richards@wur.nl,,"Richards, Paul/0000-0001-5813-0228; Peters, Krijn/0000-0002-5135-375X",,,,,31,36,40,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Some studies argue that environmental regulation constrains firms' abilities to exploit revenue-enhancing or cost-reducing opportunities. Other studies, representing the Porter hypothesis, argue that environmental regulation motivates firms to innovate, which ultimately improves financial performance. Although much of the debate focuses on long-run effects, there are also important short-run effects. This study provides empirical evidence regarding the short-run and long-run effects of Clean Water Act regulation on financial performance. To generate this evidence, we examine the effect of permitted wastewater discharge limits, on the return on sales, using panel data on publicly owned firms in the chemical manufacturing industries. We find that Clean Water Act regulation improves financial performance in both the short run and the long run with a stronger effect in the long run. These results suggest that some net benefits may be realized during a short-run transition to comply with a tighter permitted discharge limit, with additional benefits accruing to the firm in the long run because the firm has more time to innovate.","[Rassier, Dylan G.] Bur Econ Anal, US Dept Commerce, Washington, DC 20230 USA; [Earnhart, Dietrich] Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",University of Kansas,"Rassier, DG (通讯作者)，Bur Econ Anal, US Dept Commerce, BE 40, Washington, DC 20230 USA.",dylan.rassier@bea.gov; earnhart@ku.edu,,,,,,,41,25,32,0,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1074-3529,1465-7287,,CONTEMP ECON POLICY,Contemp.

The underlying justification for such a system was that shipping lines operating in freight conferences could not otherwise adjust their prices promptly enough to counteract the devastating effect of bunker price increases. Thirty years after its imposition, BAF has always been a bone of contention between carriers and shippers. Ocean carriers contend that it is a necessary evil to reduce their exposure to volatile bunker price, while shippers argue that this risk should either be considered as a normal commercial venture, or dealt with in a more transparent way. When bunker surcharges began to climb in 2003. BAF disputes became one of the main obstacles to the dialog between both parties. To settle the dispute over BAF, the Europe Commission (EC) called for the submission on the issue of surcharges. The European Commission banned carrier conferences on October 17th 2008. The shipping lines now set their own independent BAF rates, which are closely monitored by the EC to ensure no collusion. The fluctuation in oil price in 2008 means that the BAF rates are now coming down, but there are still some wide variations in application. During this period of dramatic change in shipping environment, it has become important to provide a theoretical framework for analyzing the BAF. This paper focuses on examining the rationale behind and effects of BAF. A microeconomic model is made to explore the underlying mechanism of BAF. By examining the trade routes of Asia to Europe and Asia to North America during the period 2003-2008, this study finds the practice of BAF cushions an ocean carrier from the negative effects of bunker price fluctuations, and provides shipping lines a powerful tool to change the incentive structure facing carriers. Despite engineers showing that reducing the speed of vessels can economize fuel consumption evidence shows there has been little change by major shipping lines in their transit time and sailing schedules during the recent period of skyrocketing fuel price. It is apparent they use the BAF as the cushion against the effect of rising bunker prices. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast, this article examines the intensive margin-the benefits of improving water service to under-served households, a growing population in developing country cities. We use contingent valuation to estimate willingness to pay (WTP) for improved piped water quality and reductions in supply interruptions among a sample of 193 households in Lahore, Pakistan. The distribution of WTP is described using parametric and non-parametric models. Results indicate that households in Lahore are willing to pay about $7.50 to $9 per month for piped water supply that is clean and drinkable directly from the tap-comparable to the monthly cost of in-home water treatment, and about three to four times the average monthly water bill for sample households using piped water. Estimates of WTP for reducing supply interruptions are both smaller and more difficult to interpret, since a significant fraction of the estimated WTP distribution for supply improvements is negative. All of our WTP estimates are well below 4% of monthly household income, the World Bank's benchmark upper bound for affordable water service.","[Olmstead, Sheila M.] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Akram, Agha Ali] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",Resources for the Future; Yale University,"Olmstead, SM (通讯作者)，Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",agha.akram@yale.edu; olmstead@rff.org,,"Olmstead, Sheila/0000-0002-9572-943X",,,,,48,27,34,3,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The specific context is whether risk professionals (here, insurers) behave differently under risk (when probability is well-specified) and different types of ambiguity in pricing catastrophic risks (floods and hurricanes) and non-catastrophic risks (house fires). The data show that insurers charge higher premiums when faced with ambiguity than when the probability of a loss is well specified (risk). Furthermore, they tend to charge more for conflict ambiguity than imprecise ambiguity for flood and hurricane hazards, but less in the case of fire.

We discuss resulting policy implications with particular emphasis on the energy sector.","[Winkler, Ralph] Univ Bern, Dept Econ, CH-3001 Bern, Switzerland; [Winkler, Ralph] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3001 Bern, Switzerland; [Heinzel, Christoph] Toulouse Sch Econ LERNA, F-31000 Toulouse, France",University of Bern; University of Bern; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Winkler, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Dept Econ, Schanzeneckstr 1, CH-3001 Bern, Switzerland.",ch.heinzel@gmail.com; mail@ralph-winkler.de,,,,,,,38,7,7,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This country of about 16.5 million people has been using a version of WSF for all its primary schools (serving children from age 4 to 12) for 25 years. In this article we describe and evaluate the Dutch system and explore what insights there might be for the U.S., taking into account the very different cultural and normative contexts of the two countries. We find that, compared to those with few weighted students, Dutch schools with high proportions of weighted students have almost 60 percent more teachers per pupil as well as more support staff per teacher. Even these large resource advantages, however, are not sufficient by themselves to eliminate all quality shortfalls in the high-weight schools, where quality is measured by school policies and practices. We conclude that weighted student funding for schools within districts in the U.S. is not likely to deliver the same highly progressive funding patterns as in the Netherlands because of the complex, multilayered U.S. education system and the absence of a political consensus in favor of generous weights.

Our measures are derived by comparing the cost of inequality in terms of equally distributed equivalent poverty gaps in the pre-transfer income and post-transfer income distributions. An application to the poverty-reducing program Oportunidades in Mexico in 2006 reveals that the use of indicator variables more strongly correlated with pre-transfer incomes in rural households can improve the redistributive effect while it also points out the difficulties of the program in targeting different levels of support among the poor, both within and between groups.","Tecnol Monterrey, Monterrey 64849, NL, Mexico",Tecnologico de Monterrey,"Garcia-Diaz, R (通讯作者)，Tecnol Monterrey, Monterrey 64849, NL, Mexico.",rociogarcia@itesm.mx,,"Garcia-Diaz, Rocio/0000-0003-1726-2456",,,,,28,0,0,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1363-6669,,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Analysis suggests that entrepreneurs who identify themselves with linear or expert career motives have a higher preference for causal decision-making logic. Entrepreneurs who identify themselves with spiral or transitory career motives have a higher preference for effectual decision-making logic. In addition, indications that prior start-up experience moderates the relationship between career motives and effectual decision-making logic for spiral-minded entrepreneurs is found.

Increases in industry valuation multiples and realized tax benefits from increasing leverage, while private, are each economically as important as operating gains in explaining realized returns.","[Guo, Shourun] Duke Energy Corp, Charlotte, NC USA; [Hotchkiss, Edith S.] Boston Coll, Carroll Sch Management, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA; [Song, Weihong] Univ Cincinnati, Coll Business, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA",Duke University; Boston College; University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati,"Guo, SR (通讯作者)，Duke Energy Corp, Charlotte, NC USA.",,"Song, Weihong/O-7623-2017","Song, Weihong/0000-0001-9928-889X",,,,,40,156,189,6,78,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-1082,,,J FINANC,J.

Two different portfolios (with ten obligors), one in the European auto sector, the other in the European financial sector, are calibrated against their market CDS spreads and the corresponding CDS-correlations. After the calibration, which are perfect for the banking portfolio, and good for the auto case, we study several quantities of importance in active credit portfolio management. For example, implied multivariate default and survival distributions, multivariate conditional survival distributions, implied default correlations, expected default times and expected ordered default times. The default contagion is modelled by letting individual intensities jump when other defaults occur, but be constant between defaults. This model is translated into a Markov jump process, a so called multivariate phase-type distribution, which represents the default status in the credit portfolio. Matrix-analytic methods are then used to derive expressions for the quantities studied in the calibrated portfolios.","Univ Gothenburg, Ctr Finance, Dept Econ, Sch Business Econ & Law, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Herbertsson, A (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Ctr Finance, Dept Econ, Sch Business Econ & Law, POB 640, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",Alexander.Herbertsson@economics.gu.se,,,,,,,28,10,12,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

We show that monitoring efforts of group members differ in equilibrium due to the asymmetry between members in terms of future profits. In particular, we show that the entrepreneur with the highest future profits also puts in the highest monitoring effort. Moreover, monitoring efforts differ between group members due to free-riding: one member reduces her level of monitoring if the other increases her monitoring effort. This effect is also at play when we introduce a group leader into the model. The individual who becomes the group leader supplies more monitoring effort than in the benchmark case. We empirically test the model using data from a survey of microfinance in Eritrea and show that the group leader attaches more weight to future periods than nonleaders in the group, which may explain why a large part of total monitoring is done by the leader.","[van Eijkel, Remco; Hermes, Niels; Lensink, Robert] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Hermes, N (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.",c.l.m.hermes@rug.nl,"Lensink, Robert/ABA-3076-2020","Lensink, Robert/0000-0001-6448-5164",,,,,15,10,12,1,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The authors find that a left-leaning political regime leads to pro-labor trade policies only for a subset of trade policy measures. In addition, they find that income inequality and country-level corruption appear to be important determinants of trade policy. For various measures of trade protection, it appears that corruption tends to hurt labor interests by increasing trade protection in labor-abundant countries and reducing trade protection in capital-abundant countries. This finding suggests that corruption, among other factors, may move trade policy away from the desires of the median voter.

Using four waves of individual-level annual data from the Japanese General Social Survey collected over the period 2000-2005, we estimate ordered logit models with various explanatory variables based on the socio-demographic, economic, political, and social background of the respondents. Many significant factors are common for both livelihood and care specifications, their effects being qualitatively the same and in line with our prior expectations. The estimation results also show positive coefficients of year intercept dummies, implying an increase in support of a government-based system over time. Further investigation shows that this trend is caused by those who favour government redistribution policies becoming increasingly more consistent in their support for a government-based social security system in Japan.

Our innovation is to move beyond the survey methodology that is widespread in this literature to analyze the actual behavior of individuals with varying degrees of exposure to civil war in a common institutional setting. We exploit the presence of thousands of international soccer (football) players with different exposures to civil conflict in the European professional leagues, and find a strong relationship between the extent of civil conflict in a player's home country and his propensity to behave violently on the soccer field, as measured by yellow and red cards. This link is robust to region fixed effects, country characteristics (e.g. rule of law, per capita income), player characteristics (e.g. age, field position, quality), outliers, and team fixed effects. Reinforcing our claim that we isolate the effect of civil war exposure rather than simple rule breaking or something else entirely, there is no meaningful correlation between our measure of exposure to civil war and soccer performance measures not closely related to violent conduct. The result is also robust to controlling for civil wars before a player's birth, suggesting that it is not driven by factors from the distant historical past.","[Saiegh, Sebastian M.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Miguel, Edward] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Satyanath, Shanker] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; National Bureau of Economic Research; New York University,"Saiegh, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, 9500 Gilman Dr 0521, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",ssaiegh@ucsd.edu,,"Miguel, Edward/0000-0001-6927-709X",,,,,17,44,49,0,19,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN STREET, MALDEN, MA 02148-529 USA",0954-1985,,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

This paper demonstrates that this conjecture holds among cyclone victims in the Pacific Islands. On one hand, households increase coastal fishing and handicraft selling, but not forest-product gathering, to smooth income against own crop damage. On the other hand, households with undamaged housing intensify fishing to help other kin-group members with damaged housing. These distinct patterns of using commons as insurance are explained by distinct forms of risk sharing against these two shocks. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

As age increases, people's mobility may decrease. However, older people have more leisure time compared to their younger (working) counterparts, and potentially spend more time on social activities. Therefore, this group can possibly increase social travel demand. However, to date, the travel demand for social activities of senior citizens has received only little attention. This paper studies trip-making for social purposes, with a special focus on the demographic ageing factors. Using social activity diary data, models are estimated to predict the number of social trips, the travel distance and mode of transport for social trips. The results indicate that the elderly of today seem to be as mobile as their younger counterparts with respect to the number of social trips. High education and involvement in clubs on average result in more social trips and full time work is found to result in fewer social trips. With regard to trip distance the results show that the average travel distance does not decrease as people get older. Full time work is found to result in longer social trips. Shorter trips were found for people in urban as well as rural areas. Trips for the purpose of visiting or joint activities tend to be longer than average. With regard to transport mode choice the results indicate that older seniors (75+) are less likely to choose the bicycle, relative to driving. No other significant age effects were found. Significant effects were found for gender, household structure, education level, car ownership, having a disability, urban density, distance and the purpose of the social activity.

Using the case study of the Greater Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area (GTAMA) we conclude that this link is neither obvious nor uniform. The main outcome of the study is that, upon gaining train access, centrally-located municipalities, such as Tel Aviv, significantly increase their revenue base. Concurrently, municipalities located in the peripheral areas of the metropolis improve their performance only marginally and even decline in their attractiveness to migrants, as a result of train access. As suggested, this difference may be explained by the socio-economic structure of each municipality group, which affects their ability to take advantage of the rail. These findings send a message to planners and decision-makers that establishment of train access does not necessarily improve the financial performance of local authorities, and can even limit their demographic growth. Other factors, such as urban functionality and location, should thus be taken into account in assessing the potential benefits and drawbacks associated with rail expansion. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that higher pay-for-performance sensitivity (PPS) leads to value-enhancing acquisitions. Banks whose CEOs have higher PPS have significantly better abnormal stock returns around the time of the acquisition announcements. On average, acquirers in the high-PPS group outperform their counterparts in the low-PPS group by 1.4% in a three-day window around the announcement. Higher PPS helps reduce the incentives for making value-destroying acquisitions, while at the same time promotes value-enhancing acquisitions. The positive market reaction can be rationalized by post-merger performance. Following acquisitions, banks with higher PPS experience greater improvements in their operating performance. We show that the effect of PPS is mainly evident in small and medium-sized banks, but is not present in large banks.

However, under tough competitive circumstances posed by globalized business milieu achieving this end apparently requires a comprehensive and systematic approach to understand and strategize operation in a superior way. This means operation and strategy must be intertwined, co-formulated and co-implemented. Logically only in this way firms are enabled to outperform rivals and create an operational hegemony. Despite this notion, management literature is suffering from a gap in its body of operational knowledge. This gap is an interdisciplinary deficiency and exists between modern dynamic theory of strategy and operational management. Although over past years a couple of authors have tried to develop models to clarify and articulate strategic operational planning and link operation and strategy from a boarder perspective but prior research lament the absent of a dynamic theory for operational strategy in order to harmonizing operation with modern theory of strategy and illuminating a new avenue towards the operational competitiveness. This paper is designed to address this context and aims to narrow this gap through theoretical analysis and proposing a conceptual model based on an intensive holistic literature review. The model builds upon operational logic and its embedded-ness in strategy and then expands into the dynamism of today's business landscape by offering a cyclic view of activities. Thus, this paper is a conceptual explanatory research study that follows a simple approach to develop a theory for understanding the dynamicity of operational strategy.","[Aghajari, Nezal] Univ Technol Malaysia UTM, Shah Alam, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,,nezal.aghajari@gmail.com,,,,,,,68,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-6-9,,,,2011,,,,,,,1344,1360,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEO28,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000317550001020,0

The author criticises some of the arguments and historical evidence on which the two main explanations that dominate recent literature are based: the institutional approach and the approach focusing on the importance of geographical factors. Using an approach which is deliberately eclectic, the author considers the role of geography, international trade, human capital and institutional quality in explaining development. A new estimation is carried out through Two Stages Least Squares (TSLS) with instrumental variables. The results of the empirical model confirm the central role of institutions in long-term economic growth. However, certain geographical conditions also seem to have influenced countries' chances of progress. The human capital is a less robust factor in explaining economic growth and trade openness does not seem significant in any estimation. Nevertheless, several questions remain to be answered, suggesting that cross-country estimations need to be complemented with a deeper historical analysis.","[Antonio Alonso, Jose] Univ Complutense, Complutense Inst Int Studies ICEI, Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Alonso, JA (通讯作者)，Edificio Mas Ferre,Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain.",j.alonso@ccee.ucm.es,,"Alonso, Jose Antonio/0000-0001-7684-9658",,,,,96,16,16,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

In one, public infrastructure investment remains unchanged, while, in the other, it increases substantially. In all scenarios, we assume a closed economy and a constant military size. Our simulations show little hope for the North Korean economy without boosting infrastructure. Although all of the reforms raise consumption, only significant increases in infrastructure investment bring positive economic growth.","[Bradford, Scott C.; Phillips, Kerk L.] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Econ, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Kim, Dong-jin] Univ Cambridge, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Cambridge, England",Brigham Young University; University of Cambridge,"Bradford, SC (通讯作者)，Brigham Young Univ, Dept Econ, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",bradford@byu.edu,"Phillips, Kerk/H-2732-2012; Bradford, Scott/R-7666-2019; Kim, Dong Jin/JMR-1090-2023","Phillips, Kerk/0000-0002-4895-4167;",,,,,4,5,5,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1748-7870,,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

India and China, in particular, have produced a number of dynamic MNEs whose success abroad generates important economic benefits for the home economy. Motivated by this observation, we describe the internationalisation record of Indonesia's major business groups. Using an archival analysis method, we find that, with a few exceptions, Indonesia's largest business groupings focus predominantly upon the domestic market. We advance two explanations for this investment pattern. The first suggests that the apparent absence of Indonesian MNEs is an accounting error, because firms' outward investment is under-reported in official statistics. The second suggests that Indonesian outward foreign direct investment is impeded by a combination of institutional and firm-level factors that arrest the internationalisation of all but the largest firms.

Specifically, privately placed deals are associated with syndicates that are smaller, more homogeneous in terms of lender industries and countries, and more concentrated.

A set of clusters may also provide the underlying physical structure for multicast communication for a higher level group communication module which may effectively be used for fault tolerance and key management for security purposes.

Beyond labor market policies, state employment growth is influenced by state and local government policies, but not the policies of all levels of government, including the national government.

In this paper, the current state and structure of internal marketing in Japanese companies is empirically examined in search of the relationship between the degree of penetration of internal marketing and corporate performance. Using the survey data, we extracted five key factors that affect the business performance of Japanese companies from an internal marketing perspective and analyzed the relationship between them, applying structural equation modeling. The results indicate that internal collaboration between functions and operational strength are two main factors for the realization of their market development. Furthermore, internal collaboration was particularly influential in the companies which successfully conducted external marketing.","[Kimura, Tatsuya] Waseda Univ, Tokyo, Japan",Waseda University,,kimura@waseda.jp,,,,,,,35,1,1,0,4,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-07-0625-8,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,22.0,,,,,,77,81,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEW99,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000318459600015,0

These theories stem from different theoretical backgrounds, varying in ideas as well as in their impact to work motivation reality. For a student approaching this field it might seem to provide an overwhelming situation in an area of study filled with contradictory theories. The method used in this study is similar to one historians use when analyzing development in a human society. Based on the historical analysis, an analysis of ideas and clusters of meanings follows. Such clusters of meanings might be understood as sources of ideologies, whereby ideology is meant a worldview. For this reason we prefer to speak about a semiotic analysis here. Authors assume that personal experience might determine individual motivation factors. It is quite clear, that on the biological level the processes of motivation should be the same in all humans. However, stimuli or conditions under which the processes of motivation are commenced might be caused by the personal experience of the individuals concerned. Authors believe that the above mentioned analysis of clusters of meaning could help us to better systemize the wide range of work motivation theories and make it more clear for all students of the field.","[Kolman, Ludek; Chylova, Hana] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Psychol, FEM, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Kolman, L (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Psychol, FEM, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic.",kolman@pef.czu.cz; chylova@pef.czu.cz,"Chýlová, Hana/AAC-4698-2022; Kolman, Luděk/AAG-8401-2020","Chýlová, Hana/0000-0003-0541-0626;",,,,,18,0,0,4,27,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-2196-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,217,222,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000338036100022,0

Consistent with the model, I find evidence that liquidity risks are priced independently of market risk in international financial markets. That is, a security's required rate of return depends on the covariance of its own liquidity with aggregate local market liquidity, as well as the covariance of its own liquidity with local and global market returns. I also show that the US market is an important driving force of global liquidity risk. Furthermore, I find that the pricing of liquidity risk varies across countries according to geographic, economic, and political environments. The findings show that the systematic dimension of liquidity provides implications for international portfolio diversification. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

While immigrants from Latin America have had historically lower propensity to naturalize than immigrants from other parts of the world, they are observed to experience the largest hikes in naturalization in the 1990s. Welfare and illegal immigration reforms that made access to public benefits and other selected rights increasingly dependent on citizenship are among the explanations that have often been offered for the surge in naturalizations in the 1990s. Other explanations include changes in immigration laws in the late 1980s, which allowed large numbers of immigrants to apply for citizenship in the mid-1990s, and anti-immigrant reform attempts (such as in California). The common denominator of the available explanations is that they are about domestic administrative and political changes, and neglect to consider those sending-country policies that might have affected immigrants' propensity to naturalize in the 1990s. Notably, between 1991 and 1996, some important Latin American sending countries (Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Brazil) changed their laws and granted their expatriates the right to naturalize in the receiving country without losing their nationality of origin. Immigrants from these countries are expected to be more likely to naturalize because of the decrease in a major cost of naturalization, specifically the need to forfeit rights in their country of origin. The analysis presented in this chapter suggests that these laws are associated with an increase of 10 percentage points in the probability of naturalization of immigrants coming from Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Brazil. These effects are sizable, explaining one sixth of the overall rise in the naturalization rate of non-Mexican Latin Americans in the 1990s.","[Mazzolari, Francesca] Ctr Studi Confindustria, Rome, Italy",,,francesca.mazzolari@gmail.com,,,,,,,19,2,2,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4419-6681-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,133,150,,10.1007/978-1-4419-6682-7_7,0.0,,,18,Economics; Ethnic Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Ethnic Studies,BTU03,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288059300007,0

Distribution parameter estimates indicate that yen appreciation jumps belong to a Levy process with unbounded variation, suggesting that same mechanism may be responsible for fluctuations in normal times as well as rare crashes. In contrast, yen depreciation jumps have a well defined second moment suggesting a Gaussian regime. In addition, extreme episodes of yen appreciation are larger and more persistent than episodes of yen depreciation. The asymmetry is magnified and power-law tails are more elongated during times of higher interest rate differential between U.S. and Japan and higher level of VIX indicating that carry trade may be the driver. We propose a model of strategic carry trader behavior that in equilibrium generates exponentially dampened power-law distribution of jumps in foreign exchange along with up by the stairs down by the elevator dynamics arising from the assymetries between negative and positive jumps.

The acquisition and use of tractors by arable crop farmers in communal and resettlement state land were encouraged. This research examines the performance of the program in the Bindura District. Ninety farmers were interviewed using a multistage sampling technique of structured questionnaires to collect data on demographic background, investment levels and production in terms of costs and returns. The Stochastic Frontier Model revealed the significant impact of the program on participating farmers, highlighting the significance of land and other productive factors. While overall production and productivity remain low, triggering a hyperinflationary situation due to supply constraints, practical implications for agribusinesses are foreseen.","[Obi, Ajuruchukwu; Chisango, Future Fortune] Univ Ft Hare, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, ZA-5700 Alice, Eastern Cape, South Africa",University of Fort Hare,"Obi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ft Hare, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, Private Bag X1314, ZA-5700 Alice, Eastern Cape, South Africa.",aobi@ufh.ac.za; 200808275@ufh.ac.za,"Obi, Ajuruchukwu/I-3620-2013","Obi, Ajuruchukwu/0000-0002-5545-8946",,,,,57,7,7,0,9,INT FOOD & AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW,COLLEGE STATION,"333 BLOCKER BUILDING, 2124 TAMU, COLLEGE STATION, TX 77843-2124 USA",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

The theoretical part deals with the issue of identifying the factors, which boost the attractiveness of regions for possible investors. In accordance with a character of used data the authors have chosen the factor analysis and the cluster analysis for the classification process. As an input for the practical analysis such data sets have been selected which describe regional business environment in the EU. The initial number of chosen regions had to be reduced because of the missing data. The ZET algorithm has been applied to complete the mising values in the remaining number of regions. The following four indicators of business environment were created on the basis of factor analysis: the indicator of quality of labour forces and innovations, the indicator of labour market, the indicator of economic activity and the indicator of demographic development. Empirical classifications were explored on two different linkages by means of created factors. Individual clusters were compared by average values of factor scores. The results of comparison were discussed.","[Odehnal, Jakub] Univ Def, Dept Econ, CZ-60200 Brno, Czech Republic; [Michalek, Jaroslav] Univ Technol, Inst Math, Fac Mech Engn, CZ-61600 Brno, Czech Republic",University of Defence - Czech Republic; Brno University of Technology,"Odehnal, J (通讯作者)，Univ Def, Dept Econ, Kounicova 65, CZ-60200 Brno, Czech Republic.",jakub.odehnal@unob.cz; michalek@fme.vutbr.cz,"Michalek, jaroslav/ABC-3753-2020","Michalek, Jaroslav/0000-0002-8719-5722",,,,,29,10,10,1,17,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The proposed scenario is: when the input of one activity depends on the input of the rest of the activities and these input have domains. Then the problem becomes which set of values of the input parameters should be chosen in the range that optimizes the overall behaviour of the activities that work together. In this paper, a methodology to model optimization agreements in business processes when these activities are also based on Web Services is proposed. In order to reach this type of agreement, an adaptation of a constraint satisfaction problem algorithm is developed.

The answer to this question depends on the scale of the local housing demand shock associated with immigration and the growth in the Hispanic population in a city. This chapter reviews the existing literature on the issue and introduces a number of new facts. Cities that received immigrants experienced faster housing price and rent appreciation during the last two decades of the 20th century. Hispanic-dense metropolitan areas have more expensive housing. Part of the price differential is due to the growth in the Hispanic population, and we derive a statistical causal link between Hispanic growth and average housing price growth. However, within metropolitan areas it is precisely those neighborhoods with increasing Hispanic share where relatively slower housing price and rent appreciation took place. The facts are consistent with immigrant and Hispanic population growth generally driving up the demand for living in a city, but with increasing ethnic segregation within the city.","[Saiz, Albert] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,,saiz@wharton.upenn.edu,"Saiz, Albert/AAZ-2321-2021",,,,,,23,2,3,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4419-6681-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,233,251,,10.1007/978-1-4419-6682-7_12,0.0,,,19,Economics; Ethnic Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Ethnic Studies,BTU03,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288059300012,0

By using 46 public universities' libraries as the main sample, this study tested three hypotheses that are related to the nature of quality management practices by individual construct, as well as by aggregation value, and to what extent the difference in the numbers of staff and the type of organization will influence the quality management practices.

The validity of the constructs is measured using factor analysis and its reliability is measured by Cronbach's alpha. It means that study sample perceives those constructs are important to maintain service quality to its customer.

S. and European Union (EU) demand spillovers and the elasticity of world trade to GDP during the global recession of 2008-09. Cross-border intermediate goods linkages have implications for the transmission of shocks and the relationship between demand, trade, and production across countries. This paper finds that 20-30 percent of the decline in U.S. and EU final demand was borne by foreign countries, with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and emerging Europe hit hardest. Allowing final demand to change in all countries simultaneously, the framework presented here delivers an elasticity of world trade to GDP of 2.8. Thus, demand forces alone can account for roughly 70 percent of the trade collapse. Large changes in demand for durables play an important role in driving these results.

Fiscal imbalance - a deviation from the optimal fiscal gap - occurs when the second-best allocation of resources in a federation cannot be achieved because fiscal transfers do not or cannot undo fiscal externalities among regional and federal governments. Under reasonable circumstances, we find that labor mobility increases the optimal fiscal gap, that is, increases the transfers required to achieve the second-best optimum. In a decentralized federation, the optimal fiscal gap cannot be achieved. In the absence of labor mobility, vertical fiscal externalities will apply. Regional governments will overspend, which will induce the federal government to create a negative fiscal imbalance to contain the size of its tax rate, assuming it can commit to future transfers. If the federal government cannot commit, regions will overspend even more and federal transfers will be excessive, leading to a positive fiscal imbalance. In both cases, mobility of labor mitigates the fiscal imbalance by reducing the tendency of regions to overspend.","[Boadway, Robin] Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Tremblay, Jean-Francois] Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON, Canada",Queens University - Canada; University of Ottawa,"Boadway, R (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",boadwayr@econ.queensu.ca; Jean-Francois.Tremblay@uottawa.ca,,,,,,,63,7,7,2,17,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

This paper provides a theoretical model of hidden overconfidence and demonstrates that a competitive insurance market may settle on separating equilibrium with advantageous selection predicting a negative relationship between risk and coverage. By assuming heterogeneity in risk perception and hidden action on self-protection, we find that, in equilibrium, the rational type of individual takes precautions to reduce the loss probability, whereas the overconfident type of individual will not make any effort.

The adverse selection cost of privately-placed Canadian SEOs decreases after Multilateral Instrument 45-102 reduced the lock-up period to four months in 2001.

This analysis is made possible by access to a new survey data set of Irish firms, which includes detailed information on firm characteristics and on the destinations of their exports over a 2-year period. In line with Eaton et al. (Am Econ Rev 94:150-154, 2004), we find that a large number of firms serve only the domestic market and many exporting firms export to a single foreign market. Although there is little movement of firms into and out of exporting, firms' involvement in individual export markets is much more dynamic. Over one-third of firms change their market coverage, usually by entering or exiting one additional market. This is consistent with an interpretation where the bulk of any sunk cost encountered in exporting is incurred during the initial entry to the export market. Subsequent entry to additional markets may be made easier by prior export experience, which could help reduce the sunk cost of extending market coverage.","Cent Bank & Financial Serv Author Ireland, Dublin 2, Ireland",,"Lawless, M (通讯作者)，Cent Bank & Financial Serv Author Ireland, POB 559,Dame St, Dublin 2, Ireland.",martina.lawless@centralbank.ie,,"Lawless, Martina/0000-0002-3484-8670",,,,,24,12,12,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

The workers examined are Indian nonagricultural regular workers, using micro-data from the 2004-5 Employment and Unemployment Survey conducted by the National Sample Survey Organisation, linked to state-level factors. A notable result is that the reach of communist parties has considerable effect on unionization probability. Moreover, it seems that the mere existence of communist parties in a state also facilitates unionization to some extent. State-level political activism and unemployment rate also influence the individual decision to join a union. The paper concludes also that a worker's gender, marital status, ethnic background, employment status, experience, occupation, sector of employment, establishment size, and type of industry remain important in the determination of union membership.","Indira Gandhi Inst Dev Res, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",,"Pal, R (通讯作者)，Indira Gandhi Inst Dev Res, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.",,"Pal, Rupayan/AAF-4646-2020; Pal, Rupayan/AAU-4717-2021; Pal, Rupayan/AAN-7062-2021","Pal, Rupayan/0000-0002-9475-2179;",,,,,25,2,2,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

The Turing mechanism or Turing diffusion-induced instability has been central to the understanding of forces which endogenously generate spatial patterns, but in a context where agents do not explicitly optimize an objective. The present paper reviews tools to study, in the spirit of Turing's analysis, a mechanism generating optimal diffusion-induced instability where optimizing agents generate optimal agglomerations. By extending the maximum principle to the optimal control of partial differential equations, it is shown how under certain conditions it will be optimal to design controls so that the price-quantity system implied by the costate-state functions of the optimal control of distributed parameter systems induces optimal spatial patterns. These methods might be useful in studying pattern formation both in problems of resource management and of economic development.","Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, Athens 10434, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business,"Xepapadeas, A (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, 76 Patiss St, Athens 10434, Greece.",xepapad@aueb.gr,"Xepapadeas, Anastasios/ABH-3240-2020",,,,,,26,18,19,1,21,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Specifically, our empirical results show that durable goods expenditures are a relatively powerful element of the monetary transmission mechanism with semi-durables consumption having a somewhat smaller impact. Our results also provide an explanation for the puzzle that the nominal expenditure share of durables has remained relatively stable in recent years while the real expenditure share has increased dramatically. In addition, this paper demonstrates that the potential bias in substitution estimates from using artificial break-adjusted monetary data can be reduced by using the relatively new non-break adjusted monetary data produced by the Bank of England.

I model such concerns by emphasizing the desire to get ahead of the Joneses, which implies that aversion to idiosyncratic risk is lower than aversion to aggregate risk. The model predicts that investors hold concentrated portfolios in equilibrium, which helps rationalize the small premium for undiversified entrepreneurial risk. In the model, status concerns are more important for wealthier households. Consequently, these households own a disproportionate share of risky assets, particularly private equity, and experience greater volatility of consumption, consistent with empirical evidence.","[Roussanov, Nikolai] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Roussanov, Nikolai] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Roussanov, N (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,,,,,,,71,62,70,0,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

We criticize this use because it neglects the important role played by incentives. Since in a NDG players are assumed to divide a windfall, there is no way to model the idea that expectations concerning the way in which the pie will be divided will influence the size of the pie itself. As a remedy, we propose to replace the NDG with an alternative game we dub Produce and Divide the Dollar (PAD). It is a simple Nash Demand Game, in which the pie to be divided is the result of an investment made by one of the two agents. In Andreozzi (2007) the evolutionary version of this game in which agents are allowed to have heterogeneous preferences is analyzed. Here we use these results to claim that the PAD offers a better paradigm for the evolutionary approach to moral norms than the simpler NDG. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Using microsimulation modelling based on the UK corporate tax system, it argues that the cyclical volatility of firms' gross profits and off-setting deductions are potentially important but distinct determinants of the size of these behavioural responses. This arises both because deductions claimed are typically a relatively large fraction of declared gross profits and because of the endogenous relationships between various deductions and those profits. The endogeneity arises mainly from asymmetries in the tax treatment of losses, which generates an asymmetric cycle in the claiming of losses and capital allowances as profit off-sets. Microsimulation modelling shows that these aspects can be sizeable compared with recent estimates of firms' profit-shifting responses found in the empirical literature.","[Gemmell, Norman] The Treasury, Wellington, New Zealand",,"Gemmell, N (通讯作者)，The Treasury, POB 3724, Wellington, New Zealand.",norman.gemmell@treasury.govt.nz,,,,,,,32,2,2,0,12,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,SEP,2010,66.0,3,,,,,207,235,,10.1628/001522110X537355,0.0,,,29,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,684MS,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284554600001,0

For this purpose we conducted an online experiment with individuals who had been involved in international climate policy. The experiment consisted of two simple non-strategic games suited to measure individual inequality aversion as captured by the equity preference model of Fehr and Schmidt (Quarterly Journal of Economics 114:817-868, 1999). We find that our participants show an aversion to advantageous inequality to a considerable extent while the aversion to disadvantageous inequality is moderate. Regarding the geographical variety in our sample, we cannot confirm significant differences in the degree of inequality aversion between different regions in the world. Our conclusion is that regional differences in addressing climate change are driven more by national interests than by different equity concerns.","[Dannenberg, Astrid] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Sturm, Bodo] Leipzig Univ Appl Sci, Leipzig, Germany; [Vogt, Carsten] Bochum Univ Appl Sci, Bochum, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Hochschule Bochum,"Dannenberg, A (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, L 7,1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.",dannenberg@zew.de,,,,,,,41,34,35,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

From a theoretical point of view this practice is contentious since a household's command over resources is determined not only by its spending power over commodities it can buy in the market but also on resources available to the household members through non-market mechanisms such as the in-kind provisions of the welfare state and the value of private non-cash incomes. In developed market economies the most important private non-cash income component is imputed rent from owner-occupied or subsidized accommodation. Employing a wider definition of imputed rent that also allows the analyst to capture income advantages among tenants living in rent-subsidized accommodations of various sorts (including rent-free or reduced-rent households), the present paper examines the differential effects of including imputed rents in the concept of resources in five European countries (Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy and the UK). The results suggest that in almost all cases, the inclusion of imputed rents in the concept of resources leads to a decline in measured levels of inequality and poverty. The main beneficiaries are outright homeowners and households living in rent-free (or heavily subsidized) accommodation most often older persons. The inclusion of imputed rents in the concept of resources does not lead to substantial changes in the ranking of the countries according to their level of inequality, despite widespread differences in the rates of home ownership and subsidization across the countries studied here.

Banks issue collateralized loans to both households and firms, obtain funding via deposits, and accumulate capital out of retained earnings. Loan margins depend on the banks' capital-to-assets ratio and on the degree of interest rate stickiness. Balance-sheet constraints establish a link between the business cycle, which affects bank profits and thus capital, and the supply and cost of loans. The model is estimated with Bayesian techniques using data for the euro area. The analysis delivers the following results. First, the banking sector and, in particular, sticky rates attenuate the effects of monetary policy shocks, while financial intermediation increases the propagation of supply shocks. Second, shocks originating in the banking sector explain the largest share of the contraction of economic activity in 2008, while macroeconomic shocks played a limited role.

In a simple principal-agent framework, I predict that the Chief Executive Officer's (CEO's) pay-performance sensitivity decreases with the executive-hedging cost. Empirically, I find evidence supporting the model's prediction. Providing further support for the theory, I show that shareholders also impose a high sensitivity of CEO wealth to stock volatility and increase financial leverage to resolve the executive-hedging problem. Moreover, executives with lower hedging costs hold more exercisable in-the-money options, have weaker incentives to cut dividends, and pursue fewer corporate diversification initiatives. Overall, the manager's ability to hedge the firm's risk affects governance mechanisms and managerial actions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In three experiments managers were asked to evaluate hypothetical progress statements related to a failing project. Experiment 1 showed that past-oriented statements, describing the amount of work done and amount of budget and time spent (75%), were perceived as revealing a preference for the sunk costs option to a larger extent than future-oriented statements describing the magnitude of work, budget and time remaining (25%). In the next two experiments, progress was described relative to explicit reference points: in Experiment 2 more than 70%, or less than 80% was done/spent, while more than 20%, or less than 30% was remaining; in Experiment 3 almost half was done/spent, or almost half remaining. These different ways of framing progress in terms of work, money, and time were readily interpreted either as arguments in support of continued investments, or as arguments for switching to a novel project, dependent upon the perceived (rather than the numerical) magnitudes of achievements, investments, and remaining resources. The studies contribute to a communicative view of framing, and give an indication of managers' implicit theories of the psychology of sunk costs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Using a new panel data set of about 100,000 bank-dependent small firms for 1997-2002 and focusing on the channel of adaptation (i.e., surviving firms' borrowing costs decline as they age) and that of selection (i.e., total borrowing costs decline as defaulting firms exit), we find that the reputation hypothesis suggested by Diamond (1989) provides a more plausible explanation of the downward sloping age profile of borrowing costs than the firm dynamics (Cooley and Quadrini, 2001) or the relationship banking (Boot and Thakor, 1994) hypothesis. In addition, we examine whether the firm selection process in Japan has been natural or unnatural. Our findings suggest that it has been natural in that firms with lower quality are separated, face higher borrowing costs, and are eventually forced to exit, which contrasts with the results of previous studies on credit allocations in Japan, including Peek and Rosengren (2005). Further, we find that the evolution of borrowing costs is partially due to selection but is mainly attributable to adaptation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The results of this paper demonstrate that the way toll revenue is used modifies the usual results significantly, which are typically based on assuming a lump-sum transfer. First, recycling revenue as investment increases the second-best toll when the benefits from the investment exceed the costs and when demand is inelastic with respect to the toll. Recycling revenue as a subsidy has no such effect. Second, partial cost-benefit analysis that focuses only on the targeted transport mode would usually lead to erroneous conclusions about whether toll revenues should be used for transport investment, subsidies, or general tax revenues. Thus, full cost-benefit analysis, which accounts for changes in consumer and producer surpluses in all transport modes, is necessary. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This paper seeks to do so, by exploring the existence of environmental equity in China. Specifically, we first calculate traditional measures of urban income inequality (the Gini coefficient and Theirs T and L indices) for the years 1995 and 2004. Then, we estimate 'pollution-adjusted' incomes using China-based health functions and economic valuation studies, and recalculate the income (or now welfare) inequality measures. The results indicate that as pollution cleanup efforts gain traction over time, the regressive consequences of pollution may diminish. We thus conclude with an encouraging note for developing countries: improving welfare distribution can coexist with an improving environment.","[Brajer, Victor; Mead, Robert W.; Xiao, Feng] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Econ, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA",California State University System; California State University Fullerton,"Brajer, V (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Econ, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA.",vbrajer@fullerton.edu,,,,,,,81,13,15,3,31,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Despite a large body of literature examining the effects of grant aid on four-year and public two-year college enrollment, for-profit colleges particularly the vast majority that offer two-year degrees and certificates have largely been ignored. Using panel data methods and a new administrative data set of for-profit colleges operating in California between 1989 and 2003, I assess the impact of the federal Pell Grant program, the G.I. Bill, and California's Cal Grant program on the net number of for-profit colleges per county. The results suggest that for both Pell and Cal Grants, increases in the per-student maximum award encourage for-profit entry. This relationship is particularly strong in counties with high adult poverty levels, where more students are eligible for aid. Further, these gains in the private sector do not appear to come at the expense of the public sector Rather public community colleges also experience enrollment gains as the generosity of Pell and Cal Grants increases, although this reaction appears to be weaker than the reaction of for-profits (C) 2010 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management","George Washington Univ, Trachtenberg Sch Publ Policy Adm, Washington, DC 20052 USA",George Washington University,"Cellini, SR (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Trachtenberg Sch Publ Policy Adm, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",,,,,,,,52,30,85,1,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

The 37 years that passed from the moment of its accession were not characterized only by expansion periods, nor were they characterized by a rapid improvement in the economic indicators. Ireland was confronted with 2 oil crises and with a pro-cyclical fiscal expansion combined with salary increases, which had a negative impact on the economy. The budgetary consolidation, fiscal reform and moderate salaries established through a social partnership contributed to the rise in competitiveness, transforming Ireland into an attractive country for foreign direct investments. The measures taken at the national level created the necessary climate for the successful absorption of EU funds. Until the end of 1999, Ireland had absorbed 74.4% of the cohesion funds allocated and starting with 2000 the absorption rate raised to 92.1% of the amounts allocated until 2003 when Ireland didn't meet anymore the criteria for assistance through the Cohesion Fund. Ireland focused on the implementation of transport and environment infrastructure projects, on the development of human resources and the improvement of education, succeeding in the same time to attract direct foreign investments in the high-tech industry from companies that had entered the single market. Ireland can provide, even after a summary analysis of the path followed to access EU funds, an example of best practices on the pragmatic approach and coherent policy elaboration designed to attract and implement EU funds, on the prioritization and guidance of the funds towards increased efficiency and the development of a healthy macroeconomic environment, on the creation of a partnership between the state, employers, unions, farmers, etc. in order to ensure credibility and support for government's strategies.","[Coman, Amalia Nicoleta] European Commiss, Directorate Gen Hlth & Consumers, Brussels, Belgium; [Coman, Paul] Cent European Acad Sci & Art, Paris, France",,"Coman, AN (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Directorate Gen Hlth & Consumers, Brussels, Belgium.",amalia_coman@yahoo.com,,,,,,,11,3,4,0,21,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2010,12.0,28,,,,,661,674,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,617XA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279314000028,0

Our results also show that the existence of trust between firm and bank improves access to financing and reduces the borrowing costs, whereas it increases the likelihood that guarantees will have to be provided.

Failure to control for locational effects, however, can lead to biased estimation of the importance of individual and household characteristics.

We show that, consistent with the pecking-order theory, PSD can be used as an inexpensive screening device, and we find empirically that firms choosing PSD loans are more likely to improve their credit ratings than firms choosing fixed-interest loans.

They also show that home prices in higher priced ZIP Codes have greater exposure to capital market risk factors, consistent with higher levels of wealth and capital market participation, on average, among owners of higher priced homes.","[Anderson, Christopher W.] Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Beracha, Eli] E Carolina Univ, Greenville, NC 27858 USA",University of Kansas; University of North Carolina; East Carolina University,"Anderson, CW (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",cwanderson@ku.edu; berachae@ecu.edu,,,,,,,26,4,4,0,3,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

Instead, subjects place high weight on annualized returns since inception. Fees paid decrease with financial literacy.

While research on the role of language as a learning process is widespread, there is no evidence on the role of language as a signal of cultural affinity. We pursue this latter avenue of research and show that subtle language affinity is positively linked with change in earnings when using English-speaking data for cities in the Golden Horseshoe area in Southern Ontario during the period 1991 to 2001.

Using data from five seasons of European cup football matches it is found that referees favour home teams when awarding yellow and red cards. Previous research on referee decisions in national leagues has identified social pressure as a key reason for favouritism. While social pressure is also found to be an important influence in this study, the international setting shows that nationality is another important influence on the decision making of referees. In considering principal-agent relationships account needs to be taken not only of how agents (referees) decide under social pressure but also of how national identity shapes agents' decision making.

In this paper we provide new time series techniques to investigate the validity of this finding in several foreign exchange options markets, including the Euro market. First, we develop a new fractional cointegration test that is shown to be robust to both stationary and non-stationary regions. Second, we employ both intra-day and daily data to measure realized volatility in order to assess the relevance of data frequency in resolving the bias. Third, we use data on implied volatility traded on the market. In contrast to previous studies, we show that the frequency of data used for measuring realized volatility within a fractionally cointegrating framework is important for the results of unbiasedness tests. Significantly, for many popular exchange rates, the use of intra-day rather than daily data affects the emergence of a different bias, as the possibility of a fractionally integrated risk premium admits itself!

Economists propose tradable permit systems as a solution, but they are difficult to implement due to the nature of non-point sources. We present a pollution offset system for trading non-point source water pollution permits. Conventional pollution offset systems suffer from thin markets and transaction costs. In this paper, we show how to overcome these problems with a centrally managed common-pool market. We define permits as allowable nitrate loading to a groundwater aquifer. This trading system utilizes estimates of potential nitrate leaching from land uses, a set of transport coefficients generated from a simulation of nitrate transport in groundwater, an online trading system, and a linear program to clear the market. We illustrate the concept using a hypothetical case study.","[Prabodanie, R. A.

One is that the optimal number of tail observations to use in the estimation is a function of the unknown tail index being estimated, which diminishes the empirical relevance of the Hill estimation. The other is that the hypothesis test of the underlying data lying in the domain of attraction of an alpha-stable law (alpha<2) or of a normal law (alpha >= 2) for finite samples, is performed on the basis of the asymptotic distribution, which can be different from those for finite samples. In this paper, using the Monte Carlo technique, we propose an exact test method for the stability parameter of alpha-stable distributions which is based on the Hill estimator, yet is able to provide exact confidence intervals for finite samples. Our exact test method automatically includes an estimation procedure which does not need the assumption of a known number of observations on the distributional tail. Empirical applications demonstrate the advantages of our new method in comparison with the Hill estimation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This article examines the Labour Market Agreements for Persons with Disabilities to highlight impediments to social program expansion and reform within governments as well as between governments, and how the design of recent agreements serves to reinforce those impediments. We find that the linkage of accountability and policy learning means that learning gets caught up in long-standing federal-provincial disputes over jurisdiction, and leads to a perverse form of learning. We also find significant barriers to innovation in the nature of federal government funding, which provides neither incentives for have provinces to expand their programming nor sufficient funds for have not provinces to successfully transform their programs.","[Graefe, Peter] McMaster Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada; [Levesque, Mario] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Polit Sci, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada",McMaster University; Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Graefe, P (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada.",,,"Graefe, Peter/0000-0002-1499-2691",,,,,57,6,7,1,4,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

We find that banks with concentrated control exhibit poorer performance, lower cost efficiency, greater return volatility, and higher insolvency risk, relative to widely held ones. We also document that legal institutions and private monitoring effectively reduce the detrimental effects of concentrated control and that official disciplinary power plays a weak governance role, whereas government intervention exacerbates the adverse effects. Further evidence shows that the relations between control concentration and bank operating characteristics are curvilinear and vary according to the types of controlling owners. Overall, our findings support the contention that country-level institutions play important roles in constraining insider expropriation, and that private monitoring mechanisms are more effective than are public rules and supervision in governing banks.

While measuring financial resources remains central, having reliable information about material deprivation adds to the ability to capture poverty and social exclusion.

They are most productively used when multidimensionality is explicitly taken into account, both in framing the question and in empirical application.

The paper argues that national TV networks changed the relative position of national versus local and regional producers and sellers of goods and services. Instead of preferring state and local social regulation, the emerging national firms preferred federal social regulation. Since national markets were emerging, the same national firms lobbied for regulatory reform in transportation and communication services. The rise of national markets associated with national TV networks also stimulated a demand for mergers and consolidations.

Funds that systematically trade counter to the public information form a homogenous subset of the privately informed funds. By using private information that contradicts the public information, these funds exhibit a superior average performance.

J,"Baird, M; Wihardja, MM",,,,"Baird, Mark; Wihardja, Maria Monica",,,Survey of recent developments,BULLETIN OF INDONESIAN ECONOMIC STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Sri Mulyani's resignation as finance minister in May disturbed markets and aroused concern about the government's commitment to reform. This concern was partly alleviated by the appointment of two well-respected individuals as finance minister and deputy finance minister. Further progress with reform will depend heavily on this new team and other key officials. Strong presidential support will also be needed to resist attempts by parliament to interfere excessively with the finance ministry's work. The economy continued its steady recovery from the impact of the global financial crisis (GFC), but the recovery could still be jeopardised if sovereign debt concerns in Europe persist and block the rebound in global trade and commodity prices. Inflation continues to accelerate, suggesting little room for complacency on monetary policy. Fiscal policy, on the other hand, remains conservative. The higher deficit in the revised 2010 budget is not excessive, and is unlikely to be realised in any case. The real budget challenge is to spend budgeted amounts fully and well. The new five-year plan is also conservative and does little to clarify spending priorities, including for the president's 'connectivity' agenda. Despite the GFC, poverty continued to decline, thanks largely to the uninterrupted expansion of GDP and to cash transfers to the poor. Unemployment also continued to fall, although particular groups suffered slight increases in unemployment (young workers 15-25 years old) and somewhat larger reductions in working hours (urban, non-poor, and male-headed households). Nevertheless the large and sustained deceleration of manufacturing growth and the closely related dramatic shift of employment from the formal to the informal sector provide cause for concern. Distortionary labour market policies may help to explain both. A new mining law significantly alters the legal environment for firms in this industry, and also introduces long discredited policies intended to 'increase value added' by requiring the domestic processing of minerals. A new law on local government taxes attempts to reduce uncertainty for citizens and investors, but the nature of overall spending by local governments is of much greater importance for the investment climate. The central government has recently been seeking to restore the role of the 'missing intermediate' level of government and to boost the centre's indirect control over local governments through provincial governments and governors. This strategy is unlikely to succeed, but it highlights the conflicting requirements for provincial governors to act as agents of the central government while also being accountable to their provincial electorates.","[Wihardja, Maria Monica] Ctr Strateg & Int Studies, Jakarta, Indonesia",,,,,,,,,,26,17,18,2,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-4918,,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

He was hired with a mandate to establish ethanol as a global commodity and to open new markets for the industry's sugar, ethanol and bioelectricity output. But he faced complex challenges. The main challenge related to the role of UNICA in leading industry-wide sustainability initiatives. This required coordination of 70,000 sugarcane producers and 430 processors; engagement with outside stakeholders in Brazil and abroad; and implementing programs that balanced economic, social and environmental outcomes. A second set of challenges emanated from the rapid growth and dramatic structural changes occurring in the industry. This case study describes UNICA's unique approach to sustainability and how it is changing the industry, allowing the reader to analyze the effectiveness of this approach in delivering sustainability.","[Chaddad, Fabio Ribas] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Chaddad, Fabio Ribas] Insper, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; Insper,"Chaddad, FR (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, 125 Mumford Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",chaddadf@missouri.edu,,,,,,,0,8,9,0,6,INT FOOD & AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW,COLLEGE STATION,"333 BLOCKER BUILDING, 2124 TAMU, COLLEGE STATION, TX 77843-2124 USA",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

In this paper, we used cluster analysis (hierarchical classification) and the AT-GARCH model in order to classify the mutual stock funds in Romania. The variables taken into consideration for the cluster analysis are represented by minimum constant risk, time-varying standard risk, turmoil risk and average of the returns. The estimation of the components risk will enable us to take into account the stochastic nature of the financial time series.

In most cases,gentrification tends to cause serious conflicts within the society,questioning its sustainability. Our diagnosis and visionary solution of this issue is that insufficient measures to accommodate housing demands of low-income households is what magnifies the issue,and therefore, that efforts should be made to provide affordable housings and human services for the disadvantaged. On the other hand, in an aging society, Korea is witnessing a remarkable decrease in the number of school-aged children, leaving many classrooms unused. If these classrooms can be used to provide the much-needed affordable housings near redevelopment sites, it should contribute as an effort to solve gentrification while reducing spatial inefficiency. Another general trend is the information society. With information technologies, local administration offices are capable of covering larger populations. Since the population tends to decrease in an aging society, this only results in the closing down of surplus administration facilities. Similar to the case of school classrooms, these spaces can be converted to housing units. However, the aforementioned strategy must overcome NIMBY, where local residents are sure to object the conversion of the buildings solely for the disadvantaged. To overcome this challenge, we propose a conceptual model called' Housing-Mixed Public Facility,' which is a conversion model including public services that all local households would benefit from. We have explored the services that could be used in this model, and have applied the model onto the two public building types by producing architectural plans and design guidelines.","[Choi, Jaepil; Choi, Young-Jun; Moon, Guen-Jong; Byun, Na-Hyang] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Architecture, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),,jpchoi@snu.ac.kr; yjchoi17@snu.ac.kr; realmoon77@hotmail.com; nhcloud@hotmail.com,,,,,,,10,1,1,0,10,CHINA ARCHITECTURE & BUILDING PRESS,BEIJING,"BAIWANZHUANG XICHENGGU, BEIJING, 10037, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-112-12328-5,,,,2010,,,,,,,403,414,,,,,,12,Economics; Urban Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,BRM62,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000283112400029,0

The recent turmoil in financial markets, however, has raised questions about whether fair value accounting is exacerbating the problems. In this paper, we review the history and practice of fair value accounting, and summarize the literature on the channels through which it can adversely affect the real economy. We propose a new model to study the interaction of accounting rules with regulatory capital requirements, and show that even when market prices always reflect fundamental values, the interaction of fair value accounting rules and a simple capital requirement can create inefficiencies that are absent when capital is measured by adjusted book value. These distortions can be avoided, however, by redefining capital requirements to be procyclical rather than by abandoning fair value accounting and the other benefits that it provides.

This study concluded that the results of quantitative indicators should be greater than 0.8 bankruptcy reorganization; otherwise, liquidation should be conducted.","[Luan Fugui; Li Jia] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Accounting Sch, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China",Capital University of Economics & Business,,luanfugui@163.com,,,,,,,19,0,0,1,6,ORIENT ACAD FORUM,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-646-54627-8,,,,2010,,,,,,,229,234,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYZ54,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300799000037,0

The experience of Poland in this respect dates back to 2006. On the level of regional government budget, the first attempts at performance budgeting were made in 2007, while preparing a budget bill for 2008. A vast spectrum of government administration tasks implemented by voivodes, together with the evolution of the concept of shape and content involving performance budgeting led to subsequent years modifications in voivodships' performance budgeting. The years of 2009 and 2010 were the time for redefining the structure and scale of tasks, which was combined with the attempts to limit the range of voivodes' level of authority. There were also attempts towards integration of voivodes' tasks with those of other budget resources' administrators, introduced in 2009. The analysis of the country budget from 2008 to 2010 proves that the structure of tasks implemented by voivodes has changed. It reflects a tendency to neglect too far-fetched minuteness, as suggested by voivodes in the earlier stages of budget forming. At the same time, there are certain functions of the national administration, for which voivodes' expenses are vital, and there are tasks requiring only a slight participation in this respect. It is also crucial that within the four years a system of indicators facilitating negotiations with local self governments responsible for the tasks was developed. The last, but equally important issue discussed in this report is the problem of implementation of information policy concerning performance budgeting. This author's analysis indicates the need to develop activities aimed at informing both the parties (institutions and organizations) involved in budget expenditure, and the general public. The aim is to make both of these groups aware of the hierarchy of goals on national scale, as well as provide information on budget apportionment for individual tasks. words.","[Olejniczak, Jaroslaw; Bednarska-Olejniczak, Dorota] Wroclaw Univ Econ, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Olejniczak, J (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Ul Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",jaroslaw.olejniczak@ue.wroc.pl; dorota.olejniczak@ue.wroc.pl,"Bednarska-Olejniczak, Dorota/R-6238-2017; Bednarska-Olejniczak, Dorota/AFQ-1572-2022; Olejniczak, Jarosław/F-7780-2014","Bednarska-Olejniczak, Dorota/0000-0002-4472-0099; Olejniczak, Jarosław/0000-0003-2028-8446",,,,,9,0,0,2,9,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2123-6,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2010,,,,,,,125,131,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA6AE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000337077600015,0

Furthermore, for the first time the direction of causality in this relationship is investigated systematically by testing for self-selection of more productive firms into importing, and for productivity-enhancing effects of imports ('learning-by-importing'). We find a positive link between importing and productivity. From an empirical model with fixed enterprise effects that controls for firm size, industry, and unobservable firm heterogeneity we see that the premia for trading internationally are about the same in West and East Germany. Compared to firms that do not trade at all two-way traders do have the highest premia, followed by firms that only export, while firms that only import have the smallest estimated premia. We find evidence for a positive impact of productivity on importing, pointing to self-selection of more productive enterprises into imports, but no clear evidence for the effect of importing on productivity due to learning-by-importing.","[Vogel, Alexander; Wagner, Joachim] Leuphana Univ Lueneburg, Inst Econ, D-21314 Luneburg, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg,"Wagner, J (通讯作者)，Leuphana Univ Lueneburg, Inst Econ, POB 2440, D-21314 Luneburg, Germany.",avogel@leuphana.de; wagner@leuphana.de,"Wagner, Joachim/D-8156-2012; Vogel, Alexander/B-2286-2012; Wagner, Joachim/AAF-4949-2020","Wagner, Joachim/0000-0001-6058-4536;",,,,,29,123,129,2,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Results suggest technological progress, once Indian commercial banks have adjusted to the new regulatory environment. This, however, does not translate in efficiency gains. There is also evidence of an ownership effect on the level and pattern of efficiency change.

We assume that the labor union's relative preferences between wage and employment depend on selected measures of firm's financial performance. The paper shows that if the labor union ties its preference for wage to the firm's dividends (or to any other quantity measuring available liquidity), then the volatility of the firm's returns increases. Consequently, equities have to grant high expected returns in order to remunerate the increased volatility. This mechanism offers an explanation for the equity premium (that is the difference between the equity return rate and the risk free rate). It is a welcome result that the simulated excess return is about the empirical estimate and that it is obtained with a plausibly low parameterization of the shareholders' risk aversion.

Across a range of existing explanations for insensitivity to scope (commodity mis-specification, embedding, warm glows) there seems to exist no clear conclusion on how to deal with the problem. This paper provides an alternative explanation for insufficient sensitivity to scope, based on re-definition of the determinants of value for environmental goods within an attributes-based choice model. In the proposed framework respondents' Willingness To Pay need depend not only on physical characteristics of a good, but may also depend on the 'label' under which the environmental good is 'sold' in the hypothetical market. To investigate this problem, a Choice Experiment study of biodiversity was conducted. We find that controlling for the effects of a label-in this case, national park designation-leads to significant increase in the scope sensitivity of welfare measures.","[Czajkowski, Mikoaj] Univ Warsaw, Warsaw Ecol Econ Ctr, Warsaw, Poland; [Hanley, Nick] Univ Stirling, Dept Econ, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland",University of Warsaw; University of Stirling,"Czajkowski, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Warsaw Ecol Econ Ctr, Warsaw, Poland.",miq@wne.uw.edu.pl; n.d.hanley@stir.ac.uk,"Hanley, Nick/C-1759-2012; Czajkowski, Mikołaj/K-2292-2012","Czajkowski, Mikołaj/0000-0001-5118-2308; Hanley, Nick/0000-0002-1362-3499",,,,,47,50,56,0,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

For the output growth and uncertainty relationship, it is observed that the larger the output growth the lower the output growth uncertainty. Some evidence have also been obtained in favor of that an increase in inflation uncertainty lowers output growth and that an increase in the latter lowers the former Furthermore, an increase in output growth uncertainty is likely to lead to more inflation. Consequently, it is inferred that policies aiming at reducing inflation would lead to a more efficient functioning of the price system, and this would contribute to the real output growth.","Istanbul Univ, Sosyal Bilimler Enstitusu, Iktisat Ana Bilim Dali, Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul University,"Korap, L (通讯作者)，Istanbul Univ, Sosyal Bilimler Enstitusu, Iktisat Ana Bilim Dali, Istanbul, Turkey.",korap@e-kolay.net,"KORAP, Hüseyin Levent/AAB-6123-2020","KORAP, Hüseyin Levent/0000-0001-6216-5941",,,,,42,0,0,0,6,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,ANKARA,"KUSKONDU SOKAK KILIM APT 14-8, A AYRANCI, ANKARA, 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

This unplanned policy change has led to some disbelief regarding the country's commitment to its inflation objective and to a floating exchange rate. In this paper we analyse whether the adoption of IT has led to an actual shift in the country's approach to the exchange rate. We find greater exchange rate flexibility and milder interventions in the foreign exchange market after IT. We conclude that possible interventions should not be seen as Fear of Floating, but as a required policy for the attainment of the inflation targets. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We estimate an empirical model to re-examine the effect of terrorism on the price of global oil stocks across oil market regimes that reflect different supply constraints. We believe that terrorism will have larger impacts when global capacity is tight (i.e. when global demand is close to global supply). This means that any shock to capacity (say by conflict) should have the largest impact on profits before the first OPEC shock in the early 1970s. Since then, conflict shocks would not allow firms to exploit production in the same way, thus reducing the available profits that could be garnered by such production manipulation. If capacity constraints are binding when a conflict occurs, then we predict that a positive stock price reaction can be expected for oil firms from such a shock. We exploit a new panel dataset to investigate the relationship between oil profitability and conflict, using conflict data from the top 20 oil producing and exporting countries in the world. We show that in the later part of our sample, 1974-2005, as cartel behavior of OPEC member countries has diminished and as conflict has become more regular and thus the information surrounding it noisier, oil stock prices do not increase in response to conflict. However, in earlier capacity constrained eras, we find that oil stocks can in fact increase in response to conflict. In some cases, the impact of conflict may cause the return of oil stocks to increase by as much as 10 percentage points.","[Blomberg, Brock] Claremont Mckenna Coll, Dept Econ, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School; Claremont McKenna College,"Blomberg, B (通讯作者)，Claremont Mckenna Coll, Dept Econ, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",bblomberg@cmc.edu,,,,,,,24,44,44,0,16,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

In this paper, we examine the exchange risk exposure of US firms during 1983-2006, comparing multinational and non-multinational firms and focusing on the role of operational hedging. Since MNCs and non-multinationals differ in size and other characteristics, we construct matched samples of MNCs and non-multinationals based on the propensity score method. We find that the multinationality in fact matters for a firm's exchange exposure but not in the way usually presumed - the exchange risk exposures are actually smaller and less significant for MNCs than non-multi nationals. The results are robust with respect to different samples and model specifications. There is evidence that operational hedging decreases a firm's exchange risk exposure and increases its stock returns. The effective deployment of operational risk management strategies provides one reason why MNCs may have insignificant exchange risk exposure estimates. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The first strand can be traced back to Haavelmo [1954] and has been further developed in a variety of ways by game theoretical models of rational conflict (Boulding [1962]; Schelling [1963], Hirshleifer [2001]). Their goal is to understand threat power. A second version of conflict theory has been developed by the founders of the Public Choice School (Olson [1965, 1982]; Tullock [1974, 1980]; Stringham [2005, 2007]) in order to tackle genuine political violence. The main finding of this paper is that both strands of recent economic literature have not yet come to grips with social conflicts. The application of standard microeconomic assumptions to the field of social conflicts has resulted in reducing conflicts either to rational conflicts- a threat of conflict without any real clash - or real self-interested private conflicts. In other words, economic theory has considered social protesters either as looters or lunatics, but never as a group of people struggling for a common cause.","Univ Paris 08, F-93526 St Denis 02, Vincennes, France",Universite Paris-VIII,"Vahabi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 08, F-93526 St Denis 02, Vincennes, France.",mehrdad.vahabi@wanadoo.fr,,,,,,,112,6,6,2,17,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,2105-2883,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

In particular, we are interested in assessing whether these concepts measure similar forms of gender-biased behavior and whether they have the same effect on workers' job satisfaction and intentions to leave their jobs. Our results provide little support for the notion that survey-based measures of sexual harassment and sex discrimination capture the same underlying behavior. Respondents do appear to differentiate between incidents of sexual harassment and incidents of sex discrimination in the workplace. There are gender differences in the consequences. however. Both sex discrimination and sexual harassment are associated with a higher degree of job dissatisfaction. However, women's intended job changes appear to be more sensitive to experiencing sex discrimination, while men's are more sensitive to experiencing sexual harassment. Although exploratory, when taken together these results give us hope that in the future sufficiently detailed surveys could provide a useful foundation for quantifying the link between sexual harassment and sex discrimination. They also suggest that the best prospect for developing-and then testing-a conceptual framework of gender bias lies in adopting a multi-disciplinary approach incorporating the insights of disciplines such as sociology, psychology, and economics.

However, we find that estimation of a standard affine three-factor model results in a variance state variable that, while instrumental in explaining the shape of the yield curve, is essentially unrelated to GARCH estimates of the quadratic variation of the spot rate process or to implied variances from options. We then investigate four-factor affine models. Of the models tested, only the model that exhibits 'unspanned stochastic volatility' (USV) generates both realistic short rate volatility estimates and a good cross-sectional fit. Our findings suggest that short rate volatility cannot be extracted from the cross-section of bond prices. In particular, short rate volatility and convexity are only weakly correlated.

Standard theory of natural monopoly is extended here to explain why long-run marginal cost (LMC) can be greater than both average cost and short-run marginal cost (SMC) for municipal water utilities. The distinctions between benign monopoly rates and marginal cost rate design favor LMC over SMC as the basis for economically efficient rate design. Taking into account conservation investments by consumers, SMC rates are economically inefficient, except during temporary shortages. The City of Los Angeles adopted economically efficient, revenue sufficient, and revenue-stable water rates at the end of a prolonged drought. After the drought ended, Los Angeles (LA) modified the rate design, making the design politically feasible during normal rainfall years. Unique features in the LA rate design determine the allocation of consumer surplus among ratepayers, making the rate design politically feasible by sharing efficiency gains among customer classes. Revenue sufficiency and stability features in the rate design minimize adverse job effects on water utility management, reducing the frequency of rate hearings with an increasing block design.

Though Wal-Mart withdrew its application in March 2007, the issue and the debate continue. This article offers a principles-based approach to this issue that begins with the recognition that banks are special and that safety and soundness regulation of banks is therefore warranted. Building on that recognition, the article lays out the principle that the examinability and supervisability of an activity should determine if that activity should be undertaken by a bank. Even if an otherwise legitimate activity is not suitable for a bank, it should be allowed for a bank's owners (whether the owners are individuals or a holding company), so long as the financial transactions between the bank and its owners are closely monitored by bank regulators. The implications of this set of ideas for the Wal-Mart case and for banking and commerce generally are then discussed.

Two types of neural network structure were employed: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Generalized Feed Forward Networks (GFW). Based on these network structures, ten Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model were constructed having varying number of hidden layers and perceptron in each layer. Rival models are evaluated and compared in terms of classification accuracy. Models are estimated by using the data of 1995-2000 periods, and their out-of-sample forecast comparisons are conducted for the period of 1997-2000 for each year prior to bank failures. In addition to ANN models, to compare the classification performance, discriminant and logistic regression models are employed.

It aims to improve the understanding of the impact of tax policy on the behaviour of economic agents. Using an accounting microsimulation model that reproduces the system of taxes and transfers in 2002 in Quebec, we measure the EMTRs that result from the interaction of the mechanisms of income taxation and redistribution. Moreover, we evaluate the distribution of EMTRs in the population. The analysis of EMTRs shows, inter alia, that family policy, whose assistance is targeted toward low-income families, generates high levels of EMTRs ascribable to the generally fast reduction of transfers as income increases. More than a quarter of heads of single-parent households face an EMTR that can reach, and even exceed, 80 percent. As for two-parent families, they mostly face EMTRs of around 50 percent. We show the importance of accounting for EMTR heterogeneity, both with respect to types of families and levels of incomes, as well as evaluating the variability of EMTRs in the population.","[Duclos, Jean-Yves; Fortin, Bernard] Univ Laval, Dept Econ, CIRPEE, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Fortin, Bernard] CIRANO, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Fournier, Andree-Anne] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA USA",Laval University; Universite de Montreal; Analysis Group Inc.,"Duclos, JY (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Dept Econ, CIRPEE, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",,"Lacroix, Guy/H-9015-2017",,,,,,28,0,0,0,2,UNIV TORONTO PRESS INC,TORONTO,"JOURNALS DIVISION, 5201 DUFFERIN ST, DOWNSVIEW, TORONTO, ON M3H 5T8, CANADA",0317-0861,1911-9917,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

Many published indexes still rely on mean or median prices, or favor repeat-sales methods, which require less information about the attributes of the housing units and less econometric expertise on the part of the index compilers. but may be less accurate and robust. In France as in other countries where housing sales have to be recorded in front of a notary. data on transaction prices and characteristics of dwellings are available. Such data have been centralized since 1994. and quarterly hedonic housing price indexes have been computed for more than 10 years. This paper describes the institutional setting of housing transactions in France, and the collaboration between the notaries and the national statistical agency (INSEE). The former are responsible for data collection and regular computation, whereas the latter takes scientific responsibility for the method. The detailed information on the individual properties transacted remains proprietary data, but disaggregated indexes are publicly and freely available.

We first articulate the difficulty of consistently estimating the regional-level production function with public capital that results from the endogeneity of the public capital stock amount. The public capital amount could be endogenous because of the central government's political decision-making process of public capital allocation or the local government's budgetary constraints. Japan's electoral reform in 1994 offers an exogenous variation in the public capital investment across regions, and we exploit this event to estimate the causal effect of public capital on production. The reform drastically changed the distribution of political representation in the Lower House across regions, and it accordingly changed the allocation of public capital across regions as well. We cannot reject the null hypothesis that public capital is not productive based on the estimates from this natural experimental identification strategy. J. Japanese Int.

Comprehensive spending data tend to be cross-sectional whilst panel studies include only limited, aggregated expenditure questions. Recently, economists have begun to use detailed, bar-code-level spending data from household panels collected by market research companies. However, there has not been a detailed assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of this collection method or its implications for the recorded data. This paper seeks to fill this gap by providing an in-depth examination of data from one company, Taylor Nelson Sofres (TNS), recording grocery purchases over five years. We assess how far the ongoing demands of participation lead to 'fatigue' in respondents' recording of their spending and the implications for household attrition, and we provide a detailed comparison of the expenditure data collected by TNS and the well-established Expenditure and Food Survey (EFS). Broadly, we suggest that problems of fatigue and attrition may not be particularly severe, though there are differences in expenditures that cannot be attributed to demographic or time effects and may be suggestive of survey mode effects.","[Leicester, Andrew] UCL, Inst Fiscal Studies, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University College London,"Leicester, A (通讯作者)，UCL, Inst Fiscal Studies, London WC1E 6BT, England.",andrew_l@ifs.org.uk; zoe_o@ifs.org.uk,,,"Economic and Social Research Council [RES-544-28-5001, ES/E024297/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/E024297/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,15,22,22,0,6,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0143-5671,,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

In addition, an economy-wide factor common among bond issues unable to be captured by firm-level factors, plays an important role in determining credit spreads, and these economy-wide effects to a great extent cancel out firm-level factors for some subsample periods, We also identify possible factors responsible for the significant economy-wide effects.

From non-public-interested explanations of the creation of government to historical studies of internalizing externalities under anarchy, public choice scholars are arriving at a more realistic perspective of human interaction with and without government. Although the economics of politics receives more attention, the economics of anarchy is an important area of research in public choice.","[Powell, Benjamin] Suffolk Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Stringham, Edward P.] Trinity Coll, SC Davis Endowment, Hartford, CT 06106 USA",Suffolk University; Trinity College,"Stringham, EP (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll, SC Davis Endowment, 300 Summit St, Hartford, CT 06106 USA.",bpowell@suffolk.edu; edward.stringham@trincoll.edu,,,,,,,156,93,99,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2009,140.0,3-4,,,,,503,538,,10.1007/s11127-009-9407-1,0.0,,,36,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,474KC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268281200013,0

These results are robust to the inclusion of other variables, corrections for endogeneity biases, relaxation of common-slope restrictions, and are invariant over subsample periods. We estimate a vector autoregression to trace out the transmission channel and find the impulse responses consistent with the predictions of a forward-looking model of inflation. Wealth effects of public debt could also affect inflation, as posited by the fiscal theory of the price level, but we do not find supportive evidence. The results suggest that the risk of a debt-inflation trap is significant in highly indebted countries and pure money-based stabilization is unlikely to be effective over the medium term.

It proposes a model of the public sector fiscal response to aid inflows, which allows for changes in structural relationships due to an exogenously imposed program of economic reform. This model is applied to 1960-99 time series data for the Philippines, which embarked on an IMF- and World Bank-funded structural adjustment program in 1980. Estimates of structural and reduced-form equations paint a dismal picture of the effectiveness of foreign aid to, and the structural adjustment program in, the Philippines so far as fiscal impacts are concerned. Both bilateral and multilateral aid inflows, and the presence of an economic reform program, are associated with decreases in public fixed capital expenditure, decreases in taxation and other recurrent revenue, and decreases in public sector saving.

Land reform tends to promote land redistribution through regularization of smallholder land invasions of large-scale landholdings, and by redistribution of public lands to smallholders in existing colonization frontiers. The implications of state-led land reform on deforestation are heterogeneous. I argue that impacts of agrarian reform are strongly related to the pre-existing social and economic configuration Of the Frontiers where it takes place. While it leads to lower rates of deformation in landscapes dominated by smallholders with diversified land use, its impact on forest conversion is higher in landscapes where extensive land use, mainly prompted by large-scale cattle ranching, tends to dominate.

The literature on the economics of targeting warns against that assumption, but evidence has been scarce and the lessons from the literature have often been ignored by practitioners. This paper shows that standard measures of targeting performance are uninformative or even deceptive about the impacts on poverty, and cost-effectiveness in reducing poverty, of a large cash transfer program in China.

We relate these factors non-linearly to movements in the option prices. They seem to be diffusive in nature, have significant associated risk premia, and can account for an overwhelming part of the option price movements. We interpret the options smirk, which is the notion that out-of-the-money (OTM) puts seem expensive relative to OTM calls, in terms of the prices of these risk factors. Going short OTM puts and long OTM calls, corresponding to the third factor, makes a profit on average, but this corresponds to its risk premium, and does not represent a market inefficiency.

Our simulation results show that this policy significantly reduces the European imports of beef corn and bio-ethanol.

Not surprisingly, relationships between airports vary widely, due to a myriad of geographic, economic, political and historical determinants. Further, given the dynamic nature of the many influences acting on the air transportation system, inter-airport relationships and the structure of the global air network as a whole are also constantly changing. The purpose of this paper is to explore such spatio-temporal variations in the structure of the global airport hierarchies. Here, we show how the concept of nodal regions can be applied to measure the extent of these variations. To facilitate this analysis, a database of nearly 900 airline carrier schedules and 4650 worldwide origins and destinations, representing a nearly complete record of commercial air travel over a six-year period, is examined. Given this dataset, nodal regions are derived for all airports represented. In general, results suggest that regions associated with individual airports are often relatively dynamic at the yearly as well as quarterly level. Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) is utilized as a local case-study to provide a detailed examination of these dynamics. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In response to this accusation, CRAs argue that such an attitude would be too dangerous for them, since their reputation is at stake. The objective of this article is to examine the validity of this argument within a formal model: Are reputation concerns sufficient to discipline rating agencies.? We show that the reputation argument only works when a sufficiency large fraction of the CRA income comes from other sources than rating complex products. By contrast when rating complex products becomes a major source of income for the CRA, we show that it is always too lax with a positive probability and inflates ratings with probability one when its reputation is good enough. We provide some empirical support for this prediction, by showing that ceteris paribus, the proportion of subprime residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) that were rated AAA by the three main CRAs indeed increased over the last eight years. We analyze the policy implications of our findings and advocate for a new business model of CRAs that we call the platform-pays model. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

On the one hand, their economies may be boosted by the price effect induced by agricultural liberalization. On the other hand, multilateral tariff cuts will result in the erosion of preferential margins. Based on an original methodology, using CGE modeling, detailed tariff calculations and predictive analysis, this paper investigates the potential impact of current multilateral negotiations on the value of preferences for African agriculture. It estimates the preferential value to USD 0.7 billion of welfare and USD 1 billion of exports to the Triad markets. Furthermore, it highlights the cruel dilemma African countries face in current negotiations, as they gain from ambitious trade liberalization, despite the large preferential erosion, while they suffer from noticeable trade and welfare losses under conservative scenarios.","[Perez, Romain; Jallab, Mustapha Sadni] United Nations Econ Commiss Africa, Trade Finance & Econ Dev Div, Addis Ababa 3005, Ethiopia",,"Perez, R (通讯作者)，United Nations Econ Commiss Africa, Trade Finance & Econ Dev Div, Addis Ababa 3005, Ethiopia.",romain.perez@un.org; msadnijallab@gmail.com,,,,,,,16,2,2,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

For that purpose, we employ a state-of-the-art panel stationarity test, which allows for an unknown number of endogenous structural breaks as well as for cross-sectional correlation. Overall, our analysis renders clear-cut evidence in favor of regime-wise stationarity in U.S. state unemployment, while hysteresis in European unemployment.

The results from the Italian sample showed highly significant effects for detection rates, framing effects, gender and degree choice, Participants declared more as detection rates rose and when tax was framed as a gain. Males and economists declared the least. The instruction to maximise income (instrumentality) encouraged psychologists to declare less, while economists behaved instrumentally whether they were asked to or not. The influence of culture was examined by comparing the two data sets. Although the tax systems of these two countries are very similar, tax evasion is much more common in Italy. As anticipated Italian students declared less than UK students and the results for the Italian sample were more pronounced (e.g. the significant framing effect) but otherwise all are in the same direction.

The impact of derivatives trading on the underlying stock market has been widely documented in the Finance literature. In particular, significant differences in the statistical properties of asset returns (for instance, mean and variance) during expiration and non-expiration days have been advanced as an evidence for the destabilization effect (or lack there of) of derivative instruments. The earlier studies have, however, drawn their conclusions without rigorously modelling the underlying stochastic data generation process. Given that the statistical properties mentioned before are merely traits of the asset returns, this approach can lead to spurious results if analyzed in isolation of the underlying process. We propose to address this crucial shortcoming by examining the expiration day effect from a GARCH (Generalized Auto Regressive Conditional Heteroskedastic) framework. We use both daily and high frequency (5 min and 10 min) data on S&P CNX Nifty Index. Our central finding using intra-day data is that while there is no pressure - downward or upward - on index returns, the volatility is indeed significantly affected by the expiration of contracts. This effect, however, doesn't show up in daily data.

Using household data from the PSID, we generate a panel of households whose homeownership we observe over a 15 year period and whose wealth accumulation we observe at three points in time: 1994, 1999 and 2001. We investigate the extent to which homeownership has an independent impact on the wealth accumulation of LMI households, controlling for a host of other variables and unobserved heterogeneity. Accounting for the skewed nature of the wealth distribution, we find that each additional year of homeownership increases total net wealth by $13.7 K on average for the full sample. Interacting income status with years of homeownership indicates that the impact of homeownership varies by income status, with each additional year of homeownership being associated with $15 K more in wealth holdings for high-income households and roughly $6 to 10 K more in wealth holdings for LMI households.

We show that, when stock returns are predictable, technical analysis adds value to commonly used allocation rules that invest fixed proportions of wealth in stocks. When uncertainty exists about predictability, which is likely in practice, the fixed allocation rules combined with technical analysis can outperform the prior-dependent optimal learning rule when the prior is not too informative. Moreover, the technical trading rules are robust to model specification, and they tend to substantially outperform the model-based optimal trading strategies when the model governing the stock price is uncertain.

Of the 14 models we evaluate across seven empirical datasets, none is consistently better than the 1/N rule in terms of Sharpe ratio, certainty-equivalent return, or turnover, which indicates that, out of sample, the gain from optimal diversification is more than offset by estimation error. Based on parameters calibrated to the US equity market, our analytical results and simulations show that the estimation window needed for the sample-based mean-variance strategy and its extensions to outperform the 1/N benchmark is around 3000 months for a portfolio with 25 assets and about 6000 months for a portfolio with 50 assets.

As a result, monetary policy over recent years has placed more emphasis on stabilizing inflation, resulting in reduced inflation and greater output stability. However, this consensus has not been accompanied by convincing empirical evidence that such a relationship exists. One reason is likely to be that de facto measures of financial globalization are endogenous, and that instruments for financial globalization are elusive. This paper introduces a new instrument-financial remoteness-as a plausibly exogenous instrument for financial openness. It examines the relationship between financial globalization and median inflation levels over an 11-year cross-section from 1994 through 2004, as well as a panel of five-year median inflation levels between 1980 and 2004. The results confirm a negative relationship between median inflation and financial globalization in the base specification, but this relationship is sensitive to the inclusion of conditioning variables or country fixed effects, precluding any strong inferences.

We examine both generalized indirect reciprocity (if A helps B then B helps C) and social indirect reciprocity (if A helps B then C helps A) in a setting where reciprocal behavior cannot be explained by strategic motivations, using a treatment for direct reciprocity as a benchmark. We use a variant of the strategy method to control for differences in first movers' actions across treatments. We find evidence of strong reciprocity within each treatment, for both strategies and decisions. Generalized indirect reciprocity is found to be significantly stronger than social indirect reciprocity and, interestingly, than direct reciprocity. This finding is interpreted as reflecting the relevance of first movers' motivation for second movers' reciprocal behavior. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

I find that collective action is associated with water scarcity, proximity to markets, group size, farm size, and governance structure. Water scarcity has a curvilinear effect on collective action and is mediated by the governance structure. The results suggest the need for a diagnostic approach in the analysis of institutional arrangements in diverse socio-ecological settings. These also suggest that collective action in the commons is more complex than is conventionally assumed in the decentralization literature. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We propose a model of incumbent behavior that features the interplay of two effects: a horizon effect, whereby greater instability leads the incumbent to embezzle more during his short window of opportunity, and a demand effect, by which the private sector is more willing to bribe stable incumbents. The horizon effect dominates at low levels of stability, because firms are unwilling to pay high bribes and unstable incumbents have strong incentives to embezzle, whereas the demand effect gains salience in more stable regimes. Together, these two effects generate a non-monotonic, U-shaped relationship between total corruption and stability. On the empirical side, we find a robust U-shaped pattern between country indices of corruption perception and various measures of incumbent stability, including historically observed average tenures of chief executives and governing parties: regimes that are very stable or very unstable display higher levels of corruption when compared with those in an intermediate range of stability. These results suggest that minimizing corruption may require an electoral system that features some re-election incentives, but with an eventual term limit.","[Campante, Filipe R.] Harvard Univ, Harvard Kennedy Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Chor, Davin] Singapore Management Univ, Singapore, Singapore",Harvard University; Singapore Management University,"Campante, FR (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Harvard Kennedy Sch, 79 JFK St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",filipe_campante@ksg.harvard.edu,"DO, Quoc-Anh/D-1424-2009; CHOR, Davin/D-1422-2009",,,,,,53,49,62,0,32,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

Medieval institutions, however. included a host of internal barriers to trade as well as external ones, and monopoly privileges and high offices were often for sale. In this paper, we analyze how a stable unitary government's regulatory policies may be affected by revenues and other services generated by the efforts of rent seekers. Competition for monopoly privilege can be a significant source of government revenue that augments tax revenues, especially in settings in which collecting ordinary tax revenues is problematic. A revenue-maximizing government encourages greater monopolization than is compatible with economic efficiency, but sells monopoly privileges in a manner that promotes innovation and partially accounts for the deadweight losses associated with monopolized markets. Our analysis provides a possible public finance explanation for relatively successful authoritarian states that have relatively little corruption, but many internal and external barriers to trade.

There are two key results. First, social parochialism is not a pre-requisite for collective management of forests. Moderate levels of social diversity are associated with low collective management, but at high levels of social diversity, collective management is high. Second, moderate wealth heterogeneity is beneficial; however, at high levels and in the presence of benefit heterogeneity, it decreases collective management. Similarly, benefit heterogeneity reduces collective management if wealth heterogeneity also exists.

Taking into account that previous studies have shown the particularly strong correlation between mobile phone use and travel behaviour. telecommunications use is considered by focussing on the mobile phone. Using panel data from Germany for the years 2004 and 2007 the first step consisted in an investigation of changes in mobile phone use taking into consideration also the level from which potential changes started. About one half of the respondents had changed their mobile phone use, in most cases by an increase Of use. In a second step a comparison was made to potential changes in travel behaviour of the observed persons. The results show that in those groups of persons where the mobile phone use was on a high level or even increased from a high level in 2003, travel behaviour in terms of travel frequency decreased less than for all other persons or even increased. The assumption that changes in life circumstances such as new place of residence or change of household size trigger the change in mobile phone use or travel behaviour Could be generally confirmed.

According to the factor loadings, there is a great deal of heterogeneity in the nature of the links between state and national economies. In addition to exhibiting geographic patterns, the closeness of state economies to the national business cycle is related not only to differences in industry mix but also to non-industry variables such as agglomeration and neighbor effects.

A time-varying tail-fatness parameter is introduced in each model, allowing one to change the tail-fatness of the copula function continuously. Fitting our model to comprehensive market data, we find that a model with fixed tail-fatness cannot fit market data well over time.

Although this pattern may reflect considered choices, they may also be the result of alternative decisions about whether to participate in the choice process at all. Alternative methods of dealing with this behaviour, each with associated implications for estimates of economic values, are presented. In particular we consider the alternative strategies of excluding such individuals from the data, using hurdle models to explicitly model this group, and propose the use of latent class models to endogenously allow for different preference structures. An advantage of the latent class approach is that the form of the non-participation need not be defined in advance. These approaches are considered using UK choice experiment data on food choices where the attributes include genetic modification of food. The latent class approach reveals the presence of two forms of non-participation in the data.","[Rigby, Dan] Univ Manchester, Dept Econ, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Burton, Mike] Univ Western Australia, Perth, WA 6009, Australia",University of Manchester; University of Western Australia,"Rigby, D (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Dept Econ, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",dan.rigby@man.ac.uk,"burton, michael/A-9541-2009; Rigby, Dan/A-9606-2009","burton, michael/0000-0003-4213-4093; rigby, dan/0000-0003-0820-5740",,,,,23,30,40,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Yet, the sources of investor information have never been used as a segmentation base to study investment behavior. We analyze survey results of investors in the US using information search, demographic, psychological, and involvement variables. Cluster analysis shows five typologies for investor information search based on sources of information. We also discover the majority of investors perform moderate- to low-information gathering strategies. The 11 demographics variables were insufficient to describe the typologies, although we did find higher-educated mate investors with higher earnings more likely to practice a high-information search strategy, confirming previous studies. Turning to the psychological and involvement variables, we develop distinct typologies and identify several significant predictors for the five investor groups. For the majority of investors, investment decisions present a considerable and unwillingly undertaken challenge, and this study concludes with a discussion of how to target these investor typologies with approaches grounded in behavior-change theory.

Consistent with the predictions made in the life cycle model, higher income growth promotes more household saving, and higher age dependency does the opposite. An increase in the inflation rate appears to encourage household saving. Interestingly, the evidence suggests that an increase in expected pension benefits tends to discourage household saving in China in the long run, but the reverse is found in India.","Monash Univ, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia",Monash University,"Ang, J (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, 900 Dandenong Rd, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia.",james.ang@buseco.monash.edu.au,"Ang, James B/N-4115-2013","ren, xiao peng/0000-0002-6032-8249; Ang, James/0000-0001-9497-0187",,,,,46,23,30,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,,,J DEV STUD,J.

Model simulations suggest that the increase in the excise tax on fuels is welfare improving. In cities, where operation costs of public transport are significantly subsidized, this tool should be accompanied with a fare increase as well, because of costs of public funds. A decrease in fares is not likely to be welfare improving because of small induced modal split and high requirements of public funds needed to cover such policy.","[Bruhova-Foltynova, Hana] Ctr Otazky Zivotniho Prostredi UK Praze, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Bruhová-Foltynová, H (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Environm, Ctr Prague, U Krize 8, CZ-15800 Prague 5, Czech Republic.",bruhova@hotmail.com,"Brůhová Foltýnová, Hana/M-7624-2019; Foltynova, Hana Bruhova/J-5759-2015","Brůhová Foltýnová, Hana/0000-0002-5242-8565;",,,,,31,0,0,0,1,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Using Zambia's cassava task force as an example, the paper describes the value chain task force method and identifies elements critical to its effective implementation.","[Chitundu, Maureen] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Chitundu, M (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 207 Agr Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",blade@msu.edu,,,,,,,63,24,25,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Moreover, firms that borrow from formal or informal sources and those that pay taxes are significantly more likely to stay in business but firms that received credit exhibit lower rates of income growth. These results persist when firm characteristics that are arguably correlated with unobserved entrepreneurial ability are controlled for. Our findings suggest that the significant within-country differences in firm productivity observed in developing economies are due in part to market and government failures that limit the ability of micro-firms to reach their optimal sizes.","[Fajnzylber, Pablo; Maloney, William F.] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Montes-Rojas, Gabriel V.] City Univ London, Dept Econ, London, England",The World Bank; City University London,"Fajnzylber, P (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",pfajnzylber@worldbank.org,"Montes-Rojas, Gabriel/M-4750-2015","Montes-Rojas, Gabriel/0000-0002-8447-4929",,,,,35,57,65,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The issue of theory falsification is mostly associated with the philosopher Karl Popper, but unfortunately the management literature identifies with his rival, Thomas Kuhn. The wish to apply Popper's doctrine in the managerial context faces another difficulty - the formation of the theory. Whilst Popper sketches a hierarchical structure of a theoretic system, managers hold a one-tier theory-of-action that harms falsification. An adaptation of the Popperian method for the managerial context is suggested and examined through Action Research. The findings indicate that a careful extraction of an upper-level theory from the theory-of-action and its testing through derivable scenarios enables early falsification, namely before the actions are taken.","[Faran, Doron] Ort Braude Acad, Coll Engn, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Karmiel, Israel",Braude Academic College of Engineering,,dfaran@braude.ac.il,,,,,,,46,1,1,0,3,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,978-953-253-061-2,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2009,5.0,,,,,,89,101,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BMP23,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273265800008,0

Representatives of municipal authorities of the Czech Republic consider the incorrectly set conditions for budgetary allocation of taxes to be the most significant aspect causing regional disparities. More than half of the resources of municipalities is represented by tax incomes, the amount of that is out of the municipalities' control. Municipalities are suffering from a lack of financial means not only to conduct their regular activities, but especially to cover investment activities. One of the possibilities how to get a sufficient financial resources are extra financial resources from subsidies from public budgets at central or regional level as well as subsidies from abroad (especially from the European Union funds). As the procedure of getting subsidies from these sources is rather complicated, the municipalities suggested (in the collected questionnaires) to simplify the whole process or to discontinue it completely. The municipal authorities representatives are further convinced that regional disparities are supported by depopulation of rural areas, migration of young people to bigger towns, insufficient transport serviceability and low level of housing facilities. Young people are not provided with an adequate social and health care, solid network of pre-school and school facilities and sufficient amount of diversified leisure-time activities.","[Jacova, Helena] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Studentska 2, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic; [Syrovatkova, Jaroslava] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Business Adm, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec; Technical University Liberec,"Jácová, H (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Studentska 2, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic.",helena.jacova@tul.cz; jaroslava.syrovatkova@tul.cz,"Jacova, Helena/G-1561-2019","Jacova, Helena/0000-0001-8622-1899",,,,,10,1,1,0,5,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-523-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,148,+,,,,,,2,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BMK17,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272657000017,0

The paper finds that the behaviours of local government can directly affect the site-selection behaviours of the companies, and can lead to the agglomeration of companies, although that in certain places they may lack initial advantages.

The gross premium written is in the analysis of Czech insurance market one of very important economic indicators. The Czech insurance market ranks with small insurance market, but the sum of gross premium written from insurance companies is in sum of year 2008 in the amount of 139 851 960 000 CZK, number of insurance contracts is 25 205 182 and number of employees in insurance companies is 14 770.

Drawing upon the testimony of seventh-century documentary papyri, this essay reveals the continued role of Christian elites in administering tax collection and the extent to which the Arab conquerors left agrarian social relations largely undisturbed.

Applying the concept of COSO (The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of The National Commission of Fraudulent Financial Reporting) framework into the financial governance system, we can reconstruct the embedded financial governance system based on COSO framework, and better control the company's financial activities.

It is evident especially when we examine the evolution of foreign currency returns, which is probably the segment with the highest liquidity and traded volume of overall financial market. Such a significant growth of realized volatility of market returns should obviously lead to demand of financial institutions on additional capital eligible to cover market risk as it is recognized by supervisor authorities. The aim of this paper is to present an approach based on copula subordinated Levy model application, which is qualified to give a true picture of increased volatility of market returns, including more than normal kurtosis (i.e. higher peaks and fatter tails) and nonlinear dependency assuming portfolio consisting of six currencies, GBP, HUF, EUR, PLN, SKK, and USD. We also study the sensitivity of capital requirements to input parameters of skewness, kurtosis and dependency as specified by parameters of selected models. More particularly, we apply two examples of subordinated Levy models, the variance gamma model and the normal inverse Gaussian model, ie. the Brownian motions driven by stochastic time. In order to obtain the portfolio distribution, ie. the random evolution of particular risky factors, two examples of elliptical copula functions are supposed, the Gaussian copula and the Student copula.","[Tichy, Tomas] Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,,tomas.tichy@vsb.cz,"Tichy, Tomas/AAA-1564-2021","Tichy, Tomas/0000-0002-6503-5330",,,,,20,1,1,0,0,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-523-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,379,388,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BMK17,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272657000043,0

Options theory provides a potent tool to resolve this issue. We propose a model which is consistent with both the Resource- and Contractual-Based Theories of the Firm and which demonstrates that corporate strategy can be perceived as a portfolio of embedded and real options. We further argue that embedded options typically serve as hedging instruments for real options which enhances their value and should be a major consideration when assessing the structure and form of contracts. Special emphasis is granted to human capital and the contractual arrangements through which firms purchase its product. Human capital is the key resource for the processes of real-options discovery and strategy-setting, both of which constitute the essential part of a modem firm's value.","Univ Econ, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Vlachy, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",vlachy@vse.cz,,"Vlachy, Jan/0000-0002-2270-3247",,,,,60,6,6,1,20,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Nowadays, cultural differences between countries and their potentially harmful consequences have received a lot of attention in the FDI literature. This paper will attempt to develop a comprehensive study of the relationship between cultural distance, entry mode choice, and subsidiary performance. Thus enabling a more precise assessment of the impact of cultural differences on foreign entry mode choice and subsequent subsidiary performance.","[Wang Lihua] Guangxi Technol Coll Machinery & Elect, Dept Business Adm, Nanning 530007, Guangxi, Peoples R China",,,hnhuhao@sina.com,,,,,,,6,0,1,3,8,M & D FORUM,ALLAWAH,"17 AUGUSTA STREET, ALLAWAH, NSW 2218, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9806854-1-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,168,172,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BOT96,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277573000030,0

Of course, those people their criticisis have their own grounds. However, the indisputable fact is that innovations in the financial sector in US since the early 1970s has greatly stimulated the rapid growth of US economy and financial industries. In contrast, the weak development of China's financial system, particularly in local level, has led to difficulties for China to deepen its economic reform and development in regions. The corporate governance of China's financial industries have not yet been perfect, there are lacking of incentive mechanisms for financial innovation in China. In order to maintain the stability of financial industries and keep a sustained economic growth in China, the best way is to standardize corporate governance of financial industry and promote innovations among financial sector.","[Wang Zhikai] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Finance, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,,zhikaiw@yahoo.com.cn,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,M D FORUM,ALLAWAH NSW,"17 AUGUSTA ST, ALLAWAH NSW, 2218, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9806854-2-8,,,,2009,,,,,,,1745,1751,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BPO33,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279533000217,0

Ideally, rents and rental values should be taxed just like other consumer goods and services, but doing so would present formidable practical and political difficulties. Under a second-best approach, the value of newly created residential (and other) property is taxed as a proxy for the VAT that should be payable on the flow of housing (building) services. This implies, however, that future increases (and decreases) in the value of the exempt property are left out of the VAT base. To remedy this defect, this paper recommends taxing the increases (refunding the tax related to decreases) realised at the time of sale of the exempt used property. This VAT should replace the current transfer, registration and stamp duties, which are highly distortionary. Beyond that, the VATs in various member states can be improved by limiting the exemption for all used immovable property to housing, by taxing land and by applying the standard rate more widely than is currently the case.","[Cnossen, Sijbren] Univ Pretoria, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Cnossen, Sijbren] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Cnossen, Sijbren] Univ Maastricht, Maastricht, Netherlands",University of Pretoria; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Maastricht University,,cnossen@ese.eur.nl,,,,,,,20,7,7,1,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0143-5671,,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

When interacting homeownership and dissatisfaction, the author finds that dissatisfied homeowners are significantly more likely to vote than both satisfied homeowners and all renters.

Four studies investigated whether consumers prefer to receive risky discounts on a per-purchase or per-item basis. Although these options do not differ with regard to expected value, they entail multiple differences (e.g., savings distribution, amount of individual gains, excitement, and effort involved) that may lead to differential consumer perceptions and experiences. Controlling for expected value of savings, participants preferred per-item over per-purchase discounts. As hypothesized, the main reasons for this preference were a partly incorrect perception of the properties of the savings distribution, the adoption of a narrow mindset focusing on the best outcome in a series of discount gambles, and the greater excitement provided by multiple discount gambles.

The latter type of utility refers to the evaluation of an alternative with the aim of making a decision, while the former refers to the evaluation of a chosen alternative after the choice has been made. We argue that accessibility should preferably be conceptualized and operationalized in terms of experienced-utility, but that this type of utility is difficult to measure. Motivated by these observations we show, taking the Logsurn as a starting point, how its building blocks (parameters estimated from choice patterns) can be used to construct closed-form and easy to compute accessibility-measures that provide an approximation of experienced-utility. We distinguish between decision-making based on utility-maximization and regret-minimization premises. Using a small-scale case-study building on departure time-choice data, we illustrate the working of the developed accessibility-measures and highlight how they differ from the Logsum-approach.

It further investigates the effect of bypass construction on those communities' economic development through changes in the number and spatial distribution of businesses and residential development, and examines whether these changes affect the road-safety level. Finally, it evaluates the effect on road safety of various traffic arrangements implemented in such communities. Drawing on an extensive data collection, the study focuses on Arab cities in the Galilee region of Israel, using cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis. The results show that bypass construction does not necessarily reduce overall crash frequencies or crash rates. It merely shifts road crashes from the highways (the bypass roads) to inner roads (bypassed) and from there to local traffic, with no significant reduction. The findings indicate a large variance in the effects of bypass constructions on safety. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the airports is a small-sized airport that serves a relatively remote region and has direct air services to other regions in Norway but not to the capital city of Oslo or to destinations abroad. The other is a medium-sized airport that serves a relatively accessible region and has direct air services to the capital city of Oslo and to a number of destinations in Norway and abroad. The study compares opinions of residents that live in the respective regions and is based on the findings of a postal survey that was completed by over 2000 residents. The Independent Samples t-test is used to investigate the significance of any differences in opinion. Significant differences were found to reflect the size and scope of services available at the airports and specific characteristics of the regions that they serve. Residents in the more remote region have a significantly higher frequency of travel by air to destinations in Norway but a significantly lower frequency of travel by air to destinations abroad. Trip frequency for holidays is significantly higher in the region that has an airport with direct international air services while trip frequency to access health services is significantly higher in the region that has limited local health services. The airport is significantly more important for resident location and retention in the remoter region. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The Curitiba experience shows that addressing the embedded problem of automobile dependence sometimes requires innovative and strategic responses within the intricate political, policy and urban planning dynamics of a city.

Few studies proposed skill-spillover between the spouses within the marriage as an explanation. This paper deviates from the previous research by exploring different relationship contexts (e.g., cohabitation, being married or divorced, a widow(er) or single) and the role of partner influences under these contexts. It argues that the interaction between gender and relationship status implies variation in not only resources but also constraints, and hence sorts individuals into two different types of self-employment: entrepreneurial self-employment (i.e., incorporated business) and unincorporated self-employment. Using Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) 1965-2005 data, results of the competing risk models show that marital status contributes to both types of self-employment transitions, especially for men, but also for women. Cohabitation is a less supportive context for entrepreneurship and a partner's self-employment experience increases only women's likelihood of entering into entrepreneurship. These results suggest that skill-spillover between partners might be context dependent and only in one direction (from men to women).","[Oezcan, Berkay] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Social Policy, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Oezcan, Berkay] Yale Univ, Dept Sociol, New Haven, CT USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Yale University,"Özcan, B (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Social Policy, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",B.Ozcan@lse.ac.uk,,"Ozcan, Berkay/0000-0003-2255-9406",,,,,61,49,50,2,54,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

In view of limited technical advances and efficiency improvements, along with growing traffic volumes, behavioural changes towards more sustainable travel futures have attained a crucial importance. This paper will discuss initial results from a 2-year project (funded by the British Economic and Social Research Council - ESRC) which aims to develop the notion of sustainability-related 'mobility styles' as a context for applying targeted social marketing policies to specific population segments. Based on ten focus group discussions and a survey of more than 1500 participants in the South West of England, two segmentation approaches are used to identify gaps between different domains of individual travel behaviour and the varying role of attitudes for travel decisions. The results demonstrate the usefulness and limitations of existing segmentation approaches and underline the need for more complex and comprehensive mobility style frameworks as basis for measures aiming at behavioural change towards sustainable mobility.

Predicted output and quality for an NPH differ from those for a for-profit hospital under some conditions but converge under others. Convergence may be the result of a complex internal decision structure with decision control primarily by physicians, similar objectives across different organizational forms, or differing constraints. The mechanisms underlying these outcomes provide explanations for conflicting results in empirical studies of non-profit and for-profit hospitals and provide a different rationale for convergence than non-profit response to competition from for-profit hospitals.

To test the hypotheses, a tentative individual measure of the potential severance payment that a worker would receive in the case of dismissal is included as well as aggregated variables that try to capture differences in labour market institutions and macroeconomic conditions. Evidence for a positive impact of the strictness of employment protection legislation and the potential severance payment on transitions to dependent self-employment is found.

Using a hand-collected sample of job changes between 1998 and 2006. we find that after controlling for deal and bank-level characteristics, hiring a banker from an investment bank with a more prominent industry presence has a positive impact on both equity and M&A market share for the gaining bank and a negative impact on the losing bank's M&A market share. After the banker switches firms, we find a significant amount of business following the banker from the losing bank to the gaining bank, particularly when the relationship is strong between the client firm and the banker. Abnormal returns around the announcement of a banker changing employers are positive and significant for the gaining bank, suggesting that the market views banker additions as value increasing.

Sweeping shifts funds from transactions deposits subject to reserve requirements to non-reservable deposits. This paper extends a conventional banking model to analyze sweeping behavior. Sweeping responds positively to increases in bank loan rates and reserve ratios and negatively to increases in the interest rate on reserves or exogenous increases in bank equity. Sweeping generates greater responsiveness in lending to changes in loan rates or the interest rate on reserves and lower responsiveness to changes in reserve ratios or equity than in its absence. Empirical analysis of an explicit condition that we derive suggests that, with an unchanged reserve requirement, the Fed could eliminate sweeping by setting the interest rate on reserves to no less than approximately 4% points below the market loan rate.

Our results suggest that, on top of a positive relation between entrepreneurial activity in general and subsequent macroeconomic growth, there is an additional positive effect of export-oriented early-stage entrepreneurship in higher-income countries. However, there is no such additional effect in lower-income countries.","[Hessels, Jolanda; van Stel, Andre] EIM Business & Policy Res, NL-2701 AA Zoetermeer, Netherlands; [Hessels, Jolanda] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van Stel, Andre] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; University of Amsterdam,"Hessels, J (通讯作者)，EIM Business & Policy Res, POB 7001, NL-2701 AA Zoetermeer, Netherlands.",joh@eim.nl; ast@eim.nl,,"Hessels, Jolanda/0000-0002-0865-3386; Van Stel, Andre/0000-0003-4512-654X",,,,,74,102,110,2,73,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

A panel regression estimation of eight Asian countries for 1998-2004 confirms the striking persistency of the portfolio weight of US Treasury securities. It also reveals, without a surprise, that the traditionally strong trade link with US as well as exchange rate regime and volatility of local currency bond index explain observed overinvestment in US Treasury securities deviating from what can be warranted by the market share of the US Treasury securities. What is interesting, however, is the estimated regime switches as found when examined with a threshold estimation (Hansen, 1999).

In addition to accounting for approximately 40 per cent on average of total export earnings, coffee production provides a livelihood for a large proportion of the Ethiopian population in the form of jobs for farmers, local traders, transporters and exporters. Volatility in the price of coffee thus influences a large proportion of the population all along the coffee commodity chain within Ethiopia. This study uses the Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity/Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (ARCH)/(GARCH) approach to quantify the volatility in the price of coffee. A distinction is made between producer, wholesale and export prices in order to compare the price risk as faced by the respective participants in the coffee chain. The volatility in coffee prices within Ethiopia is also compared to the volatility levels in Brazilian coffee prices, since Brazil is a major coffee producing country in the world. Coffee prices within Ethiopia were found to be more volatile than in Brazil. Producer prices were found to be the most volatile, followed by wholesale prices and export prices respectively. The high level of volatility in producer prices emphasises the need for efficient price risk management tools that should be available to coffee producers in Ethiopia.","[Jordaan, H.] Univ Free State, Dept Agr Econ, Bloemfontein, South Africa",University of the Free State,"Worako, TK (通讯作者)，Ethiopian Dev Res Inst, POB 2479, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",kwtadesse@yahoo.com; jordaanh@ufs.ac.za; herman.vanschalkwyk@nwu.ac.za,"Jordaan, Henry/AAF-8722-2019","Jordaan, Henry/0000-0003-4845-1727",,,,,21,4,4,1,38,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,SEP,2011,50.0,3,,,,,90,108,,10.1080/03031853.2011.617865,0.0,,,19,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,836LI,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000296112800005,0

However, the more exogenous measure of resource abundance (stock of natural capital) has a significant negative effect on income per capita even after controlling for geography, rule of law and de facto or de jure trade openness.

High loan-to-value (LTV) mortgages secured by expected future home values are one way to take advantage of these capital gains. In this article, we use a simple partial equilibrium consumer theory model to explore the implications of high LTV borrowing. We find that sufficiently large expected house price growth leads to an upward-sloping budget line when households can obtain high LTV mortgages. In this environment, the demand for housing fits neither the conventional theories of consumer goods nor that of investment goods. In fact, increases in the expected future price of housing may reduce current housing demand, whereas decreases in the effective (current) price may lead to households buying smaller homes. Moreover, high LTV loans reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy, but raise the volatility of aggregate demand.

However, most firms are held by multiple small blockholders. This article shows that, while such a structure generates free-rider problems that hinder intervention, the same coordination difficulties strengthen a second governance mechanism: disciplining the manager through trading. Since multiple blockholders cannot coordinate to limit their orders and maximize combined trading profits, they trade competitively, impounding more information into prices. This strengthens the threat of disciplinary trading, inducing higher managerial effort. The optimal blockholder structure depends on the relative effectiveness of manager and blockholder effort, the complementarities in their outputs, information asymmetry, liquidity, monitoring costs, and the manager's contract.

I show that in this case, the threshold of free allocation above which a dominant firm will set the permit price above its marginal abatement costs is below its optimal emissions in a competitive market, and that overall efficiency cannot be achieved by means of permit allocation alone. In addition to being of general economic interest, this issue is relevant in the context of the EU ETS. I find that the largest German, UK and Nordpool power generators received free allowances in excess of the derived threshold. Conditional on having price-setting power in both the electricity and permit markets, these firms would have found it profitable to manipulate the permit price upwards despite being net permit buyers.","Univ Basel, Fac Business & Econ, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland",University of Basel,"Hintermann, B (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, Fac Business & Econ, Peter Merian Weg 6, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",b.hintermann@unibas.ch,,,,,,,43,46,54,1,45,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The incentive effects or distortions of individual job search arising due to the unemployment insurance scheme are crucial for optimal policies, so is the scope for risk diversification that depends critically on whether the balanced budget requirement applies to each state of nature or across states of nature. In the former case a basic budget effect tends to cause optimal benefits to be procyclical. If risk diversification across states of nature is possible, the fact that incentives are more distorted in good than bad states of nature tends to make both benefits and contribution rates countercyclical. It is shown that countercyclical benefits exacerbate employment fluctuations but increase average employment by aligning benefits more with states of nature where the incentive costs are small.","[Andersen, Torben M.] Aarhus Univ, Sch Econ & Management, CEPR, CESifo, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Svarer, Michael] Aarhus Univ, Sch Econ & Management, CAM, IZA, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",Aarhus University; Aarhus University,"Andersen, TM (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Sch Econ & Management, CEPR, CESifo, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",,,,,,,,13,9,10,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-4367,,,J RISK INSUR,J.

We develop a methodology for decomposing the trend in mortgage performance into a part due to economic conditions and a part due to underwriting changes, and provide natural metrics or indices of underwriting quality and economic conditions. The recent mortgage debacle can be attributed about equally to each factor. Important underwriting characteristics were eased in the 1990s, but the negative effects of lower standards were masked by strong local and national economic conditions. After 2002, there was little change in observable loan characteristics, but loan performance still eroded, even after controlling for the economic environment. Our evidence suggests that erosion after 2002 must have arisen from underwriting covariates that are unobservable to investors, consistent with the hypothesis that moral hazard in nonagency securitizations caused underwriting risks to be mispriced.","[Capozza, Dennis R.] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Van Order, Robert] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; George Washington University,,anderson@ufanet.com; capozza@umich.edu; rvo@gwu.edu,"Capozza, Dennis R./AAJ-3789-2020","Capozza, Dennis/0000-0003-0631-3465",,,,,12,14,17,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-2879,,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

We explore the factors behind this lower post-crisis investment. Although weaker post-crisis fundamentals contributed to the decline, the most important factor appears to be balance sheet restructuring in the aftermath of the excessive debt accumulation and excess investment that occurred during the run-up to the crisis.

This is called a tail event in the sense that it is way out the tail of a probability distribution. This article considers the implications of tail events for economic policy and climate change economics. This issue has been analyzed by Martin Weitzman, who has proposed a dismal theorem. The theorem's general point is that under limited conditions concerning the structure of uncertainty and preferences, society has an indefinitely large expected loss from high-consequence, low-probability events and that standard economic analysis does not apply. The present article is intended to put the dismal theorem in context and examine the extent of its relevance with regard to climate change. There are indeed deep uncertainties about virtually every aspect of the natural and social sciences of climate change, and the only way these uncertainties can be resolved is through continued careful consideration and analysis of all data and theories. I conclude that tail events are important phenomena that require careful analysis and attention. At the same time, I find that there is no universal rule for determining when benefit-cost analysis should or should not be applied.

We do not even know the probability distributions for future temperatures and impacts, making benefit-cost analysis based on expected values challenging to say the least. There are good reasons to believe that those probability distributions are fat-tailed, which implies that if social welfare is based on the expectation of a constant relative risk aversion utility function, then we should be willing to sacrifice close to 100 percent of gross domestic product to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I argue that unbounded marginal utility makes little sense and that once we put a bound on marginal utility, this implication of fat tails goes away: Expected marginal utility will be finite even if the distribution for outcomes is fat-tailed. Furthermore, depending on the bound on marginal utility, the index of risk aversion, and the damage function, a thin-tailed distribution can actually yield a higher expected marginal utility (and thus a greater willingness to pay for abatement) than a fat-tailed one.","MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Pindyck, RS (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",rpindyck@mit.edu,,,,,,,21,91,97,0,26,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1750-6816,1750-6824,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

This result is not explained away by differences in observable borrower quality, geographical location of the property, or the cost of capital of high- and low-OTD banks. Instead, our evidence supports the view that the originating banks did not expend resources in screening their borrowers. The effect of OTD lending on poor mortgage quality is stronger for capital-constrained banks.

It is argued that what drives this information search is the hope that the unpleasant state of not knowing ends when one faces the truth (Shani, Igou, & Zeelenberg, 2009; Shani, Tykocinski, & Zeelenberg, 2008; Shani & Zeelenberg, 2007). In this manuscript, we show that bottlenose dolphins as well, sometimes seek to increase their knowledge concerning food allocated to other dolphins in the group, even though such knowledge could not increase self-food availability. This search increases when own feed is augmented, and decreases when sexually engaged (a competing basic need to food and curiosity), suggesting that knowledge for knowledge's sake emerges particularly when the organisms' basic needs (e.g., food) have been satisfied, allowing higher-level psychological needs to emerge. This finding has diverse implications for understanding humans' curiosity and social comparison tendencies, as it appears that even in the animal kingdom information is viewed as a valuable asset of itself.

We extend previous analyses by decomposing the effect of start-ups on total employment change into within- and cross-sector effects. We find that start-ups in a sector influence employment change in the same as well as in other sectors. The results illustrate that the known S-shaped pattern can be attributed to the different effects of start-ups in a sector on employment change in the same sector and in others. Start-ups in a sector have a positive impact on employment change in the same sector. The effects on employment change in other sectors may be negative or positive, and depend on the sector under consideration. In particular, start-ups in high-end services deviate from manufacturing and low-end services in that they have significant negative impacts on employment change in other sectors.

We critically re-assess this argument by first reviewing existing, but also new avenues through which the Merton (1974) model can point to a systematic bias in market beta estimates. However, we also show that some avenues are diversifiable, and that they all rely on excessive economy-wide default risk to create a non-negligible bias. We then use the Merton (1974) model to proxy for the total debt portfolio, but find that its application in empirical tests cannot improve pricing performance.

We consider five categories of shareholders that are specific to our dataset. We find that ownership structure is significant in explaining risk differences but mainly for privately owned banks. A higher equity stake of either individuals/families or banking institutions is associated with a decrease in asset risk and default risk. In addition, institutional investors and non-financial companies impose the riskiest strategies when they hold higher stakes. For publicly held banks, changes in ownership structure do not affect risk taking. Market forces seem to align the risk-taking behavior of publicly held banks, such that ownership structure is no longer a determinant in explaining risk differences. However, higher stakes of banking institutions in publicly held banks are associated with lower credit and default risk. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The positive impact found in services does not necessarily imply that new firms are more efficient than incumbent firms; high degrees of creative destruction may also improve the efficiency of incumbent firms.

Although in terms of customer orientation PPI banks may partly resemble relationship banks, they lack their comparative advantage in generating borrower-specific information. Instead, the characteristic features of PPI banks are low costs and easy scalability. While the latter may enable PPI banks to quickly capture market share, it may also generate overexposure in risky markets. We present a case study on ING Direct, one of the leading global PPI banks and address the sustainability of the PPI business model by comparing the ING Direct foreign operations. The findings for ING Direct are validated using data for E-Trade Bank. We conclude that managing growth appears to be the prime challenge to PPI banks. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

First, the use of trade credit is associated with the nature of the transacted good. In particular, suppliers of differentiated products and services have larger accounts receivable than suppliers of standardized goods and firms buying more services receive cheaper trade credit for longer periods.

We focus our analysis on Asia and Latin America during the period 1997-2008. Using bank-level panel data to identify foreign banks and to estimate measures of banking competition, we are able to provide robust empirical evidence that an increase in foreign bank penetration enhances competition in these host countries' banking sectors. We find that this positive foreign bank penetration and banking competition link is associated with a spillover effect from foreign banks to their domestic counterparts. This spillover effect becomes stronger when more efficient and less risky foreign banks enter into less concentrated host country markets. We also find that the spillover effect is greater when foreign banks enter in the form of 'de novo penetration' than through mergers or acquisitions of domestic banks ('M&A penetration').

Based upon fieldwork in Karnataka, India, this paper argues that whilst traditional forms of control over the labouring class have been eroded, gatekeeping increasingly allows the dominant class to exert a more subtle form of political control, which in turn facilitates processes of accumulation. Rather than equalizing political power and control over public resources, heightened levels of fiscal decentralization to village councils (gram panchayats) have increased levels of gatekeeping, which both provides a significant share of the politically active dominant class's income and forges new patterns of labouring class dependence upon the dominant class. This heightens socioeconomic differentiation and reproduces the latter's political dominance despite the loosening of labour-related ties. In addition, it is argued that although a minority of gatekeepers are from the labouring class, their inclusion facilitates dominant class accumulation rather than their own upward mobility. The paper stratifies gatekeeping in order to locate it amongst the totality of social relations between and within classes, which collectively produce processes of accumulation, differentiation and domination within society. The paper concludes that although the forms taken by extra-economic aspects of capital's control over rural labour have been altered during the erosion of traditional forms of dominance, they remain highly significant and are increasingly so in the fieldwork area in a context of decentralized governance.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Pattenden, J (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",j.pattenden@uea.ac.uk,,,,,,,48,55,59,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The development of agrarian capitalism carries with it increased stratification, which is analysed along five dimensions: earned income, land expansion, use of credit, income from food sales and income from household enterprise. The paper demonstrates increasing differentiation between households, between professional cohorts and within professional cohorts. The data showing stratification within professions suggest that intra-cohort stratification is driving most of the inter-cohort stratification. The Russian model of agrarian capitalism and its processes of stratification have yielded a bifurcated countryside in which a thin stratum of 'super winners' has emerged. Economic processes have developed beyond simple stratification and have created the basis from which a rudimentary class structure appears to be forming.","So Methodist Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Dallas, TX 75275 USA",Southern Methodist University,"Wegren, SK (通讯作者)，So Methodist Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 3300 Univ Blvd,Carr Collins Hall,Room 220, Dallas, TX 75275 USA.",swegren@smu.edu,"Wegren, Stephen/AAU-9859-2020",,,,,,67,3,4,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The results show that the spatially disaggregated measure not only improves the assessment of the impact of foreign bank presence but also resolves unexplained discrepancies found in existing empirical studies contingent on aggregate measures.

We show that the returns of a buy-and-hedge strategy involving taking a long position in convertible bonds (CBs) while hedging the equity risk alone explains a substantial amount of these funds' return dynamics. In addition, we highlight the importance of non-price variables such as extreme market-wide events and the supply of CBs on performance. Out-of-sample tests provide corroborative evidence on our model's predictions. At a more micro level, larger funds appear to be less dependent on directional exposure to CBs and more active in shorting stocks to hedge their exposure than smaller funds. They are also more vulnerable to supply shocks in the CB market. These findings are consistent with economies of scale that large funds enjoy in accessing the stock loan market. However, the friction involved in adjusting the stock of risk capital managed by a large fund can negatively impact performance when the supply of CBs declines. Taken together, our findings are consistent with convertible arbitrageurs collectively being rewarded for playing an intermediation role of funding CB issuers whilst distributing part of the equity risk of CBs to the equity market.

Using panel data for 149 closed or divested foreign bank subsidiaries across 54 countries from 1997 to 2009, we show that the problems encountered by subsidiaries were not the main cause of divestment by parent banks. Based on data for the parent banks of the closed subsidiaries, the results show that these parent banks reported significant financial weaknesses before closing their international operations. Therefore, we conclude that a multinational bank's decision to close or sell a subsidiary in another country is motivated by problems in the home country, with the weak performance of the foreign subsidiary in the host country being a less relevant factor.","[Kowalewski, Oskar] Warsaw Sch Econ SGH, World Econ Res Inst, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland; [Hryckiewicz, Aneta] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, D-6000 Frankfurt, Germany; [Hryckiewicz, Aneta] Kozminski Univ, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics; Goethe University Frankfurt; Kozminski University,"Kowalewski, O (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ SGH, World Econ Res Inst, Al Niepodleglosci 162, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland.",okowale@sgh.waw.pl,"Kowalewski, Oskar/A-6054-2011; Hryckiewicz, Aneta/AAB-1586-2020","Kowalewski, Oskar/0000-0001-5520-3559; Hryckiewicz, Aneta/0000-0002-2546-1829",,,,,31,13,15,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

This study focuses on the effect of large retail store locations in the urban structure on overall CO2 emissions, by using the Oulu region, Finland, as a case study. The aim was to utilize GIS tools to assess store locations in terms of CO2 emissions from private cars used for consumer traffic. In this case, not only are the locations of the existing and planned retail units investigated with respect to population distribution and car ownership, but the analysis is also carried out by regarding any location within the study area as a hypothetical site for a large retail unit. According to the applied method, CO2 values are lowest near the centre of the studied region, the region with the highest population density, although the city centre itself did not turn out to be the most optimal location for a retail store in terms of CO2 emissions. Nevertheless, by generally reducing trip length, a compact urban structure is an important way of achieving long-term cuts in CO2 emissions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Underwriter incentives in co-led syndicates were particularly weak in industries where commercial banks stole substantial market share. Similar patterns do not hold in bust markets where investors are likely to engage in their own information collection efforts. Our results suggest that competition may have an adverse effect on the incentives of financial intermediaries in market environments where their information production is more valuable to investors.

Using euro area aggregate stock market data, I show that judgements based on the EP ratio may be myopic because movements in the EP ratio are often driven by cyclical oscillations in earnings that do not affect the long-run profitability of corporations. I propose an adjustment to the EP ratio that decreases its sensitivity to cyclical fluctuations and I find periods in which such an adjustment is very consequential. For example, before the 2008 financial crisis the unadjusted EP ratio made stock prices look relatively cheap; the adjustment I propose would have taken into account the fact that earnings were inflated by a temporary cyclical boost and would have made them look much less cheap. The model I propose translates the EP ratio into an estimate of the probability that the stock market is under- or over-valued. Simulating its real-time use, I find that the model would have been able to provide early warning signals of some episodes of mis-valuation that were eventually followed by sharp corrections in stock prices.","Bank Italy, Econ Outlook & Monetary Policy Dept, I-00184 Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Taboga, M (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Econ Outlook & Monetary Policy Dept, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",marco.taboga@bancaditalia.it,,,,,,,34,7,9,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

Our innovative approach utilizes both survey data and data from economics-based field experiments, which enables us to elicit and control for the risk attitudes of individual entrepreneurs in the study. Empirical findings suggest that (1) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants, (2) credit cards, and (3) earnings from a salaried job are among the most important sources of funds for entrepreneurs in their decision to start up a firm. Our findings support Evans and Jovanovic (Journal of Political Economy 97(4):808-827, 1989) in that wealth appears to have a positive impact on the probability of starting up a firm, even when controlling for risk attitudes; however, risk attitudes do not appear to have a strong role to play in the entry decision overall. Policy implications suggest that firm start-ups are dependent on access to capital in both initial and early stages of development, and that government funding, including SBIR grants, is an important source of capital for potential and nascent high-technology entrepreneurs.","[Elston, Julie A.] Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Audretsch, David B.] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN USA",Oregon State University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Elston, JA (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",julie.elston@osucascades.edu,,"Audretsch, David/0000-0002-3815-7762",,,,,25,43,65,0,62,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We document a distinctive pattern, previously not found in the literature, in the way stock-related waves form. Corporate waves seem to start with new issue waves (seasoned equity offering preceding initial public offering waves), followed by stock-financed merger waves, followed in turn by repurchase waves. Our results hold over separate decades and across industries. Our results seem consistent with both the neoclassical efficiency hypothesis and the misvaluation hypothesis, and there are distinct periods when one or the other appears dominant.","[Rau, P.

The change cannot be explained simply by shifts in sector-level returns and volatility. A reallocation effect is at play, which we study in the context of mean-variance portfolio theory applied to sectoral returns. We find the reallocation is particularly strong in sectors characterized by young, small and external finance dependent firms, and for states that have a larger share of such sectors. The findings suggest that improving bank access to branching affects the sectoral specialization of output, in a manner that depends on the variance-covariance properties of sectoral returns, rather than on their average only.","[Acharya, Viral V.] NYU Stern, London Business Sch, London, England; [Imbs, Jean] HEC Lausanne, Paris Sch Econ, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Sturgess, Jason] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA",University of London; London Business School; Georgetown University,"Acharya, VV (通讯作者)，NYU Stern, London Business Sch, London, England.",,"Acharya, Viral V./HCH-4349-2022",,,,,,49,23,29,0,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

The findings supplement existing body of knowledge and contribute to the understanding of causes of stress and role of socio-demographic factors in affecting stress level among police personnel.","[Bano, Bushara] Aligarh Muslim Univ, Dept Business Adm, Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh, India",Aligarh Muslim University,,syedabushara@gmail.com,,,,,,,13,13,13,2,6,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8720-9,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,4.0,,,,,,300,303,,,,,,4,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX59,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303217400058,0

Outstanding export success of firms engaged in semiconductor industry as a key manufacturing sector in Singapore necessitates studying export success of these companies from a new strategic and manufacturing view point. From such perspective, investigating factors influencing the export success of companies working in this sector is of a great significance. Using data from 36 semiconductor manufacturing units, this study intends to investigate the contribution of the firm's four competitive priorities to export success of Singaporean semiconductor equipment manufacturing firms. The four competitive priorities namely, quality, low cost, flexibility and delivery were regressed against export success through multiple regression analysis performed by SPSS 17 software using the stepwise method. The findings from this study depicted that among the four competitive priorities quality and low cost have a positive and significant relationship with export success of Singaporean semiconductor manufacturing firms while there is no significant relationship between delivery and flexibility and export success. Moreover, the study findings also illustrated that the most important competitive priority that contributed in predicting export success was quality. This study can be considered as a platform for Singaporean semiconductor manufacturing firms' managers in order to take more advantages of quality and low cost aspects of their productions especially when competing on a global scale and also planning to enter in to new international markets.","[Chavosh, Alireza; Halimi, Anahita Bagherzad; Behyar, Pedram; Bayat, Zahra] Multimedia Univ, Fac Management, Cyberjaya, Malaysia; [Salehi, Mehrdad] Management & Sci Univ, Grad Sch Management, Cyberjaya, Malaysia",Multimedia University; Management Science University,"Chavosh, A (通讯作者)，Multimedia Univ, Fac Management, Cyberjaya, Malaysia.",vidranas@gmail.com; chakameh.1983@gmail.com; ems_salehi64@yahoo.com; pedram_behyar@yahoo.com; bayat_1983@yahoo.com,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,6,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8720-9,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,4.0,,,,,,212,+,,,,,,3,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX59,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303217400041,0

Hence VaR constraint regulations can have a destabilizing effect on the financial system. A VaR constraint on the probability that future firm equity value will be less than a floor is a constraint on the probability-of-ruin when the floor is zero. The marginal price of risk with this constraint is coherent and also additive.

The existing analysis and scenarios creating models, used at the academic and practitioners fields, do not provide a single output that can be interpreted and taken as the final and relevant information output to be used at the decision-making moment, and are nor or cannot be dynamic, turning any tentative to create scenarios based upon them impossible. Their lack of capacity to connect distinctive and still related variables creates great difficulty to decision makers when evaluating multiple business variables and producing action decisions. Current existing business simulation and diagnosis models only consider a reduced number of factors or variables, most only two variables represented by 2x2 matrices, not linking to any of them multiple existing factors and variables related to the business environment, in order to deliver a final and single output, which could be used as the core indication for the decision-making process. That has led to an important question: How can information represented in multiple 2x2 matrices be reduced to a single representation? Or, in other words, can we interconnect two or more 2x2 matrices and create a new matrix that represents all variables in place? The proposed model in this paper is a tentative to provide a solution to that problem, having a unique and unmistakable meaning, eliminating confusion and potential errors at the decision-making moment. The concept has been applied to a software application dealing with multiple variables represented in different 2x2 matrices and reducing all those variables to a single positioning in a final 2x2 matrix.","[Fernandes, Manuel T.] CAAM Corp Acad Adv Management, Samora Correia, Portugal",,"Fernandes, MT (通讯作者)，CAAM Corp Acad Adv Management, Samora Correia, Portugal.",,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,0,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9084-1,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,11.0,,,,,,30,34,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000392766500006,0

Prior evidence suggests that such cross-holdings explain the puzzle of why shareholders allow acquisitions that reduce the value of the bidder. Conducting a shareholder-level analysis of cross-holdings, we instead find that cross-holdings are too small to matter in most acquisitions and that bidders do not bid more aggressively even in the few cases in which cross-holdings are large. We conclude that cross-holdings do not explain value-reducing acquisitions. Beyond acquisitions, we find that institutional cross-holdings between large firms have, in fact, increased rapidly over the last 20 years, but mostly due to indexing and quasi-indexing.

Conjoint Choice Experiment (CCE) was utilized to design the survey and latent class approach to analyze the data. Within the prices and weight constraints provided in the survey, origin is an important factor for all four identified consumer classes. All consumer classes prefer domestic lamb meat, and moreover, domestic highland lamb meat is strongly preferred over domestic plain/lowland meat. The identified consumer classes prefer smaller weight lamb to larger ones. This study also analyzed willingness to pay for the main product attributes for the largest consumer groups. The two largest consumer groups were willing to pay 101 and 276 ALL/kg for domestic plain/lowland meat as opposed to imported meat. This result can be used to producers' advantage if labeling and other marketing tools are available to inform consumers of the products' origin. Therefore, enforcement of origin identification should be a priority for the government and other stakeholders, while producers should consider introducing and promoting their own brands such as producer associations' brands.","[Imami, Drini; Zhllima, Edvin] Agr Univ Tirana, Koder Kamez, Tirana, Albania; [Chan-Halbrendt, Catherine; Zhang, Quanguo] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Management, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Imami, D (通讯作者)，Agr Univ Tirana, Koder Kamez, Tirana, Albania.",dimami@ubt.edu.al; chanhalb@hawaii.edu; quanguoz@hawaii.edu; ezhllima@ubt.edu.al,"; Imami, Drini/Q-6843-2017","Zhllima, Edvin/0000-0002-9054-9878; Imami, Drini/0000-0002-4716-792X",,,,,46,28,29,0,15,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Analysis of the results of a unique village survey reveals that a village's choice of land reallocation type - partial or large in scale - is significantly affected by transaction cost considerations, which vary according to village topography and size, rather than concerns for economic efficiency (tenure security), the latter of which is a proxy for the theory of induced institutional change. More specifically, villages with complex topographies tend to favour partial land reallocation, whereas larger settlements tend to reallocate land more thoroughly.","[Kung, James Kai-Sing; Bai, Ying] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Div Social Sci, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Kung, JKS (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Div Social Sci, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",sojk@ust.hk,,"Kung, James Kai Sing/0000-0001-9733-8638",,,,,37,28,34,0,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Demographic pressure and inequality seem to have little effect in isolation. However, in provinces where population growth is high, greater levels of inequality between religious groups appear to increase the violence risk.","[Ostby, Gudrun; Urdal, Henrik; Strand, Havard] Int Peace Res Inst Oslo PRIO, Ctr Study Civil War, Oslo, Norway; [Tadjoeddin, Mohammad Zulfan] Univ Western Sydney, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia; [Murshed, S.

During the crisis, many economies experienced a brief period of extreme flexibility. A 'fear of floating' gave reduced flexibility when the crisis subsided, but flexibility after the crisis was greater than that seen prior to the crisis. Contrary to the idea of a durable Bretton Woods II arrangement, Asia then went on to slowly raise flexibility and reduce the role for the US dollar. When the period from April 2008 to December 2009 is compared against periods of high inflexibility, from January 1991 to November 1991 and October 1995 to March 1997, the increase in flexibility is economically and statistically significant. This paper proposes a new measure of dollar pegging, the Bretton Woods II Score. We find that Asia has been slowly moving away from a Bretton Woods II arrangement. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This research aim is to create a plan for new development of such associations on the basis of results of localization factors. There coefficient of localization is used for identification of cluster. New method is to use a concentration factor, which is concentration of vineyards in the associations. Results are compared with already operating on associations for the appellation in Austria DAC. They were traced changes in consumer preferences in the Czech wine market. Consumers are placing more emphasis on the selection of wine on its descent from a particular area, growing community and the individual grower. The dynamic development of the wine category, major changes in market and consumer demand are the main causes for the formation of associations of small and medium-sized wineries. This paper specifically introduces new associations for appellation system VOC. This alliance is described in the context of the establishment, operation, development and expansion, respectively the possibility of involvement of additional organizations suppliers and research institutions. Based on the experience of newly emerging VOC system of appellations was setting up a plan of formation association with the proposed methodological approach. Open cooperation between associations VOC appellation and other entities involving suppliers, customers, research institutions and universities has the possibility of creating an institutionalized wine cluster.

It refers to the growing meaning of this concept and its tools (both economic and voluntary). It highlights its shift from macro- to micro-level. On the macro-level exists many models, structures and tools, they can be used to measure and report the progress in sustainable development. On the micro-level are used many voluntary tools, but lots of them are used as advertising statement and shows only positive result. The complex framework of sustainability accounting is still missing. It can be useful tool to measure progress in achieving sustainability. Nowadays exist many initiatives trying to prepare this framework, but at first must be solved the question, what is understand as sustainability business. The next step can be the foundation of the possible relation between economic successful and sustainable company.","[Zborkova, Jitka] Univ W Bohemia, Plzen, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,,prochaz2@kfu.zcu.cz,,"Zborkova, Jitka/0000-0003-2716-1536",,,,,11,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-6-9,,,,2011,,,,,,,1904,1912,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEO28,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000317550001077,0

However, a general equilibrium process of adjustment should occur in response to tax evasion, involving changes in the relative prices of both commodities and factors of production as resources move into and out of the relevant activities, and these changes should tend to reduce any initial benefit from evasion. In this paper we analyze these incidence effects, using a computable general equilibrium model of an economy with a formal (and taxed) sector and an informal (and untaxed) sector, in order to examine how much of the initial benefit of income tax evasion is retained by the evaders and how much is shifted via factor and commodity price changes stemming from mobility. Our simulation results show that the household that successfully evades its income tax liabilities has a post-evasion welfare that is only slightly higher than its post-tax welfare if it had fully complied with taxes. Further while this household keeps some of its initial increase in welfare, a large percentage of this initial gain is competed away as a result of mobility that reflects competition and entry into the informal sector Consequently, the evading household benefits only marginally from successful income tax evasion, and this advantage diminishes with mobility via competition/entry in the informal sector","[Alm, James] Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Sennoga, Edward B.] African Dev Bank, Uganda Field Off, Kampala, Uganda",Tulane University; African Development Bank Group (AfDB),"Alm, J (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",jalm@tulane.edu; e.sennoga@afdb.org,,,,,,,18,11,12,0,7,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

This paper establishes a skewness-comparability condition on probability distributions that is necessary and sufficient for any decision-maker's preferences over the distributions to depend on their means, variances, and third moments only. Under the condition, an Expected Utility maximizer's preferences for a larger mean, a smaller variance, and a larger third moment are shown to parallel, respectively, his preferences for a first-degree stochastic dominant improvement, a mean-preserving contraction, and a downside risk decrease and are characterized in terms of the von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function in exactly the same way. By showing that all Bernoulli distributions are mutually skewness comparable, we further show that in the wide range of economic models where these distributions are used individuals' decisions under risk can be understood as trade-offs between mean, variance, and skewness. Our results on skewness-inducing transformations of random variables can also be applied to analyze the effects of progressive tax reforms on the incentive to make risky investments.

This result varies across agencies as share prices react more strongly to A.M. Best and Standard & Poor's downgrades than to Moody's. We observe a similar asymmetric reaction to rating changes subject to a common rating benchmark.

However, it seems possible that consumers are also concerned about the choices made by other consumers. In fact, it is unclear that people's consumption decisions are made independently of social context. For instance, under the desire to conform to certain social norms-or in the presence of status concerns-some individuals may be willing to pay a higher price premium for green products the more widespread green consumerism is in society. We test this hypothesis using a choice experiment where the respondents were asked to choose among coffee products varying with respect to their share of ecological beans, share of fair trade beans, and price. Three treatments were used, differing only in the information given about the choices made by other consumers. We find different responses to the treatments across individuals and we can only confirm our hypothesis of conformity for women, although men appear to have stronger preferences for ecological coffee than women have.","[Carlsson, Fredrik; Lofgren, Asa] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Garcia, Jorge H.] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Dept Econ, Bogota, Colombia",University of Gothenburg; Pontificia Universidad Javeriana,"Carlsson, F (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Box 640, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",fredrik.carlsson@economics.gu.se; jgarcia-l@javeriana.edu.co; asa.lofgren@economics.gu.se,"Carlsson, Fredrik/E-3734-2010","Carlsson, Fredrik/0000-0003-4789-8009",,,,,51,70,78,1,71,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The addition of emerging markets (EMs) does boost the ratio of country-factor variance relative to industry-factor variance: these markets have a higher variability, but are also less related to global factors. Investigating to what extent this phenomenon can be tracked down to the impact of adding more small firms, we find the following. (1) Small firms do have higher volatility, but only after controlling for country and sector affiliation. (2) Small firms do have weaker sector affinity, as expected. (3) Small firms unexpectedly have weaker local-market sensitivities than large firms. Facts (2) and (3) mean that adding more small firms to the data base has a diversifying effect on both the sector- and country-factor variance; while the impact on sector variance is larger, the net effect turns out to be tiny. (4) Adding emerging markets has a very marked impact on the variance ratio.

Consistent with the literature, our empirical analysis provides evidence that the wage rates of similarly skilled workers differ across net-exporting, net-importing, and nontradable industries. Our results add to the literature by showing that the wage gap usually found across importing and exporting industries vanishes for highly skilled workers (workers with college degree and beyond) when we control for the cross-effect between international trade and education, but the wage gap due to international trade still persists for low-skilled workers. This finding supports the view that education serves as an equalizer and counterbalances the adverse impact from import penetration on wages of highly skilled workers.","[Tebaldi, Edinaldo; Kim, Jongsung] Bryant Univ, Smithfield, RI 02917 USA",Bryant University,"Kim, J (通讯作者)，Bryant Univ, 1150 Douglas Pike, Smithfield, RI 02917 USA.",etebaldi@bryant.edu; jkim@bryant.edu,"Tebaldi, Edinaldo/D-6065-2019","Tebaldi, Edinaldo/0000-0003-3670-3245",,,,,29,5,6,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1363-6669,,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Special attention has been paid to the problems of education and training in the field of tourist facilities and services in Bulgaria and Romania and the need for their improvement. The reasons for this are that education and training are strategic factor for sustainable development trough contribution to human capital development, within the Romania-Bulgaria Cross-Border Cooperation Program 2007-2013. In relation to this the Academy of Economic Studies in Bucharest, Romania and D. Tsenov Academy of Economics in Svishtov, Bulgaria decided to collaborate in the field Cooperation on human resources development - joint development of skills and knowledge, through the development of cross-border liaisons and exchanges between the two universities. Both Bulgaria and Romania have represented and still represent important tourism destinations in Eastern Europe, promoting coastal tourism, spas, mountain resorts or heritage tourism. Comparing with the existent potential and with the other Central and East-European countries, including Bulgaria, Romania has modest economical performances in tourism industry. The last decade shows a relative decline of external demand for Romania, the main causes being the missing fund for investment in developing, modernization, and rehabilitation of specific infrastructure, the less diversification of the entertainment, the tourism services' quality - lesser comparative with competitors. On other hand, in the same period, Bulgaria has improved the tourism services' quality and economic performances. Training specialists in tourism is one of the ways of performance growth in this field. Although there are numerous educational institutions for tourism professionals (high school and vocational school, universities with Bachelor and Masters Degrees, post university and doctoral studies), in both countries the quality of the tourism employees is low and unable to sustain high quality services. Therefore, trans-border cooperation in tourism between Romania and Bulgaria can bring benefits both in better turning to account the touristic potential and the educational systems of the two countries.","[Tigu, Gabriela; Nica, Ana-Maria] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Andreeva, Maria] D Tsenov Acad Econ Svishtov, Svishtov, Bulgaria",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Tsenov Academy of Economics,"Tigu, G (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",,"Nica, Ana-Maria/IUQ-2106-2023; Tigu, Gabriela/AEV-2179-2022","Tigu, Gabriela/0000-0001-6189-8027; Nica, ANA-MARIA/0000-0002-5830-9428",,,,,17,6,6,1,41,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2010,12.0,,,,4,,735,760,,,,,,26,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,699CQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285641900003,0

Hyperbolic discounting induces time-inconsistent behavior and is becoming increasingly popular in economic applications. Most studies that provide evidence in favor of hyperbolic discounting either are merely qualitative or they depend on assumptions about, or parametric fittings of, utility functions. This paper provides a quantitative measure for the degree of deviation from stationarity and the induced time-inconsistency that can overcome the problems mentioned. This measure, the hyperbolic factor, also provides simple preference foundations of the most popular discount functions. Moreover, it can easily be calculated from data and does not require knowledge of utility. Thus, the hyperbolic factor provides an easy tool for theoretical preference foundations, critical empirical tests, and quantitative measurements of hyperbolic discounting.","Erasmus Sch Econ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Rohde, KIM (通讯作者)，Erasmus Sch Econ, H13-27,POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",rohde@ese.eur.nl,"Rohde, Kirsten/C-2823-2018","Rohde, Kirsten/0000-0002-0222-7474",,,,,52,29,31,1,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

But the effect of allowing default on debt levels is ambiguous, not least because lenders may restrict access to credit. Hence the optimal punishment for bankruptcy is unclear. The US states allows householders to keep a variety of assets when filing for bankruptcy - the 'bankruptcy exemptions' - and these exemptions change substantially between states and over time. By exploiting these differences this study shows that raising the exemptions (i) marginally decreases the level of unsecured debt that household's hold; (ii) makes consumption smoother. Thus, despite the effect on debt levels, the generous provisions to debtors in arrears may be helping US households to insure themselves against income risk. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This model, which we refer to as the rapidly decreasing tempered stable (RDTS) GARCH model, takes into account empirical facts that have been observed for stock and index returns, such as volatility clustering, non-zero skewness, and excess kurtosis for the residual distribution. We review the classical tempered stable (CTS) GARCH model, which has similar statistical properties. By considering a proper density transformation between infinitely divisible random variables, we can find the risk-neutral price process, thereby allowing application to option-pricing. We propose algorithms to generate scenarios based on GARCH models with CTS and RDTS innovations. To investigate the performance of these GARCH models, we report parameter estimates for the Dow Jones Industrial Average index and stocks included in this index.

This paper studies empirically the role of uncertainty in currency crises. Uncertainty, which is measured using the dispersion of survey forecasts of key macroeconomic variables, is found to have a non-monotonic effect on exchange rate pressures: it heightens speculative pressures when expected fundamentals are good and eases them when they are bad. This prediction is consistent with a broad class of currency crisis theories, ranging from first-generation to global-game models. The proposed empirical strategy remains valid in the presence of forecasters with strategic objectives and addresses potential endogeneity bias by building a novel set of instrumental variables.

We provide a theoretical link between the well-established notions of probabilistic risk attitudes (i.e., optimism and pessimism) used in economics and the important independent measures for individual behavior used in the psychology literature (i.e., curvature and elevation). One of the parameters in our model measures curvature and represents the diminishing effect of optimism and pessimism when moving away from extreme probabilities 0 and 1. The other parameter measures elevation and represents the relative strength of optimism vs. pessimism. Our empirical analysis indicates that the new weighting function fits elicited probability weights well, and that it can explain differences in the treatment of probabilities for gains compared to that for probabilities of losses.","[Zank, Horst] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Abdellaoui, Mohammed] HEC Paris, GREG HEC, F-78351 Paris, France; [L'Haridon, Olivier] Univ Paris 04, HEC Paris, F-78351 Paris, France; [Zank, Horst] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Dept Appl Econ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",University of Manchester; Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC) Paris; Sorbonne Universite; Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC) Paris; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Zank, H (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",horst.zank@manchester.ac.uk,"L'Haridon, Olivier/GYU-3062-2022","L'Haridon, Olivier/0000-0001-8786-4765; Zank, Horst/0000-0002-7017-7122",,,,,55,42,46,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

We test the hypothesis that gold represents a safe haven against stocks of major emerging and developing countries. A descriptive and econometric analysis for a sample spanning a 30 year period from 1979 to 2009 shows that gold is both a hedge and a safe haven for major European stock markets and the US but not for Australia, Canada, Japan and large emerging markets such as the BRIC countries. We also distinguish between a weak and strong form of the safe haven and argue that gold may act as a stabilizing force for the financial system by reducing losses in the face of extreme negative market shocks. Looking at specific crisis periods, we find that gold was a strong safe haven for most developed markets during the peak of the recent financial crisis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Our results show that the amount given by trustors to trustees has a significant and positive effect on the former's self-declared happiness. To explain why only trustors and not trustees are significantly and positively affected by their giving decision, we argue that the happiness effect results from the trustor's internal satisfaction with his/her exhibition of trust or by a consequence of it, that is, the enactment of the generating (total payoff enhancing) power of the trustor's decision.

They use the results of this estimation to examine the recent monetary history of the United States and to interpret, through this lens, the sources of the rise and fall of the Great Inflation from the late 1960s to the early 1980s and of the Great Moderation of business cycle fluctuations between 1984 and 2007. Their main findings are that, while there is strong evidence of changes in monetary policy during Chairman Paul Volcker's tenure at the Federal Reserve, those changes contributed little to the Great Moderation. Instead, changes in the volatility of structural shocks account for most of it. Also, although the authors find that monetary policy was different under Volcker, they do not find much evidence of a big difference in monetary policy among the tenures of Chairmen Arthur Burns, G. William Miller, and Alan Greenspan. The difference in aggregate outcomes across these periods is attributed to the time-varying volatility of shocks. The history for inflation is more nuanced, as a more vigorous stand against it would have reduced inflation in the 1970s, but not completely eliminated it. In addition, they find that volatile shocks (especially those related to aggregate demand) were important contributors to the Great Inflation.

Overall, the results show that the costs and benefits of boards' monitoring and advising roles could explain bank board structures with caveats. For example, due to the regulatory nature and comparatively intensive scrutiny of bank officers and directors, it is argued that bank managers have less control over the directors' selection processes. Thus, bank board independence should not be the outcome of negotiation with CEOs. Consistent with this view, bank CEOs are found not to affect bank board independence. The trend analysis also provides some important results. In contrast to non-bank evidence, for instance, board size was discovered to decrease over the sample period for large and medium-sized banks, while board size remained relatively stable for small banks. These results are robust with respect to different estimation specifications. Furthermore, the study's findings have important policy implications for bank regulators and investors.

Yet, there is no definitive consensus about how such inland facilities should be labeled, with terms such as dry ports being advocated. It is suggested in the paper that the term inland port is a more appropriate construct since it considers terminal activities as well as the crucial logistics activities taking place in co-location or in proximity of inland terminals. This perspective requires the investigation of how transport and supply chain functions and the various actors involved in their setting and operations are taking shape in inland ports. Case studies pertaining to European and North American inland ports are presented. Although inland ports are planned, set and operated by a wide variety of actors, ranging from public to private interests, transport and supply chain functions tend to label them as satellite terminals, load centers or transmodal centers.

We find that a large U. S. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) position in a destination country in 1990 is associated with a relatively large stock portfolio position in that country in the 2001-2006 period. Moreover, a change in the U.S. FDI position from 1980 to 1990 helps predict the change in the U.S. Foreign Portfolio Investment position from 1994 to 2006. These results are rationalized by Van Nieuwerburgh and Veldkamp's (2009) equilibrium model of learning and portfolio choice under an information processing constraint. FDI establishes marginal differences in the endowments of information about different countries, which later translate into differences in stock portfolio holdings. We control for cross-country differences in capital controls, proximity along different dimensions, corporate governance, and economic and capital market development. Our results also hold for the G6 countries collectively.","[Andrade, Sandro C.] Univ Miami, Sch Business Adm, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA",University of Miami,"Andrade, SC (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Sch Business Adm, POB 248094, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",sca@miami.edu,,,,,,,42,39,48,0,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Both static and dynamic pricing models may be involved. Unbounded problems are characterized by new notions such as (strong) compatibility between prices and risks. Surprisingly, the lack of bounded optimal risk and/or return levels arises for important pricing models (Black and Scholes) and risk measures (VaR, CVaR, absolute deviation, etc.). Bounded problems present a Market Price of Risk and generate a pair of benchmarks. From these benchmarks we introduce APT and CAPM-like analyses, in the sense that the level of correlation between every available security and some economic factors explains the security expected return. The risk level non correlated with these factors has no influence on any return, despite the fact that we are dealing with risk functions beyond the standard deviation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We study the political economy of state usury laws in 19th century America. Exploiting the wide variation in regulation, enforcement, and economic conditions across states and time, we find that usury laws when binding reduce credit and economic activity, especially for smaller firms. We examine the motives of regulation and find that usury laws coincide with other economic and political policies favoring wealthy political incumbents, particularly when they have more voting power. The evidence suggests financial regulation is driven by private interests capturing rents from others rather than public interests protecting the underserved.","[Benmelech, Efraim; Moskowitz, Tobias J.] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Benmelech, Efraim; Moskowitz, Tobias J.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Benmelech, Efraim; Moskowitz, Tobias J.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Benmelech, E (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"van Lent, Laurence/G-5298-2010",,,,,,58,80,95,0,39,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

To avoid that the long memory property of volatility carries over to returns, we consider a filtered FIEGARCH-in-mean (FIEGARCH-M) effect in the return equation. The filtering of the volatility-in-mean component thus allows the co-existence of long memory in volatility and short memory in returns. We present an application to the daily CRSP value-weighted cum-dividend stock index return series from 1926 through 2006 which documents the empirical relevance of our model. The volatility-in-mean effect is significant, and the FIEGARCH-M model outperforms the original FIEGARCH model and alternative GARCH-type specifications according to standard criteria.

The underlying idea is that engagement fosters political awareness and interest and increases the public's monitoring ability. Still, weak fiscal autonomy can undermine voters' interest in and demand for an efficient production of public services. In our contribution, we test whether and how voter involvement in the political sphere is related to government performance - in terms of its efficiency - using a broad panel of German municipalities. Our results suggest that voter involvement indeed has a positive impact on cost efficiency. Crucially, however, this efficiency-enhancing effect of voter involvement is significantly positively affected by local governments' fiscal autonomy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Banks can overcome these asymmetries through relationship lending, or at least mitigate their effects by asking for collateral. Small firms, especially if they are young, have little collateral and short credit histories, and thus may find it difficult to raise funds from banks. In this paper, we show that even in this case, small firms may improve their borrowing capacity by joining Mutual Guarantee Institutions (MGI). Our empirical analysis shows that small firms affiliated to MGIs pay less for credit compared with similar firms. We obtain this result for interest rates charged on loan contracts which are not backed by mutual guarantees. We then argue that our findings are consistent with the view that MGIs are better at screening and monitoring opaque borrowers than banks are. Thus, banks benefit from the willingness of MGIs to post collateral since this implies that firms are better screened and monitored. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

According to the results, the managerial discretion of CEOs has a significant and negative correlation with the firm R&D investment. The number of the independent outside directors in the board has a positive influence on the R&D investment. And as the shares held by a manager increase, the firm R&D intensity will decrease at first, and then increase along an inverted parabolic curve.

Our main result is that a tight monetary policy can have adverse effects beyond the short term and can potentially cause a currency crisis in the medium term, even in cases when the interest rate defense is successful and prevented a currency crisis in the short-run. In addition, we add a risk premium and find that this increases the likelihood of a crisis, can help explain contagion, and that prospective capital controls will increase the likelihood that such controls will be needed as an emergency measure.

Since capacity changes in U.S. refineries occur infrequently, we empirically model the investment process using hazard models. An increase in uncertainty decreases the probability that a refinery might adjust its capacity. The results are robust to various investment thresholds. Our findings lend support to theories that emphasize the role of irreversibility in investment decisions.","[Dunne, Timothy] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Mu, Xiaoyi] Univ Dundee, Ctr Energy Petr & Mineral Law & Policy, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; University of Dundee,"Dunne, T (通讯作者)，Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",tdunne@ou.edu; x.mu@dundee.ac.uk,,"Mu, Xiaoyi/0000-0002-3280-6426",,,,,37,29,31,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1821,1467-6451,,J IND ECON,J.

We show that A8 immigrants who arrived after EU enlargement in 2004 and who have at least one year of residence, and are therefore legally eligible to claim benefits, are 59 per cent less likely than natives to receive state benefits or tax credits and 57 per cent less likely to live in social housing. Furthermore, even if A8 immigrants had the same demographic characteristics as natives, they would still be 13 per cent less likely to receive benefits and 29 per cent less likely to live in social housing. We go on to compare the net fiscal contribution of A8 immigrants with that of individuals born in the UK, and find that in each fiscal year since enlargement in 2004, irrespective of the way that the net fiscal contribution is defined, A8 immigrants made a positive contribution to the public finances despite the fact that the UK has been running a budget deficit over the last few years. This is because they have a higher labour force participation rate, pay proportionately more in indirect taxes and make much less use of benefits and public services.","[Dustmann, Christian; Frattini, Tommaso; Halls, Caroline] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Frattini, Tommaso] Univ Milan, I-20122 Milan, Italy",University of London; University College London; University of Milan,"Dustmann, C (通讯作者)，UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England.",c.dustmann@ucl.ac.uk; t.frattini@ucl.ac.uk; hallscaroline@googlemail.com,,"FRATTINI, TOMMASO/0000-0002-9844-881X",,,,,21,116,126,3,44,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

Underlying this upsurge lie an increase in the probability of workers to lose their jobs and a decrease in the probability that the unemployed find jobs. This paper analyzes the sources responsible for these labor market changes in Japan in the decade of the 1990s. We build, calibrate, and simulate a neo-classical growth model with search frictions in the labor market. Using actual TFP data, the model is able to reproduce the path of unemployment and the job flows, as well as that of output. We find it to be the decrease in productivity, coupled with the reduction in hours worked, which curtails the profits of firms, inducing a drop in employment and an increase in unemployment. J.

However, such methods are also subject to weak instrument problems. We propose identification-robust minimum distance methods for exploiting these additional restrictions and show that they yield considerably smaller confidence intervals for the coefficients of the model compared to their limited-information generalized method of moments counterparts. In contrast to previous studies, we find evidence of partial but not full indexation, and obtain sharper inference on the degree of price stickiness.

We find that, on average, it takes 30-60 minutes for a foreign stock to achieve market efficiency. For a comparable US stock, it takes only 10-15 minutes. The significant difference between foreign and US stocks remains robust when the speed is measured by the number of transactions rather than in calendar time. After relevant firm characteristics are controlled for, the time that it takes for foreign stocks to reach efficiency is significantly negatively related to the quality of their home country institutions. We find that one possible channel through which institutions affect the speed is through their impact on information asymmetry. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Contrary to stage game models (Barrett in J Theor Politics 11: 519-541, 1999, Eur Econ Rev 45: 1835-1850, 2001), in an evolutionary equilibrium (EE) no signatory prefers to be outside the IEA and the EE is robust to trembles. With two populations, there is a unique interior EE when there is decreasing returns to abatement and small asymmetry in the externality differences across populations. At the interior EE, transfers from the poor to the rich can increase payoffs for all nations, but come at the expense of greater payoff inequality. Transfers can also eliminate the basin of attraction for the payoff inferior EE with decreasing returns to abatement and large asymmetry. Thus IEAs, such as the Kyoto Treaty, predicated on the polluter-pays and ability-to-pay principles may result in Pareto inferior outcomes.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"McGinty, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, POB 413, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",mmcginty@uwm.edu,,,,,,,22,17,19,3,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

One of the research objectives was the assessment of the satisfaction degree of requirements relating to protection of human health and environmental protection by SMEs from Romania, including those in trade, in terms of an integrated approach to sustainable development values within the European Excellence Model as defined by the European Foundation for Quality Management - EFQM). As a consequence of the study it appears that there is a correlation between the degree of meeting these requirements and mature quality management system of enterprises. Thus, it was found that for SMEs in trade, whose interests in implementing a quality management system is in its early stages, the degree of satisfaction of the requirements of society, from the perspective of an integrated approach to sustainable development values in the EFQM Excellence Model, is relatively low. On the other hand, research carried out showed that data obtained by SMEs in trade in the process of evaluating and monitoring the impact on the environment are used mainly to establish corrective actions, following the complaints occurred, and less to define continuous improvement programs to meet these requirements.","[Olaru, Marieta; Dinu, Vasile; Sandru, Diana; Dinca, Violeta] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Stoleriu, Ghiorghita] Tecnoserv Bucuresti SA, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Olaru, M (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",molaru@gmail.com,"Olaru, Marieta/AAL-1550-2020; Dinu, Vasile/L-5051-2017; Olaru, Marieta/A-2032-2017",,,,,,35,81,81,0,29,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2010,12.0,27,,,,,10,26,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,558MP,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274747700001,0

By admitting that both the effects of globalization and the consequences of accession to WTO have led to new limitations, which made the states give up some of their powers and authority, environmental accounting seems to be a good modality to manage their affairs and financial interests, taking into account the protection and preservation of the environment [11].

In the attempt of intensifying the sense of responsibility of corporate representatives and of restoring investors' trust in the companies' financial statements there has to be a strict responsibility delegation between executive management, legal advisors, accountants, auditors of public companies regarding internal control of financial statements, as well as the public reporting of week points in the internal control of financial reporting existing until the date of valuation. The motivation of implementing a suitable internal control of the financial statements comes from the possibility of achieving numerous investment benefits due to effort done by the company's representatives in avoiding frauds and in following an increase in periodical financial reports credibility. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (Section 404) states demands to corporative representatives from companies regarding monitoring and consolidating their own internal control of financial reporting. In order to achieve a maximum benefit, the company's stakeholders have to be informed about these and about the implications of implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, so that they can understand and valuate the responsibilities of public companies.

In view of this, we have analyzed the dynamic variation of the effective irrigated area, the water-saving irrigated area as well as the ratio between them from 1996 to 2005. The results showed that: in Shandong Province, the effective irrigated area slightly increased while the water-saving irrigated area grew more, about 93.141 thousand hectares every year.

This research has the potential to explain so-called market anomalies and inform welfare and policy debates about asset markets. We begin with examples of demand shocks that generate mispricings, arguing that they can stem from behavioral or from institutional considerations. We next survey, and nest within a simple model, the following costs faced by arbitrageurs: (a) risk, both fundamental and nonfundamental; (b) short-selling costs; (c) leverage and margin constraints; and (d) constraints on equity capital.

The paper argues that exchange rate policy and institutional factors are the main determinants of real exchange rate, and their impacts on real exchange rate have been salient when we observe the change in nominal exchange rate. The real undervaluation of RMB was directly impacted by China's cheap labor and natural resources. Nominal exchange rate will be better indicator of real exchange rate and long-term equilibrium level. In identifying the long-run impact of non-monetary factors behind real exchange rate determination, macroeconomic and structural policies will be made to enhance China's social and economic development, and satisfy the need for internal and external balance.","[Li, Huifen] Shanxi Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Finance, Taiyuan, Peoples R China",Shanxi University Finance & Economics,,lihuifenhaoyu@sina.com,,,,,,,10,2,2,0,4,UNIVERSE ACADEMIC PRESS TORONTO,TORONTO,"1 SPADINA CRESCENT, ROOM 205, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 3G3, CANADA",,,978-1-926642-07-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,103,106,,,,,,4,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BUS85,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290245000022,0

We employ a large data set of rated, multi-country MFIs spanning 11 years, and perform panel data estimations with instruments. We find that the average loan size has not increased in the industry as a whole, nor is there a tendency toward more individual loans or a higher proportion of lending to urban costumers.

This work is oriented to the application of X-ray technique for image and study of internal structure of various types of tissues. The important problem of application the X-ray methods in biology is low absorption of the biological tissues poorly by X-rays. The different parts of biological objects absorb X-rays on the similar level so that it is very difficult to achieve a decent contrast on the resulting image. Equipment development in this area offers new opportunities of detection. For research of the internal structure of biological objects we used X-ray equipment that was built at our university. Source of X-ray radiation is X-ray lamp PXS5-927 with micro-focus. For detection we were used CCD chip, a macro lens and scintillator.

The article which is theoretically rooted in institutional economics paying the attention to the state and its role in economy deals with the essence of concessions. It outlines their characteristics, namely: the subject of concession is always public (municipal) property; one of the parties of the concession agreement is the state. On the grounds of the analysis of world experience the classification of all existing types of concession agreements is given, as well as the types which in accordance with the Federal law Concerning concession agreements exist in the Russian Federation in agricultural sector and other sectors of the national economy. The article mentions that the concession is an effective mechanism for financing of capital-intensive projects that stimulate the reduction of the financial burden on budgets of all levels and creation of additional jobs. Special attention is given to the analysis of the reasons that hamper the development of concessions in Russia in general and in the agricultural sector. The main reasons are: a lack of comprehensive, systematic approach to the development of the mechanism of the operation and management of concessions, insufficient protection of concessioner's rights, as well as a lack of methodological support in the sphere of preparation of specialists in concessions. The article emphasizes that the economic potential of concessions in Russia is high. The priority directions for the application of concessions are primarily the objects of production and transport infrastructure in the agricultural sector of the national economy, but for further promotion of concessions it is necessary to develop a number of by-laws in the sphere of regulation of the relationship between the concedent and the concessionaire.","North Caucasus State Tech Univ, Stavropol 355029, Russia",North Caucasus Federal University,"Selevanova, E (通讯作者)，North Caucasus State Tech Univ, Kulakov Ave 2-2, Stavropol 355029, Russia.",Elena.Selevanova@daad-alumni.de,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,1,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2123-6,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2010,,,,,,,241,247,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA6AE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000337077600027,0

How to reduce the discharge of CO2 and how to make use of it for energy development has been being concerned by more and more people. CO2 has been utilized for oilfield development and has been becoming one of the most important ways for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). This paper used HTHP (high temperature and high pressure) microscopic observation apparatus to observe the microscopic phase state of CO2 at the reservoir temperature and the microscopic oil displacement state under different pressures. The studies provide the following results: Even though the reservoir temperature is higher than the critical temperature of CO2, state of CO2 is also between gas and liquid under the condition of high pressure, and closer to the latter. At the reservoir temperature, CO2 approaches laminar flow of piston like displacement under the low pressure immiscible state. With the increase of displacement pressure, CO2 flows as the form of hydraulic flow. When it goes miscible phase, CO2 intensifies its turbulence and contacts with crude oil sufficiently; simultaneously, CO2 is closer to liquid state under the condition of high pressure and easier to dissolve in crude oil and can reach miscible phase. Thus, this paper from the view of microcosmic explained that CO2 and crude oil can come to miscible phase easily with the enhancement of pressure.","[Zhang Shuo] China Univ Petr, Inst Petr & Gas Engn, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China",China University of Petroleum,,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,ST PLUM-BLOSSOM PRESS PTY LTD,HAWTHORN EAST,"STE 4, LEVEL 3, 695 BURKE RD, HAWTHORN EAST, VC 3123, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-646-54471-7,,,,2010,,,,,,,66,+,,,,,,3,Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BDJ45,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000313542100012,0

From a different point of view, the Fiscal Theory of the Price Level takes into account monetary and fiscal policy interactions and assumes that fiscal policy may determine the price level, even if monetary authorities pursue an inflation targeting strategy. In this paper we try to test empirically whether the time path of the government budget in EMU countries would have affected price level determination.

Given the in-sample period of 1980:01-2000:04, the large-scale BVARs, estimated under alternative hyperparameter values specifying the priors, are used to forecast real house price growth rates over a 24-quarter out-of-sample horizon of 2001:01-2006:04.

Each involves different ways of managing R&D and linking internal to external research. Disciplinary absorptive capacity requires a firm to actively engage with the scientific community, while protecting domain-specific knowledge. Domain-specific absorptive capacity depends upon influencing disciplinary research at universities and consortia, then capturing domain knowledge through collaboration and hiring. As technology develops, it becomes encoded, and absorption depends increasingly upon integrating knowledge from suppliers. Hence, absorptive capacity is a multifaceted construct that is heavily shaped by the type and maturity of technology absorbed.","Melbourne Business Sch, Melbourne, Vic 3053, Australia",,"Lim, K (通讯作者)，Melbourne Business Sch, 200 Leicester St, Melbourne, Vic 3053, Australia.",k@kwanghui.com,,,,,,,47,66,76,1,47,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Mean willingness to pay (WTP) values were computed with both, a parametric and non-parametric approach. Parametric WTP estimation indicates that respondents in the sample are willing to pay about 40.51 (sic) per household to avoid a similar future oil spill in Spain. This implies that on average, the Spanish society places a value of the environmental losses caused by the Prestige oil spill around 574 (sic) million.

We use the methodology of dynamic factor analysis for large datasets to investigate possible empirical linkages between forecastable variation in excess bond returns and macroeconomic fundamentals. We find that real and inflation factors have important forecasting power for future excess returns on U.S. government bonds, above and beyond the predictive power contained in forward rates and yield spreads. This behavior is ruled out by commonly employed affine term structure models where the forecastability of bond returns and bond yields is completely summarized by the cross-section of yields or forward rates. An important implication of these findings is that the cyclical behavior of estimated risk premia in both returns and long-term yields depends importantly on whether the information in macroeconomic factors is included in forecasts of excess bond returns. Without the macro factors, risk premia appear virtually acyclical, whereas with the estimated factors risk premia have a marked countercyclical component, consistent with theories that imply investors must be compensated for risks associated with macroeconomic activity.","[Ludvigson, Sydney C.] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Ludvigson, Sydney C.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ng, Serena] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",New York University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Columbia University,"Ludvigson, SC (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Econ, 19 W 4th St,6th Floor, New York, NY 10012 USA.",sydney.ludvigson@nyu.edu,"Ng, Serena/AAA-1003-2020","Ng, Serena/0000-0003-2684-364X",,,,,44,430,490,6,89,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Furthermore, our results indicate that the latter two factors have a persistent impact. This contributes in explaining why price perceptions have not normalized for several years in some countries. The results suggest that policy measures in countries which are going to introduce the euro should address these issues in order to prevent a similar development as experienced in many euro area countries.

Results from a dynamic version of the sales accelerator model show that the dependence of investment spending on internal funds does not significantly differ among firms attached to savings banks, cooperative banks or commercial banks. Thus, the importance of the public banking sector in Germany may not explain the rather low dependence of German firms on internal funds, and public ownership of banks does not seem to be important for reducing financing constraints.

Using the latest panel data, the paper finds that growth in transition economies has been higher because of the recovery of lost output, progress in market reforms, and favorable external conditions. These results are consistent with estimates from the global sample that includes 123 countries, and are robust to instrumental variable estimations and other robustness tests. A general implication of the findings is that some of the factors behind the rapid growth are unlikely to continue for a very long time and that the challenge would be to further improve the investment climate, which will require broadening the scope of macroeconomic reform into a second generation of reforms encompassing structural and institutional areas.

Although fast transport such as air shipment is an option for exporting firms to smooth volatile demand in foreign markets, market volatility may systematically trigger the firms to undertake FDI.

Conversely, they are overconfident in placing themselves in easy tasks but underconfident in hard tasks. These findings can be explained by a regression hypothesis that implies random errors in estimation as well as by rational Bayesian updating (that implies no random error). We test these hypotheses in five experiments. We find overconfidence in estimation involving hard tasks but underconfidence in easy tasks. However, for placement (involving both easy and hard tasks) we find no overconfidence, regression effects due to low and high anchor points, and extreme underconfidence when people choose between multiple alternatives. On the other hand, when given precise information about absolute performance, people's re-assessments of relative performance are consistent with the Bayesian model. Since placement judgments are important in many competitive settings, our results emphasize the need for more research to identify their determinants. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This study used a multiple visit cost-route method to estimate labour inputs and financial profitability of agroforestry-based and conventional (with and without fertiliser) soil fertility management practices in eastern Zambia. Results show that aggregated over a five-year cycle, labour inputs used under agroforestry practices were lower than fertilised maize fields but higher than non-fertilised continuous cropped maize. Agroforestry practices were more profitable (NPV ranging between $233 and $327 ha(-1)) than unfertilised maize fields (NPV of $130 ha(-1)) but less profitable than fertilised maizefields. The NPV for the latter is $499 ha(-1) under a 50% government subsidy on fertiliser but, it fell to $349 ha(-1) when the subsidy effect is removed. In terms of return per unit investment cost, agroforestry practices performed better with a benefit to cost ratio ranging between 2.77 to 3.13 in contrast to 2.65 (subsidised fertiliser) and 1.77 (non-subsidised fertiliser). The returns to labour per person day was $2.56 in (non-subsidised) fertilised maize field, $3.16 in subsidised fertiliser field, $2.63 in Gliricidia fields, $2.41 in Sesbania fields, $1.90 in Tephrosia fields, and $1.10 in non-fertilised maizefields. The results do not support the popular notion that agroforestry practices are more labour intensive. It suggests that in addition to total labour use requirements, the temporal distribution of labour use during the farming season is important. It is concluded that agroforestry practices are profitable, and could contribute to food security.","[Ajayi, O. C.; Akinnifesi, F.

The program allocated $6.6 billion to developers in 2006, and over 1.6 million units have been subsidized under the program since its inception in 1987. A historical literature suggests place-based housing subsidies, such as the LIHTC program, will be more expensive in providing the same level of housing support to the poor than tenant-based strategies (i.e., housing vouchers). This paper uses an administrative data series of LIHTC subsidized properties in California to show the program encourages developers to construct housing units that are an estimated 20% more expensive per square foot than average industry estimates. It is additionally shown that due to liquidity constraints faced by LIHTC primary developers in how the subsidy is allocated, virtually all developers sell the tax credits at a substantial discount below their statutory value immediately after construction. This price is estimated to be $0.73 per $1 of tax credit, or $1.8 billion annually, as compared to alternatively allocating a lump sum grant to developers. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Time is often wasted due to informal school closures, teacher absenteeism, delays, early departures, and poor use of classroom time. Since the 1970s, attempts have been made in several countries to measure the use of instructional time in schools and its impact on student achievement. Studies have been of variable quality and have used different definitions and methods. However, they have consistently shown that significant amounts of time are lost and that the amount of time spent engaged in learning tasks is related to student performance. The large losses in many countries raise issues of governance, monitoring, and validity of economic analyses. It is important to take instructional time wastage into account when considering public sector expenditures on education, teacher salary rates, unit costs, and the rates of return from graduates.

We find multiple shifts in the mean, with inflation in the region increasing throughout the eighties and decreasing in the nineties, thus documenting that the rise and fall of inflation in Latin America occurred a decade later than in industrial countries. Regarding the persistence, we find that it is high but that it decreases when the shifts in the mean are taken into account, as in developed countries, while it appears to have decreased recently in more than half of the countries in our sample.

Since empirical evidence manifests a substantial failure of such policies, we construct a simple model to indicate the crucial aspects of this failure. To this end we consider a tax-evading firm, allocating work in the official and underground sector, where it is not taxed. With a view to reducing underground employment, the government may decide to launch an amnesty for past social security noncompliance, while providing fiscal incentives for new hiring in order to encourage a process of worker regularization. Allowing for endogenous enforcement, we find that the reputation of policy-makers in combating tax evasion proves crucial in determining the success of such a policy.","[Chiarini, Bruno; Marzano, Elisabetta] Univ Napoli Parthenope, Naples, Italy; [Di Domizio, Marco] Univ Teramo, Teramo, Italy",Parthenope University Naples; University of Teramo,"Marzano, E (通讯作者)，Univ Parthenope, Dipartimento Studi Econ, Via Medina 40, I-80133 Naples, Italy.",elisabetta.marzano@uniparthenope.it,"DI DOMIZIO, Marco/ABB-6920-2020; MARZANO, ELISABETTA/ABG-5797-2022","DI DOMIZIO, Marco/0000-0002-9995-7990;",,,,,15,8,8,0,6,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN STREET, MALDEN, MA 02148-529 USA",0954-1985,,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

The study uses a microeconomic approach, the unit cost ratio (UCR) method of competitiveness analysis, to assess changes in the relative competitiveness of EG milk producers from 1983 - 2006. Findings of previous research indicate that dairy market deregulation in the 1980s and 1990s caused lower real milk producer prices, increased uncertainty and higher exit rates in the South African dairy industry. Results of the UCR analysis suggest that EG milk producers were not competitive based on the net local price received for milk but were competitive when dairy cattle trading income was included. This suggests that dairy cattle trading income played an important role in enhancing the profitability of EG dairy enterprises in the study period. Further UCR analysis revealed that the top one-third of EG milk producers were relatively competitive from 1983 - 2006 due to higher real milk prices and lower unit costs. A panel data study of individual EG milk producers could be used to identify other important factors affecting milk producer competitiveness over time.","[du Toit, J. P.; Ortmann, G.

The paper is the result of a careful analysis of the literature and of a field research.

The analyses of questionnaires and dedicated literature lead us to the design of a competitiveness model for hospitality industry, called Hospetitiveness The empirical model of competitiveness in the Romanian hospitality industry. The model has three levels: the first level (the base) is represented by decisive factors of competitiveness: human resources, innovation, services and costs, which influence all hotels' operations. The second level consists in the inclusion of competitiveness factors' attributes in the organization's processes and operations, in order to reach the objectives and obtain competitive advantage. This is the level where all the competitiveness factors are transposed in objective measures, in order to make them easily understood by the employees. The third level illustrates the dimensions of competitiveness as results of the impact of the decisive factors on the organization's internal processes and operations. These dimensions are: customer satisfaction, market position and internal and external social responsibility. The model is dynamic, being the starting point for specific models in hotel management (e.g. business or seaside hotels' management), and also the base for a best practices guide that translates competitiveness factors into key competitive advantage.","[Emilian, Radu; Tuclea, Claudia Elena; Tala, Madalina Lavinia; Brindusoiu, Catalina Nicoleta] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Emilian, R (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",radu.emilian@gmail.com; claudiaelenatuclea@yahoo.com; madalina_tala@yahoo.com; catalina_brindusoiu@yahoo.com,"Claro, Jose Alberto/N-4055-2019; Tala, Madalina Lavinia/R-8481-2017; Tuclea, Claudia/R-7491-2019; Carvalho dos Santos Claro, Jose Alberto/H-6147-2012","Tala, Madalina Lavinia/0000-0003-0096-4195; Carvalho dos Santos Claro, Jose Alberto/0000-0003-1319-2382",,,,,17,3,3,1,10,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2009,11.0,26,,,,,462,472,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,462KQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267351800025,0

Following Lewis et al. [Lewis, M., Rogalski. R., Seward, J., 2003. Industry conditions, growth opportunities and market reactions to convertible debt financing decisions. journal of Banking and Finance 27, 153-181], we employ a single measure that simultaneously considers all of these features: the expected probability (measured at issue date) that the convertible will be converted to equity at maturity. We find that firms in countries with stronger shareholder rights issue convertible debt with a higher expected probability of converting to equity. The positive association between the expected probability of conversion and shareholder rights is less pronounced in firms for which ownership structures create potentially high managerial agency costs. Specifically, in Countries with stronger shareholder rights, firms with higher separation of control rights and cash flow rights tend to issue convertibles with lower probability of conversion. Furthermore, we find that large non-management block ownership strengthens the likelihood of issuing convertible debt with higher probability of conversion in countries with stronger shareholder rights. In contrast, firms in countries with stronger creditor rights issue convertibles with lower probability of conversion. We also document that the negative association between creditor rights and probability of conversion is more pronounced in firms with higher separation of control rights and cash flow rights.

We first conduct the standard unit root and cointegration tests with aggregate data. Nationwide analysis potentially suffers from problems of the low power of stationarity tests and the ignorance of dependence among regional house markets. Therefore, we also employ panel data stationarity tests which are robust to cross-sectional dependence. Contrary to previous panel studies of the U.S. housing market, we consider several, not just one, fundamental factors. Our results confirm that panel data unit root tests have greater power as compared with univariate tests. However, the overall conclusions are the same for both methodologies. The house price does not align with the fundamentals in sub-samples prior to 1996 and from 1997 to 2006. It appears that the real estate prices take long swings from their fundamental value and it can take decades before they revert to it.

On this slightly atypical market the quality of tourism products and services tends to become an element of competitive differentiation. Constantly practicing high standard quality services allows obtaining certain notoriety both for the tourism services providers and for the promoted destination. Continuous monitoring and improvement of tourism products quality must base on the correspondence relation between the satisfaction, perception and tourists' expectancies. Nowadays tourist wants to be offered multiple choices, to discover the tourism offer suitable to satisfy the most diverse preferences. He is not willing to make any concession regarding the quality of the tourist products he is being offered. His discontents are linked, mainly, to poor performance of the staff training activity, to lack of equipment and facilities compared to the ones present in other states of the European Union and to the infrastructure's precarious state. In order to emphasize the way of perceiving the tourism products quality among tourists who had visited Bukovina, during December the 20(th) 2008 and January the 20(th) 2009, we developed a socio-statistic research on a sample of 151 tourists accommodated in the lodge units within Suceava county. The study results emphasized that because of the global economic crisis, the tourism products quality is more frequently perceived as a differentiation element between tourism agencies, and Romanian tourists stress more then ever this detail.

It reports results from an attribute-based stated preference study in which members of couples are asked to conduct a choice-experiment first individually and then jointly. The choice context was the selection of which beach to visit while on vacation in Tobago. Available alternatives differed in attributes related to coastal water and beach quality such as level of coastal development and fish abundance. Tests of preference equality are reported and structured so as to identify the intra-couple decision-making patterns under taste heterogeneity with both finite and continuous mixed logit. Results from the latter suggest that women's preferences are found to be predominant in the joint choice-experiment. Results suggest caution in using individual choice rather than joint couple choice when valuing quality changes impacting on couple activities, such as water and beach quality in Tobago, and call for further research on the topic.","[Beharry-Borg, Nesha] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Hensher, David A.] Univ Sydney, Fac Econ & Business, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Scarpa, Riccardo] Univ Waikato, Waikato Management Sch, Dept Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand",University of Leeds; University of Sydney; University of Waikato,"Beharry-Borg, N (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",n.c.beharry-borg@leeds.ac.uk; davidh@itls.usyd.edu.au; rscarpa@waikato.ac.nz,"Scarpa, Riccardo/AAF-8435-2019","Scarpa, Riccardo/0000-0001-6449-5389; Hensher, David/0000-0003-0058-2242",,,,,26,36,40,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

On the other hand, the impact of different modes of transportation on the frequency and duration of contact has not been explored. Using the 1994 Portland Household Activity and Travel Behavior Survey, this paper investigates the potential relationship between automobility and the expected participation in and duration of a variety of in-home and out-of-home social activities. The analysis makes use of descriptive and inferential statistics to illustrate a broad variation in the effect of car use on duration of activity, both in terms of polarity and magnitude. Furthermore, multivariate regression analysis reveals that reliance on the automobile acts by enabling longer durations in less mobile and more time-constrained segments of the population. Conversely it acts by decreasing durations in more mobile and less time-constrained subgroups. The paper ends by discussing directions for future research into the potential social implications of automobility. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Indeed, Friday announcements have a 15% lower immediate response and a 70% higher delayed response. A portfolio investing in differential Friday drift earns substantial abnormal returns. In addition, trading volume is 8% lower around Friday announcements.

We argue that the benefit of leasing is that repossession of a leased asset is easier than foreclosure on the collateral of a secured loan, which implies that leasing has higher debt capacity than secured lending. However, leasing involves agency costs due to the separation of ownership and control. More financially constrained firms value the additional debt capacity more and hence lease more of their capital than less constrained firms. We provide empirical evidence consistent with this prediction. Our theory is consistent with the explanation of leasing by practitioners, namely that leasing preserves capital, which the academic literature considers a fallacy.","[Rampini, Adriano A.] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27705 USA; [Eisfeldt, Andrea L.] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Duke University; Northwestern University,"Rampini, AA (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, 1 Towerview Dr, Durham, NC 27705 USA.",rampini@duke.edu,,,,,,,70,146,183,3,73,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

It is shown that monetary expansion causes output first to decline, to eventually rise above its original level. However, if interest earnings on foreign securities dominate the trade balance in the expression for the exchange rate, monetary expansion leads to an appreciation of the exchange rate, while having an expansionary output effect. Money is neutral in the long run if either the wealth effect or foreign interest payments are abstracted from; if both are abstracted from, it is neutral also in the short run. Short and long-run neutrality results also if wealth consists only of foreign securities. The above responses hold both for net creditors and - with a minor qualification - debtors.

We analyze changes in cash demand for 13 advanced economies from 1988 to 2003 by separating cash into three denomination categories to disentangle its store of wealth and payment functions. Defining denominations commonly dispensed by automated teller machines (ATMs) as the medium category, we show that demand for small-denomination currency decreases with greater debit card usage and with greater retail market consolidation. In contrast, the demand for high-denomination notes decreases when interest rates rise but is generally unaffected by changes in debit card usage.","[Amromin, Gene; Chakravorti, Sujit] Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Econ Res Dept, Chicago, IL USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago,"Amromin, G (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Econ Res Dept, Chicago, IL USA.",gamromin@frbchi.org; sujit.chakravorti@chi.frb.org,"Amromin, Gene/B-7425-2011",,,,,,43,41,45,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

The positive effect obtains because the opportunistic objectives of one country's policy makers are kept in check at the union level by other members with disparate objectives. We calibrate the model to evaluate the proposed monetary union in the East African Community. The empirical results show that the mutual restraint on monetary policy is an important determinant of the expected benefit from an EAC monetary union. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
