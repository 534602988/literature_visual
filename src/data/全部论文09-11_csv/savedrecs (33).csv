The study investigates whether the permanent income hypothesis holds true in the ten Asian countries; and whether liquidity constraints affect consumer spending. Our empirical analyses of panel data consist of the following four steps. First, we test for a panel unit root. Second, we test for cointegration among panel data employing the panel cointegration test; and a Fisher-type test using an underlying Johansen methodology. Third, the long-run equilibrium relationship is estimated using the fully modified ordinary least squares technique for heterogeneous cointegrated panels. Finally, once the panel cointegration is established, we establish a panel-type error correction model to further test whether the permanent income hypothesis/life cycle hypothesis is valid. The empirical results show that consumption and current income are strongly cointegrated, liquidity constraints exist in all ten Asian countries, and this implies that the permanent income hypothesis is not upheld. In addition, the effect of the 1997 Asian financial crisis on the size of liquidity constraints is investigated, and the results show that liquidity constraints increased after the Asian financial crisis. The likely explanation of this is that households were not able to smooth their consumption relative to their permanent income through short-term borrowing, as liquidity is tighter and borrowing constraints are stronger. Therefore the financial crisis resulted in consumption levels that are more sensitive to current income levels, and this provides further support against the case for the permanent income hypothesis/life cycle hypothesis, in these countries.",,,,wkminn@ocu.edu.tw,"Wang, Kuan Min/H-5247-2019","Wang, Kuan Min/0000-0002-0237-0596",,,,,36,1,1,0,8,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The price discovery model can effectively solve the contradiction between supply and demand in the situation that logistical facilities are greatly influenced by natural disasters. So it can help us from a new perspective to discuss and solve some decision-making problems about the price recovery and reconstruction of fresh agri-product markets. Sichuan Province as an example explains how the price discovery model is achieved. The result shows that even in the situation that infrastructures are severely effected by natural disasters, the price discovery model can help to find abnormal prices of fresh agriculture products after natural crisis and deal with the consequent conflicts, thereby helping the government to regulate and make decisions.","[Wei, Lai; Liu, Xiaolin] Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Chengdu 611134, Peoples R China; [Chen, Hong] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econom, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China",Sichuan Agricultural University; University of Electronic Science & Technology of China,"Wei, L (通讯作者)，Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Chengdu 611134, Peoples R China.",wlfuture1969@hotmail.com,"zhang, lin/IZQ-4870-2023",,Fund of Sichuan Center for Rural Development Research [CR1027]; Fund for National Natural Science Foundation of China [70773017],Fund of Sichuan Center for Rural Development Research; Fund for National Natural Science Foundation of China,The research was sponsored by the Fund of Sichuan Center for Rural Development Research (CR1027) and the Fund for National Natural Science Foundation of China (70773017).,,10,0,0,0,7,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1865-0929,,978-3-642-23022-6,COMM COM INF SC,,,2011,208.0,,1.0,,,,359,+,,,,,,2,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BXA64,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000295545200055,0

A relatively new field in this context is the international entrepreneurship research stream. The investigation of Born Globals - companies that operate in international markets from the earliest days of their establishment (see Knight and Cavusgil, 1996) is one of its main topics. Standardization has been crucial for the development of industrial society and standards have been important issues for international technology systems, business practice and economics (see Blind, 2004, Suarez, 2004, Shapiro and Varian, 1999). The underlying research stream is about 30 years old (see Egyedi and Blind, 2008) but there has been hardly any linkage to the Born Global research stream so far. The paper shows how Born Globals can successfully establish their technologies and/or products as international de facto standards. Model development is done in ten steps. Based on the completion of the 22 case studies (1) success factors are identified and coded in the case study documents (2). Four success factors groups related to the company, demand, competition and other issues are created (3) and the stages of the standardization process are modeled (4). Common success factors were identified and assigned to the phases of standard setting (5). Afterwards, three classifications of young standard establishers were developed (6). They reveal specific success factor constellations (7). Based on the constellations of the success factors and the frequency of their occurrence, a category 'dynamics of standardization' with specific dimensions is identified (8). Its dimensions are assigned to the process phases of standardization by an extension of the assignment of success factors to standardization stages (9). Finally, a dynamic model for setting and maintaining standards with the multi-dimensional core category 'dynamics of standardization' is developed (10). The model enriches the few theoretical frameworks of the Born Global research which are available so far, as well as first approaches that consider dynamic aspects in standards research (e. g. Egyedi and Blind, 2008).","[Wurster, Simone; Blind, Knut] Tech Univ Berlin, Chair Innovat Econ, Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin,,simone.wurster@tu-berlin.de; knut.blind@tu-berlin.de,,,,,,,50,3,3,0,5,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,861,873,,,,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800104,0

We extend the concept of real authority by observing that not only does the principal have to be informed to give an order but also the worker must be willing to follow the order. We show that workers are given more authority when they are costly to replace or do not mind looking for another job, even if they have no better information than the principal. The allocation of authority thus depends on external market conditions as well as the information and agency problems emphasized in the literature.

We show that a medium-intensity financing constraint can play a positive role in mitigating the preemptive competition and improving firm value in equilibrium. This positive effect is in sharp contrast with the conventional negative effects of the financing constraint. The positive effect is strong, especially for IT venture businesses because of the following characteristics: severe preemptive competition, a lack of internal funds, high uncertainty regarding future project value, and high bankruptcy costs.","[Nishihara, Michi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Osaka 5600043, Japan; [Shibata, Takashi] Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Grad Sch Social Sci, Hachioji, Tokyo 1920397, Japan",Osaka University; Tokyo Metropolitan University,"Nishihara, M (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyama Cho, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",nishihara@econ.osaka-u.ac.jp; tshibata@tmu.ac.jp,"Shibata, Takashi/N-3122-2019; Shibata, Takashi/J-6330-2014","Shibata, Takashi/0000-0001-9724-6469; Shibata, Takashi/0000-0001-9724-6469; Nishihara, Michi/0000-0003-2673-1250",,,,,34,20,20,0,25,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1058-6407,,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

This paper addresses the possible relevance of recent findings in experimental economics and neuroeconomics to the philosophical controversy over altruism and egoism. After briefly sketching and contextualizing the controversy, we survey and discuss the results of various studies on behaviourally altruistic helping and punishing behaviour, which provide stimulating clues for the debate over psychological altruism. On closer analysis, these studies prove less relevant than originally expected because the data obtained admit competing interpretations such as people seeking fairness versus people seeking revenge. However, this mitigated conclusion does not preclude the possibility of more fruitful research in the area in the future.

However, both of these views tend to naturalize and universalize scarcity, and thus overlook abundance and sufficiency, which are important states in the social provisioning process. It is argued that this is due to ignorance of the sociocultural causal underpinnings of scarcity, abundance, and sufficiency (SAS).

Since with regard to certain anticompetitive conduct, the law remains substantially incomplete up to the first relevant court judgment, in terms of policy it is worth concentrating on stand-alone claimants who, not relying on earlier judgments, face very high evidentiary requirements, while generating large positive (information) externalities for potential follow-on claimants. The paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we introduce the notion of incompleteness of the laws and address the process of production of evidence in antitrust lawsuits. Sect. 3 provides a survey of EU national case law and our summary of the results puts emphasis on incomplete laws, evidentiary requirements and stand-alone lawsuits. Sect. 4 presents a framework model to distinguish the decision-making processes for stand-alone and follow-on claimants in the presence of incomplete antitrust laws. In Sect. 5 we introduce a vector autoregressive model that we test with reference to the US antitrust law enforcement regime.

However, performing the cooperative R&D and formation of spin-off companies has become an alternative route for technology transfer. With plenty of options by which public research institutes (PRI) can employ technology transfer, one should determine first the appropriate channel for the transfer in order to establish the appropriate strategy. This paper builds a theoretical framework to match the mode of technology transfer with two key conditions: (1) absorptive capacity of recipient firms and (2) dependence on complementary assets. The theoretical discussion elucidates that the combination of lower level of absorptive capacity and less dependence on complementary assets favor the creation of new firms as a mode of technology transfer; the opposite combination favors cooperative research and development (R&D), and the in-between case supports licensing as an appropriate mode of transfer. Based on the theoretical framework, we analyzed the case of chemical industry in Korea utilizing the concept of patent portfolio analysis.","Specialty Construct Ctr 39570, Sci & Technol Policy Inst, Seoul 156714, South Korea","Science & Technology Policy Institute (STEPI), Republic of Korea","Lee, YJ (通讯作者)，Specialty Construct Ctr 39570, Sci & Technol Policy Inst, 20th Fl, Seoul 156714, South Korea.",caelee@stepi.re.kr,,,,,,,32,10,11,0,35,KOREAN SOC INNOVATION MANAGEMENT & ECON-KOSIME,DONGJAK-GU,"26TH FL SPECIALTY CONSTRUCTION CTR SHINDAEBANG-DONG, 395-70, DONGJAK-GU, SEOUL 156-714, SOUTH KOREA",1976-1597,,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

In a poor economy, schooling is costly for parents, and education is likely to be unequally distributed among siblings. Drawing on discrete ordered choice models, we present a simple method to estimate the between and within components of both the explained and unexplained variance in education. For our empirical analysis, we use the Living Standard Measurement Study survey conducted in 2002 in Albania. We explain about 40% of the total variance and find that inequalities in education are mainly due to differences between families.

Thus, suggesting that the current German and Austrian accounting law reforms are crucial in order to increase the reporting quality in the future. The analysis of correlation in particular shows statistically significant positive correlations between the reporting on the independence of the supervisory board and the firm performance index (Price-Earnings-Ratio, Tobin's Q) in both countries. Taken together, the determined correlations of all variables in question are to be classified as rather insignificant and their effects are quite inhomogeneous.

More recent travel surveys are thus increasingly collecting non-metric information through categorical variables such as opinions, which is difficult to exploit with the most widely used analytical tools. The present paper assesses the potential of a nonparametric analysis technique little used in transport research, namely correspondence analysis, in order to define a set of different customer profiles regarding stated mode choices. Data coming from an attitudinal travel survey administered to a representative sample of the population of the city of Novara (Italy) are used to this effect. The resulting clusters are quite informative and policy relevant, mainly because they are based on a variety of metric and nominal variables which would be less easy to consider when using more standard multivariate techniques such as cluster analysis, and also because not all the observation need to be forcedly classified. A simple modal choice modeling exercise illustrates how the derived market segments can provide guidance to improve the results of a standard quantitative analysis, while keeping a low computational complexity. Our study shows the usefulness of the proposed methodology in a transport policy decision-making context. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, a literature in economic development posits that diversity may negatively affect school performance by undermining the efficient provision of education. This article empirically tests this claim, which we call the public goods channel, by examining the relationship between racial diversity and student performance in Ohio's school districts. We find that moving from a completely homogenous school district to one in which two racial groups have equal population shares is associated with a 7-17.5 percentage point decline in the passage rate on the state math exam, holding per pupil spending across districts constant.

We build a simple repeated model of a researcher capable of obtaining innovative ideas. Although they reduce the time spent on research, we show that commercialization incentives also affect the choice of research projects. Commercial rewards induce a more intensive search for (ex post) path-breaking innovations, which are more likely to be generated through (ex ante) riskier research programs. We derive the organization's optimal incentive scheme in terms of the researcher's characteristics. We show that organizations should use a high level of commercial incentives for scientists who have strong or weak intrinsic preferences for research. For those with strong preferences, the organization needs to induce development, whereas for those with weak ones, it needs to induce effort.","[Banal-Estanol, Albert] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Banal-Estanol, Albert] City Univ London, London, England; [Macho-Stadler, Ines] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ & Hist Econ, CODE, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Macho-Stadler, Ines] Fac CCEE, BGSE, Barcelona 08193, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; City University London; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Barcelona School of Economics,"Banal-Estañol, A (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, C Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain.",albert.banalestanol@upf.edu; ines.macho@uab.es,"Macho-Stadler, Ines/C-7092-2008; Banal-Estanol, Albert/D-7578-2013","Macho-Stadler, Ines/0000-0002-2415-7972; Banal-Estanol, Albert/0000-0002-4797-8677",,,,,41,11,12,2,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Consumers make their purchase decisions based on the signal (perception) of quality they experience, where the signal is influenced by both the true product quality valued by the consumer and the affect of the consumer at the time of the signal formation. In this situation, a firm finds it optimal to invest in both product quality and in variables inducing affect, even though rational consumers, in equilibrium, correctly solve back for the true product quality. We uncover an asymmetry in the effects of the cost of producing quality and the cost of inducing affect. As a firm's cost of quality decreases, the firm will find it optimal to invest more both in the true quality and in the affect inducement, even if it does not have a lower cost of inducing affect. Conversely, if a firm finds it easier to induce affect, then the product quality decreases but affect-inducing activities increase. Under competition, we find that the firm investing more in quality also invests more in affect creation. An implication of this is that in a competitive environment, consumers can rationally associate an up-lifting store atmosphere, affect inducing merchandizing, or mood-creating communication with high quality products even when the firm has no need to signal their private cost of quality information, and when there is no consumption externality of the affect. We also analyze the case in which firms might have different costs and consumers are uncertain about the costs incurred by a given firm. Here again we show that the perceived quality production is positively correlated with both the true quality and the affect inducing activities.","[Iyer, Ganesh] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kuksov, Dmitri] Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Washington University (WUSTL),"Iyer, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",giyer@haas.berkeley.edu; kuksov@wustl.edu,,,,,,,26,22,29,3,23,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1058-6407,,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Principally, Easterbrook focused on the things that antitrust could not do well. When antitrust's reach exceeds its grasp, it creates type I and type II errors. But Easterbrook points out that, in antitrust matters, type II errors are largely self-correcting. Letting price-fixers go free may be a mistake, but cartels are prisoner's dilemmas, so the mistake is corrected in the market. Letting monopolizers continue to raise prices may be an error, but new-firm entry will solve that problem as well. Easterbrook provides a taxonomy of the sources of antitrust errors, including the difficulty that antitrust defendants have in explaining procompetitive rationales and the difficulty that judges and juries have in understanding the theory and empirics involved in antitrust cases.","[McChesney, Fred S.] Northwestern Univ, Sch Law, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [McChesney, Fred S.] Kellogg Sch Management, Dept Management, Evanston, IL USA",Northwestern University; Northwestern University,"McChesney, FS (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Sch Law, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",f-mcchesney@law.northwestern.edu,,,,,,,21,17,17,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

As most economies face downturn as well as does the international trade, credit insurance is used intensively, mainly the state supported part. It may be an instrument of support of bank credit activities financing the international trade and therefore an obvious impulse that turns the entrepreneurs onto increase of their business activities. Long-term process of unification of forms, methods and instruments used in export credit insurance is observed, as well as in other insurance fields. Nevertheless, this is not a single insurance market as we can see in other insurance businesses. This could be only possible in case the insurance is provided on commercial basis with commercial reinsurance. State budget fulfils the role of reinsurance in state supported insurance. Therefore it is difficult to talk single insurance market based on the right to set the branches or provide services. Another way of harmonization is observed. It is unification of rules for state support in order to support competitiveness of individual OECD exporters but still keep the discipline in export support. Thus the rules for financing and insurance of export credits and investments were dealt within OECD. The rules include the ways of description of territorial risks of individual countries, setting the insurance rates, terms of supported export credits or level of insurance cover. These rules were implemented into EU legal system and member states legal systems. Following these rules could bring the benefit of weaker protectionism which is more observed in these days of hard economic situation.","[Bohm, Arnost; Tumova, Kristyna] Tech Univ Liberci, Ekon Fak, Katedra Pojistovnictvi, Liberci, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Böhm, A (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberci, Ekon Fak, Katedra Pojistovnictvi, Liberci, Czech Republic.",arnost.bohm@tul.cz; kristyna.tumova@tul.cz,,,,,,,12,1,1,0,12,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

I analyse how two types of temporal structures influence market behaviour and operation using comparative ethnographic data on stock exchanges in Fiji, Ghana and Iceland. Internal dynamics of markets organize time in manners that influence the nature of market competition and, consequently, the types of skills necessary to demonstrate competence. External relations position markets in relation to other social settings, connecting temporal orders between particular markets and these other settings as well as situating markets as the sites of the creation of legitimate information.","Macalester Coll, Dept Sociol, St Paul, MN 55105 USA",Macalester College,"Larson, EW (通讯作者)，Macalester Coll, Dept Sociol, 1600 Grand Ave, St Paul, MN 55105 USA.",larsone@macalester.edu,,,,,,,58,1,1,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

One, the so-called oSAS modelo, regards knowledge bases of firms and distinguishes between Synthetic, Analytical and Symbolic knowledge. The second, the oWorlds of Productiono construct, classifies firms according to differences in technologies and markets and outlines four possible action frameworks within which companies operate and innovate. Combining these conceptualizations seems to enrich analyses within both perspectives and provide a useful framework for studies on knowledge dynamics in different economic contexts. Empirical evidence regarding knowledge dynamics of two oalternative foodo producers is presented, indicating that symbolic knowledge which in current literature is mainly delimited and described within cultural industries, may also be relevant for other industries such as the alternative food sub-sector.","[Testa, Stefania] Univ Genoa, I-16100 Genoa, Italy; [Manniche, Jesper] Ctr Reg & Tourism Res, Nexo, Denmark",University of Genoa,"Testa, S (通讯作者)，Univ Genoa, Viale Causa 13, I-16100 Genoa, Italy.",stefania.testa@unige.it,"testa, stefania/ISU-1321-2023; Pineda, Diana/K-6241-2012","testa, stefania/0000-0002-4067-8110;",,,,,48,25,26,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

The identification of shocks is based on the Cointegrated VAR methodology. The categorization and interpretation of shocks are based on synthesis of theoretical studies on international business cycles and international policy coordination. We show that the Cointegrated VAR model is a valid choice and that it demonstrates good fit with the data-generating processes of the time series examined. We find that country-specific US permanent shocks transmit to Europe and Japan and when positive, have a locomotive effect. The USA is not affected by the country-specific permanent shocks of Europe or Japan. The permanent shocks originating in Europe or Japan do not have a significant effect on the opposite country's growth rates.

The current paper is focused at describing the impact of both current and newly proposed waste deposition fee rates on the set of enterprise economic performance indicators. The first part of the paper provides a description of history as well as the current situation in the field of waste deposition fees in the country. The second part of the paper shortly describes the applied methodology of data collection and analysis. Such indicators as a) share of waste deposition fee in total revenues of an enterprise; b) share of waste deposition fee in consumption from operation; c) share of waste deposition fee in value added were calculated. The analysis consisted of the two consequent steps. The first was focused at quantifying the share of fees in selected economic indicators of enterprises in the year 2006. The second step consisted in quantification of the potential impact of the fee rates newly proposed by the Ministry of the Environment on economic agents in 2010 given an assumption that neither productivity nor economic performance of the companies would change. The final part of the paper presents the general conclusions about the stimulative potential of current and updated fees used as economic tools of environmental policy.,,,,ritschelova@rek.ujep.cz; sidorov@rek.ujep.cz; farsky.unl@seznam.cz,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,4,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

However, the current situation both at home and abroad is that many owners of intellectual property rights try their best to switch technologies to standards, thus, the relationship between standards and IPR have become much closer than ever before. At the same time, the participants of agreement on standardization will engage in collaborative cooperation, and form a monopoly under the veil of standardization. That will become more dangerous and critical if the identified standards for antitrust of enterprises' agreement on standardization aren't clear enough. Therefore, it is imperative to have clearly identified standards. This thesis discusses the identifying indicators for antitrust exemption of enterprises' agreement on standardization, which will be done by analyzing the competitive situation and the cost of production in the market.","[Wang Shuping; Ji Rentian] China Jiliang Univ, Sch Law, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",China Jiliang University,,wangshupinglawyer@163.com; jirentian@163.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,2,AMERICAN SCHOLARS PRESS,MARIETTA,"3238 HARVEST WAY, MARIETTA, GA 30062 USA",,,978-0-9845209-1-6,,,,2010,,,,,,,195,200,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTV50,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288188100039,0

Then, using a sample of 569 Chinese manufacturing enterprises to test these hypotheses, evidence consistent with previous studies has been found that there is a significant corresponding correlation between the export intensity and the performance of a firm. It is also found that the difference in influences of different FDI modes on the performance of firms is found not significant. Finally, it is found that for each entry mode, return on assets (ROA) of firms has all partially improved, but there is no significant difference in the influence of international modes on the performance of firms.","[Zeng, S.

One important question relates to the nature of the relationship between the formal and informal sector. This article uses Porter's five forces model to interrogate the linkages between informal fruit and vegetable traders in the Natalspruit Market (Ekurhuleni) and their formal suppliers, primarily the Johannesburg Fresh Produce Market. While the threat of new products is low, the street traders' position is weakened by the threat of new entrants, consumer bargaining power and lack of cooperation among street traders. In relation to supplier power, we conclude that while this varies according to a number of factors, the formal sector is dominant over informal fruit and vegetable sellers in this market. This finding rests primarily on the observation that, because of their fragmentation, the informal traders' collective buying power is not being used in the same way as large formal retailers of fruit and vegetables to obtain better terms of trade with the formal economy supplier.","[Ngiba, Cyril Nhlanhla; Dickinson, David; Whittaker, Louise] Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Business Sch, ZA-2050 Wits, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Ngiba, CN (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Business Sch, ZA-2050 Wits, South Africa.",,"Whittaker, Louise/AAW-1642-2021","Whittaker, Louise/0000-0002-3478-446X",,,,,17,7,9,0,7,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"RM EMS 4-51, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The project evaluation results show consistent reductions in car driver trips with an average reduction of 11%. The mode of travel that experiences the most substantial increase is walking with modest increases reported for cycling and public transport. Results have not been disaggregated according to the type of participation that individuals have had in projects; therefore, it is not possible to identify how project design influences Outcomes. Despite the consistency of outcomes reported and many aspects of good practice in project evaluations, there are some concerns about evaluation methodology, notably that the estimation of Outcomes might be systematically biased. The main concerns relate to independence of evaluators, sample sizes and survey response biases. A priority in future project evaluations is to use independent evaluators and to collect aggregate-level travel data with which to corroborate survey-based results and enable monitoring of outcomes over longer time-scales. Another priority is to increase the understanding of how design elements of PTP projects influence behavioural outcomes and to develop appropriate research methods to investigate this. Improved evaluations will better enable the value for money of PTP to be assessed relative to other investment options. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

While criticisms of the trend abound, the wisdom of crowds argument creates a presumption that the profession's acceptance of increasing mathematical sophistication is a net improvement. I provide a contrasting market failure argument for the excessive mathematization of economics. Academic research is not a cash-based economy, and this limits economists' ability to contract for assistance with technical research. Consequently, production of mathematical and statistical research must use the firm-the department-instead of the market. This alters the composition of the faculty and ultimately the economics curriculum, and the resulting level of sophistication may be greater than optimal.","Univ Texas Pan Amer, Dept Econ & Finance, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley,"Sutter, D (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Pan Amer, Dept Econ & Finance, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA.",dssutter@utpa.edu,,,,,,,27,6,6,0,3,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Results indicated that reading is not very predominant compared to other leisure activities. In terms of preference for the published project, it was discovered that people from the MZG prefer to read magazines and newspapers instead of books, and that the price of the latter is a determining factor in their acquisition.

Firms inducing harm must hold a license issued by a regulatory agency on a case-by-case basis. A firm may also be subject to liability. This paper studies the implications on social welfare of combining licensing with strict liability. Contributions include the study of a joint use and related administrative costs. The latter include costs pertaining to litigation and the issuing and enforcing of licenses. It is established when a joint use is motivated. Regulatory compliance should protect from liability in order to decrease litigation and enforcement costs and associated distortions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

During this period, the air transport in China has also been undergoing significant transformation and rapid growth following the reform and opening up policy of China since 1978, the same year when the USA enacted the Airline Deregulation Act. Although China has become the world's second largest air transport system since 2006, few studies have analyzed the growth pattern and policy evolution of this important market. This paper critically reviews the development of the air transport policy of China and examines the challenges in the 21st Century. Such an investigation leads to the following conclusions: (A) the reform of China's civil aviation has been based on the national policy in socialist market economy as well as the liberalisation of air transport; (B) the substantial growth in the last three decades has been driven by economic growth as well as the transformation of China's transport industry. (C) In order to sustain the rapid and continuous development in civil aviation, China should continue to implement scientific management and development, deepen the reform and opening up and continue liberalisation.

The strategy assumes an adult worker model family and aims to promote better, as well as more, jobs and to ensure that policies should further both flexibility in the labour market and security for workers. The article explores, first, the meaning of internal and external flexibility, and of employment-based security and the different implications for men and women. While the policy documents assume that flexicurity will increase gender equality, the mechanisms have not been specified. In fact, as the article shows, women are often more 'flexible' workers than men, particularly regarding their contractual arrangements and hours of employment. However, they tend not to be economically autonomous and, we argue, the supply-side policies advocated on the security side of the flexicurity matrix are insufficient to improve their position, which is strongly related to the gendered divisions of paid and unpaid work.","[Lewis, Jane] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Social Policy, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Plomien, Ania] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Gender Inst, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Lewis, J (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Social Policy, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",J.Lewis@lse.ac.uk,,"Plomien, Ania/0000-0001-5883-2297",Economic and Social Research Council [RES-225-25-2001] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,94,31,35,0,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

This practice may generate efficiencies through synergies and information sharing, but may also be abused to reduce the number of competitors or-even worse-to facilitate or enforce collusion among them; therefore, it is often regulated. In this paper, we first present results from a survey on the regulation of joint bidding in European public procurement, documenting how the existence and the type of regulation differ across countries, and that-where present-regulation is often related to the ability of an individual firm to be admitted as a solo bidder. Borrowing from the theories of joint bidding in auctions and of horizontal mergers and joint ventures in oligopoly, we then review the basic economics of bidding consortia and the effects that these can have in terms of bidding competition, coordination among firms, risk management, exploitation of other synergies, and entry. Finally, we assess the relative degrees of restrictiveness of several practical criteria that could be used to create consistent regulatory requirements for bidding consortia in public procurement. The only strong conclusion that we can draw is that there is an urgent need for further theoretical and empirical or experimental research on this very important issue for public procurement.","[Spagnolo, Giancarlo] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, SITE, Rome, Italy; [Spagnolo, Giancarlo] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, CEPR, Rome, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata; University of Rome Tor Vergata,,gianluigi.albano@tesoro.it; giancarlo.spagnolo@uniroma2.it; matteo.zanza@gmail.com,"Albano, Gian Luigi/O-7102-2019","SPAGNOLO, GIANCARLO/0000-0003-4117-6283",,,,,23,12,15,1,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

However, it is surprisingly difficult to demonstrate this relation empirically, as areas with greater numbers of crimes tend to hire more police. In order to resolve this simultaneity, we begin by exploring the structure of the financial relationship existing between state and local governments, arguing that variations in state tax rates can serve as an instrumental variable for local police numbers. Two-stage least square (2SLS) result show that the elasticity of police presence with respect to crime is about -1.1 for violent crime, and -0.9 for property crime. These results are mostly significant, and are more negative than those obtained under OLS. Overall, our estimations suggest that police does reduce crime. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

This analysis differs from previous related studies not only in its adoption of more current migration and other data but also in other ways. First, unlike most earlier related studies, it includes a separate measure of the overall cost of living; second, it examines per pupil (rather than per capita) outlays on public primary and secondary education; and third, in addition to property taxes, it also focuses on per capita state income tax burdens. Inclusion of the last of these variables in the analysis is based on studies that have found the existence of a state income tax to have influenced migration patterns and other studies that have found higher state income tax levels to have resulted in reduced per capita income growth over time. Moreover, including both property tax burdens and income tax burdens broadens the scope of the hypothesis. Strong empirical support for the Tiebout-Tullock hypothesis (as interpreted here) is obtained for the study period.","Armstrong Atlantic State Univ, Savannah, GA 31419 USA",University System of Georgia; Armstrong Atlantic State University,"Cebula, RJ (通讯作者)，Armstrong Atlantic State Univ, Savannah, GA 31419 USA.",,"Cebula, Richard J/P-7535-2018",,,,,,34,11,16,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

This triad has provided the starting point for most subsequent discussion. Our purpose is to introduce a further type of coordination, the destructive mode of coordination. This mode achieves coordination by intimidation, threat, and the use of non-institutionalized coercive means. Resources and human efforts are allocated in order to appropriate what other people produce. Two simple examples provide an introductory illustration: traffic circles (roundabouts) and prisons. Appropriation through pirating provides a further example of destructive coordination. More specifically, biopiracy (blood patenting) is discussed in order to clarify the relationship between destructive coordination and the institutionalization of property rights. Finally, we focus on the role of destructive coordination as a transitional mechanism that is supported by the institutional vacuum, ultimately yielding to other modes of coordination.",,,,mehrdad.vahabi@wanadoo.fr,,,,,,,82,17,17,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

By calling for endogenously determined judicial errors, this paper not only traces the effect of a firing litigation on employment, but also explores the possible effects of labor market conditions on judicial mistakes. We show that worse labor market conditions (a larger dismissal pay) will induce judges to be more favorable toward fired workers (firms). Thus, a higher level of unemployment (a larger dismissal pay) will decrease (increase) the possibility of a type-1 error and increase (decrease) the possibility of a type-2 error. It is also shown that, while a policy that lowers a type-1 error will increase the employment level, a lower type-2 error, somewhat surprisingly, will not necessarily have a positive effect on employment. Besides, in departing from the findings of previous analyses, we find that dismissal pay can either increase or decrease the employment level, with this crucially depending on the probability of juridical mistakes.

In addition, the cointegration is found among the four variables (trade balance, domestic income, foreign incomes and real exchange rate) in the case of Argentina and Peru.

North and South America have experienced cases which not only suffer from a scarcity of financial resources, but also institutional limitations. The redevelopment of certain old contaminated areas can be attractive, because it might become a potentially lucrative area for redevelopment projects that can also bring interesting job and research opportunities. The paper presents a recapitulation of studies concerning the application of the decision and stakeholder theories for the solution of environmental problems, focusing mainly on brownfield issues. We also analyzed the decision making processes in the management of contaminated land in the Czech Republic. Brownfield management still lacks legislation in the Czech context; however the treatment of ecological burdens of the past has been regulated within the process of privatization at the beginning of the 1990's. The last part of the work focuses mainly on the remedial decision making for ecological burdens of the past in the Czech Republic. The main objective of this work has been to gather ideas from the local and international context, and to adapt them to the actual decision making processes of the management of historical contamination in the Czech Republic. We concluded that the tools provided by the stakeholder theory and the laws governing decision making, which are intended for setting remedial goals, are a key factor for the potential success of brownfield management. At the end of the work there is a suggested solution diagram for the decision making process in the management of historical contamination in the Czech Republic that integrates the main ideas gathered after our recapitulation of studies.","Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Mechatron Informat & Interdisciplinary Studie, Inst Novel Technol & Appl Informat NTI, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Aguilar, SC (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Mechatron Informat & Interdisciplinary Studie, Inst Novel Technol & Appl Informat NTI, Studentska 2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic.",silvia.cihakova@yahoo.com,,,,,,,23,14,14,0,10,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The results show that Romanian stakeholders are oriented towards the philanthropic and legal dimensions of CSR. They highlight the internal CSR dimension with emphasis on avoiding environmental damages, creating an environmental responsibility among employees and compliance with the regulations in force in all circumstances. The stakeholders' role in developing CSR is rather informative and educative than operational, their contribution to stimulating CSR is generally perceived as being low or even inexistent.

In the post-war era, the number of firms grew rapidly and peaked in 1953 at 200, and then declined sharply for the first 20 years. As a consequence, only four firms survived, and the industry evolved to be an oligopoly. To address what factors caused the shakeout of firms, we examine the determinants of firm survival, with a focus on the role of product strategies. We provide evidence that early and experienced entrants tend to survive longer than late and inexperienced ones. In addition, it is found that firms located in clusters are more likely to survive than others. Our findings also indicate that offering high-quality products and broadening product-lines have significantly positive effects on survival. Moreover, we found that the probability of failure first falls and then rises with increasing degrees of product-line overlap with rivals.","[Kato, Masatoshi] Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Tokyo 1868603, Japan",Hitotsubashi University,,masatoshi.kato@gmail.com,,,,,,,45,0,0,0,1,CHINA WATERPOWER PRESS-CWPP,BEIJING,"6 SANLIHELU, FUXINGMENWAI, BEIJING, 100044, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5084-6533-3,,,,2009,,,,,,,78,87,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BNO72,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275143800010,0

They belong to interest groups, are interested in generally beneficial issues, are not directly part of the structure of government and act independently of it. The West European countries have begun to recognize the positive role and impact of NGOs over the course of the 90s. The result has been a shift from the concept of government to the concept of governance. The tool for governance is a civic dialogue, which develops participative democracy, i.e. the possibility to express and participate in the decision-making process during the election period. Economists describe the civil sector as the environment responsible for expanding the wealth of a society. Non-governmental non-profit organizations add a new perspective and guide the reactions of both local needs and problems as well as issues of a global character at the turn of the 21st century. A rigid centralized system in the post communist countries has been largely replaced by a bureaucracy lacking both experience and finances to create a truly democratic alternative. The main problems of these countries is a deficit of rules of communication with the interest groups (NGOs included), limited power (capacity) of state institutions and no clear lines between state activities and civil society. although almost 20 years have passed since the fall of the totalitarian state in the Czech Republic, the rebirth of civil society has been and continues to be, a painful and tong-term process. Non-profit organizations have been declared by public administration as partners and colleagues, but in practice this is still not an equal relationship. What is missing here is a clear vision supported by social consensus regarding the role of the state in Czech society, or what function the state should perform.","Tech Univ Liberci, Hospodarska Fak, Katedra Ekon, Liberci, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Laboutková, S (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberci, Hospodarska Fak, Katedra Ekon, Liberci, Czech Republic.",laboutkova@centrum.cz,"Laboutkova, Sarka/AAI-1256-2019","Laboutkova, Sarka/0000-0001-7108-2144",,,,,21,11,11,0,12,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Three key findings are derived. First, the examined Chinese manufacturing SMEs had a greater likelihood of survival had they developed and sustained a competitive advantage. Second, marketing innovation assisted in developing and sustaining competitive advantages based on differentiation and cost leadership strategies. Third, marketing innovation capabilities improved when the examined manufacturing SMEs were competitor oriented and had good inter-functional capabilities.","[Naidoo, Vik] Deakin Univ, Geelong, Vic 3217, Australia",Deakin University,,vikash.naidoo@deakin.edu.au,,,,,,,59,1,1,2,11,CHINA WATERPOWER PRESS-CWPP,BEIJING,"6 SANLIHELU, FUXINGMENWAI, BEIJING, 100044, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5084-6533-3,,,,2009,,,,,,,200,212,,,,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BNO72,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275143800024,0

The risk theory is the analysis of the stochastic features of non-life insurance business. The field of insurance risk theory has grown rapidly. There are now many papers and textbooks, which study the foundations of risk processes along strictly theoretical lines. On the other hand there is a need to develop the theories into forms suitable for practical purposes and to demonstrate their application. Modem computer simulation techniques open up a wide field of practical applications for risk theory concepts, without requiring the restrictive assumptions and sophisticated mathematics, of many traditional aspect of insurance risk theory. Modelling the size or loss is of crucial importance for an insurer. Particular attention is paid to studying the right tail of the distribution, since it is important to not underestimate the size (and frequency) of large losses. The method of maximum likelihood is often used to estimate parameters of possible distributions, and various tests may be used to assess the fit of a proposed model (for example Kolmogorov-Smirnoff, and chi(2) goodness-of-fit. Often one may find that a mixture of various distributions may be appropriate to model losses due to varying characteristics of both the policies and policyholders. The objective of this article is to call attention to a new approach to statistical modelling using quantile functions. This approach can deal with many issues associated with the steps of the statistical modelling process based on quantile methods. The definition and modelling of loss distributions in non-life insurance is one of the problem areas, where obtaining a good fit to the extreme tails of a distributional model is of major importance. It is a thesis of this article that the use of models based on quantiles provides an appropriate and flexible approach to the distributional modelling needed to obtain well-fitted tails. We are specifically interested in modelling and simulations the tails of loss distributions Thus is of particular relevance in reinsurance if we ale required to choose or price a high-excess layer. In this situation it is essential to find a good statistical model for the largest observed losses.","[Pacakova, Viera; Linda, Bohdan] Univ Pardubice, Fak Ekon Spravni, Ustav Matemat, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Pacáková, V (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fak Ekon Spravni, Ustav Matemat, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",vpacakova@gmail.com; Bohdan.Linda@upce.cz,,,,,,,11,6,6,0,5,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

It is also shown that dynamic inefficiency may arise, despite the fact that the model is of the Ramsey type.

This chapter identifies two types of new ventures - domestic new ventures (DNVs) and international new ventures (INVs) - based on the scale and scope of two value chain activities (sales and sourcing). These two categories are tested empirically in a national setting with respect to differences in their entrepreneurial orientation based on the scales of Covin and Slevin (1989) and Miller and Friesen (1982), incorporating four dimensions: innovativeness, risk-taking propensity, proactiveness, and competitive aggressiveness. For three of the nine hypotheses tested in this chapter there were no significant differences between the two types of firm. Support was found for INVs to be the first businesses to introduce products/services, administrative techniques and technologies; in addition, INVs typically initiated actions to which competitors then responded. Likewise, INVs were found to have a stronger proclivity for high-risk projects than local firms, and typically adopted a very competitive, 'get rid of competitors' posture.","[Rasmussen, Erik S.; Madsen, Tage K.; Servais, Per] Univ So Denmark, Dept Mkt & Management, Odense, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,,,"Rasmussen, Erik S/G-2215-2012; Servais, Per/AAY-5038-2020","Servais, Per/0000-0002-1753-4119; Madsen, Tage Koed/0000-0002-0093-5100; Rasmussen, Erik/0000-0002-2448-9838",,,,,0,2,2,1,8,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"GLENSANDA HOUSE, MONTPELLIER PARADE, CHELTENHAM GL50 1UA, GLOS, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84720-830-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,150,165,,,,,,16,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BSP51,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285291900012,0

International trade fairs bring together agents from all over the world and create temporary spaces for presentation and interaction. Within specific institutional settings, participants not only acquire knowledge through face-to-face communication with other agents, they also obtain information by observing and systematically monitoring other participants. This paper analyzes trade fairs from the perspective of time-geography as reflexive time-space constructions which enable economic interaction within well-defined, spatially and temporally bounded places. Temporary face-to-face contact and the physical co-presence of global communities at these events establish a particular information and communication ecology, referred to as global buzz. This paper aims to analyze the constituting components of global buzz and to dismantle the complexity of this phenomenon in a multi-dimensional way. Participants at international trade fairs benefit from intensified decentralized knowledge flows in the form of learning by interacting and learning by observation. As such, these events establish central nodes in the global political economy through which knowledge is created and exchanged at a distance.","[Schuldt, Nina] Univ Marburg, Fachbereich Geog, D-35032 Marburg, Germany; [Bathelt, Harald] Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada; [Bathelt, Harald] Univ Toronto, Dept Geog & Planning, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada",Philipps University Marburg; University of Toronto; University of Toronto,"Schuldt, N (通讯作者)，Univ Marburg, Fachbereich Geog, Deutsch Str 10, D-35032 Marburg, Germany.",nina.schuldt@web.de; harald.bathelt@utoronto.ca,,,,,,,70,5,5,0,23,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

During the period under study the results suggest that the impact of size is not uniform across the various measures employed. The empirical findings suggest that size has a negative impact on return on average equity (ROAE), while the opposite is true for return on average assets (ROAA) and net interest margins (NTM).

In the case of the twentieth century, particular emphasis is given to the sources upon which Foucault drew, seeking to determine how Foucault constructed his lecture presentations, and hence identify the particular originality of his arguments.","Leigh Sinton, Norrest, Malvern WR13 5EH, Worcs, England",,"Tribe, K (通讯作者)，Leigh Sinton, Norrest, Driftway, Malvern WR13 5EH, Worcs, England.",tess@dircon.co.uk,,,,,,,40,29,36,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Nevertheless, the decrease of stamp tax does not always result in the change of stock market volatility from the statistical perspective. In short run, the stamp tax adjustment does not bring about significant effects on the volatility of stock market. In long run, it almost does not affect the stock market.

An empirical study is conducted with a sample of 102 listed companies from SZ SMEB (Small and Medium Enterprises Board, Shenzhen) with panel data from until 2007). The main conclusions of this study are drawn as follows: (1) the difference of a new venture's resources will impact its performance directly: namely, physical resources and human resources are positively correlated with its profitability and growth; meanwhile, financial resources are positively correlated with new ventures's growth, and reputation resources positively correlated with profitability; (2) there would be statistical significance between a new venture's resources and its choice of growth strategy. The study indicates that new ventures with rich tangible resources and human resources would tend to adopt market pulled strategy for growth, whilst those with rich intangible resources would go for innovation pushed strategies for the same purpose;, (3) growth strategies in different industries also differ significantly. New ventures with high-technology prefer innovation pushed strategies, while those with less high-technology tend to choose market pulled strategy instead.

Many studies use models and methods that disregard uncertainty, investigating distortionary effects of different taxes on whether, when, and how to explore for, develop, and operate resource deposits. Introducing uncertainty into the analysis opens a range of challenges and leads to results that cast doubt on the relevance of studies that neglect uncertainty. There are, however, several ways to analyze uncertainty regarding companies' behavior, resource price processes, and diversification opportunities, all with different implications for taxation. Methods developed in financial economics since the 1980s, though promising, are still not in widespread use. Additional topics covered in this review are optimal risk sharing between companies and governments, time consistency and fiscal stability, the relationship between taxes and discount rates, tax competition, and transfer pricing.","Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, NO-0317 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Lund, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, NO-0317 Oslo, Norway.",diderik.lund@econ.uio.no,,,,,,,95,26,31,0,21,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1941-1340,,,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

To what extent do these trends imply a reallocation of scarce land away from food to fuel production? This paper critically reviews the small but growing literature in this area. We find that an increase in biofuel production may have a significant effect on food prices and, in certain parts of the world, in speeding up deforestation through land conversion. However, more research needs to be done to examine the effect of newer generation biofuel technologies that are less land intensive as well as the effect of environmental regulation and trade policies on land-use patterns.","[Chakravorty, Ujjayant; Hubert, Marie-Helene] Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R6, Canada; [Chakravorty, Ujjayant; Hubert, Marie-Helene; Nostbakken, Linda] Univ Alberta, Dept Mkt Business Econ & Law, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R6, Canada",University of Alberta; University of Alberta,"Chakravorty, U (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R6, Canada.",ujjayant@ualberta.ca; mhubert@ualberta.ca; linda.nostbakken@ualberta.ca,,/0000-0002-4339-5095,,,,,56,64,77,0,45,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1941-1340,,,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

Changing economic conditions, including waning transportation and communication costs, technological change and economic restructuring, rising real incomes, and changing tastes for natural amenities, have led to this new form of urban-rural interdependence. We review the recent research on the causes and consequences of this growth at regional and metropolitan scales, discuss advances in empirical and theoretical economic models Of urban land-use patterns at spatially disaggregate scales, and highlight research on environmental impacts and the efficacy of growth controls and land conservation programs that seek to manage this growth. The paper concludes with future research questions and needs.

With respect to the time dimension, agents are generally assumed to have a pure time preference as well as a preference for smoothing consumption over time. With respect to risk, agents are generally assumed to be Arrow-Pratt risk averse. The discounted expected utility model assumes that aversion to risk and aversion to intertemporal fluctuations coincide. This review discusses models and concepts that aim at disentangling time and risk attitude and briefly sketches a generalization of risk attitude to situations where uncertainty is not captured by unique probability measures.

Available impact studies of insect-resistant and herbicide-tolerant crops show that these technologies are beneficial to farmers and consumers, producing large aggregate welfare gains as well as positive effects for the environment and human health. The advantages of future applications could even be much bigger. Given a conducive institutional framework, GM crops can contribute significantly to global food security and poverty reduction. Nonetheless, widespread public reservations have led to a complex system of regulations. Overregulation has become a real threat for the further development and use of GM crops. The costs in terms of foregone benefits may be large, especially for developing countries.

Although a variety of different renewable Sources have been targeted for expansion, biomass technologies, especially those for converting biomass to liquid biofuels for transportation, have cornered a large share of the new investments. Cutting-edge knowledge in genomics and biotechnology, process chemistry, and engineering is being applied to produce new types of energy feed-stock and process them into novel biofuels. If these investments bear fruit, liquid biofuels have the potential to displace a substantial amount of oil over the next few decades, with limited negative impact on food supply and the natural habitat. Energy-security and food-security constraints and environmental considerations will determine which technologies emerge as winners. The search for new transportation fuels is also giving rise to the development of new paradigms in innovation, commercialization, and regulation.","[Sexton, Steve; Hochman, Gal; Zilberman, David] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Rajagopal, Deepak] Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Zilberman, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",deepak@berkeley.edu; zilber@are.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,121,16,18,0,28,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1941-1340,,,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

Both methodologies have their own context-specific advantages and disadvantages, and should be viewed as complements, not substitutes. Structural models typically require a theoretical model and explicit assumptions about structural errors in order to recover the parameters of behavioral functions. These estimates may be required to measure general equilibrium welfare effects or to simulate intricate feedback loops between natural and economic processes. However, many of the assumptions used to recover structural estimates are untestable. The goal of reduced form studies is, conversely, to recover key parameters of interest using exogenous within-sample variation with as few structural assumptions as possible-reducing reliance on these assumptions assists in establishing causality in the relationship of interest. Reduced-form studies do, however, require assumptions of their own, e.g., the (quasi) randomness of an experiment with no spillover effects on the control group.","[Timmins, Christopher] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Schlenker, Wolfram] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, New York, NY 10027 USA",Duke University; Columbia University,"Timmins, C (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",christopher.timmins@duke.edu; wolfram.schlenker@columbia.edu,,,,,,,89,33,46,1,34,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1941-1340,,,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

Earnings from farming in many developing countries have been depressed by a prourban bias in own-country policies as well as by governments of richer countries favoring their farmers with import barriers and subsidies. Both sets of policies reduce national and global economic welfare and inhibit economic growth; they also add to inequality and poverty in developing countries. Since the 1980s, however, numerous developing and some high-income country governments have reduced their sectoral and trade policy distortions. This paper draws on new empirical studies to show the changing extent of policy distortions to prices faced by the world's farmers since the 1950s. Modeling results provide an indication of how far those reforms proceeded between the early 1980s and 2004 and of how Much scope remains for removing continuing inefficiencies in global agricultural resource use.","[Anderson, Kym] World Bank, Washington, DC USA; [Anderson, Kym] Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA, Australia",The World Bank; University of Adelaide,"Anderson, K (通讯作者)，World Bank, Washington, DC USA.",kym.anderson@adelaide.edu.au,"Anderson, Kym/G-7292-2012","Anderson, Kym/0000-0002-1472-3352",,,,,52,2,5,0,10,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1941-1340,,978-0-8243-4701-7,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

Habitat protection policies that fail to account for private incentives often have unintended negative consequences. Private incentives for habitat protection depend on many factors: whether landowners are compensated for the costs of habitat protection, the design of compensation mechanisms, underlying property rights and security of tenure, the structure of conservation contracts, and whether markets can be created that internalize external benefits of habitat protection. In developing countries, agricultural price, credit, tax, and land tenure policies have important effects on the demand for habitat conversion. Private landowners often can provide crucial information about costs of habitat protection and species or habitat values on their property. Policies that encourage self-reporting of this information can greatly improve the cost effectiveness of policies to identify and acquire sites for species protection.","[Innes, Robert] Univ Calif, Sch Social Sci Humanities & Arts, Merced, CA 95344 USA; [Frisvold, George] Univ Arizona, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of California System; University of California Merced; University of Arizona,"Innes, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calif, Sch Social Sci Humanities & Arts, Merced, CA 95344 USA.",rinnes@ucmerced.edu; frisvold@ag.arizona.edu,,,,,,,165,14,14,0,56,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1941-1340,,,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

A three-stage framework, sourced with the incomplete contracting and control rights literature, is advanced to evaluate the successes and failures of a variety of PPP in the natural resources. These case studies provide unique insights into the contract Structures that are typically designed for the management and provision of impure public goods. We demonstrate the desired contract structure of a PPP depends on the type of good or service produced, and it is this pivotal point that generally results in shared authority in the extraction or production and consumptive distribution of natural resources.","[Rausser, Gordon; Stevens, Reid] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Rausser, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",grausser@are.berkeley.edu,,"Rausser, Gordon/0000-0002-0647-128X",,,,,80,10,10,1,38,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1941-1340,,,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

We are more vulnerable to extreme events as a result of the increasing concentration of population and activities in exposed areas of the country. The question is not whether large-scale catastrophe will occur, but when and how frequently they will strike. One key question is, Who will pay for the economic losses future disasters will inflict? This paper discusses how new catastrophe risk markets can be developed to provide the necessary financial covet-age to make our Country more resilient. We look specifically at insurance-linked financial instruments to complement traditional insurance and reinsurance. We also propose the development of long-term insurance and long-term loans to overcome behavioral biases such as myopia and misperception of risks. The paper concludes by proposing risk management strategies that apply to other extreme events such as the financial crisis of 2008-2009.","[Kunreuther, Howard C.; Michel-Kerjan, Erwann O.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Ctr Risk Management & Decis Proc, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Kunreuther, HC (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Ctr Risk Management & Decis Proc, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",kunreuther@wharton.upenn.edu; erwannmk@wharton.upenn.edu,,,,,,,40,6,7,3,22,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1941-1340,,,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

Climate change also affects the productivity of land, which in turn leads to further land-use change. This paper explores the growing research on both topics. The land-use emission literature has focused on deforestation (harvests) and ignored the fact that harvests hive led to a much younger and therefore growing global forest. Taking this into account, mankind's current and future influence over land use will have a small positive effect on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Although the literature Initially focused on climate impacts alone, when adaptation is taken into account we find that climate change is likely to have benign net global impacts on market sectors related to land use. Climate impacts on nonmarket sectors, however, are much more poorly understood or measured. Furthermore, it is not yet clear whether governments will adapt or malidapt to climate change.","[Mendelsohn, Robert] Yale Univ, Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Dinar, Ariel] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Environm Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",Yale University; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Mendelsohn, R (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",robert.mendelsohn@yale.edu; ariel.dinar@ucr.edu,"Mendelsohn, Robert/GZA-9112-2022",,,,,,98,38,47,6,73,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1941-1340,,,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

We examine the causal relationship between electricity consumption and economic growth, price and income elasticities of demand, and the barriers to adoption of energy-efficient equipment. We also examine the performance outcomes of economic policies affecting the electricity sector, including institutional reforms such as privatization and regulation. We find that electricity demand is driven by GDP, prices, income, the level and characteristics of economic activity/urbanization, and seasonal factors. The magnitude of their effects differs across countries, time periods, and Studies even for the same country. These demand studies suffer from a number of limitations, including data availability and price distortions that limit responsiveness of demand to price signals. The literature is inconclusive on whether reforms, particularly privatization, improved supply efficiency. Effective regulation, competitive markets, and appropriate sequencing of reforms are important factors that influence the outcomes of privatization. There is a need for more quantitative analysis of the social welfare and distributional impacts of privatization of the electricity sector in developing countries.","[Khanna, Madhu] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Rao, Narasimha D.] Stanford Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Stanford University,"Khanna, M (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",khanna1@illinois.edu; ndrao@stanford.edu,"Rao, Narasimha D/K-5357-2012","Rao, Narasimha D/0000-0003-1888-5292",,,,,99,30,36,2,32,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1941-1340,,,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

We distinguish them as special cases in a general model of household behavior, which is critical and depends on risk information. Simply informing households may achieve a lot in the simplest challenge (groundwater arsenic); yet, for the three infectious situations discussed (respiratory, diarrhea, and malaria), community coordination and public provision may also be necessary. More generally, social interactions may justify additional policies. For each situation we discuss the valuation of private spillovers (i.e., externalities) and evaluation of public policies to reduce environmental risks and spillovers.

Yet, there is relatively little work in economics that addresses biodiversity loss. Some economists have called for better integration of economic and ecological models to address biodiversity and the attendant ecosystem services. Current integrated approaches in economics are discussed, and they take in ecosystem services, ecosystem externalities, and substantial ecological modeling. Much of the modeling uses Lotka-Volterra equations, which are standard in ecology, although there is concern that the equations lack the microfoundations of plant and animal behavior. An alternative approach is to admit microbehavior using economic optimization techniques that build adaptive ecological systems. However, much more effort is needed to assess whether admitting more ecological detail into economic models will be fruitful.","Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",University of Wyoming,"Tschirhart, J (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",jtsch@uwyo.edu,,,,,,,170,33,39,0,69,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

We assess the extent to which these conditions provide a motivation for policy intervention in energy-using product markets, including an examination of the evidence oil policy effectiveness and cost.

We distinguish between integration in positive versus normative analysis. There is rapid growth in positive research that combines the two disciplines to provide insight and better understanding of the bidirectional linkage between economic and ecological systems. This research is a crucial part of addressing growing large-scale environmental challenges. This integration is equally important, but potentially much more difficult, in normative analysis, especially when interdisciplinary groups include individuals with different views regarding appropriate normative criteria. In such cases, reaching consensus can be difficult and slow, even when the practical implications of the different perspectives (i.e., the general policy prescriptions they imply) are the same. We suggest an approach for increasing the scope for collaboration among economists and ecologists in normative analysis.","[Segerson, Kathleen] Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Polasky, Stephen] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Polasky, Stephen] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",University of Connecticut; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Segerson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",polasky@umn.edu; kathleen.segerson@uconn.edu,"Polasky, Stephen/AAC-5341-2019",,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [0814628] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,152,106,135,2,130,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1941-1340,,,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

Preferences with respect to risk, time, societal others, and the environment shape the decision-making processes of individuals. Economic experiments have been extensively carried out in the lab and in the field to test the predictions of behavioral theories; some have had a particular focus on development and environmental issues. Random interventions have also proven to be an important source of information with respect to experimentation in development and policy design. This article identifies the contributions of experiments and random interventions and reflects on the value of having a productive dialogue-in connection with said experiments-with the main stakeholders regarding the problems being studied. Wherever experimental science is done, young men and women are learning to build instruments, using the new materials and new concepts that science has made available. And then, the crafts that were nurtured in the laboratory find uses in the world outside.

It emphasizes the role and interpretation of the Hotelling condition and discusses the reasons why that result plays so small a role empirically. The concept of sustainability is introduced in the simplest possible content, that of directly consuming a finite stock over infinite time. When the resources flow is an input into production along with capital that can be accumulated, the nature of sustainability changes and becomes more interesting. It is suggested, however, that to consider instead the eventual availability of a resource-free backstop technology may be just as interesting and more relevant. That concept is illustrated in the direct-consumption context but awaits further development in production economies.","MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Solow, RM (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jamu@mit.edu,,,,,,,18,1,1,0,8,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1941-1340,,,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

In the seminal work on the Subject, agriculture was seen as a Source of contributions that helped induce industrial growth and a structural transformation of the economy. However, globalization, integrated value chains, rapid technological and institutional innovations, and environmental constraints have deeply changed the context for agriculture's role. We argue that a new paradigm is needed that recognizes agriculture's multiple functions for development in that emerging context: triggering economic growth, reducing poverty, narrowing income disparities, providing food security, and delivering environmental services. Yet, governments and donors have neglected these functions of agriculture with the result that agriculture growth has been reduced, 75% of world poverty is rural, sectoral income disparities have exploded, food insecurity has returned, and environmental degradation is widespread, compromising sustainability. Mobilizing these functions requires shifting the political economy to overcome antiagriculture policy biases, strengthening governance for agriculture, and tailoring priorities to country conditions.","[Byerlee, Derek] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [de Janvry, Alain; Sadoulet, Elisabeth] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",The World Bank; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Byerlee, D (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",dbyerlee@gmail.com; alain@are.berkeley.edu; sadoulet@are.berkeley.edu,"Byerlee, Derek/HTN-3605-2023",,,,,,49,147,180,0,81,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

The implications of a range of complicating factors are considered; these include traffic bottlenecks, constraints on which roads and freeway lanes in the road network can be priced, driver heterogeneity, private toll operators, other externalities besides congestion, and interactions between congestion taxes and the broader fiscal system. I also briefly discuss the incidence of congestion taxes and experience with this policy in the United States and elsewhere. Although the economics literature on congestion pricing has advanced considerably over the past 20 years, research is still needed on the empirical measurement of second-best efficient tolls for urban centers and whether alternative design features have substantial implications for efficiency. More research is also needed on the design of schemes to promote feasibility by compensating adversely affected groups with minimal loss in economic efficiency.","Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Resources for the Future,"Parry, IWH (通讯作者)，Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",parry@rff.org,,,,,,,99,12,17,2,24,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1941-1340,,,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

The object of the research has been the influence of Poland's joining the EU on plant and animal production of a medium-small farm (15 ESU), the animals fed on concentrates type, the pig fattening subtype, a medium-large farm (37 ESU), the various crops and animals with a predominance of milk and beef cattle production type, a medium-large farm (27 ESU), the pig fattening subtype, and a medium-large farm (19 ESU), and the milk production type. The results of the research have been compared with the situation of the Polish agriculture, in particular within the context of the agricultural population's income depreciation resulting from the process of the systemic transformation. The object of analysis included changes in the volume of a direct surplus on the production of cereals, sugar beet, pigs, beef, and milk in 2006 as compared to 2003. The research has proved the highest positive effect of the integration on the profitability of animal production, and in particular on individual farms' economic results on beef cattle and dairy cows breeding. A slight positive effect of the integration on the profitability of pig fattening has also been indicated. As far as plant production is concerned, a strong beneficial influence of the integration on sugar beet production's profitability has been proved. Furthermore, it has been pointed out that economic results of farms concentrating on the production of cereals have deteriorated after the integration. The article discusses also the effect the integration has had on farms' net incomes. Moreover, economic results of Polish farms before and after the integration have been compared with economic results of agricultural producers of certain types in the selected EU counties. Basing on the conclusions drawn from the performed analysis, the article includes also the prediction of social and economic changes concerning the Polish countryside and farms.","[Czternasty, Waldemar; Smedzik, Katarzyna] Poznan Univ Econ, Dept Macroecon & Agr Econ, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,,,,,,,,,6,3,3,0,3,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-9937-3-7,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2009,,20,,,,,126,132,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BUR81,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290182900017,0

Results suggest that labor and capital cost shares rose and the meat share of costs dropped in all industries and that long-run costs rose in the cattle slaughter, pork processing, and chicken slaughter industries. Results also suggest that events may have favored large cattle slaughter plants throughout the period and large chicken slaughter plants during the implementation period of the Pathogen Reduction Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (PR/HACCP) rule spanning the 1997-2002 period. There is no evidence that events favored large plants over small plants in pork processing and sausage-making.

Nonetheless, European consumers' definition and perception of TFP have not been thoroughly addressed thus far. The specific aim of this study was to provide an all-embracing consumer definition of the concept of TFP that is comfortable for the largest possible majority of European food consumers. Cross-sectional survey data were collected from representative consumer samples from Belgium, France, Italy, Norway, Poland, and Spain in November 2007, yielding a total sample of 4,828 participants. The study elaborates on country-specific peculiarities and identifies consumer segments that differ in the emphasis they place in the conceptualization of TFP. The following definition emerged, A traditional food product is a product frequently consumed or associated to specific celebrations and/or seasons, transmitted from one generation to another, made in a specific way according to gastronomic heritage, naturally processed, and distinguished and known because of its sensory properties and associated to a certain local area, region or country. Cross-European homogeneity was found in the elements to include in the definition, across and within-country heterogeneity existed regarding the specific emphasis of particular elements. Four consumer segments were distinguished by whom TFP are predominantly defined as multiconcept, usual/familiar, authentic/typical, and inherited. The first segment displayed a very broad conceptualization, without a clear differentiation. For the latter three segments, particular elements dominated their conceptualization. Product positioning, marketing, and communication challenges for TFP facing these consumer segments are discussed. [EconLit citations: D12; M39; Q13].

Following the European Commission's ruling to establish Greek feta cheese as a product of protected designation of origin (P.D.O.), major opportunities have been created for exports and further development. The present paper is based on a survey conducted on a sample of cheese-making enterprises in Greece. The collection of the data was made using a specially prepared structured questionnaire. The objective of the study is to examine the competitiveness of cheese-making enterprises, and explore the possibility of their receiving funding, as a driving force for agricultural development and for the exploitation of the goat and sheep farming sectors. In order to study the competitiveness of cheese-making enterprises, an assessment of basic financial results was carried out. Finally, a grouping of the cheese-making enterprises was attempted, as regards the main economic parameters that are linked to their competitive profile. The results of the survey are expected to facilitate the implementation of rural policy measures that will improve the competitiveness and economics of the enterprises in question.

The analysis brought into prominence the impact of institutional arrangements on the success or failure of agropark formation. An overview of the risks related to the agropark concept was provided.

In addition to the log-normal distribution, the Weibull, gamma, exponential and log-logistic distributions are employed for a comprehensive data set of over 6,000 Australian wines. Estimates of marginal attribute impacts do differ with distribution employed with the Weibull being the most different. On average for all wines, the log-logistic distribution produces the most accurate predictions, however, the performance of distributions differs according to price range. Combining the predictions can produce substantially lower absolute errors on average, because of the varying accuracy performance of the distributions. [EconLit citations: L15, D40, C16].

Advertising, having an estimated elasticity (of demand) of 0.038 using panel data, is found to be about five times as effective as nonadvertising; therefore, it remains the more powerful marketing tool. Such results have policy implications in benefit-cost analysis and optimal allocation of fluid-milk check-off funds.

Economic aspects of rapeseed production are significantly influenced by productivity dynamics of oilseed rape sowings, changes in productivity levels, regional aspects of cultivation conditions, size of farms, and specialisation and concentration of production. Three methods were used in the research: dynamic time-row analysis method to estimate crop productivity and growth of other parameters in a longer period of time, grouping method to investigate the influence of production concentration, and logical construction method. It is recognised that large agricultural holdings are the most important rapeseed producers. Three fourths of the total rapeseed areas are concentrated in these enterprises accounting for 82% of the total yield produced by all rapeseed-production farms together. One fifth of the total area under oilseed rape belong to medium-sized farms; however the proportion of the total rapeseed yield obtained in this group of farms is by one third lower than that produced by large agricultural holdings. Insignificant number of small-scale farms is engaged in oilseed rape cultivation. Significant differences observed in rapeseed productivity levels among particular regions except natural (soil, climatic, etc.) factors are greatly affected by the applied amount of fertilisers and crop protection products. In meteorologically unfavourable years, yield decline in farms high in seed yields is considerably lower compared with lower productivity farms.","[Ruza, Liga] Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,,liga@latraps.lv,,,,,,,5,1,1,0,1,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-9937-3-7,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2009,,20,,,,,167,173,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BUR81,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290182900023,0

The demand for French wines became more price inelastic in the latter period while the demand for other European wines became price elastic. If the UK government is concerned with decreasing alcohol consumption, an increase in the wine excise tax would lead to a relatively larger decrease in imports from Italy, Portugal, and Spain.

The data from the EU database of FADN are used for describing the structure of producers. The analysis is based on average indicators of agricultural sector on an example of field crops production. The analysis of social profitability indicates that the scale of the enterprise plays an important role in competitiveness. Considering the opportunity cost price of resources the small-scale production is inefficient and in longer perspective not sustainable. The evaluation of competitive advantage showed that only large-scale enterprises have a minimal competitive advantage in production. Value of the relevant index characterising the competitiveness approximately equals to one, which means that the price of usage of domestic resources is equal to value added found on the basis of import prices. Despite the fact that in production the use of labour has decreased, the small-scale producers use considerably more labour for the same amount of end product compared to large-scale producers, and the changes in relative price of production factors affect small-scale producers more than large-scale producers, due to the use of more labour-intensive technologies are used.",,,,,,,,,,,11,2,2,0,0,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-9937-3-7,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2009,,20,,,,,140,146,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BUR81,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290182900019,0

An Application of the Theory of Planned Behavior,AGRIBUSINESS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,REASONED ACTION; FAST-FOOD; OBESITY; HOME; CONSUMPTION; DIET,"American consumers spend almost half of their food dollars on food away from home (FAFH) despite potential harmful effects of eating out more frequently. This study examines how consumers' attitudes toward FAFH and their personal preferences influence their behavior of eating food away from home. This study differs from previous work by using the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to model consumers' FAFH behavior. Empirical testing of consumers' FAFH behavior reveals several interesting and important findings. Results show that negative attitudes toward FAFH reduced consumers' frequency of eating out, whereas the availability of healthy food, good service, and convenience in restaurants increased consumers' frequency of eating out. The policy implications of such study findings are discussed. [EconLit citations: D120].

Traceability can be used as a tool to gather information about and manage food safety risks associated with these types of products. The authors investigate the choice of voluntary traceability in three-tiered multi-ingredient food supply chains, They propose a framework based on vertical control and agency theory to model three dimensions of traceability systems: depth, breadth, and precision. Their analysis has three main results. First, full traceability is feasible as long as there are net benefits to a downstream firm that demands traceability across all ingredients. Second, horizontal network externalities are positive because an increase in the level of traceability in one ingredient requires a similar increase in others. Finally, vertical network effects will be positive insofar as willingness to pay and probabilities of food safety hazards increase. [EconLit Classification: Q130, L140]. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals.

A probit model was used to determine the factors influencing the EurepGap compliance decision while descriptive statistics were used to identify the major constraints to compliance. Results indicate that the high initial cost of compliance is a major constraint on compliance. This arises from the need to purchase recommended agro-chemicals and fertilizers, and the hiring of additional labor. The key factors that are likely to enhance compliance with the standards include socioeconomic and farm characteristics such as area under French beans, household size, total number of farm enterprises and access to extension services. However, compliance is also negatively influenced by access to off-farm income. The authors make several policy recommendations that could be implemented to enhance and upscale compliance with EurepGap standards in the study area. [EconLit citations: D230; Q130; Q180].

On one hand, the responses to the competition with new actors coming from emerging countries and the reaction to high-tech products demand evolution. On the other hand, endogenous dynamics appear to become more important for the strategic behaviour of the firms: a higher qualification of the human capital, a more clear orientation for high quality products, organization changes, and relation capacity development. Starting from these considerations, this paper developed an econometric analysis using information from one of the most important national dataset for innovation analysis. The results pointed out that a determinant to successfully develop and introduce product innovation is the capacity to built relationships on the product markets (i.e., with the modern distribution), while the territorial context determines a higher/lower relevance of each of the driving factors of innovation.

This method allows a motivated choice of the necessary number of aggregates to perform a definite amount work taking into account the economic expediency. The computer software MS Excel Solver was used to calculate the mathematical model solving it as an optimisation task of non-linear programming.

Since the end of 2008 incomes of dairy farmers are sharply decreasing, and there are significant problems for sustainability of this industry. Milk production costs sharply increase, while milk purchase prices are not adequate for the development of industry. The first precondition for the industry development is a lack of milk products in the domestic market. The second precondition that determines and will determine the need for producing milk and milk products is their export. Presently Latvia exports almost 40% of the milk output. Even now it is possible to expand the export of milk products, as the demand for milk products rapidly increases in the world market. Only a production system having competitive dairy farms and the existing ones strengthened at all economic stages might be perspective.

Although numerous studies in the economics, finance, and accounting literatures have examined the properties of these forecasts and provided general insight into their performance, no known research explicitly examines the performance of analysts' EPS estimates for publicly traded food companies. This issue is particularly relevant given the influence that publicly traded agribusiness companies maintain in the agro-food supply chain (Vickner, 2002). Focusing on quarterly consensus estimates of EPS for 11 of the largest publicly traded food companies based on capitalization, the authors examine the point accuracy of these estimates through the introduction of the mean absolute scaled error measure, their performance over time, as well as their optimal forecast properties of bias, efficiency, and forecast encompassing. Results suggest that professional analysts, on average, produce EPS estimates that are more accurate than time series alternatives, yet the differences are often not statistically significant. For many of the firms examined, analysts' EPS estimates are found to be biased, inefficient, and do not encompass information in simple time series alternatives. For many firms in the sample, forecast accuracy has decreased over time. However, it is difficult to determine if this decline in forecast accuracy is due to turnover of analysts in the wake of increased financial market regulation (e. g., Sarbanes-Oxley), decline in forecasting skill, or structural changes in the food industry, which make it more difficult to forecast earnings over time.

Two of the segments jointly represent about 40% of all cheese-purchasing households and arc characterized as frequent buyers with an average interpurchase time of 2 weeks. These frequent-purchase households are larger in size, have greater incomes, have a smaller proportion of African Americans, and are insensitive to coupons. They are often described in the marketing literature as loyal customers. In contrast, the other two segments, which jointly represent about 60% of the households, are characterized by infrequent buyers with an average interpurchase time of 6 weeks.

The authors then analyze the effect of property structures (cooperatives and corporations) and business activities on the intensity of the relationship between intangibility and performance. Relationships between intangibles and performance were tested empirically by means of a questionnaire carried out in 2005-2006. Questionnaire data were completed using financial statements for 207 companies whose activity included one or more stages in the production and marketing of wine. Using MANOVA and the production function approach, the authors found evidence that intangible proxies had a negative impact on the firms' economic performance measurements and a positive impact on commercial performance for intermediate values of intangible ratios. They also found that production functions were very different with regard to legal status and business activity, but that the negative impact of intangible proxies remained.

Eight attributes, proposed in hypothetical contracts to farmers, are evaluated. The results suggest that farmers have strong marketing preferences associated with new supply chains, such as prearranging prices and quantities with buyers, but have remaining preferences for some attributes of traditional spot markets, such as the lack of grading produce, receiving cash payments, lack of delivery schedules, ability to sell at the farm gate, and ability to sell individually. Further, farmers prefer market channels that do not require major upfront investments.

In our research the input, transformation and output activities of a biogas plant were modelled with the GNF (Generalised Network Flow) method. The plant is based on a 1000-sow farm with slurry system. Other inputs in the area can comprise silage maize, sweet sorghum, grass silage, and by-products of green pea processing. Transforming process in the biogas plant has two steps. During the first step, the input material is digested, while during the second step, transforming processes are carried out according to the various utilisation forms of the biogas and the fermented manure. Products from the biogas production are as follows: clean biogas, electricity, heat, and their combinations. The fermented material can be utilised in homogenised form, or as separated liquid and dry phases. Our aims were to optimise the processes with minimum costs. The analysis of shadow prices and the sensitivity analysis lead to the determination of marginal costs of the input materials and economic transport distances. This model allows decreasing the cost of biogas production as well as deciding on the plants to be grown, thus increasing the competitiveness of green energy production.","[Csipkes, Margit; Gal, Timea; Szendrei, Janos; Nagy, Lajos] Univ Debrecen, Ctr Agr & Engn Sci, Dept Econ Anal & Stat, Debrecen, Hungary",University of Debrecen,"Csipkés, M (通讯作者)，Univ Debrecen, Ctr Agr & Engn Sci, Dept Econ Anal & Stat, Debrecen, Hungary.",,"Szendrei, Janos/HMD-4837-2023","Szendrei, Janos/0000-0002-2204-7972",,,,,9,0,0,0,3,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-9937-3-7,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2009,,20,,,,,174,+,,,,,,2,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BUR81,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290182900024,0

All data were collected on the province level for the period from 1991 to 2007. The patterns of the source of productivity were investigated using two methods: interpretation of estimated parameters in Cobb-Douglas production function, and the analysis of squared semi partial correlations. The results applied in the research are similar from both methods. The paper argues that the least pure impact is connected with certified seeds, medium impact on chemical originated inputs (fertilisers and pesticides), and the largest impact - to soil quality. The findings of the study indicate that: - pure impact of certified seeds is below 10%, - impact of chemical origin inputs is ca. 30% - (influence of pesticides and artificial fertilisers are not to be separated (as they strongly depend on each other), - pure impact of soil quality - about 60%.

By using a Tobit model, an effort is exerted to demonstrate the empirical application of TCE theory and to measure transaction costs that influence agricultural marketing.

However, the price decreases associated with efficiency gains are likely to have a much larger effect on food demand and welfare in developing countries. Despite the importance of the question, few studies have empirically analyzed which driver has been more important to the spread of modern food retailing. Using a newly constructed data set of 103 developing countries, we find suggestive evidence of the expansion being primarily driven by growth in demand for nonprice characteristics. Specifically, we find that variation in demographic characteristics, such as share of the population who would benefit most from the convenience offered by modern formats, are associated with large variations in supermarket growth over the past decade. On the other hand, growth in modern food retailing appears uncorrelated with variation in the ease of developing efficient supply chains. Thus, although having the possibility to deliver large welfare gains to developing countries, the expansion of modern supermarkets likely has had much more muted effects.

The results suggest that the profitability of the producer, marketing method employed by the producer and the number of packers to whom the producer sold hogs significantly influences attitudes towards marketing contracts. These results suggest that low-cost producers who market hogs via individual or group marketing contracts are more positive, or in some cases less negative, in their attitudes towards marketing contracts. Although prior nonparametric analyses provide some insight into factors influencing producers' views of marketing contracts, this analyses allows inference of statistical significance.

Despite its relevance, little empirical research has focused on explaining the company's entry and expansion into food retailing. Wal-Mart's expansion into food retailing through its store conversion strategy is analyzed using an industrial organization entry framework. The results show that Wal-Mart's store conversion strategy has targeted largely populated areas with low population density, a high percentage of population receiving food stamps, and where the presence of incumbents is modest. The results also provide evidence that as the company moves toward saturation of local markets and increases store conversion rates, it may be forced to reconsider some of its strategic decisions based on the exploitation of economies of density and store conversion.

The results indicated that cowpea consumers in Ghana, Mali, and Nigeria are willing to pay a premium for large cowpea grains. Bruchid damage is not statistically significant in any market. The impact of price on other cowpea quality characteristics such as skin color and texture and eye color vary locally. Implications for development of the cowpea value chain are as follows: (a) researchers should identify cost-effective ways to increase cowpea grain size because larger grain are preferred and (b) serving local markets requires a portfolio of grain skin and eye color and skin texture combinations.

The research provides abundant empirical support to the view that F & B MNEs operate on a worldwide scale and although their share of foreign to total affiliates is lower than in the average MNE they have a wide country spread. The great physical dispersion of the F & B MNEs' assets, however, does not necessarily imply expansion to cultural distant areas. World leaders in this industry are more likely to expand their operations to countries that display cultural characteristics similar to those of the home country. The authors observe differences concerning cultural distance among different companies. Western F & B MNEs seem more culturally rooted than Japanese ones, probably owing to differences in the product mix and the activities developed by the companies. A comparison of 1996, 2000, and 2002 data shows that F & B MNEs are gradually expanding to increasingly unfamiliar environments.

From the use of the Heckman two-step procedure, they also calculate own-price, cross-price, and income elasticities by estimating demand relationships for both organic and conventional milk. They find that demographic factors play a crucial role in the household choice of purchasing organic milk. Furthermore, households are more sensitive to own-price changes in the case of organic milk versus conventional milk. Evidence from estimated cross-price elasticities indicates that organic and conventional milk are substitutes. However, quantities purchased of organic milk are more sensitive to changes in prices of conventional milk than vice versa. Consequently, an asymmetric pattern exists with regard to the substitution patterns of the respective milk types. Moreover, evidence indicates that organic milk is responsive to income changes, but conventional milk is not responsive to income changes. Finally, a 1% increase in the price of organic milk reduces total milk sales by 0.20%, but a 1% increase in the price of conventional milk raises total milk sales by 0.31%.

A further objective is to verify whether consumer cognitive structures vary with household structure (children vs. no children), as reported in the literature on new product acceptance. The results reveal a higher degree of abstraction in the cognitive structure of households with children, incorporating more values in the means end chains.

Three categories of member attributes are identified: satisfaction with the profitability of farm operations, age of the member, and experience from board work. The cooperatives' degree of success is measured as members' commitment towards cooperatives, and members' trust in the board of directors. The data originate from a mail Survey among 2,250 Swedish farmers. The results indicate differences in members' commitment and their trust towards directors to be due to farm profitability, the members' age and experience as directors.

The model used regionally aggregated at-home consumption data from 2000 to 2005. Estimated uncompensated own price elasticities for fresh potatoes were highly significant and ranged between -0.5 and -1.6. The study was designed to capture the effects of the aggregate organic market on the prices, expenditures, and demand for each potato category. Organic food market penetration elasticities suggest that specialty potatoes (organic and minor-colored) are particularly well positioned if demands for organic products continue to rise, red potatoes are not well positioned and evidence of the early warning signs of slippage in market share for white and russet potatoes may exist. Producers and promoters of conventional potato products should account for the increasingly important role of organic products in making decisions. As an auxiliary exercise, we also statistically sourced the variance of the organic potato price premium relative to the other four fresh potato prices. At the present time, the variability of the organic potato premium is not much affected by production costs or other supply-related factors: the premium variability was driven largely by demand, and demographic/seasonal factors. Producers should be cautious about shifting to organic potato production until lower cost practices emerge. [JEL Codes: D120, Q130, Q180].

The notion of sustainability comprises three aspects: ecological, social and political, and economic target systems, which by now have been supplemented with cultural and regional elements including the protection of environment, local traditions, scale of values, cultural and historical heritage. The principles of sustainable development also include the improvement of human and animal health and the maintenance of vital rural communities. The priority notion of sustainability of agricultural production refers also to animal production and especially sheep production. Sheep have contributed substantially to the grassland-based agricultural production in Hungary for centuries. Sheep sector is important in rural areas as the tool of sustainability of animal production. It should also be highlighted that contrary to numerous efforts, the globally difficult process of sustainable development poses almost unsolvable problems for implementers even on local and regional levels.

The least energy loss, when processing forest biomass, is monitored in the production of granules and woodchips. There is a great amount of energy-wood in Latvia. It is possible to produce 8 million MWh of energy per year if Latvia's exported energy-wood is used in local cogeneration facilities. Properly and rationally processed logging scraps can be used to produce an extra 12.5 million MWh of energy, thus slightly decreasing the import of energy resources.

Changes of the production resources and the efficiency of their utilisation may become a marker to assess the situation of farms and predict the development of agriculture. Production resources in agriculture allow achieving specific volume of production, which is directly transferable on the amount of the gained profit. Farms are distinguished by different rates of development, which is conditioned by many factors. Apart from the external factors (components of the environment), one should point to the internal conditions of the farm. It is estimated that the internal forces are decisive in achieving success on the market on particular conditions (country, region). It all depends on the entities themselves - how they would use their chances offered by the environment and actions they would take to avoid danger. The external environment has a great influence on the entity, complicating the situation and hindering decision taking and effective management. Many businesses cope in a changing environment, while others are liquidated, which is a mark of the role of the business's internal potential (Adamowicz 2002). The potential is related to both, the material factors of production (such as the soil, labour force resources, fixed and current assets, etc.), and the non-material factors (knowledge, skills, competence of the management, access to information, etc.). Winning the competitive advantage is possible when the business has appropriate resources at its disposal and uses them efficiently. The material will present the diversification in the use of the production potential on the Polish farms, depending on their market activeness (relations with the environment). The analysis covers the soil and labour resources. The main emphasis will be placed on the efficiency of using these resources on farms with diversified relations with the environment (market).

Traceability systems based on information and communication technologies (ICT) allow firms to collect, track, stock and transfer information on a range of product attributes. This study contributes to further understand traceability adoption by applying ICT adoption models to the case of ETS, and by using an original dataset, the 2002 ICT Survey, representative of all French agribusiness. The results suggest that a firm's degree of complexity (growing size, belonging to a group) and the development of its information system play a significant role in its adoption behavior. Moreover, they show that ETS adpotion is more driven by a firm's narrow relations with specialized suppliers and downstream processors than by retailers [EconLit classifications: O33; Q130].

DEA uses mathematical programming to produce a linear best practice frontier over the data and then calculates efficiency measures relative to this frontier. The technical efficiency was calculated for individual farms which use similar inputs and produce the same product (cereals and oilseeds producers). The Farm Accounting Data Network (FADN) data were used to analyse the grain sector in Estonia. The analysis demonstrated that producers should not benchmark to the highest level of production, but rather should combine resources in land, labour and costs to achieve an efficient level of production, which indeed may be less than the maximum production level of the group.","[Luik, Helis] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Econ & Social Sci, Tartu, Estonia",Estonian University of Life Sciences,,helis.luik@emu.ee,,,,,,,13,0,1,0,4,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-9937-3-7,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2009,,20,,,,,72,78,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BUR81,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290182900010,0

Collusive behavior was found for all three data periods though the extent of Collusion varied across semester-long data periods.

Because of limited production, pricing, promotions, and consumer-related variables are essential to explain olive oil consumer behavior. As a consequence of this increasing consumption, it is fundamental to analyze the main factors influencing consumers' olive oil choices for both brands and retailers to be able to compete more efficiently and satisfy consumer needs more closely. But, few such studies are concerned with olive oil (although a great many works in the literature analyze the influence of these factors in other product categories). In a sociocultural context like the Spanish market, in which brand awareness is strong and the use of the product is very high, these factors are even more important. Thus, the main objective of this article is to determine and assess how different marketing variables, such as price, price discounts, use of store flyers and loyalty, explain olive oil brand choice.

This has resulted in changes in the spatial distribution of production among crops and greater volatility in shipping demands, both intra- and interseasonally. Basis relationships have become more volatile and less predictable. Greater volatility results in more risk for producers and shippers, and exacerbates planning and investment for handling and shipping infrastructure. The purpose of this study is to analyze relationships and impacts among shipping costs and basis values at origins and destinations. The results indicate that (1) basis values have become more risky; (2) all marketing costs have increased; (3) increases in rail tariffs were less than those for barges; (4) daily car values, on average, declined; (5) fuel service charges had moderate changes in absolute terms; and (6) handling margins have had fairly substantial increases, particularly at port. The econometric results indicate that the following variables were significant in explaining variability in origin basis values: shipping costs, Gulf-PNW ocean rate spreads, outstanding export sales, shipping industry concentration, measures of rail cars late, the ratio of stocks to storage capacity, futures prices, and varying measures of futures and destination spreads. Finally, implications for rail pricing, capacity and understanding basis pricing are discussed. [Econ Lit citations: Q130, L900].

The impact of socioeconomic and demographic factors on respondents' acceptance of Fair Trade coffee is evaluated using cluster analysis and multinomial logit models. The results suggest that, regardless of location, consumers place a strong premium on price and labeling claims. Three consumer segments are identified in each city; in Toronto, these segments are labeled Fair Trade-Focused, Price Conscious, and Balanced Buyers; for Vancouver these segments are labeled Organic and Fair Trade-Focused, Price Conscious, and Balanced Buyers. Although a broad spectrum of variables influences segment membership, no single variable explains membership in the same segment in each city. Such a result is rather telling; it suggests deeper constructs underlie segment membership, and presumably consumption behavior with respect to Fair Trade coffee. [EconLit citations: D120, Q130].

The authors study the effects of two simultaneous forms of complexity on the consistency of respondents' choices, i.e., the number of choice sets per questionnaire and the number of options per choice set. Their findings suggest that respondents' choices do vary with the amount of information given resulting in an optimal five options and six choice sets per survey.

Conjoint analysis reveals a significant proportion of respondents value nonprice attributes; medication and housing had the highest importance scores, followed by price and brand ownership. Cluster analysis of the part-worth utilities revealed three consumer segments: price conscious consumers-consumers focused on naturalness; and those focused on animal health. Segments do not appear to differ on the basis of socioeconomic and demographic profile of respondents. However, multiitem scales reflecting attitudes towards production systems vary significantly across segments. Price-conscious respondents show agreement with use of medication and express concern over quality. Respondents in the naturalness segment express concern over quality, locality of production and impact of production methods on own health.

Consumer data collected from a U.S. national online survey was used to estimate the factors helping explain consumers' willingness to purchase and pay a higher premium for two natural and regionally produced beef products: ground beef and USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) Choice rib eye steaks. Consumer preferences for natural and regionally produced beef are shown to be motivated by a combination of perceptions of personal benefits and altruistic factors. Additionally, the results of probit models indicate that the probability a consumer will pay more or less of a premium depends on purchase behavior and shopping location, stated importance of production attributes, awareness and interest in private and civic agricultural issues, in addition to some typical demographic variables such as income.

For the congressionally mandated Livestock and Meat Marketing Study, we modeled differences in levels and variances of cattle quality associated with particular marketing arrangements and valuation methods using fed cattle purchase data from 29 large U.S. beef packing plants for October 2002 through March 2005. Results indicate fed cattle procured through marketing agreements and packer ownership had higher and more consistent quality compared to other types of arrangements.

One of the newest and effective energy resources is biogas, which can be used in thermal energy, electric energy production, and as a vehicular fuel. This article shows the exploration of biogas production perspectives and potential to be used from agricultural products obtained in Latvia, of which corn ensilage is the most effective one. Since Latvia has huge areas of uncultivated farmland, these areas can be used for efficient corn growing, from which biogas would be obtained, and then reprocessed into electric energy. The statistics show that using 140 thousand hectares or 10% of the European Union agricultural spaces of Latvia for corn growing; the potential biogas gain would be at least 564 million m(3).

Using a very simple discrete choice experimental design, the authors aim (a) to provide an example of consumer research implementation in food-related NPD and to assess its marketing value, and (b) to evaluate the quality of the acquired consumer-related information for marketing decision-making in food consumer-led NPD processes against a number of criteria set in the relevant literature. Functionality is found to be a statistically significant attribute for all three children's snacks of the research design compared to other attributes such as flavor and price. Parents seem to perceive the functional snack alternative as offering greater utility as compared to its conventional (i.e., nonfunctional) counterpart. Overall, the authors conclude that, despite some inherent weaknesses, the advantage of the discrete choice methodology in connection with consumer-led food NPD lies in its ability to describe current consumer needs and desires realistically and to contribute to the optimization of existing products.

This investigation into the daily price seasonality in the U.S. cotton market is based on spot prices from Memphis and futures prices from the New York Cotton Exchange. The regression methodologies employ adjustments to control for undesirable properties in the error terms. There are three main conclusions. First, the close-to-close changes in the futures price and in the spot price exhibit a negative Monday effect. Second, it negative bad Monday effect is observed on Mondays using close-to-close prices. The effect is present during the weekend nontrading period and continues into trading on Mondays. Third, the negative bad Monday effect does not appear to weaken in close-to-close prices and during the weekend over the period examined (1987-2003).

As livestock producers adapt to rising feed costs, the prospect of incorporating dried distiller's grain with solubles (DDGS) at higher than traditional levels becomes an important consideration. Given prices for feedstuffs and supplies of DDGS that are outside the historical data range, forward-looking analyses of the agricultural economy (even those with explicit derived demands for livestock feed) are poorly equipped to represent the farm-and sector-level tradeoffs that will emerge. The authors' results indicate that DDGS demands are more responsive to price changes in energy-oriented feeds than protein, despite the predominant historic feeding use of DDGS as a protein supplement. They extend their empirical analysis to account for the role of heterogeneous DDGS feed quality, identifying this as a critical consideration for sector-level substitution patterns. The price elasticities they report from their two-stage farm-level feed mix simulation and sector-level cost function estimation offer a robust picture of feedstuffs substitution of the type necessary for understanding the livestock component of demand response in the biofuels era.

Previous empirical studies of generic dairy advertising focus only on the market of the advertised good, ignoring potential spill-over and feedback effects. We specify an LA/AIDS model of dairy demand, which allows consistent estimation of cross-price and cross-advertising effects across dairy product markets, and is flexible and satisfies the axioms of consumer theory. We use the non-linear 3SLS estimator to address endogenous prices and serial correlation, and conduct bootstrapping to generate empirical distributions of elasticity estimates. Results suggest that cross-market effects are economically and statistically important. Thus, econometric dairy demand models that ignore cross-advertising and cross-price effects are mis-specified.

However, significant increases in sales for the remaining exporters are likely to be observed only once the importer is confident that the outbreak is localized and contained. In March of 1997, Japan imposed an import ban on Taiwanese pork. At the time, Taiwan was supplying 41% of Japan's pork imports. The authors rely on the framework developed by Goldberg and Knetter (1999) and implement a generalized method of moments procedure to estimate the inverse residual demand elasticities of the current three largest exporting countries: United States, Canada, and Denmark. Structural change was investigated by adapting Qu and Perron's (2007) methodology that endogenizes the break dates. The authors found that foreign exporters were delayed by 2 years in making adjustments after Taiwan's exit. The ban on Taiwan's exports made the U. S. residual demand more inelastic and reinforced the case for U. S. market power. Denmark's reduction of market power may be due to their export product mix. [EconLit citations: L11; Q13].

However, unlike most previous studies that assume Bertrand-Nash pricing conduct, we solve for pricing conduct, assuming a leader follower (Stackelberg) framework, and joint-profit maximization (monopoly) conduct, in addition to the widely used Bertrand-Nash pricing conduct. Price-cost margins are computed using estimates from a random coefficients multinomial logit demand model. Our results indicate that demand for milk at the supermarket chain level is elastic. Consumers, moreover, are more price sensitive to whole milk than to skim milk. In terms of pricing conduct, our results indicate that the Stacke1berg game, where, for instance, the Albertsons supermarket chain leads and Safeway follows, best fits the data at hand. This model implies that, on average, 23% of retail prices are appropriated by supermarket chains when selling fluid milk. Moreover, in the case of Albertsons whole milk, 76% of the marketing margin is explained by the cost of processing and distribution of fluid milk, and 24% is explained by the exercise of market power. Approximately 52% of the marketing margin is due to the exercise of market power in the case of skim milk sold by Safeway, while 48% is due to the cost of processing and distribution.

A generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) process is used to estimate expected price and price volatility; price and Supply equations are estimated jointly. In addition to the standard GARCH model, several different symmetric, asymmetric, and nonlinear GARCH models are estimated. These models use different conditional variance specifications (linear or nonlinear) to grasp some additional empirical regularity of data like asymmetry. Asymmetric price volatility means that different volatility is recorded in the case of a fall in prices than an increase in prices by the same amount. The possible existence of asymmetry in the producer's price volatility gives useful information about market structure and possible market power. The empirical results indicate that among the estimated GARCH models the nonlinear asymmetric GARCH model (NAGARCH) seems to better describe producers' price volatility of the Greek broiler industry. Furthermore, the empirical findings show that price volatility is an important risk factor and broiler feed price is the most significant cost factor of the Supply response function. Finally, the model provides forecasts for quantity Supplied, producers' price, and price volatility. [EconLit. Classifications: Q110, C510, D200].

Data concerning macroeconomic conditionings as well as data coming from farms running farm accountancy - Polish FADN (Farm Accountancy Data Network) in the years 2004- 2006, where dairy cattle was the dominating direction of production (TF41) or a prevailing one, were used for the analysis). Farms were grouped according to an annual average number of kept cows into the following groups: up to 10, 10-20, 2040, 40-60 and above 60. The analysis of the milk orientated farms shows strong connections between the area of farms, employment as well as value of the property engaged at a farm. Together with the scale of production the share of fixed assets slightly decreases, while the level of indebtedness, especially long-term, increases. The investment possibilities of the farm also change. The dairy efficiency of cows shows a strong connection with the scale of production. Farms with the biggest scale of production obtain about 60% more milk from a cow per a year than farms keeping up to 10 cows. Productivity of the basic means of production (land, work and capital) depends heavily on the scale of production. It is especially observed in case of economic productivity of work, which at farms with the biggest scale of production is about 5-6 times higher than at farms with the smallest scale.

Oligopoly theory suggests that corn input and field equipment suppliers likely benefit from policies that support corn markets, such as U. S. biofuels policy, whereas meat companies likely lose. This study investigates the impact of biofuels policy on U. S. agribusiness stock prices. Corn futures prices are found to have had a structural change in November 2006, consistent with the expansion of U. S. biofuels policy support. A linear two-factor (S&P 500 and corn prices) equilibrium asset pricing model is estimated on two subsamples, one before and one after the estimated change point. Conditional heteroskedasticity in stock returns is accounted for using a GARCH(1,1) model. In the more recent period, corn price increases are found to have positive effects on excess stock returns for seed, fertilizer, and machinery companies, while the impact on meat companies is negative. The results may be interpreted as evidence that crop input suppliers gain from U. S. biofuels policies while meat processors lose. [EconLit citations: D43; L13; Q14].

In particular, they analyze the relationship between product quality and vertical integration. Although there is a long tradition in transaction cost theory of analyzing the determinants of make or buy decisions in manufacturing, surprisingly few empirical Studies have been conducted ill the agriculture and food and beverage industry. Likewise, although quality is a key competitive variable in many food sectors, only a few studies have analyzed quality in their models. The authors find that transaction costs and product quality provide a useful explanation of vertical integration in the wine industry in the Rioja DOCa. Wineries that produce high-quality wines are more likely to integrate vertically than those producing low-quality wines. They also find that the size of the winery significantly affects make or buy choices. Implications are explored for managers facing a governance mode choice. [EconLit Classifications: L220, Q130].

The study identifies four broad groupings of barriers to HACCP implementation, namely perceptions that HACCP is of questionable appropriateness to the firm, the scale of change required to achieve implementation, low priority given to enhancement of food safety controls, and financial constraints. The severity of these identified barriers differs significantly between firms that have implemented HACCP and those that have not. In particular, HACCP implementation is impeded significantly by barriers related to financial constraints. The most important driver promoting implementation is customer requirements for HACCP to be implemented in supplier facilities. [EconLit citations: D210, L600, L660].

Results suggest that production of organic crops and the regional location of the farm positively affect adoption of a DMS. Adoption of DMS, however, has a negative relation to large farms, farms with production contracts, and farms specializing in cash grains. Farms adopting a DMS are typically those with organic crops and those located in regions with access to a large metropolitan customer base.

The cost of meeting organic certification standards, however, has meant that supply has been slow to adjust. With limited supply, the authors hypothesize that organic suppliers enjoy more market power in bargaining over their share of the retail-production cost margin for fresh apples. We test this hypothesis using random parameters, generalized extreme value demand model (mixed logit) combined with a structural model of retail and wholesale pricing that allows conduct to vary by product attributes (organic or nonorganic) and time. They apply this model to data on wholesale prices of organic and nonorganic apples from Washington State, and retail data from five major metropolitan markets. They find that organic growers do indeed earn a larger share of the total margin than nonorganic growers, but this vertical market power is eroding over time as market supply adjusts.

To model the preferences, a random parameter logit model and a latent class model are estimated and compared. The comparison, based on predicted probability distribution, regression analysis of the probabilities, and investigation of the probability ratio, suggests that the latent class model is preferred to the random parameter logit model. Estimating a latent class model with three latent classes, using group dependent variables, i.e., class indicators, suggests that preferences may be characterized by food safety and animal welfare dimensions. Calculating the willingness to pay for the variables within each class, the author found that Class 1 is oriented towards animal welfare, Class 3 is oriented towards food safety, and Class 2 is intermediate of Class 1 and Class 3. Moreover, class membership and its implication for the assessment of organic pork are investigated. The respondents within the food safety-conscious'' class have a strong belief that organic food products are safer, though this class is also found to be the most price sensitive. The animal welfare-conscious'' respondents are also price sensitive, but to a lesser extent than the food safety-conscious consumers. Moreover, respondents that show a concern for animal welfare do not believe that organic pork is produced under more animal friendly conditions. The relatively large size of the animal welfare-conscious class and the negative perception of organic pork found in this group suggest that market opportunities exist for the marketing of animal welfare-certified products.

Alternative marketing agreement use resulted in improved beef Supply chain efficiency, product demand, and plant profitability. The slaughter and processing costs were lower for plants with higher volumes of AMA cattle relative to cash market cattle. Plants that slaughter cattle from AMA Sources operated at higher volumes. had less variable Volumes, and had lower average total costs per head because of the substantive economics of size. Plants that slaughter cattle from AMA Sources also had higher gross margins and average profits per head.

Due to safety-related uncertainties in the food supply chain, various regulatory safety and health policies are implemented to decrease potential harm to likely victims. The expected effect of these food-safety policies forecasted in terms of reduction in foodborne illnesses, mortality, and food-related diseases may be overstated if consumers' offsetting behavior is overlooked. Reduction and, in some cases, reversal of direct policy effect may occur. This research tests the presence of dominant or partial offsetting behavior in the preparation and consumption of vegetables if a food-safety policy such as the Pathogen Reduction/Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (PR/HACCP) is mandated in the vegetable sector.

We analyze the interaction between the microeconomic characteristics of firms and those of their environment because this interaction determines a multinational firm's decision to internalize trade. The empirical work is based on the 'industrial globalization' survey conducted by the French statistics institutes in 1993 and 1999. With regard to the French agri-food trade, there has been an increase in intra-firm (IFT) trade within the EU-15 borders and the European multinational networks. The main determinants of intra-firm trade are the firms' need to generate economies of scale and to protect and exploit their 'firm-specific advantages' related to the technology and nature of the product. The model sheds light on the role and the development of intra-regional networks of subsidiaries. [JEL classifications: F10, F14, F23].

There is a wide array of cash contracts with varying terms that pose strategic alternatives for buyers, particularly as they seek to use contracting as an element of risk mitigation. Durum is a crop where many issues and challenges are apparent. Durum is more risky than competing crops with greater price, yield, and quality risk. In contrast to competing crops, futures do not exist, cross hedging is poor, and forward contracting has been used minimally. The purpose of this study is to develop a model to analyze alternative contracting strategies in the case of durum wheat. The authors introduce alternative pricing features, and explore contract terms and analyze them in terms of risk and return to growers using stochastic efficiency with respect to a function. Results indicate that contracts reduce risks to growers, and are preferred to no contracting of durum. In general, the results varied across grower risk aversions.

Two types of dairy models are used for the study. The first one is a stylized mathematical model which is used to explore the relative trade effects of domestic price discrimination accompanied with revenue pooling mechanism versus border measures in dairy product markets. The second one is a partial equilibrium, multiple-region model of dairy policy and trade, which is used to see the empirical implication of domestic price discrimination for six major dairy producers. The analytical results identify the trading status as the key to determine the relative trade effects. While domestic price discrimination is always less trade distorting than border measures in a net-importer case, the relative trade distortiveness depends on the export volume in a net exporter case. The theoretical possibility that domestic price discrimination is more trade distorting than border measures is found when the ratio of dairy export to domestic manufacturing milk consumption is very high. The results also indicate that while the both support measures increase dairy export, domestic price discrimination may place greater economic burden on fluid milk consumers and less economic burden on tax payers than border measures. In addition, the results imply that domestic price discrimination schemes can be effective trade protective measures for Canada, Japan and the United States, where the schemes are currently being implemented.

(b) Have any returns to producers achieved been greater than the cost of the promotion? (c) What has been the effect of lamb promotion on the lamb import share? The first question is addressed through an econometric analysis of the U.S. retail demand for lamb, which takes into account the effects of lamb advertising and promotion expenditures. The results then are used to calculate a benefit-cost ratio for lamb promotion in answer to the second question. An econometric analysis of the import share of U.S. lamb consumption provides the basis for addressing the third question. Lamb promotion is found to have increased the demand for lamb, and particularly American lamb, generating in the process a highly positive return to producers relative to the small cost of the program.

We use the new model to analyze two types of policies. We first consider policies that would allow entrepreneurs to use a greater fraction of their total wealth in financing their projects, thus allowing them to reduce reliance on debt or equity finance by outside investors. We show that such policies may not be welfare-improving, because they expose entrepreneurs to more downside risk. This result highlights the importance of allowing for risk aversion, since policies that aim at alleviating inefficiencies associated with adverse selection may increase risk exposure and ultimately reduce welfare. We then consider how the tax treatment of losses affects social welfare. We show that if a society places a high value on distributional equity or if entrepreneurs are sufficiently risk-averse, a full-loss-offset system may be desirable even when there is excessive investment.","[da Costa, Carlos E.] Fundacao Getulio Vargas, Grad Sch Econ, BR-22250900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Escola de Pos-Graduacao em Economia (EPGE); Getulio Vargas Foundation,"da Costa, CE (通讯作者)，Fundacao Getulio Vargas, Grad Sch Econ, Praia Botafogo 190, BR-22250900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",carlos.eugenio@fgv.br,"Social, Inct/J-8669-2013",,,,,,19,0,0,0,16,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,DEC,2011,67.0,4,,,,,303,326,,10.1628/001522111X614141,0.0,,,24,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,882ZZ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299603700001,0

We also compare advertisements that are costless to voters with those that reduce voter payoffs.

However, the effect of information is less than that found in previous experimental studies where information is exogenously provided by the experimenter. Furthermore, we find that when advertising by winning candidates reduces voter payoffs, informed voters are less likely to participate, thus are turned off rather than turned out. Finally, we discover that candidates tend to overadvertise, and contrary to theoretical predictions, advertise significantly more when voting is voluntary than when it is compulsory.

We describe recent trends in crime and review the evidence showing that mental illness is a clear risk factor both for criminal behavior and victimization. We summarize the development of a number of new pharmaceutical therapies for the treatment of mental illness that can le into wide use during the great American crime decline. We examine limited international data, as well as more detailed American data, to assess the relationship between rates of prescriptions of psychotropic drugs and crime rates, while controlling for other factors that may explain trends in crime rates. Using state-level variation in the rates that various drug therapies disperse within populations to identify impacts on crime rates, we find some evidence that the expansion of psychiatric drugs is associated with decreased violent crime rates, but not property crime rates. We find no robust impacts on homicide rates and no effects on arrest rates. Further, the magnitudes of the estimated effects of expanded drug treatment on violent-crime are small. Our estimates imply that about 5 percent of the decline in crime during the period of our study was due to expanded mental health treatment.

Convergence should particularly focus on (i) the issue of the presence of politicians on decision-making bodies; (ii) the need for clearly defining dismissal procedures of heads of supervision; (iii) autonomy from government in regulatory matters; (iv) supervisory autonomy in matters of licensing and withdrawing licenses; (iv) mechanisms for judicial accountability; (v) legal protection for supervisors handling in good faith.

Among our findings are significant gender gaps between male- and female-owned companies in terms of firm size, but much smaller gaps in terms of firm efficiency and growth (except in LA). Part of the reason women run smaller firms is that they tend to concentrate in sectors in which firms are smaller and less efficient (in ECA and SSA). By contrast, we find no evidence of gender discrimination in access to formal finance in any of the three regions, although in ECA women are less likely than men to seek formal finance.

ETR involves a shift in the target of taxation away from labour or firms towards pollution or the use of natural resources, in such a way that overall tax revenues are unchanged. It is hoped that such a tax shift will deliver environmental improvements while having a neutral or positive effect on the economy. The modelling was set up to explore the extent to which this would be the case. The paper starts with a brief literature review identifying the theoretical hypotheses relating to ETR and summarising the results of some of the evaluations of ETRs that have been implemented. It then briefly describes the model used for the analysis in this paper. The main body of the paper then describes the scenarios set up to explore the main impacts and the results of modelling these scenarios. These results suggest that substantial reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can be achieved with minimal impacts on output and an overall increase in employment, such that ETR emerges as a very attractive policy for GHG emission reduction.","[Ekins, Paul] UCL, UCL Energy Inst, London WCIH ONN, England; [Summerton, Philip; Thoung, Chris; Lee, Daniel] Cambridge Econometr, Cambridge, England",University of London; University College London,"Ekins, P (通讯作者)，UCL, UCL Energy Inst, Cent House,14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WCIH ONN, England.",p.ekins@ucl.ac.uk,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/I02929X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/G007748/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/I02929X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; NERC [NE/G007748/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,17,23,26,1,54,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We find that the corporate bond market has repeatedly suffered clustered default events much worse than those experienced during the Great Depression. For example, during the railroad crisis of 1873-1875, total defaults amounted to 36% of the par value of the entire corporate bond market. Using a regime-switching model, we examine the extent to which default rates can be forecast by financial and macroeconomic variables. We find that stock returns, stock return volatility, and changes in GDP are strong predictors of default rates. Surprisingly, however, credit spreads are not. Over the long term, credit spreads are roughly twice as large as default losses, resulting in an average credit risk premium of about 80 basis points. We also find that credit spreads do not adjust in response to realized default rates. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We use the cyclical volatility model to generate out-of-sample forecasts of exchange rate volatility for horizons of up to 1 year under the assumption that the long run trend is fully persistent. As a benchmark, we compare the forecasts of the cyclical volatility model with those of the range-based EGARCH and FIEGARCH models of Brandt and Jones (2006).

The 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the follow-up 2008 Accra Agenda for Action have focused attention on common donor practices that reduce the development impact of aid. Using 18 underlying indicators that capture these practices-derived from the OECD-DAC's Survey for Monitoring the Paris Declaration, the new AidData database, and the DAC aid tables-the authors construct an overall aid quality index and four coherently defined sub-indexes on aid selectivity, alignment, harmonization, and specialization. Compared with earlier indicators used in donor rankings, this indicator set is more comprehensive and representative of the range of donor practices addressed in the Paris Declaration, improving the validity, reliability, and robustness of rankings. One of the innovations is to increase the validity of the aid quality indicators by adjusting for recipient characteristics, donor aid volumes, and other factors. Despite these improvements in data and methodology, the authors caution against overinterpretation of overall indexes such as these. Alternative plausible assumptions regarding weights or the inclusion of additional indicators can still produce marked shifts in the ranking of some donors, so that small differences in overall rankings are not meaningful. Moreover, because the performance of some donors varies considerably across the four sub-indexes, these sub-indexes may be more useful than the overall index in identifying donors' relative strengths and weaknesses.

There have been many national and local initiatives to promote walking and cycling, but without a long term vision and consistent strategy it is difficult to see how a significant change may be achieved. This paper presents three alternative visions for the role of walking and cycling in urban areas for the year 2030: each vision illustrates a 'desirable' walking- and cycling-oriented transport system against a different 'exogenous social background'. These visions have been developed through a process of expert discussion and review and are intended to provide a stimulus for debate on the potential for and desirability of such alternative futures. Each is based on the UK and represents a substantial change to the current situation: in particular, each of the visions presents a view of a society where walking and cycling are considerably more important than is currently the case and where these modes cater for a much higher proportion of urban transport needs than at present. The visions show pictures of urban environments where dependence on motor vehicles has been reduced, in two of the visions to very low levels. The methodological approach for devising visions is informed by work on 'utopian thinking': a key concept underlying this approach is one of viewing the future in social constructivist terms (i.e. the future is what 'we', as a society, make it) rather than considering the future as something that can be 'scientifically' predicted by the extrapolation of current trends.

J,"Wheelock, DC",,,,"Wheelock, David C.",,,Banking Industry Consolidation and Market Structure: Impact of the Financial Crisis and Recession,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ST LOUIS REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The number of U.S. commercial banks and savings institutions declined by 12 percent between December 31, 2006, and December 31, 2010, continuing a consolidation trend begun in the mid-1980s. Banking industry consolidation has been marked by sharply higher shares of deposits held by the largest banks the 10 largest banks now hold nearly 50 percent of total U.S. deposits. However, antitrust policy is predicated on the assumption that banking markets are local in nature, and enforcement has focused on preventing bank mergers from increasing the concentration of local banking markets. The author finds little change over time in the average concentration of local banking markets or the average number of dominant banks in them, even during the recent financial crisis and recession when numerous bank failures and several large bank mergers occurred. Concentration did not increase substantially, on average, in markets where mergers occurred among banks when both the acquiring and acquired banks had existing local offices, though rural markets generally saw larger increases in concentration from such mergers than did urban markets. Although the structures of local banking markets, on average, have changed little since the mid-1980s, deposit concentration has continued to increase at the level of U.S. Census regions. As technology evolves and the costs of obtaining banking services from distant providers fall further, local market characteristics may become less relevant for analysis of competition in banking.

In the empirical work, three environmental pollutants are considered, using two alternative methods with two sets of Chinese data. CO2 emissions could not be studied because of data limitations. The hypothesis that the use of coal can be reconciled with the environment through declined emission intensity is confirmed by the empirical tests. The decreases in emission intensity are driven by the application of clean coal technologies, which can be encouraged by appropriate regulations and incentives and have both environmental and economic benefits. Therefore it is critical that appropriate legal and fiscal regimes be formulated and that the development and utilization of high-efficiency and clean coal technologies be promoted. The paper also suggests that the use of coal could continue to be reconciled with concern for the environment, even while considering CO2 emissions.","Econ Res Inst ASEAN & E Asia, ERIA Annex Off, Senayan 10270, Jakarta Pusat, Indonesia",,"Shi, XP (通讯作者)，Econ Res Inst ASEAN & E Asia, ERIA Annex Off, 6th Floor Sentral Senyan 2,Jl Asia Afrika 8, Senayan 10270, Jakarta Pusat, Indonesia.",xunpeng.shi@gmail.com,"Xunpeng, Roc Shi/I-5486-2019","Xunpeng, Roc Shi/0000-0001-9653-7395",,,,,50,13,14,0,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Moreover, most of the existing approaches are based on a limiting argument in which all variables become large at the same rate. In this paper, we show how the conditional approach of Heffernan and lawn (2004) can be implemented to model extremal dependence between financial time series.

The incorporation of on-the-job search substantially improves the ability of the Mortensen and Pissarides model to explain the effect of growth on labor market variables.

Moreover, a borrower who migrates 190 miles from his state of birth is 17% more likely to default and 15% more likely to file for bankruptcy, while a borrower who continues to live in his state of birth is 14% and 10% less likely to default and file for bankruptcy, respectively.

Second, prior to August 2007, the spread was broadly insensitive to key borrower characteristics, whereas afterward it became somewhat more reactive to measures of creditworthiness.

We show that CDS, and the empty creditors they give rise to, have important ex ante commitment benefits: By strengthening creditors' bargaining power, they raise the debtor's pledgeable income and help reduce the incidence of strategic default. However, we also show that lenders will over-insure in equilibrium, giving rise to an inefficiently high incidence of costly bankruptcy.

Higher turnover has been associated with more frequent smaller trades, which have progressively formed a larger fraction of trading volume over time. Evidence indicates that secular decreases in trading costs have influenced the turnover trend. Turnover has increased the most for stocks with the greatest level of institutional holdings, suggesting professional investing as a key contributor to the turnover trend. Variance ratio tests suggest that more institutional trading has increased information-based trading. Intraday volatility has decreased and prices conform more closely to random walk in recent years. The sensitivity of turnover to past returns has increased and cross-sectional predictability of returns has decreased significantly, revealing a more widespread use of quantitative trading strategies that allow for more efficient securities prices.

However, a net moral hazard effect obtains only if the two players' responses to exogenous shocks fail to neutralize each other, entailing a negative relationship between child's effort and parental LTC coverage. We focus on outcomes out of equilibrium, interpreting them as a break in the relationship resulting in no informal care provided and hence high probability nursing home admission. Changes in the parent's initial wealth, LTC subsidy received, and child's expected inheritance are shown to induce net moral hazard, in contradistinction to changes in child's opportunity cost and share in the bequest.","[Courbage, Christophe] Geneva Assoc, Geneva, Switzerland; [Zweifel, Peter] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Courbage, C (通讯作者)，Geneva Assoc, Geneva, Switzerland.",christophe_courbage@genevaassociation.org; peter.zweifel@econ.uzh.ch,,"Courbage, Christophe/0000-0002-2554-0228",,,,,14,20,22,2,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

Participants are asked to choose between different ways for choosing which numbers to bet on for a gamble. They can choose the numbers themselves (control), let the experimenter choose (no control), or randomize. Classical economic theories predict indifference among the three methods. I found that participants exhibit strict preference for control, preference for no control, and preference for randomization. These preferences are robust as participants are willing to pay a small amount of money to implement their preferred method. Most participants believe that the winning probability under different methods is the same. This result contributes to the literature by clarifying that for most participants who exhibit preference for control, their preference is not due to illusion of control, but by source preference. Participants invest less in the risky gamble when they are not offered their preferred method.","Max Planck Inst Econ, Strateg Interact Grp, D-07745 Jena, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Li, KK (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Econ, Strateg Interact Grp, Kahlaische Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",Kingli@econ.mpg.de,"King, Li King/K-3000-2019","LI, King King/0000-0002-9454-3780",,,,,15,7,10,1,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

Unlike standard regression approaches this approach allows us to identify specific distributional characteristics such as polarisation and stratification. The period between 1965 and 1997 exhibits the formation of two convergence clubs: one at 50% and another at 125% of the national average income. Income disparities across the states declined over the 1960s and then increased from the 1970s to the nineties. Conditioning exercises reveal that the observed polarisation is associated with the disparate distribution of infrastructure. In particular, education, the extent of irrigation and literacy are found to be associated with the formation of the lower convergence club.","Univ Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Bandyopadhyay, S (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",,,,,,,,37,29,30,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

A stated choice experiment for the Netherlands,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,HST; Location choice; Firms; Office location; Accessibility,TRANSPORT,"High-speed rail is seen as a factor contributing to the attractiveness of a location for economic activities. This paper focuses on how the level-of-service characteristics of railway stations, and in particular the presence of high-speed train services, influence the attractiveness of locations for specific types of offices. The results are presented for a stated choice experiment for location choices of offices in the Netherlands. It is concluded that the availability of high-speed train services contributes to the attractiveness of a location for offices. For internationally-oriented offices the areas around stations with international high-speed train services are attractive because of their good international accessibility. We also found an indication that high-speed train services can raise the status of an office site. In the Netherlands, the domestic high-speed train services are less relevant for location choices, because of the small domestic distances. Besides high-speed train services, other location characteristics that determine how well a site is connected to the railway network are also found to be important for location choices. Thereby differences between offices occur, which can partly be explained by the number of trips to/from an office. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, empirical studies face two challenges: heterogeneous behavioral responses and unobservable resource abundance. This paper addresses these two problems simultaneously by using an unusual data set and an estimation technique developed in the industrial organization literature. We apply the methods to location and species choices in the Gulf of Mexico reef-fish fishery. The models are used to explore spatial effort substitution in response to two marine reserves. Individual attributes from a survey of vessel captains are linked to each fisherman's observed daily trip information to control for observable heterogeneity. Some unobservable abundance information is captured by location- and species-specific constants and estimated by contraction mapping. The empirical results confirm that there is significant heterogeneity in fishermen's response to the formation of marine reserves. They also show that ignoring unobservable abundance information will lead to significant bias in predicting spatial fishing effort.","[Zhang, Junjie] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Int Relat & Pacific Studies, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Smith, Martin D.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Smith, Martin D.] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Duke University; Duke University,"Zhang, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Int Relat & Pacific Studies, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",junjiezhang@ucsd.edu; marsmith@duke.edu,"; Smith, Martin/D-9168-2016","Zhang, Junjie/0000-0002-0716-3828; Smith, Martin/0000-0002-4714-463X",,,,,39,20,23,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We introduce a new approach to testing this hypothesis by examining changes in discount levels following distributions of dividends and capital gains. Since distributions reduce future shareholder tax liabilities, the tax liability hypothesis implies that closed-end fund discounts should decline following distributions. Focusing on changes in discounts isolates this tax effect by eliminating the impact of other fund-specific factors on discount levels. Our results support the tax liability hypothesis, showing that short-run fluctuations in discounts are directly affected by taxable distributions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Such a funding-liquidity crisis gives rise to bases, that is, price gaps between securities with identical cash-flows but different margins. In the time series, bases depend on the shadow cost of capital, which can be captured through the interest-rate spread between collateralized and uncollateralized loans and, in the cross-section, they depend on relative margins.

However, the CPI-W may not accurately reflect the experience of retirees for two reasons. First, retirees generally have higher medical expenses than workers, and medical costs, in recent years, have tended to rise faster than the prices of other goods. Second, even if medical costs did not rise faster than the prices of other goods, as retirees aged, their medical spending would still tend to increase as a share of income; that is, each cohort of retirees would still see a decline in the real income available for non-medical spending. We show that, for in the 1918 birth cohort, Social Security benefits net of average out-of-pocket medical expenses have declined relative to a price index for non-medical goods by around 20 percent for men, and by around 27 percent for women.

We examine the impact of these regulatory changes on market discipline during the period 1995-2009. The price of deposits is used to measure market discipline in a dynamic panel data methodology on a sample of 104 commercial banks. We find a weakening of market discipline following the introduction of the BGS. The result is consistent with the deposit insurance scheme being credible in the lower capital requirement environment. The adoption of LG in a recovering economy also mitigates the role of market discipline. However, market discipline is more pronounced in listed banks than unlisted banks and in foreign banks than domestic banks. These results have important implications for banking regulation and supervision, particularly during a crisis period. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Generalized method of moments is implemented to address the endogeneity of private health insurance, and the nonnegativity and the discreteness of physician services use. The results indicate that the moral hazard effect varies considerably across disease-specific specialist care. The strongest moral hazard (for no-condition related specialist visits) is almost twice the moral hazard effect of the weakest (for chronic condition related specialist visits). Although the findings indicate some variation in the moral hazard effect across disease-specific general practitioner visits, the variation is less considerable. The main policy implication is that optimal insurance for physician services should be designed to have differential cost sharing based on disease status rather than to have uniform cost sharing.","[Koc, Cagatay] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Econ, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Koc, Cagatay] Fed Trade Commiss, Bur Econ, Washington, DC 20580 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington,"Koç, Ç (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Econ, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.",ckoc@uta.edu,,,,,,,84,14,15,0,26,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,,,J RISK INSUR,J.

This paper finds that when an administration's time is almost up, submissions of economically significant regulations nearly double. Such surges in regulatory activity decrease the duration of regulatory review at the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), likely because of political pressure to quickly approve new rules. Specifically, one additional economically significant regulation submitted to OIRA decreases the mean review time for all regulations by about two thirds of a day. If OIRA review improves regulation quality, then regulatory surges that decrease review time could hinder such improvement.","Fed Railroad Adm, US Dept Transport, Washington, DC 20590 USA",,"McLaughlin, PA (通讯作者)，Fed Railroad Adm, US Dept Transport, 1200 New Jersey Ave SE, Washington, DC 20590 USA.",econpatrick@gmail.com,,,,,,,11,12,12,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUN,2011,147.0,3-4,,,,,395,412,,10.1007/s11127-010-9635-4,0.0,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,756RD,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290031500008,0

The article applies a non-parametric approach, i.e. data envelopment analysis (DEA), to assess the relative technical efficiency of higher education across selected countries. When estimating the efficiency frontier we focus on measures of quantities outputs/outcomes. The results show that the relatively high public expenditure per student in Croatia should have resulted in a better performance regarding the outputs/outcomes, i.e. a higher rate of higher education school enrolment, a greater rate of labor force with a higher education and a lower rate of the unemployed who have tertiary education. On the other hand, regardless of the input-output/outcome mix, the higher education system in Slovenia is shown to have a much higher level of efficiency compared to both Croatia and many other comparable new EU member states and OECD countries.","[Aristovnik, Aleksander] Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Obadic, Alka] Univ Zagreb, Zagreb 41000, Croatia",University of Ljubljana; University of Zagreb,"Aristovnik, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",aleksander.aristovnik@fu.uni-lj.si,"Aristovnik, Aleksander/B-4642-2010; Obadic, Alka/H-9836-2018","Aristovnik, Aleksander/0000-0003-1345-9649; Obadic, Alka/0000-0002-8915-8853",,,,,40,43,45,0,34,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2011,13.0,30,,,,,362,376,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,860DP,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000297929000003,0

The first part of the paper describes and compares the offer of entrepreneurship education in both universities. This analysis reveals the increasing interest in introducing and promoting entrepreneurship education since the implementation of the Bologna educational process started. The second part of the paper investigates the entrepreneurial intentions among graduates at both academic institutions. This empirical research is based on two surveys carried out among 93 graduates of the US and 98 graduates of the AES in 2010. Following the hypotheses of Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behaviour, Personal Attitudes towards starting-up and Perceived Behavioural Control -self-efficacy perception- are studied as primary antecedents of the entrepreneurial intention. The analysis reveals the existence of higher entrepreneurial intentions for the AES. This seems to be due to more positive personal attitudes towards entrepreneurship for the graduates at the AES, whereas no significant differences in self-efficacy can be appreciated.","[Romero, Isidoro] Univ Seville, Seville, Spain; [Petrescu, Raluca Mariana; Balalia (Iosif), Alina Elena] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",University of Sevilla; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Romero, I (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Seville, Spain.",isidoro@us.es,"Grosu, Raluca Mariana/I-5331-2017; Iosif, Alina-Elena/B-4435-2015; Romero, Isidoro/E-8160-2010","Grosu, Raluca Mariana/0000-0003-4246-2433; Romero, Isidoro/0000-0001-8764-2599",,,,,34,17,17,1,52,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2011,13.0,30,,,,,347,361,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,860DP,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000297929000002,0

The wave of consolidation and the rapid increase in market concentration that took place in most countries has generated concerns about the rise in banks' market power and its potential effects on consumers. This paper advances the existing literature by testing the market power (Structure-Conduct-Performance and Relative Market Power) and efficient structure (X- and scale efficiency) hypotheses for a sample of over 2500 bank observations in nine Latin American countries over 1997-2005. We use the Data Envelopment Analysis technique to obtain reliable efficiency measures. We produce evidence supporting the efficient structure hypotheses. The findings are particularly robust for the largest banking markets in the region, namely Brazil, Argentina, and Chile. Finally, capital ratios and bank size seem to be among the most important factors in explaining higher than normal profits for Latin American banks.","[Chortareas, Georgios E.] Univ Athens, Dept Econ, Athens 10559, Greece; [Garza-Garcia, Jesus G.] Banco Mexico, Direct Financial Stabil, Mexico City 06059, DF, Mexico; [Girardone, Claudia] Univ Essex, Essex Business Sch, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; Bank of Mexico; University of Essex,"Chortareas, GE (通讯作者)，Univ Athens, Dept Econ, 8 Pesmazoglou St, Athens 10559, Greece.",gchortar@econ.uoa.gr; jgarza@banxico.org.mx; cgirardone@essex.ac.uk,,"Girardone, Claudia/0000-0002-7347-7526",,,,,47,50,56,2,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We use dollar-weighted returns (a form of Internal Rate of Return (IRR)) to assess the properties of actual investor returns on hedge funds and compare them to buy-and-hold fund returns. Our main finding is that annualized dollar-weighted returns are on the magnitude of 3% to 7% lower than corresponding buy-and-hold fund returns. Using factor models of risk and the estimated dollar-weighted performance gap, we find that the real alpha of hedge fund investors is close to zero. In absolute terms, dollar-weighted returns are reliably lower than the return on the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 index, and are only marginally higher than the risk-free rate as of the end of 2008.

We examine and reconcile different stylized factors in returns that contribute to the SRTR scaling distortions. In complementing the use of the variance ratio test, we propose a new intuitive subsampling-based test for the overall validity of the SRTR. The results indicate that serial dependence and heavy-tailedness may severely bias the applicability of SRTR, while jumps or volatility clustering may be less relevant. To mitigate the first-order effect from time dependence, we suggest a simple modified-SRTR for scaling tail risks. By examining 47 markets globally, we find the SRTR to be lenient, in that it generally yields downward-biased 10-day and 30-day VaRs, particularly in Eastern Europe, Central-South America, and the Asia Pacific. Nevertheless, accommodating the dependence correction is a notable improvement over the traditional SRTR. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Three results stand out. First, neither urban systems models nor new economic geography models imply a robust prediction for the impact of trade openness on spatial concentration. Whether trade promotes concentration or dispersion depends on subtle modelling choices among which it is impossible to adjudicate a priori. Second, empirical evidence mirrors the theoretical indeterminacy: a majority of cross-country studies find no significant effect of openness on urban concentration or regional inequality. Third, the available models predict that, other things equal, regions with inherently less costly access to foreign markets, such as border or port regions, stand to reap the largest gains from trade liberalisation. This prediction is confirmed by the available evidence. Whether trade liberalisation raises or lowers regional inequality therefore depends on each country's specific geography.","[Bruelhart, Marius] Univ Lausanne, DEEP, Ecole HEC, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Bruelhart, Marius] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London SW1Y 6LA, England",University of Lausanne; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Brülhart, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, DEEP, Ecole HEC, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",Marius.Brulhart@unil.ch,"Brulhart, Marius/B-8633-2008","Brulhart, Marius/0000-0001-5483-0219",,,,,64,60,69,1,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Using proprietary loan-level data for U.S. commercial banks, I find that, on average, mergers reduce loan spreads, with the magnitude of the reduction being larger when postmerger cost savings increase. My results suggest that the relation between spreads and the extent of the market overlap between merging banks is nonmonotonic. The market overlap increases cost savings and consequently lowers spreads, but when the overlap is sufficiently large, spreads increase, potentially due to the market-power effect dominating the cost savings. Furthermore, the average reduction in spreads is significant for small businesses.

We combine stochastic hydrometeorological crop-loss models with a regionalized computable general equilibrium model to estimate losses for the full distribution of possible weather events in Malawi. Results indicate that, based on repeated sampling from historical events, at least 1.7 per cent of Malawi's gross domestic product (GDP) is lost each year due to the combined effects of droughts and floods.

Although this debate is theoretically well documented, the empirics seem to lag behind the theory. In this article, we contribute to this literature by adding enlightening evidence on the issue. More precisely, we relate the growth experiences of countries which had relatively similar economic structures in the late 1970s, with changes occurring in these countries' structures between 1979 and 2003. The results reveal a robust relationship between structure and (labor) productivity growth, and lend support to the view that producing (though not user) ICT-related industries are strategic branches of economic activity.","[Teixeira, Aurora A.

The data consisted of 79 semi-structured interviews with school children aged 12-13 and 15-16 years old from rural and urban areas in Sabah, Malaysia. According to them, poverty is mainly economic. Their responses about the causes of poverty can be categorised as individualistic, structural, fatalistic and other factors (such as age, geography, land and encouragement). Older respondents from rural and urban areas gave more individualistic and structural attributions compared to the younger respondents. While they believed that government is most responsible to help the poor, other parties such as the poor, public and NGO's should also work together to alleviate poverty. They suggested that these parties can contribute in terms of donation, infrastructural improvement, education, attitudinal change and job opportunities. Respondents acknowledged that hard work and education are important to improve their standard of living. However, education is regarded as a ticket to seek their fortune elsewhere.

During the 1970s, $1.00 of issuance resulted in $0.23 of cash savings; over the most recent decade, $1.00 of issuance resulted in $0.60 of cash savings. This increase is caused by increasing precautionary motives. Proxies for precautionary motives increase over the sample period, and firm-level increases in these proxies are associated with firm-level increases in share issuance-cash savings. Share issuance-cash savings are inversely related to issuance costs, suggesting that firms issue and save when costs are low, so as to avoid issuing when costs are high. This framework can also help explain patterns and trends in share issuance activity over time.

Like some previous studies we used a GARCH stochastic volatility approach, employing not only traditional discrete time GARCH models but also using a COGARCH - a newly developed continuous-time GARCH model which allows for a rigorous analysis of unequally spaced data. When a risk-return relationship symmetric to positive or negative returns is postulated, a significant risk premium of the order of 7-8% p.a., consistent with previously published estimates, is obtained. When the model includes an asymmetry effect, the estimated risk premium, still around 7% p.a., becomes insignificant. These results are robust to the use of a value weighted or equally weighted index. The COGARCH model properly allows for unequally spaced time series data. As a sidelight, the model estimates that, during the period from 1953 to 2007, the weekend is equivalent, in volatility terms, to about 0.3-0.5 regular trading days. (c) 2010 Elsevier BM.

This paper contrasts this theory with recent case evidence from the Caribbean and the Middle-East. The former represents the mature exotic type beach holiday while the latter is a fast developing religious, cultural and multi-product form of tourism. In both cases multi-step relationships exist between the development of air transport policy and the number of incoming visitors. The strength and significance of these interrelationships are tested using two separate best-fit Structural Equation Models (SEMs) based on a panel data set of a selection of endogenous and exogenous variables for the period 2000-2007. It is found that, despite both regions' continued government participation in national carriers, only in the Caribbean has this appeared to have resulted in the expected dampening effect on tourism output, whereas a reverse effect was found for the sample of Middle-Eastern states. Focussing on their formidable hub-and-spoke networks, state owned and vertically integrated Middle-Eastern carriers are still encouraged to offer competitive fare and service levels to capture 6th freedom traffic with the growing number of long-stay visitors being one of the main beneficiaries of this.

We focus on children aged between 5 and 15 as the literature suggests that self-control develops within such age range. We ask each child to toss a fair coin in private and to record the outcome (white or black) on a paper sheet. We only reward children who report white. Although we are unable to tell whether each child was honest or not, we speculate about the proportion of reported white outcomes. Children report the prize-winning outcome at rates statistically above 50% but below 100%. Moreover, the probability of cheating is uniform across groups based on child's characteristics, in particular age. In a second treatment we explicitly tell children not to cheat. This request has a dampening effect on their tendency to over-report the prize-winning outcome, especially in girls. Furthermore, while this effect in boys is constant with age, in girls it tends to decrease with age. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We explore a potential biological basis of risk-taking variation within and between the sexes by studying how the ratio between the length of the second and fourth fingers (2D:4D) predicts risk-taking. A smaller 2D:4D ratio has been linked to higher exposure to prenatal testosterone relative to estradiol, with men having lower ratios than women. In financially motivated decision-making tasks, we find that men and women with smaller 2D:4D ratios chose significantly riskier options. We further find that the ratio partially explains the variation in risk-taking between the sexes. Moreover, for men and women at the extremes of the digit-ratio distribution the difference in risk-taking disappears. Thus, the 2D:4D ratio partially explains variation in financial risk-taking behavior within and between sexes and offers evidence of a biological basis for risk-taking behavior.","[Slonim, Robert] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Garbarino, Ellen] Univ Sydney, Dept Mkt, Fac Econ & Business, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Sydnor, Justin] Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Sch Business, Actuarial Sci Risk Management & Insurance Dept, Madison, WI USA",University of Sydney; University of Sydney; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Slonim, R (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",E.garbarino@usyd.edu.au; Roberts@econ.usyd.edu.au; jsydnor@bus.wisc.edu,,"Slonim, Robert/0000-0002-9513-4970",,,,,57,78,90,0,73,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

We assume the upstream monopolist can select either a two-part or a one-part tariff pricing strategy. It is found that if the upstream firm adopts a two-part (one-part) tariff pricing strategy, then the market price of the final good under a tariff will be higher (lower) than that under an equivalent quota; that is, the quota is set at the import level under the tariff regime. This result stands in stark contrast to the prior findings of both Hwang and Mai (1988) and Fung (1989). Moreover, if the quota rent is set as being equal to the tariff revenue, the social welfare under a tariff will necessarily be lower than that under an equivalent quota.","[Peng, Cheng-Hau] Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Dept Econ, Hsinchuang 24205, Taipei County, Taiwan; [Hwang, Hong; Kao, Kuo-Feng] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 100, Taiwan; [Hwang, Hong] Acad Sinica, RCHSS, Taipei, Taiwan",Fu Jen Catholic University; National Taiwan University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Peng, CH (通讯作者)，Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Dept Econ, 510 Chung Cheng Rd, Hsinchuang 24205, Taipei County, Taiwan.",echong@ntu.edu.tw; d95323011@ntu.edu.tw; chpon@mail.fju.edu.tw,"Kao, Kuo-Feng/JXM-1330-2024","Kao, Kuo-Feng/0000-0002-2763-6565; Hwang, Hong/0000-0001-5103-8947; Peng, Cheng-Hau/0000-0002-7522-7002",,,,,21,4,4,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1363-6669,,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

I find that option introduction alleviates 79% of the price adjustment efficiency disparity between short-sale constrained and unconstrained stocks in relation to negative news. No significant improvement in adjustment efficiency is found in response to positive information. These results are robust to controls for endogeneity biases associated with the option introduction selection process. Further, I find evidence that post-option improvement in efficiency is similar in relation to private and public information. This suggests that short-sale constraint effects stem, at least in part, from an irrational, optimism bias or another behavioral source as suggested theoretically by Miller (1977). Collectively, these results suggest that options act as an effective substitute to short-sales, significantly contributing to the informational efficiency of the market. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Such skills and social connections could give experienced founders some advantage in the process of raising venture capital. This paper uses a large database of venture-backed companies and their founders to examine the advantage associated with prior founding experience. Compared with novice entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs with venture-backed founding experience tend to raise more venture capital at an early round of financing and tend to complete the early round much more quickly. In contrast, experienced founders whose earlier firms were not venture-backed do not show a similar advantage over novice entrepreneurs, suggesting the importance of connections with venture capitalists in the early stage of venture capital financing. However, when the analysis also takes into account later rounds of financing, all entrepreneurs with prior founding experience appear to raise more venture capital. This implies that skills acquired from any previous founding experience can make an entrepreneur perform better and in turn attract more venture capital.","Clark Univ, Dept Econ, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",Clark University,"Zhang, JF (通讯作者)，Clark Univ, Dept Econ, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",juzhang@clarku.edu,,,,,,,84,106,136,7,114,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The focus is on the composition of equity and debt in funding such assets. In contrast, the balance sheet management of financial intermediaries reveals that it is equity that behaves like the predetermined variable, and the asset size of the bank or financial intermediary is determined by the degree of leverage that is permitted by market conditions. The relative stickiness of equity reveals possible nonpecuniary benefits to bank owners so that they are reluctant to raise new equity, even during boom periods when raising equity is associated with less stigma and, hence, smaller discounts. We explore the empirical evidence for both market-based financial intermediaries such as the Wall Street investment banks, as well as the commercial bank subsidiaries of the large U.S. bank holding companies.

Transmission elasticity from energy to agricultural commodity prices of 0.20 is estimated for the 1960-2005 period. The econometric evidence confirms that the elasticity increased considerably when the post-2005 boom years were included in the analysis.

The rationale for intervention is discussed as related to both efficiency and equity considerations. Efficiency considerations include: public goods, externalities, countervail for market power and asymmetric information. Support to Canadian agriculture presents evidence of direct support and support through market development and return to research studies. Several different aspects of support to Canadian agriculture are presented, including producers subsidy equivalents, rates of stabilization, rates of income enhancement, rates of return to investments into agriculture, capitalization of government payments into agricultural land. Much of the discussion is by commodity. The results suggest that direct government intervention into Canadian agriculture has been increasing over time but that there is a wide variation across commodities. Direct intervention is also moving away for commodity specific intervention to a more whole farm approach. This is partly explained by the desire of the Canadian government to move towards more decoupled programs to be compliant with international agricultural trade commitments. Results also suggest that stabilization is reasonably effective by commodity group but there is a wide variation across commodities. The overall rate of return of government support to landlords is lower than rate of return to agriculture due to research investments, indicating that a reallocation of government support from direct payments to research and development activities would increase overall returns to Canadian agriculture.","[Clark, J.

As the descendants of Mexican immigrants assimilate into American society and often intermarry with non-Mexicans, ethnic identification weakens, particularly among the children produced by Mexican intermarriages. This process of ethnic leakage is highly selective, because Mexican Americans who intermarry tend to have much higher education and earnings than Mexican Americans who do not intermarry. Consequently, available data for third- and higher-generation Mexicans, who usually can only be identified by their subjective responses to questions about Hispanic ethnicity, understate the socioeconomic attainment of this population. In effect, through the selective nature of intermarriage and ethnic identification, some of the most successful descendants of Mexican immigrants assimilate to such an extent that they fade from empirical observation. We present several pieces of evidence that are consistent with this story.","[Duncan, Brian] Univ Colorado, Denver, CO 80202 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver,"Duncan, B (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Denver, CO 80202 USA.",brian.duncan@ucdenver.edu; trejo@austin.utexas.edu,,,NICHD [5R03HD050574-02]; University of Texas at Austin [5R24HD042849],NICHD(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); University of Texas at Austin,This research was supported by NICHD grants 5R03HD050574-02 to Stephen Trejo and 5R24HD042849 to the Population Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin.,,90,20,23,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4419-6681-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,285,+,,10.1007/978-1-4419-6682-7_14,0.0,,,6,Economics; Ethnic Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Ethnic Studies,BTU03,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288059300014,0

Using well-established mathematical methods, I derive equations that show how rapidly this change will occur. Using data from previously published studies to establish parameter bounds, I draw random samples for parameter values and use these to investigate how quickly the gender composition of a firm's management structure can change.

The objective is to find the optimum response and its associated factor levels as quickly as possible at minimum expense. A strategy is to find a relative broad-based initial experiment that includes the variables we think are driving the response. Next, we run the experiment and fit a response surface from the results. We then use the response surface model to guide us in developing our second experiment, thus moving in closer to the optimal response. This systematic practice tends to work very well with using quantitative factors during its dealing. The usual alternative is more or less haphazard trial-and-error search over our feasible region or study grip. The sequence of experiments may include second-order response surface if a first-order response surface is judge to be inadequate. Nevertheless, the objective remains to close in on our best operating setting as quickly and economically as possible. The theoretical objective of the paper is to demonstrate design that is useful in response surface work: a central composite design. Packaging in food products is a critical process. Robust, airtight seals are required to preserve product freshness and shelf life. The sealing process in packaging is critical. One of the leverage points in this process is seal strength. When wrapping materials are joined together, two important leverages are sealing temperature and sealing time. The practical (or experimental) purpose of the paper is to determine optimal seal process requirements in order to provide maximum tensile strength in the seal.","[Hron, Jan; Macak, Tomas] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Management, FEM, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Hron, J (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Management, FEM, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",hron@pef.czu.cz; macak@pef.czu.cz,"Macak, Tomas/G-7396-2014; Hron, Jan/C-6378-2017","Macak, Tomas/0000-0002-6737-239X; Hron, Jan/0000-0001-6618-7136",,,,,9,0,0,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-2196-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,233,237,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000338036100024,0

Despite this attention, little empirical research has been done about relationship marketing practices among SMEs especially those in developing countries. However, it is now widely accepted that SMEs play a crucial role in economic development. Consequently, their effectiveness in relating to customers in a sustainable way is considered an important contribution to macro-economic development of industries as well as countries. This study was intended to investigate the relationship marketing instruments employed by SMEs in Uganda and to suggest practical tools that policy makers in developing countries can use to enhance SME competitiveness. The study is part of a wider study to investigate the relationship marketing practices of SMEs in Uganda and to propose a suitable model that can be used to improve their competitiveness. Data was collected from SME owners-managers, employees and regular customers to identify the relationship marketing instruments employed by SMEs and their contribution to SME competitiveness. Findings revealed that the instruments employed vary between different SME sectors and that, in general, those SMEs that were perceived to be more relationship marketing oriented had higher customer satisfaction levels compared to those that were not. The findings also confirmed the mediating role of customer experiences. These findings confirm that relationship marketing practice can have a big impact on SME competitiveness in Uganda. The study contributed to existing literature on the relationship marketing practices of SMEs in developing countries and formed a foundation for future research in related fields.","[Kakeeto-Aelen, Terry; van Dalen, Jan] Maastricht Sch Management, NL-6229 EP Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,,kakeeto@msm.nl; Dalen@msm.nl,,,,,,,58,0,0,0,4,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

The empirical research has been conducted in the period from March to June 2010 in the enterprises from Bosnia and Herzegovina. The original questionnaire was used with questions relating to characteristics of enterprise and organizational change management. The results of conducted research are uneven, from enterprises that are open to any changes and coping with them appropriately, to those who do not think about the changes ahead and do not know how to deal with them appropriately. In order to change the situation it is necessary to intensify education on the importance of changes and necessity of their implementation, not only of managers but also all those on which depends the success of implementation of organizational changes.","[Klepic, Zdenko; Bosnjak, Lidija Lesko; Mabic, Mirela] Univ Mostar, Fac Econ, Mostar 88000, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Mostar,,zdenko.klepic@sve-mo.ba; lidija.lesko@sve-mo.ba; mirela.mabic@sve-mo.ba,"Mabić, Mirela/N-8720-2018","Mabić, Mirela/0000-0002-1529-7797",,,,,10,0,0,0,9,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

The FRM has been held up as the gold standard in mortgage instrument design and as an essential element of the U.S. housing-finance system. Supporters of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac argue that a government guarantee eliminating credit risk is essential to ensuring the FRM remains the main instrument for housing finance. The FRM has benefits for the consumer through payment stability and the right to prepay the mortgage without penalty. But these benefits come at significant cost. The interest rate and prepayment risk in the FR/vI are costly and difficult for investors to manage. There is a premium for both the long term and the prepayment options that are paid by all users of the mortgage. The FRM causes instability in the mortgage market through periodic refinancing waves. The FRM can create negative equity in an environment of falling house prices. And the taxpayers are on the hook for hundreds of billions of dollars in losses backing the credit risk guarantees provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to support securities backed by the FRM. International experience suggests that mortgage markets work fine without an FRM (only Denmark has an equivalent instrument). Borrowers rarely stay with the same mortgage for 15-30 years. Shorter-term fixed-rate mortgages would be less expensive than the FRM in most interest rate environments, particularly if lenders were allowed to charge prepayment penalties. The taxpayer is exposed to too much risk in supporting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to justify continued government support for a product for which the costs outweigh the benefits.","[Lea, Michael] San Diego State Univ, Corky McMillin Ctr Real Estate, San Diego, CA 92123 USA; [Sanders, Anthony B.] George Mason Univ, Mercatus Ctr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University; George Mason University,"Lea, M (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, Corky McMillin Ctr Real Estate, San Diego, CA 92123 USA.",mlea@mail.sdsu.edu; asander7@gmu.edu,,,,,,,17,6,6,0,11,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4803-8,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

The study aims to introduce the Trinity Financial Instrument (TFI): micro-insurance, micro-credit and micro-savings, to Thai policy-makers. The study considers the government's cash compensation for house restoration as reactive finances for the flood-affected households. This compensation potentially results in increasing long-term financial vulnerability. of the households. To analyse the financial vulnerability, an. Asset-Based Approach aiming to measure vulnerability was used for formulating independent variables, and a financing gap regarded as a dependent variable was adapted from the CATSIM model(Catastrophe Simulation Model) for indicating a funding proportion of reactive finances to the total house restoration cost. In addition, a comparison of household preferences in financial instruments between the previous financial statement and the future financial plan of individual households could explain how they change their preference after introducing TFI. In this study, Tambon Phukaothong, Ayutthaya Province,. Thailand, was selected to be a case study. Based on the quantitative methodology, 197 households were surveyed by a questionnaire distribution. The result found that more than half of the respondents were categorized as a high financially vulnerable group in 2006 flood event, because the compensation of the government potentially made respondents rely more on reactive finances rather than seeking for proactive finances. Consequently, an average funding proportion of proactive finances to the total house restoration cost was about 44% during the 2006 flood event. Nevertheless, the use of proactive finances for funding house restoration among Thai rural low-income households would increase to 82%, based on the assumption that the government replaces the compensation for house restoration with TFI. With regard to the results, the study proposes that the Thai government is a key factor in assisting Thai rural low-income households in funding house restoration activities associated with floods. However, instead of providing the reactive compensation, the government should provide the households with access to affordable TFI in order to guard them against future flood damage.","[Sakonnakron, Sarunwit Promsaka Na; Hirunsalee, Siyanee; Kanegae, Hidehiko] Ritsumeikan Univ, Grad Sch Policy Sci, Kyoto, Japan",Ritsumeikan University,"Sakonnakron, SPN (通讯作者)，Ritsumeikan Univ, Grad Sch Policy Sci, Kyoto, Japan.",sarunwit@hotmail.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9175-6,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,14.0,,,,,,374,382,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8ZN,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000392896300068,0

In the course of general structural changes in agriculture, so-called extended family farms have emerged as a predominant form of farming businesses in many, mainly western parts of Germany. Through combining traditional family-labour-based governance structures with additional non-family labour, extended family farms can realize economies of scale. Thus, they are often considered a sustainable type of organisation that is able to cope with international competition. So far existing research has not fully explored the factors determining the competitiveness of extended family farms. Against this background, this article analyzes potential determinants of competitiveness of extended family farms on the basis of a survey of 103 farm managers. The empirical results show that the success of the farms surveyed is not only based on the realization of technical economies of scale, but also on the personality of the farm managers and the strategies implemented.","[Schaper, Christian] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agrarokon & Rurale Entwicklung, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Schaper, C (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agrarokon & Rurale Entwicklung, Platz Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",christian.schaper@agr.uni-goettingen.de,,,,,,,78,12,13,0,19,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

In this paper we use a new factor, economic structural changes, to explain the differences of private savings in developing countries and its impacts on current account balance. We point out that growth related structural changes can be decomposed into productivity changes and job reallocations, which will affect private savings differently through wage effect and labor reallocation effect. Wage variation resulting from productivity growth will increase private savings, while labor reallocation moving from low income to high income sectors will reduce savings. Using sector level data, we find strong empirical evidence that structural change patterns have a significant impact on private savings and current account balance. This result provides another way to understand the recent savings glut in East Asian countries and also has some implications for the large current account imbalance issue. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

There is widespread support for energy conservation, especially when it is voluntary, as this seems a cheap way to realize environmental and energy-climate goals. However, this overlooks the phenomenon of rebound. The topic of energy rebound has mainly attracted attention from energy analysts, but has been surprisingly neglected in environmental economics, even though economists generally are concerned with indirect or economy-wide impacts of technical change and policies. This paper presents definitions and interpretations of energy and environmental rebound, as well as four fundamental reasons for the existence of the rebound phenomenon. It further offers the most complete list of rebound pathways or mechanisms available in the literature. In addition, it discusses empirical estimates of rebound and addresses the implications of uncertainties and difficulties in assessing rebound. Suggestions are offered for strategies and public policies to contain rebound. It is advised that rebound evaluation is an essential part of environmental policy and project assessments. As opposed to earlier studies, this paper stresses the relevance of the distinction between energy conservation resulting from autonomous demand changes and from efficiency improvements in technology/equipment. In addition, it argues that rebound is especially relevant for developing countries.","[van den Bergh, Jeroen C. J.

Indeed, these extraordinary payments are shown to increase the default rate of other firms in the industry, ultimately lowering the value of corporate claims as well as government tax claims. The model is also used to examine the efficiency of different recoupment mechanisms (both existing and new) used by regulators and insurers to potentially reduce these contagion effects. Analysis allows us to stipulate the conditions under which a tax carryforward provision could be more efficient than the usual recoupment mechanisms known as premium rate surcharge and premium tax credit..","[Bernier, Gilles; Mahfoudhi, Ridha M.] Univ Laval, Dept Finance & Insurance, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; [Bernier, Gilles] Univ Laval, Ind Alliance Insurance Chair, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; [Mahfoudhi, Ridha M.] Desjardins, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Laval University; Laval University,"Bernier, G (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Dept Finance & Insurance, Pavillon Palasis Prince, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",gilles.bernier@fsa.ulaval.ca; ridha.mahfoudhi@fsa.ulaval.ca,,,,,,,17,7,7,1,8,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-4367,,,J RISK INSUR,J.

We use an 'incremental differences-in-differences' (IDiD) estimator to look at the effects of the NMW in each year through its differential impact across local labour markets. We find that the NMW is associated with a significant fall in wage inequality in the bottom half of the distribution. This suggests that geographical areas where the NMW 'bites' more have experienced larger declines in wage inequality than elsewhere. While the overall effect of the NMW on employment rates averaged over its existence is neutral, we do find small positive employment effects from 2003 onwards. Likewise, the association of the NMW with unemployment has been negative in recent years. NMW effects on hours have been mixed, but overall there is no compelling evidence to indicate that the NMW upratings have had an adverse effect on full-time total hours of work. Notwithstanding the clarity of these results, any causal interpretation of them might be compromised by the presence of concomitant policies that might have been correlated with the 'bite' of the NMW.","[Dolton, Peter; Bondibene, Chiara Rosazza; Wadsworth, Jonathan] Univ London, Royal Holloway Coll, London WC1E 7HU, England",University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"Dolton, P (通讯作者)，Univ London, Royal Holloway Coll, London WC1E 7HU, England.",peter.dolton@rhul.ac.uk; c.rosazza-bondibene@rhul.ac.uk; j.wadsworth@rhul.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,24,21,21,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

In the case of Ontario we contend that, despite large market potential and comparatively strong regulatory incentive policies, weak regulatory governance is one factor that has accounted for the challenges in attracting and implementing large-scale private investment in power generation at a reasonable cost. A unique survey of 63 wind power firms that assessed private sector opinions about the investment environment for renewable energy provides empirical support for our arguments. Firms rated the stability of regulatory policy, compared to a range of factors, among the weakest aspects of Ontario's business environment. However, policy stability ranked among the most important factors in firms' assessments of the attractiveness of alternative jurisdictions in their location decisions. Subsequent interviews revealed that firms have responded to this risk by explicitly pricing it into wind project financial models in Ontario-implying higher wind power prices for ratepayers and by directing investment funds to other jurisdictions. We argue that policy stability in Ontario may be improved by devolving greater decision-making authority to regulatory agencies in the energy sector and by strengthening their institutional independence.","[Holburn, Guy] Univ Western Ontario, Richard Ivey Sch Business, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Lui, Kerri] Univ Toronto, Fac Law, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Morand, Charles] Business Dev Bank Canada, Venture Capital, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); University of Toronto,"Holburn, G (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, Richard Ivey Sch Business, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.",,,,,,,,25,17,19,0,14,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,1911-9917,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

Using the modified dealership model of Maudos and Fernandez de Guevara (2004) as a baseline specification, we show that augmenting the model by proxies for direct and indirect impact of foreign bank participation does not produce a significant outcome. We explain our results by the fact that the dealership model fully accounts for the mechanisms through which foreign bank presence is hypothesized to affect interest margins in theoretical models on international banking. We call for re-examination of some of the previous findings showing a significant own effect of foreign bank participation on interest margins in emerging markets within the framework of the dealership model.

We study the factors driving household waste disposal and recycling in 18 cities in Taiwan and Japan in order to understand the impact of alternative waste management incentives. We show that this depends on the effect of distinct policies on the relative costs of the main alternative disposal methods: recycling, disposal to landfill and illegal dumping. The willingness both to recycle and to dispose to landfill depends on the relative costs of the waste collection regime, and these are dominated by the time cost of alternative disposal methods. The higher the frequency of waste collection, the less recycling and the more disposal to landfill there will be. This is because frequent collection reduces the marginal time-cost of disposal to landfill. Curbside collection of recyclable material, and the frequency of that collection, has a similar effect on the recycling rate. Although direct incentives, such as unit pricing are important in the waste disposal decision, recycling depends primarily on management of the time-costs it involves.","[Perrings, Charles] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, EcoSERVICES Grp, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Kuo, Yen-Lien] Natl Sci & Technol Ctr Disaster Reduct, Sindian City 231, Taipei County, Taiwan",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; National Science & Technology Center for Disaster Reduction (NCDR),"Kuo, YL (通讯作者)，Natl Sci & Technol Ctr Disaster Reduct, 9F,200,Sec 3,Beisin Rd, Sindian City 231, Taipei County, Taiwan.",yenlien@gmail.com; Charles.Perrngs@asu.edu,,"Kuo, Yen-Lien/0000-0001-7637-8331",,,,,31,25,29,1,54,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This paper thus analyzes survey evidence from 692 fund managers in five countries, the vast majority of whom rely on technical analysis. At a forecasting horizon of weeks, technical analysis is the most important form of analysis and up to this horizon it is thus more important than fundamental analysis. Technicians are as experienced, as educated, as successful in their career and largely just as overconfident in decision-making as others. However, technical analysis is somewhat more popular in smaller asset management firms. What we find most significant is the relation of technical analysis with the view that prices are heavily determined by psychological influences. Consequently, technicians apply trend-following behavior. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Young black men are 15 times as likely to be murdered as young white men. This disparity is historic and pervasive, and cannot be accounted for by individual characteristics. Culture-of-violence and tail-of-the-distribution theories are also inadequate to explain the geographic and demographic pattern of the disparity. We argue that any satisfactory explanation must take into account the fact that murder can have a preemptive motive: people sometimes kill simply to avoid being killed. As a result, disputes can escalate dramatically in environments (endogenously) perceived to be dangerous, resulting in self-fulfilling expectations of violence for particular dyadic interactions, and significant racial disparities in rates of murder and victimization. Because of strategic complementarity, small differences in fundamentals can cause large differences in murder rates. Differences in the manner in which the criminal justice system treats murders with victims from different groups, and differences across groups in involvement in street vice, may be sufficient to explain the size and pattern of the racial disparity.

In order to be compliant with this approach, institutions must estimate the loss-given-default, the fraction of the credit exposure that is lost if the borrower defaults. This study evaluates the ability of a parametric fractional response regression and a nonparametric regression tree model to forecast bank loan credit losses. The out-of-sample predictive ability of these models is evaluated at several recovery horizons after the default event. The out-of-time predictive ability is also estimated for a recovery horizon of 1 year. The performance of the models is benchmarked against recovery estimates given by historical averages. The results suggest that regression trees are an interesting alternative to parametric models in modeling and forecasting loss-given-default. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The model especially accounts for the correlation of defaults on the one hand and correlation of default rates and recovery rates on the other hand. Nested Archimedean copulas are used to model different dependence structures. For the recovery rates a very flexible continuous distribution with bounded support is applied, which allows for an efficient sampling of the loss process. Due to the relaxation of the constant 40% recovery assumption and the negative correlation of default rates and recovery rates, the model is especially suited for distressed market situations and the pricing of super senior tranches. A calibration to CDO tranche spreads of the European iTraxx portfolio is performed to demonstrate the fitting capability of the model.

The degree of trust in health providers appears to be a key factor in determining the effectiveness of health education in both regions. The effect is not ruled out by controlling for general trust.

The black middle class, increasingly referred to as the Black Diamonds are the most powerful marketing trend during the last 10 years, as they have emerged as the strongest buying influence in the economy, and making inroads in understanding this market presents a good opportunity. The data used in this paper was collected from an integration of a consumer behaviour survey; as well as personal interviews and focus group discussions. The paper asserts that the key factors influencing the South African consumers' behaviour are age, gender, income, race and wine drinking history. The paper also asserts that, not only is the black middle class different from the white middle class, but that different segments exist within the Black Diamonds. The industry should particularly focus on marketing to women and the Start-me-up age group, as there is limited consumer knowledge about wines, but a high willingness to experiment. The paper also suggests various new brand communication platforms that can be explored to reach this market as well as competition between industry stakeholders.","[Ndanga, Leah Z.

This study contributes to the literature by analyzing the impact of stronger IPR laws in China on its bilateral trade flows. We estimate the effects of IPR protection on China's imports at the aggregate and detailed product categories for both developed and developing countries. The empirical results suggest that increased IPR protection stimulates China's imports, particularly for knowledge-intensive products. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Corruption rather than resource dependency per se affects negatively the ability of African countries to reinvest resource rents in the short term, but for Asian countries, corruption is less important than point resources.

Consistent with this prediction, we find international differences in the cost of capital to be strongly and positively related to varying degrees of home bias for 38 markets. This finding is robust to different cost of capital proxies, different control variables, alternative home-bias measures, international tradability of stocks, and alternative specifications. Therefore, the overall evidence implies that countries may enjoy a significantly lower cost of capital by reducing the extent of their home bias and hence, increasing global risk sharing.

Second, the role of liquidity is examined in a Fama and French (1993) framework.

The article discusses potential advantages (such as targeting. cost and informational) and disadvantages (such as exclusion and inability to manage correlated risk) of these arrangements, and their implications for the design of community-based social protection programs and policies.

A more radical stance founded on legal and operational mechanisms drawn from the open-source software movement could not only function to impede processes of dispossession, but might actually facilitate the repossession of 'seed sovereignty'.

The author also studies monetary policies that target a constant, but nonzero, nominal interest rate and finds that to the extent that a financial asset is valued as a means to facilitate transactions, the asset's real rate of return will include a liquidity return that depends on monetary considerations. Through this liquidity channel, persistent deviations from an optimal monetary policy can cause the real prices of assets that can be used to relax trading constraints to exhibit persistent deviations from their fundamental values.

An increase in government spending of 1 percent of GDP generates output and unemployment multipliers, respectively, of about 1.2 percent (at one year) and 0.6 percentage points (at the peak). Each percentage point increase in GDP produces an increase in employment of about 1.3 million jobs. Total hours, employment and the job finding probability all rise, whereas the separation rate falls. A standard neoclassical model augmented with search and matching frictions in the labor market largely fails in reproducing the size of the output multiplier whereas it can produce a realistic unemployment multiplier but only under a special parameterization. Extending the model to strengthen the complementarity in preferences, to include unemployment benefits, real wage rigidity and/or debt financing with distortionary taxation only worsens the picture. New Keynesian features only marginally magnify the size of the multipliers. When complementarity is coupled with price stickiness, however, the magnification effect can be large.

We also explore the sensitivity of the results to the inclusion of variables aiming to control for underlying financial and fiscal conditions. The main new findings are that: expansionary fiscal shocks have a short-term positive impact on GDP and private consumption, with government spending shocks entailing, in general, higher effects on economic activity than (net) tax reductions; output multipliers to government expenditure shocks are of similar size in the euro area and in the US; the persistence of a fiscal spending shock is higher in the US than in the euro area, which appears to be related to military spending in the US; and fiscal multipliers have increased over the recent past in both geographical areas.","[Burriel, Pablo; de Castro, Francisco; Garrote, Daniel; Gordo, Esther; Perez, Javier J.] Bank Spain, Dept Res, Madrid, Spain",Banco de Espana,"Burriel, P (通讯作者)，Bank Spain, Dept Res, Madrid, Spain.",pburriel@bde.es; fcastro@bde.es; daniel.garrote@bde.es; egordo@bde.es; joan.paredes@ecb.int; javierperez@bde.es,"de castro, francisco/JHU-5465-2023","de Castro, Francisco/0000-0002-8190-1796; Paredes, Joan/0009-0000-5809-0983",,,,,40,45,50,5,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0143-5671,,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

However, for the majority of the households that do not refinance, consumption sensitivity appears to be due to a reduction in precautionary saving.","Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Sch Business & Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Gan, J (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Sch Business & Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jgan@ust.hk,,,,,,,49,86,99,6,59,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Those allotted the role of public servants chose between whistleblowing, opportunism and reciprocity (delivery of a contract) and those acting as businesspeople chose how to frame the game (calling their payment either a gift or a bribe) and whether to blow the whistle at the end of the game. Opportunism and abstaining from whistleblowing is the Nash equilibrium. In line with widespread experimental evidence we find instead that businesspeople and public servants depart from maximizing payoffs. Businesspeople who strongly preferred to call the payment a bribe were more willing to punish non-delivering public servants. Translated to the real world, this finding reveals that gift-giving is a less effective method for influencing public servants because gifts fail to signal businesspeople's willingness to retaliate opportunism.

This online trend developed also in the way companies interact with their customers by means of Internet platforms, or in the form of e-commerce. Despite the easiness with which customers order products from home, the online shopping has also many risks. Most of the risks are related to the lack of information about the company who sells online or the uncertainty that the ordered products will be delivered. Starting with the presentation of the processes taking place in online shopping, the present article reviews the rights consumers have when buying online and then focuses on researching the risk of online shopping as perceived by Romanian consumers. The study analyzes the differences in the risk perception and the willingness to buy online in the future depending on gender, age or income. The way in which consumers perceive risks affects the company's marketing strategy, because if consumers see a greater risk in online transactions, the probability that they will buy online decreases. Consequently the company must focus its communication strategy on the reduction of the risk perception.","[Pelau, Corina; Bena, Irina] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Pelau, C (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",corinapelau@yahoo.com,"Pelau, Corina/F-4663-2015","Pelau, Corina/0000-0002-6139-028X",,,,,28,15,15,0,30,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2010,12.0,28,,,,,373,387,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,617XA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279314000008,0

Therefore, an important implication of the findings in this paper is that adequate liberalization in the financial system of the host country is a crucial requirement for effective foreign aid.

We find that the lowest emissions areas are generally in California and that the highest emissions areas are in Texas and Oklahoma. There is a strong negative association between emissions and land use regulations.

The tests allow for robust analysis of their separate characteristics and facilitate better estimation of return dynamics. Empirical evidence of both small and big jumps based on these tests suggests that models for individual equities and overall market indices require incorporating Levy-type jumps.

In US data there is indeed a strikingly high time series correlation between the yield on nominal bonds and the dividend yield on equities. This positive correlation is often attributed to the fact that both bond and equity yields comove strongly and positively with expected inflation. Contrary to some of the extant literature, we show that this effect is consistent with modern asset pricing theory incorporating uncertainty about real growth prospects and habit-based risk aversion. In the US, high expected inflation has tended to coincide with periods of heightened uncertainty about real economic growth and unusually high risk aversion, both of which rationally raise equity yields.

While the market can find uses for partial credit guarantees, the attractions for public policy can be illusory: indeed their most attractive feature for myopic politicians may be the ease with which the true cost of guarantees can be understated, at least at the outset. In practice, the actual fiscal cost of existing schemes has varied widely across countries and has represented a high per dollar subsidy in some cases. Despite the recent application of some innovative techniques, the social benefit of such schemes has proved difficult to estimate, not least because their goals have been vague. Operational design has influenced the cost and apparent effectiveness of different schemes and has also varied widely. Clear and precise goals, against which performance is regularly monitored, realistic pricing verified by consistent and transparent accounting, and attention to the incentive features of operational design, especially for the intermediaries, are among the prerequisites for such schemes to have a good chance of truly achieving improvements in social welfare.

The main results show that physical infrastructure problems, financing constraints, and institutional problems discourage FDI. These results are robust to an alternative definition of FDI, introduction of additional explanatory variables, and some breakdown analyses (different sectors of activity and comparison between Sub-Saharan Africa and other developing countries). The results also highlight that exporter foreign firms are more constrained in their activity by physical infrastructure hurdles and the lack of skilled workers compared to firms supplying the domestic market.

Specifically, returns are higher when more institutional investors enter the auction or bid higher prices, suggesting institutional investors are informed and are also able to shave bids adequately.

The changing nature of airports in their metropolitan context and the emergence of new pressures and problems require the introduction of a fresh conceptual framework to assist the better understanding of these complex roles and spatial interactions. The approach draws upon the meta-concept of interfaces of an 'airport metropolis' as an organising device consisting of four main domains: economic development, land use, infrastructure, and governance. The paper uses the framework to further discuss airport and regional interactions and highlights the use of sustainability criteria to operationalise the model. The approach aims to move research and practice beyond the traditionally compartmentalised analysis of airport issues and policy-making by highlighting interdependencies between airports and regions.

There is a common trend in yield differentials, which is correlated with a measure of aggregate risk. In contrast, liquidity differentials display sizeable heterogeneity and no common factor. We propose a simple model with endogenous liquidity demand, where a bond's liquidity premium depends both on its transaction cost and on investment opportunities. The model predicts that yield differentials should increase in both liquidity and risk, with an interaction term of the opposite sign. Testing these predictions on daily data, we find that the aggregate risk factor is consistently priced, liquidity differentials are priced for a subset of countries, and their interaction with the risk factor is in line with the model's prediction and crucial to detect their effect.","[Favero, Carlo] Univ Commerciale Luigi Bocconi, Univ Bocconi, IGIER, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Pagano, Marco] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ, I-80126 Naples, Italy; [von Thadden, Ernst-Ludwig] Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",Bocconi University; University of Naples Federico II; University of Mannheim,"Favero, C (通讯作者)，Univ Commerciale Luigi Bocconi, Univ Bocconi, IGIER, Via Salasco 5, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",carlo.favero@uni-bocconi.it; mrpagano@tin.it; vthadden@pool.uni-mannheim.de,"PAGANO, MARCO/AAD-8218-2022","PAGANO, MARCO/0000-0002-0709-6119; FAVERO, CARLO AMBROGIO/0000-0002-1668-9426",,,,,35,137,150,0,41,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

In equilibrium, the stock price reflects the demand from both controlling shareholders and portfolio investors.

Thus, stocks have lower expected returns when investor protection is weak. This has implications for domestic and foreign investors' stockholdings.

Third, the response of policymakers to inflation is smaller when the exchange rate is over-valued and larger when it is under-valued. None of these responses is allowed for in the widely used linear Taylor-type rules, suggesting that monetary policy is better analysed using a more sophisticated model, such as the one suggested in this paper.","[Martin, Christopher] Univ Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Milas, Costas] Keele Univ, Keele, Staffs, England",University of Bath; Keele University,,,,"Milas, Konstantinos/0000-0002-9789-384X",,,,,22,3,5,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

We also show that the composition of collateralizable assets shifts towards non-specific assets (e.g., land) with borrower risk.

Investors have preferences with external habits. Countercyclical risk premia and procyclical real interest rates arise endogenously. During bad times at home, when domestic consumption is close to the habit level, the representative investor is very risk averse. When the domestic investor is more risk averse than her foreign counterpart, the exchange rate is closely tied to domestic consumption growth shocks. The domestic investor therefore expects a positive currency excess return. Because interest rates are low in bad times, expected currency excess returns increase with interest rate differentials.","[Verdelhan, Adrien] NBER, MIT Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Verdelhan, A (通讯作者)，NBER, MIT Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,/0000-0002-0319-5531,,,,,56,171,230,1,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

Findings show that there is a large number of factors that influence consumer purchasing behaviour.

Today, social dialogue has no longer an exclusive role of (re) establishing social peace. However, the main objective of social dialogue remains social peace, and the main source of social peace remains social dialogue. The relation between employees and employers is still developing between peace and war. The paper attempts to analyse the concept of social peace, within the context of European Social Model, and to identify the rather rigid Romanian rules that may prevent or postpone the achievement of a balance between security and flexibility and of a sustainable social peace. Indeed, unlike other legal systems, where the distinction between conflicts of rights and conflicts of interests, albeit theoretically acknowledged, is not relevant in practice, this distinction is fundamental for the German-inspired Romanian system. Social peace is regarded as mandatory as long as a collective contract is in force, therefore any kind of strike or collective action is forbidden as long as no conflict of interests arisen. Such a conflict is dependent on the very moment of negotiating a new collective contract. The paper analyses the Romanian solution and attempts to identify the relation between such a legislative option and the establishing of social peace. Is the mere prohibition of social actions during the existence of collective contract the way to achievement of social peace, or it should rather be a voluntary process? Moreover, the prohibition of strikes during the existence of collective contracts is in fact in line with the ILO requirements? The answers are searched in the sensible relation between peace and war during nowadays labor contracts. The author is trying to find practical solutions, in order to harmonize the Romanian system to the general European approach.","[Dimitriu, Raluca] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,raluca_dimitriu@yahoo.com,"dimitriu, raluca/B-7550-2012; Dimitriu, Raluca/AAH-9846-2019; Dimitriu, Raluca/IAM-2551-2023","dimitriu, raluca/0000-0002-2549-2449; Dimitriu, Raluca/0000-0002-2549-2449",,,,,7,0,0,0,4,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",,,978-606-505-347-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,132,148,,,,,,17,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BSE06,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284258100009,0

Unlike prior research that relies on experiments or surveys to derive investors' expectations, we estimate expected returns directly from stock prices, the book value of equity, and analyst earnings forecasts. We find that the expected returns are positively related to both past market returns and past stock returns. However, investors' expectations seem to be overoptimistic (overpessimistic) for stocks that had extremely high (low) returns in the previous year. Furthermore, we find that investors' expectations about future earnings growth rates are also positively related to past growth rates. The results remain robust after we control for analyst optimism and measures of risk. Taken together, our results are consistent with the findings that investors extrapolate from past stock returns and past earnings growth rates.","[He, Wen] Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sch Accounting, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"He, W (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sch Accounting, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",wen.he@unsw.edu.au,"Shen, Jianfeng/D-8922-2013; He, Wen/AAJ-2088-2020","Shen, Jianfeng/0000-0003-0502-3212; He, Wen/0000-0001-7421-6208",,,,,37,11,11,3,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

European and international security has become too complex to characterize by way of a single analytical model. Though militaiy power remains crucial, the importance of economic power has clearly increased. Additionally, non-state actors have also emerged to an extent unknown in the old times of classical diplomacy. Therefore, a distinction could be made between formal and applied geopolitics. Geopolitical dynamics includes not only geostrategic but also geo-economic (read: geo-energetic) and geo-cultural changes of the geo-strategic actors' position. Three major international strategic actors are involved in framing the European geopolitical and geo-cultural context: the United States of America, the European Union and Russia clearly forming a kind of power configuration by interacting to different extents in the European region and beyond: in the broader Eurasian and Euro-Atlantic supra-region.","[Iliopoulos, Ilias] Ludwig Maximilian Univ Munich, Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Iliopoulos, I (通讯作者)，Ludwig Maximilian Univ Munich, Munich, Germany.",ilias.iliopoulos@bdcol.ee,,,,,,,44,0,0,0,2,CAROL I NATL DEFENSE UNIV,BUCHAREST,"PANDURI STR NO 68-72, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-663-843-5,,,,2010,,,,,,,138,149,,,,,,12,Economics; Political Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Government & Law,BG8RG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000392673600020,0

Both were concessions to the operation of domestic farm policies in developed countries, primarily the US and the UK and later Canada and the EU, and full advantage was taken of these legal exceptions. Subsidies in general had been treated leniently in the GATT with merely the obligation to notify if they impacted upon exports. Domestic subsidies for agricultural products had significant impacts on both imports and exports and were seen to be a significant part of the trade problem, but operated under minimal constraints. So the exceptional treatment of agriculture in the GATT had led to a dysfunctional trade regime. The Uruguay Round faced up to the inchoate conditions on world markets and the deterioration of trade relations that these exclusions allowed. The Agreement on Agriculture (URAA) specifically banned quantitative restrictions on imports, except those introduced to guarantee access and banned new export subsidies, capping and reducing existing expenditures on the programs and the volumes that could be subsidized. Domestic subsidies that were deemed to be most trade-distorting were capped and modestly reduced. The Doha Round would, if completed, eliminate export subsidies, severely limit the ability to provide trade-distorting support, and reduce the bound tariffs by a considerable extent. The URAA was negotiated at a time when the US and the EU were the main players in the agricultural policy space and it represented a way of disciplining trade to avoid conflicts and reduce protection. Domestic policies were reformed in a way that was consistent with the URAA constraints. If the Doha Round is successful, most of the special provisions for agriculture will no longer be needed. But at that stage the URAA may inadvertently hamper the process of developing trade rules that meet new challenges.","Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Europe Ctr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Josling, T (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Europe Ctr, Encina Hall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",josling@stanford.edu,,,,,,,17,2,2,0,8,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

The adjustment factors are defined in a way that is similar to their real-world counterparts and they differ in the relative weight they put on changes in the contribution rate and in the pension level. We show how the internal rate of return of the PAYG system depends on the fluctuations in cohort size and on the choice of the adjustment regime. We find that fluctuations In the Cohort size have the smallest impact oil the internal rate of return if the relative weight of the adjustment parameters directly corresponds to the length of the retirement period relative to the length of the working period.

An assessment is conducted that quantifies environmental impact through estimates of useable energy produced and carbon emissions avoided by AGreen Energy's project to install anaerobic digesters on five Massachusetts farms. The analysis shows the anaerobic co-digestion of manure and source separated organics under project conditions results in a net energy gain of 1:2.9 and a GHG emissions reduction of 50% over business as usual, justifying the technique as a sustainable residual management tool for dairy operations as well as food industry businesses.","[Morris, Chelsea; Snellings, Sam] AGreen Energy LLC, Boston, MA 02118 USA",,"Morris, C (通讯作者)，AGreen Energy LLC, 580 Harrison Ave,Suite 404, Boston, MA 02118 USA.",contact@agreenenergyllc.com,,,,,,,7,5,5,0,27,INT FOOD & AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW,COLLEGE STATION,"333 BLOCKER BUILDING, 2124 TAMU, COLLEGE STATION, TX 77843-2124 USA",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

The approach follows Charles Tilly's Durable Inequality in combining Marxian ideas of exploitation and dispossession with Weberian notions of social closure. The article then draws on the work of Steven Lukes, Pierre Bourdieu and Arjun Appadurai to argue for the need to incorporate a multidimensional conception of power; including not only power as the direct assertion of will but also 'agenda-setting power' that sets the terms in which poverty becomes (or fails to become) politicised, and closely related to power as political representation.

Central to our analysis is the idea that different sectors of the economy will sort into high- and low-crime areas depending on their relative sensitivity to crime. We illustrate this by comparing retail industries to their wholesale counterparts, and high-end restaurants to low-end eateries. Because retail industries are dependent on pedestrian shoppers, they are expected to be especially sensitive to violent crime. Because high-end restaurants are dependent on evening business, they are expected to be especially sensitive to violent crime over the prime dinner hours. Findings indicate that retail, wholesale, high- and low-end restaurants are all more active in areas with higher local rates of violent crime, even after conditioning on an extensive set of model controls. This could arise because violent crime is attracted to our target industries. This also likely reflects that other sectors of the economy outbid our target industries for safer locations (e.g. residential). Further analysis confirms such sorting behavior. Retailers are more likely to locate in safer locations as compared to wholesalers in the same industry. Among restaurants, an increase in violent crime during the prime dinner hours equivalent to the sample max/min range would decrease the high-end share of local restaurants by roughly 40 percentage points. These findings indicate that entrepreneurs take violent crime into account when bidding for locations within a city. These finding also indicate that efforts to make distressed portions of cities more vibrant must give consideration to the need to ensure that such areas are safe. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This study focuses on determining the nature of fairness and dependence in marketing relationships-two important factors that have been found to promote stability. This research explores whether religious tradition, national factors, cultural dimensions, industry norms, or relationship-specific elements determine the standards that firms use to assess fairness in their B2B relationships. Potential differences in the nature or impact of fairness and dependence in domestic business relationships versus relationships among firms from different countries are examined. By also examining the nature of partners' dependence in greater depth (exploring both benefit-based vs. cost-based dependence), greater insights are gained as to which types of dependence are associated with greater relationship stability and if the effects of perceived fairness are moderated by the benefit-based vs. cost-based nature of the partners' dependence.","[Scheer, Lisa; Lund, Donald; Kozlenkova, Irina] Univ Missouri, Robert J Trulaske Sr Coll Business, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Scheer, L (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Robert J Trulaske Sr Coll Business, 433 Cornell Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",irinakozlenkova@mizzou.edu,"Lund, Donald/AAF-2705-2020",,,,,,19,0,0,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2123-6,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2010,,,,,,,219,223,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA6AE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000337077600024,0

We might agree that it is much easier to answer the question Why do we measure the quality of life than the one How do we measure it?. Let us start with answering the easier question. Life quality is to be measured because life is much more than simple surviving. On one hand, the improvement of people's health is judged in terms of their lifespan; on the other hand in terms of the improvement of their life quality (e.g. how their pain is eased, how their ability to work improves). Today policy-making governments have started to realize that the reserves of economic and social policies preaching slogans like job creation, GDP growth and motorway construction are running out. More and more people feel that to make citizens satisfied and to gain their votes something else will also be needed than before. But what does this mean? To answer the question many call the notion of life quality and happiness to help and try to find the way out by the reinterpretation of thoughts and ideas well-known for centuries for the XXI. century.","[Sores, Anett; Nagy, Adrian; Peto, Karoly] Univ Debrecen, Fac Appl Econ & Rural Dev, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary",University of Debrecen,"Sorés, A (通讯作者)，Univ Debrecen, Fac Appl Econ & Rural Dev, Boszormeny Ut 138, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary.",soresanett@agr.unideb.hu; nagy.adrian@agr.unideb.hu; peto@agr.unideb.hu,"Nagy, Adrian/GPS-7835-2022","Nagy, Adrian/0000-0002-3813-9759",,,,,7,0,0,0,0,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2123-6,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2010,,,,,,,317,323,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA6AE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000337077600036,0

Contrary to the expectations of some observers, Yudhoyono's strong popular mandate and his Democratic Party's newly won parliamentary plurality did not result in significant changes to the president's cautious style of governing or the fickle nature of president-parliament relations. Most political parties also opted for continuity over change, electing or re-electing established figures as leaders despite high levels of public dissatisfaction with their performance. The fact that the 2009 election failed to generate any new momentum for reform does not augur well for the remainder of Yudhoyono's second term.

At each locality, samples of river sediments were also taken for arsenic analysis. The arsenic concentration was determined in the gills and foot (,ug/g city weight), using the hydride generation analytical technique (HG AAS). The arsenic content in the sediments was determined with inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP OES). An increasing arsenic concentration downstream of the river was demonstrated. The results indicate a higher deposition of metals in the foot of bivalves compared to the gills. In addition, a correlation between the arsenic concentrations in both types of tissues as well as between the metallic content in the tissues and in the sediments was demonstrated.

People generally focus on how to decrease the amount of CO2 discharged to the air and how to utilize CO2 for energy development. CO2 has been used for gas drive in order to improve oil recovery during the process of oilfield development and a good effect has been obtained. Especially for extra-low permeability reservoirs, CO2 flooding has been one of the most important ways for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). In this paper, the core samples of extra-low permeability come from Jilin oilfield. Three types of core displacement tests-CO2 miscible displacement, CO2 immiscible displacement and water displacement-on the rock samples were designed. The experimental results were analyzed and compared through combining experimental parameters and in situ operational parameters. The results of core displacement tests show that compared to water flooding, CO2 flooding has great oil recovery, short development cycle, high oil production efficiency and small injection/production pressure difference. Moreover, compared to CO2 immiscible displacement, CO2 miscible displacement has short development cycle, high productivity and low consumption of CO2. This paper draws a conclusion that CO2 flooding has great superiority for EOR in extra-low permeability reservoirs.","[Yang Ping] Inst Porous Flow & Fluid Mech, Langfang 065007, Hebei, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,ST PLUM-BLOSSOM PRESS PTY LTD,HAWTHORN EAST,"STE 4, LEVEL 3, 695 BURKE RD, HAWTHORN EAST, VC 3123, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-646-54471-7,,,,2010,,,,,,,275,+,,,,,,3,Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BDJ45,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000313542100047,0

A simple model of probabilistic choice and valuation can account for a higher incidence of standard (nonstandard) preference reversals for certainty (probability) equivalents and it can also rationalize the existence of strong reversals.

Using proprietary data compiled by AlpInvest Partners, we calculate the aggregate home bias of these funds as well as their home bias at the fund level. We find significant variation across funds. While UK-based funds are on average least home-biased, they show a high degree of intra-European bias. In comparison, US funds are found to be least home-biased in terms of inter-regional acquisitions, with Europe being the most important destination for US buyout capital. Furthermore, we find that buyout funds tend to be less home-biased than portfolio investors and, more specifically, mutual funds. This finding is consistent with the optimal ownership theory of the home bias, which predicts that foreign direct investment - as opposed to portfolio investment - represents the preferred choice of entry in countries where the quality of governance is perceived to be inferior, promoting insider ownership.","[Cornelius, Peter] AlpInvest Partners, NL-1081 KJ Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Cornelius, P (通讯作者)，AlpInvest Partners, Jachthavenweg 118, NL-1081 KJ Amsterdam, Netherlands.",peter.cornelius@alpinvest.com,,,,,,,34,2,3,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

Our findings are summarized as follows: first, intra-East Asian trade is discouraged by exchange rate volatility more seriously than trade in other regions. Second, one important source of the discouragement is that intermediate goods trade in international production networks, which is quite sensitive to exchange rate volatility compared with other types of trade, occupies a significant fraction of East Asian trade.

The value-added of this paper lies in the use of a recent, alternative econometric method, a pair-wise approach that considers all the possible pairs of log per-capita pollutant emission gaps across all the countries in the sample. In this method, all emissions differences must be stationary around a constant mean. Empirical results support different conclusions on stochastic convergence in per capita CO(2) and SO(2) emissions depending on the choice of the unit root test. The use of specific critical values from the ADF-KPSS joint test overcomes these initial conflicting results and leads to small percentages of stationary pairs around a constant mean; which invalidate the hypothesis of stochastic convergence for per capita emissions of CO(2) and SO(2), even over the OECD sub-dataset.","Univ Nantes, LEMNA, Inst Econ & Management Nantes, IAE, F-44322 Nantes 3, France",Nantes Universite,"Nourry, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nantes, LEMNA, Inst Econ & Management Nantes, IAE, Site Erdre,Chemin Cens Tertre,BP 52 231, F-44322 Nantes 3, France.",myriam_nourry@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,30,53,57,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Third, we measure the influence of the choice of the numeraire on the derivation of bilateral equilibrium rates. Finally, we study the temporal robustness of the estimations by dropping one or 2 years from the estimation period. Our main conclusion is that BEER estimations are quite robust to these successive tests, although at one point of time misalignments can differ by several percentage points depending on the methodology. The choice of the productivity proxy is the most sensible one, followed by the country sample. In contrast, the choice of the numeraire and the time sample have a relatively limited impact on estimated misalignments.","[Benassy-Quere, Agnes; Mignon, Valerie] CEPII, Paris, France; [Bereau, Sophie; Mignon, Valerie] Univ Paris Ouest, CNRS, Paris, France",Universite Paris Saclay; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Bénassy-Quéré, A (通讯作者)，CEPII, Paris, France.",,,"Benassy-Quere, Agnes/0000-0003-4898-3694; Bereau-Gnabo, Sophie/0000-0001-5820-9577",,,,,67,28,30,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

Previous Choice Modelling papers have considered the issue of the internal consistency of choices-such as the extent to which strictly-dominated options are chosen. In this paper, a different focus is employed, namely the extent to which people choose options which violate their stated upper or lower limits for the acceptable levels for individual attributes. Since hypothetical over-statement of WTP has been a focus in stated preference studies, we concentrate on violations of stated upper limits of WTP, and explore the effects of editing such choices using a variable censoring rule and alternative approaches to re-classifying choices. The empirical case study is a choice experiment on eco-tourists in Rwanda. Our main conclusion is that the suggested approach offers a useful way of imposing consistency on choices, and that editing choices in this manner has an appreciable impact on estimated willingness to pay. However, issues remain with regard to explaining why people apparently violate their stated maximum willingness to pay.","[Bush, Glenn; Hanley, Nick] Univ Stirling, Dept Econ, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Colombo, Sergio] IFAPA, Dept Agr Econ, Ctr Granada, Granada 18080, Spain",University of Stirling,"Hanley, N (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Dept Econ, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",n.d.hanley@stir.ac.uk,"Colombo, Sergio/D-2143-2011; Hanley, Nick/C-1759-2012; Colombo, Sergio/IXD-1645-2023","Colombo, Sergio/0000-0001-7307-9811; Hanley, Nick/0000-0002-1362-3499",,,,,21,28,31,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

However, under current turbulent times, the short-run survival actions may be insistently sought by policy-makers under the pressure of trade unions and the exit of failing firms may be perceived to be more costly for society. Actually, the immediate costs that existing businesses, employees and consumers have to incur may be up-front and visible, while the benefits of competition may be less visible. As a consequence, times of severe financial and economic crises bring about a severe questioning of market mechanisms with unfailing regularity and the stance of the competition policy against this backdrop. We shall therefore look in the current paper at the role of competition authorities in a time of severe economic and financial crisis and in particular, at how the crisis will impact the application of competition law. In the end, we will conclude in favour of the need to preserve competition policy as well in difficult times even if we admit that a certain flexibilisation in procedures (but not in rules) may be probably necessary.","[Oprescu, Gheorghe] Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Inst Business Adm, Bucharest, Romania; [Eleodor, Daniela] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Oprescu, G (通讯作者)，Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Inst Business Adm, Bucharest, Romania.",gheorghe.oprescu@gmail.com,,,,,,,12,2,2,0,8,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2009,11.0,,,,3,,722,734,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,534HM,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272887200007,0

For the majority of subjects, we find that risk preferences are not stable across elicitation methods. In interval regression models subjects' risk preference classifications from survey questions on job-based gambles are not associated with risk preference estimates from the experiment. However, we find that risk classifications from inheritance-based gambles are significantly associated with the experimental measure. We identify some subjects for whom risk preference estimates are more strongly correlated across elicitation methods, suggesting that unobserved subject traits like comprehension or effort influence risk preference stability.","[Anderson, Lisa R.; Mellor, Jennifer M.] Coll William & Mary, Dept Econ, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA",William & Mary,"Mellor, JM (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Dept Econ, POB 8795, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",jmmell@wm.edu,,"Anderson, Lisa/0000-0002-8748-222X",,,,,40,125,134,3,52,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

We observe that renters who become homeowners not only experience a significant increase in housing satisfaction, but also after changing their tenure status, they obtain a different utility from the same housing context.

In the last 5 years, bunker prices have risen considerably. An increasing bunker price in container shipping, especially in the short term, is only partially compensated through surcharges and will therefore affect earnings negatively. This paper deals with the impact of increasing bunker costs on the design of liner services on the Europe-Far East trade. The paper assesses how shipping lines have adapted their liner service schedules (in terms of commercial speed, number of vessels deployed per loop. etc.) to deal with increased bunker costs. The paper also includes a cost model to simulate the impact of bunker cost changes on the operational costs of liner services. The cost model demonstrates for a typical North Europe-East Asia loop that the current bunker prices have a significant impact on the costs per TEU even when using large post-panamax vessels. The model also shows shipping lines are reacting quite late to higher bunker costs. The reasons that explain the late adaptation of liner services relate to inertia, transit time concerns, increasing costs associated with fixing schedule integrity problems and fleet management issues.

A Lagrange multiplier test is derived to test the constancy of correlations against the DSTCC-GARCH model, and another one to test for another transition in the STCC-GARCH framework. In addition, other specification tests, with the aim of aiding the model building procedure, are considered. Analytical expressions for the test statistics and the required derivatives are provided. Applying the model to the stock and bond futures data, we discover that the correlation pattern between them has dramatically changed around the turn of the century.

The output effect is usually neglected: it is the lost business resulting from passing on the price overcharge. To evaluate the relative importance of the three effects, we introduce various models of imperfect competition for the plaintiff's industry. We show that the passing-on defense generally remains justified after accounting for the output effect, provided that the cartel affects a sufficient number of firms. We derive exact discounts to the price overcharge, and illustrate how to compute these in the European vitamin cartel.

To prove existence, one has to consider types of equilibria ignored by Shleifer and Vishny, even if one adopts their parameter restrictions. For example, the only equilibrium may be one in which maximization of expected wealth requires an all-or-nothing investment strategy, with intermediate investment levels being strictly unprofitable. If one goes beyond Shleifer and Vishny's parameter restrictions, multiple equilibria may arise, and equilibrium selection may be governed by sunspots.

In recent years, there is an accumulation of evidence that this is an issue that should interest developed countries as well. Recently published numbers by the European Commission and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development indicate a nonnegligible flow of European academics to American universities. This article provides the first case study conducted on the most massive out-migration of academics on record. At a time when Europe and other developed countries have begun to express concern about the phenomenon, the rate of academic emigration from Israel to the United States is already four to six times the European emigration rate. The particular focus here is on the area of economics, in which the exodus of younger academics from Israel coupled with a heightened retirement rate among the older academics has brought Israel's top economics departments-among the best in the world, until now-to the brink. Countries wanting to create conditions for fostering and nurturing the necessary productivity advances underlying economic growth must become aware of how far and how quickly an academic implosion can occur, if left unchecked. The findings brought forth here should help increase the level of this awareness.

The capital requirement is taken to be the contribution of an exposure to the unexpected loss on the bank's diversified portfolio. Here we extend this approach to calculate capital requirements for equity investments. We show that in the case when asset values have a normal distribution an analytical formula for the unexpected loss contribution may be developed. We show that the capital requirements for equity investments are quite different to those of credit exposures, since equity investments can suffer substantial loss of value even when the underlying company has not defaulted. Unexpected loss is commonly used as a measure of capital requirements, but it ignores the ability of earnings to absorb loss. We propose a definition of capital requirement that recognises the expected earnings on assets, and show how to combine the ASRF model and the Capital Asset Pricing Model to compute this quantity for credit and equity exposures.

We test two predictions derived from work in psychology regarding the influence of norms. The first is a focusing influence, whereby norms only impact behavior when an individual's attention is drawn to them; and the second is an informational influence, whereby a norm exerts a stronger impact on an individual's behavior the more others he observes behaving consistently with that norm. We find support for both effects. Either thinking about or observing the behavior of others produces increased pro-social behavior - even when one expects or observes little pro-social behavior on the part of others - and the degree of pro-social behavior is increasing in the actual and expected pro-social behavior of others. This experiment eliminates strategic influences and thus demonstrates a direct effect of norms on behavior.

The study reveals that the actors within the service sector have vast new opportunities in terms of communication and value co-creation, but in the same time, the requirements regarding the quality of provided services trigger various problems for managers. The originality and value of this study consist of identifying logical connections between changes in the society, changes in the services, and changes in the service quality management. The findings of this study reveal that service quality management, as an integral part of the management of services, became more important within the knowledge-based economy as compared to the traditional (industrial) economy. Service quality management is knowledge-driven, it relies on people's continuous development, network-intense collaboration (sharing ideas and knowledge), and value co-creation to attain sustainable competitive advantage.

Maddison (2003) over the period spreading during 1950 and 2001. Toward this end, we employ highly flexible panel techniques which incorporate Multiple mean and slope shifts in the output series. Our findings are clearly supportive of regime-wise trend stationarity in Output after (1) allowing for cross-dependence and multiple breaks, and (2) removing four countries that exert undue influence on the whole panel. Remarkably, our main results hold true for alternative per capita real GDP proxies retrieved from the Penn World Table 6.2 as well as for different country-groups constructed on the basis of the country's participation in regional integration processes. Interestingly, the timing of the breaks broadly coincides with terms of trade shocks associated with large fluctuations in the price of primary commodities. Based on our results, we draw some policy prescriptions that point to the need for managing adequately terms of trade booms and busts to avoid large swings in Africa's aggregate output.

The authors consider aid proliferation-excess aid investment relative to recurrent cost-as a potential cause that undermines aid effectiveness, because aid projects can only produce sustainable benefits when sufficient recurrent costs are disbursed. They consider the donor's budget support as a device to supplement the shortage of the recipient's recurrent cost and to alleviate the misallocation of inputs. However, when donors have self-interested preferences for the success of their own projects over those conducted by others, they provide insufficient budget support relative to aid, which results in aid proliferation. Moreover, aid proliferation is shown to be worsened by the presence of more donors.","[Arimoto, Yutaka] Univ Tokyo, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Kono, Hisaki] Inst Developing Econ, Mihama Ku, Chiba 2618545, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Arimoto, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138657, Japan.",arimotoy@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp; Hisaki-Kono@ide.go.jp,,,,,,,27,10,11,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The empirical results based on the Euler equation approach and semi-annual firm level data from two major emerging markets, Mexico and Turkey, suggest that profits and rates of returns from fixed and financial assets have differential effects on fixed investment spending of real sector firms. Accordingly, increasing availability and accessibility of alternative investment opportunities in financial markets can become instrumental in channeling real sector savings to short-term financial investments instead of long-term fixed capital formation and thus lead to deindustrialization.

We examine the extent to which equity fund managers use index futures to manage fund flows and the effect this has on their alpha and market timing measures of performance. Our results show that funds that do not use derivatives exhibit lower returns and negative market timing skills when they experience fund flow. The performance of funds that use derivatives, however, is independent of investor's liquidity demands. In fact, the unconditional performance of the average user fund is statistically equivalent to the performance of the average non-user fund conditional on zero fund flow.

These predictions are useful e.g. in mean-variance portfolio analysis when the rebalancing frequency is lower than the data frequency. In this situation the conditional mean and the conditional covariance matrix of the cumulated higher frequency returns are required as inputs in the mean-variance portfolio problem. The empirical value of the result is evaluated by comparing the performance of quarterly and monthly rebalanced portfolios using monthly MSCI index data across a large set ofGARCH models. Using correct multistep predictions generally results in lower risk and higher returns. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Second, productivity exerts a procyclical, positive effect on employment but this effect becomes smaller after NAFTA.

Our analyses suggest that a borrowing firm's earnings management behavior generally decreases as the strength of bank monitoring increases. The strength of bank monitoring is measured as (1) the magnitude of a bank loan, (2) the reputation (rank) of a lead bank, (3) the length of a bank loan, and (4) the number of lenders. These results imply that bank monitoring plays an important role in the corporate governance of bank-dependent firms. We further examine other bank loan characteristics (collateral. refinancing, loan types, and loan purposes) and their effects on borrowers' earnings management behavior. Our analyses show that collateral and loan types are significantly associated with borrowers' earnings management behavior while refinancing and loan put-poses have no association.

Our results show that wealth gains are lower when shareholder rights are more suppressed. We also find that the premium paid for shares is inversely related to the strength of shareholder rights, and this suggests that managers pay higher premiums when shareholder rights are more restricted. These findings imply that managers use shareholders' funds to eliminate blockholders who are more likely to monitor them when shareholder rights are relatively weak, thereby entrench themselves. Consistent with this view, we further show that significant positive abnormal long-run returns after private stock repurchases are limited to firms with stronger shareholder protection. Overall, the evidence is consistent with the predictions of agency theory. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

During the time, they became almost unsolvable due to servitude to old ideas and approaches to goals, organization and managing the state and public sector, political work and everday public and business managing. The application of ruling ideology, performed during the nineties of the last century and the restoration of capitalism expressed itself as unproductive, because everything else remained the same - methods of work, approach, values and standpoint. Its basic feature is institutional non-regulation being the consequence of unclear, foggy and manipulated transition. There are multiple reflexion to the public healtcare system. First the space for the wild privatisation of one part of the public healthcare system was open as well as for the development of irregular partnership between the public and private sector in the production of public goods and services. Second, the creation of a complex, to distribution oriented coalition was initiated that, within the framework of historical heritage, very skillfully using its political and any other influence intended to retain such a situation and stop necessary structural changes in the public healthcare system and the regular development of the private sector as well. Third, within of the framework of foggy and damped transition, arose the miracuous mixture of quasi-public, quasi-market and administrative mechanisms of regulation that nonsensenses necessity for the existence of the public healthcare system. Conseqently, Serbia needs the total reingeneering as a radical, qualitative and on inovations based methodology which, on the basis of development vision, should determine the direction of institutional changes and various reformatory operations in order to construct a radically new public healthcare system - oriented to prevention and preservation of health capacity (of the whole national population) on the basis of development of the relevant system of life and work while the medical treatmant of the mayor part of maladies, especially of those needing sofisticated and costly technologies, should be awarded to the private sector on the basis of personal participation. The key of implementation is in the new definition of the contents of paradigm equity. Paradigm that the public health insurance should provide the best healthcare for everybody is false and financially untenable even for much more wealtheir societies. On the other side, equity means necessity to provide the health care in the framework of public, transparent and precise minimum standards for everbody (meaning that nobody will die because he is not insured, because he has not money for cure or, simply, as often happens in Serbia, because he do not know relevant people).","[Adzic, Sofija] Fac Econ, Subotica, Serbia; [Adzic, Jasminka] Med Sch, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Adzic, S (通讯作者)，Fac Econ, Subotica, Serbia.",adzic@eccf.su.ac.yu; jaasna@gmail.com,,,,,,,15,1,1,1,3,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,978-953-253-061-2,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2009,5.0,,,,,,515,+,,,,,,3,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BMP23,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273265800043,0

Comparing two California households that are similar in all respects except residential density, a lower density of 1000 housing units per square mile (roughly 40% of the weighted sample average) implies an increase of 1200 miles driven per year (4.8%) and 65 more gallons of fuel used per household (5.5%). This total effect of residential density on fuel usage is decomposed into two paths of influence. Increased mileage leads to a difference of 45 gallons, but there is an additional direct effect of density through lower fleet fuel economy of 20 gallons per year, a result of vehicle type choice.

Averch and Johnson (1962) argue that certain regulation of electric utilities provides utilities the incentive to purchase an inefficiently large amount of capital. Another possible and related unintended consequence of electric utility regulation is that regulatory cost disallowances on capital may also increase utilities' incentives to overcapitalize. The authors provide theoretical evidence that capital expenditure disallowances will increase the Averch and Johnson effect in some instances and thus may have contributed to the overcapitalization problem that regulation was designed to discourage.

Interestingly, range and point forecasts do not have differential effects on participants' earnings predictions, confidence judgments, and risk judgments.","Depaul Univ, Sch Accountancy & Management Informat Syst, DePaul Ctr, Chicago, IL 60604 USA",DePaul University,"Du, N (通讯作者)，Depaul Univ, Sch Accountancy & Management Informat Syst, DePaul Ctr, 1 E Jackson Blvd, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",ndu1@depaul.edu,,,,,,,29,18,21,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

For all three measures of poverty-headcount, gap, and squared gap-the impact of GDP growth on poverty reduction is a decreasing function of initial inequality. The impacts are similar in direction for SSA and non-SSA, so that within both regions there are considerable disparities in the responsiveness of poverty to income growth, depending on inequality. Nevertheless, the income-growth elasticity is substantially less for SSA, implying relatively small poverty-reduction response to growth.","UNU WIDER, FI-00160 Helsinki, Finland",,"Fosu, AK (通讯作者)，UNU WIDER, Katajanokanlaituri 6B, FI-00160 Helsinki, Finland.",fosu@wider.unu.edu,,,,,,,23,96,105,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Complexity is analysed in terms of five design dimensions which were systematically varied according to a macro experimental design. To study the influence of cross country differences on willingness to pay estimates, we combined datasets collected in Sydney, Santiago de Chile and Taichung city in Taiwan, all of them related to an equivalent route choice experiment. Several mixed logit models were specified and estimated; our results show that design dimensions do have an impact on the behavioural outputs of discrete choice models estimated on SC data. However, these influences seem to be data-specific, suggesting that the impact of design dimensions upon SC Outcomes may be local and not necessarily transferable across different Countries and cultures.

We propose a measure that we argue captures the various dimensions of effective state-business relations in sub-Saharan Africa. We then estimate standard growth regressions using dynamic panel data methods with this measure, along with the more conventionally used measures of institutional quality such as degree of executive constraints, the rule of law, the degree of corruption and the quality of the bureaucracy. Our results show that effective state-business relations contribute significantly to economic growth-countries which have shown improvements in state-business relations have witnessed higher economic growth, controlling for other determinants of economic growth and independent of other measures of institutional quality.","[Sen, Kunal] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Velde, Dirk Willem Te] Overseas Dev Inst, London, England",University of Manchester,"Sen, K (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England.",kunal.sen@manchester.ac.uk,,,,,,,42,38,43,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Given the task of feeding a growing population of more than 1.3 billion, especially with dramatically increased income level and rapid urbanization, grain production has been settled in one of very important position in policy agenda. Therefore, in China to what extent nature resources such as land and water can sustain the grain production is in question. By reviewing cultivated land protecting policies and institution reforms of water resources, we conclude that further institution reforms are needed, especially proper incentive structure needs to be taking into account in designing cultivated land protection policy to modify the failure of top-down mode. Institution reform such as water use rights reform, the role of water use associations and water pricing reform should be further enhanced to meet the increasing scarcity of water resources. Stagnation of institution reforms should be paid more attention by the policy makers.","[Shi Xiaoping; Heerink, Nico; Qu Futian] Nanjing Agr Univ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing Agricultural University,"Shi, XP (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",ftqu@njau.edu.cn; nico.heerink@wur.nl; serena2@njau.edu.cn,"Heerink, Nico/AAA-2045-2020","Heerink, Nico/0000-0002-9911-3501",,,,,44,0,0,0,0,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2016-1,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2009,,,,,,,41,51,,,,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5MI,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000373043700006,0

Drawn on the experience of Griliches' Knowledge Production Function (KPF), it constructs the updated KPF model. Under the frame of the updated KPF model, zone innovation output is of spatial correlation. According to the theory of spatial econometrics, it makes an empirical analysis for the effect of FDI, R&D expenditure and R&D personnel to technology innovation, taking the advantage of the Spatial Error Model (SEM). As a result, the spatial error coefficient lambda is 0.866, which goes through the significance test and indicates that there are obvious effects of zones innovation spatial spillover in the Zhejiang province. The coefficient of FDI and R&D expenditure is positive and goes through the significance test, which indicates their noticeable positively spatial diffusion (spillover) effect on the zone innovation output. But R&D personnel have an opposite effect, which indicates that the R&D efficiency is lower though the Full-time Equivalent (FTE) of R&D Personnel is larger. Therefore, the R&D expenditure with supporting policies should be increased successively at first. Secondly, it is necessary to optimize the soft environment for investment to attract FDI.

Statistics show that more and more world-class business firms are attaching great importance to job seeker's value during human recruitment and selection stage. Only those whose value match the value of the company can have more chances to get the job, and can possibly do the work well in a long run. This paper analyzes the values of companies and individuals should and must match in order to achieve company's goals. How the world-class business firms conduct their value-based recruitment and selection are discussed in depth in the paper.","[Wu Qizhi; Gao He] Yunnan Univ, Sch Business & Tourism, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China",Yunnan University,,victorwqz@sina.com,,,,,,,5,0,0,1,14,M & D FORUM,ALLAWAH,"17 AUGUSTA STREET, ALLAWAH, NSW 2218, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9806854-1-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,228,232,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BOT96,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277573000042,0

For an expendable crop input, the most important factor in determining whether producers share WOM initiative information with peers is how often they are asked for advice by their peers. In contrast, for an expendable companion animal product the most important factor in determining whether veterinarians share WOM initiative information with peers is whether they had a satisfactory experience in the WOM initiative.","[Fulton, Joan; Alexander, Corinne] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA; [Xu, Pei] Morrisville State Coll, Dept Agr Sci Business & Dairy, Morrisville, NY 13408 USA; [Akridge, Jay] Purdue Univ, Coll Agr & Prof Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47904 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; State University of New York (SUNY) System; Morrisville State College; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Fulton, J (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 403 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA.",xup@morrisville.edu; fultonj@purdue.edu; cealexan@purdue.edu; akridge@purdue.edu,"Akridge, Jay/L-6253-2019",,Beck Ag,Beck Ag,The authors would like to thank two anonymous reviewers for their thoughtful comments which improved the paper.

Major shareholders can use their control to monitor managers effectively, so it will reduce the agency costs and increase the value of companies, which is alignment effect. In this paper, we use no-parameter model and fixed effect model to estimate the relationship between the above effects and the percentage of the largest shareholders, and find that with the increase of the largest shareholders' shares, the performance of Chinese listed companies shows an N-type curve, representing alignment effect-entrenchment effect-alignment effect by turns. The attributes of the largest shareholders are also connected with the two effects, and the state-owned shareholders are easier to display the behaviors of the entrenchment effect, inducing that the performance is lower than the individual shares, and legal institute shares and foreign shares are not significantly connected with the performance; the introduction of other shareholders can effectively limit the largest shareholders and improve the performance of companies.","[Yao Yilong; Wang Liang; Chen Rui] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Lingnan Coll, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University,,lnsyyl@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,2,M D FORUM,ALLAWAH NSW,"17 AUGUSTA ST, ALLAWAH NSW, 2218, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9806854-2-8,,,,2009,,,,,,,644,652,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BPO33,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279533000078,0

The private firm is run by an entrepreneur and a venture capitalist (VC) (insiders) who desire to exit partially from the firm. A crucial factor driving their exit choice is competition in the product market: While a stand-alone firm has to fend for itself after going public, an acquirer is able to provide considerable support to the firm in product market competition. A second factor is the difference in information asymmetry characterizing the two exit mechanisms. Finally, the private benefits of control accruing to the entrepreneur post-exit and the bargaining power of outside investors versus firm insiders are also different across the two mechanisms. We analyze two situations: the first, where the entrepreneur can make the exit choice alone (independent of the VC), and the second, where the entrepreneur can make the exit choice only with the concurrence of the VC. We derive a number of testable implications regarding insiders' exit choice between IPOs and acquisitions and about the IPO valuation premium puzzle.","[Bayar, Onur] Univ Texas San Antonio, Coll Business, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA; [Chemmanur, Thomas J.] Boston Coll, Carroll Sch Management, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); Boston College,"Bayar, O (通讯作者)，Univ Texas San Antonio, Coll Business, 1 UTSA Cir, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.",onur.bayar@utsa.edu; chemmanu@bc.edu,,,,,,,28,75,96,4,77,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

In the early 1980s, predominance of cycle shocks gives way to strong negative spillovers of trend impulses, consistent with real business cycle theories. The coincident reduction of macroeconomic volatility was mainly caused by pronounced dampening of transitory disturbances.

On average, across estimation methods, a strengthening in the fiscal balance by 1 percentage point of GDP is associated with a current account improvement of about 0.3 percentage point of GDP. With our preferred estimation method (quarterly structural VAR using government consumption to identify fiscal policy shocks), the relationship is stronger, in the 0.3-0.5 range. The association is stronger in emerging markets and low-income countries; in economies that are more open to trade; and when the economy is somewhat overheated to begin with. The effect is, however, notably weaker during episodes of large fiscal policy and current account changes, suggesting that fiscal policy may have a more limited role in correcting large external imbalances.","[Abbas, S.

We study an economy in which operating firms are interdependent, where their success depends on the ability of other operating firms to obtain financing. In such an economy, an inefficient credit market freeze may arise in which banks abstain from lending to operating firms with good projects because of their self-fulfilling expectations that other banks will not be making such loans. Our model enables us to study the effectiveness of using alternative measures as a means of getting an economy out of an inefficient credit market freeze. In particular, we study the effectiveness of interest rate cuts, an infusion of capital into banks, direct lending by the government to operating firms, and the provision of government capital or guarantees to encourage privately managed lending. Our analysis provides a framework for analyzing and evaluating the standard and nonstandard instruments used by authorities during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Our analysis also provides testable implications for how firms, banks, and economies can be expected to be affected by shocks to the banking system.","[Goldstein, Itay] Univ Penn, Wharton Finance Dept, Wharton Sch, 2321 SH DH,3620 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bebchuk, Lucian A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Law, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Harvard University,"Goldstein, I (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Finance Dept, Wharton Sch, 2321 SH DH,3620 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",itayg@wharton.upenn.edu,"Goldstein, Itay/AAU-9170-2021; Bebchuk, Lucian A./H-2735-2014",,,,,,39,71,74,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

In recent years Park and Ride (P + R) facilities have been increasingly introduced by local authorities as an alternative for or addition to parking supply in the city centre. In this paper we present results of a survey amongst 45 major cities in Europe. We study how deployment of P + R is framed by policy makers within their broader transport policy. This paper offers three things. First, we report on present adoption levels of P + R. The survey outcomes reveal that P + R is adopted fairly unevenly across Europe. We find that a quarter of the responding cities are extensively engaged on implementing P + R, whereas another quarter has little or no engagement. It raises the question, if congestion is a problem present in most major cities across Europe, why adoption is so uneven? Therefore, secondly, we map out diversity in framing of P + R throughout European cities, by revealing current beliefs about it. We show how diversified policy-makers' interpretation of P + R is. Thirdly, we track the salient beliefs underlying the policy frames that determine P + R implementation. Linear regression analysis suggests that economic implications of P + R, perceived demand for P + R, and organisational learning capabilities are the most important drivers for city governments whether or not to engage in P + R development, explaining 40% of the variance in their actual engagement in P + R deployment.

Many scholars have asked about the motives and the consequences of these exports. Goetzmann and Ukhov [2006], using a modem portfolio theory approach, have shown that British capital exports were the consequences of both the opportunity and the understanding of diversification. Parent and Rault [2004] gave empirical evidence that French investments abroad were driven by economic and financial motives, not by diplomatic or political factors. In this paper we wonder whether French investors had understood the benefits of international diversification as British investors did and to what extend they have practiced it. We deliver a renewed database of domestic and foreign assets' yields quoted at the Paris Stock Exchange over the period 1874-1913. We find out that French investors had a very modem way to choose their portfolio investments, similar to Victorian investors. Using the modem portfolio theory, we highlight similarities between the evolution of Paris Stock Exchange capitalization and the structure of the market portfolio. We also find out a clear preference of French investors for foreign investments. This outcome calls into question the traditional view of the French rentier of the 19th century.","[Edlinger, Cecile; Parent, Antoine] Univ Nancy 2, BETA, F-54001 Nancy, France; [Merli, Maxime] Univ Strasbourg, EM Strasbourg, LaRGE, Strasbourg, France",Universite de Lorraine; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Edlinger, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nancy 2, BETA, F-54001 Nancy, France.",,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,12,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

This is the first study to test and corroborate how the CDS market responds to rating actions after controlling for the presence of concurrent public and private information. We show that since the clustering of rating announcements characterizes economically significant developments, the common practice of using uncontaminated samples underestimates market response. As in previous studies, we find that the market response to bad news is stronger than to good news. Nevertheless, bad news and negative rating announcements tend to cluster. Therefore, the residual contribution of negative rating announcements is small and in some cases insignificant. Positive rating announcements are less frequent and less clustered, though their residual contribution is still significant. (C) 2011 Elsevier By.

Average travel time was firstly reduced by expressway development; and it will be reduced further by the introduction of the inter-city rail system in 2011. The unevenness in regional accessibility remained relatively high during the initial stage of expressway development, but later expansion brought more balanced accessibility landscapes. The first stage (2010-2020) of inter-city railway development will raise the accessibility inequality. Its later effects, however, remain to be seen. Convenience in transport connections is associated with the spatial pattern of industrialization. In addition, accessibility improvement is tied to the direction of city-region development, as exemplified by Guangzhou's choice of Nansha, the city's outer port, as development focus.

Different explanations are provided to indicate how the shares of short-term (up to 3 months) and long-term (more than 1 year) unemployed people could affect the well-being of the employed and unemployed. Using data from almost 300,000 individuals from 11 EU countries, we find significant effects of both shares on life satisfaction.

Nevertheless, I argue that the evolution of standard-setting is more complex than this argument implies, and evaluate the economic basis of Demedian's arguments for how debt contracts respond to changes in accounting rules.

Participants were randomly matched into pairs and took a short multiple-choice test, the relative score of which determined their merit-based payoffs. After learning about the test scores, participants were asked to report them, thus affecting the final payoffs. Framing was varied as participants could either report their own scores or the scores of their counterparts. The presence of threat, or vulnerability to other players' dishonesty, was varied as either one or both players in a pair could misreport scores. Participants who reported their counterparts' scores were more likely to report honestly than participants who entered their own score. Participants, whose payoffs were threatened by their opponents' misreporting, were more likely to cheat to the fullest extent. Furthermore, we found that framing significantly reduced misreporting in the absence, but not in the presence of threat. Results suggest that when actors feel vulnerable to other people's dishonesty they would often cheat as much as they can in order to level the playing field, even when they strongly disapprove of the behavior.

Using panel data for Pennsylvania, we compare actual property tax rates to the Leviathan revenue-maximizing rates for municipalities, school districts, and counties.

We find that fiscal decentralization results in stronger intergovernmental competition and lower tax rates. We also find evidence of collusion among school districts that exhibit high interdependence but also high tax rates. This calls into question the current literature's blind use of spatial dependence as a measure of intergovernmental competition.","[Crowley, George R.; Sobel, Russell S.] W Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",West Virginia University,"Crowley, GR (通讯作者)，W Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, POB 6025, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",george.crowley@mail.wvu.edu; russell.sobel@mail.wvu.edu,,"Sobel, Russell/0000-0001-6820-5414",,,,,55,22,26,1,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,OCT,2011,149.0,1-2,,,SI,,5,30,,10.1007/s11127-011-9826-7,0.0,,,26,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,817QJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000294688600002,0

These restrictions came into effect in 1968 and lasted until mobility began to increase to some extent under the free trade agreements in the early 1990s. This is an unusual episode in Canadian history, the implications of which for the Canadian economy and for Canadian public policy appear to have received little attention. We assemble evidence that suggests that the near closing of the border led toward uncoupling of Canadian and US labour markets and to a decrease in the elasticity of labour supply in Canada. Implications for Canadian fiscal policy of a decline in labour elasticity are then derived using a model of equilibrium fiscal structure. We show that these predictions, including heavier taxation of labour income and an increase in the overall size of the public sector, are consistent with what occurred over the two decades after the near closing of the US border, as well as with the partial reopening following the free trade agreements. The analysis continues by acknowledging additional factors that determine the structure and size of the public sector, and by considering the near closing of the border in a broader historical context. We conclude with a prediction about the future course of Canada-US migration policy that follows from our analysis.","[Davies, James B.] Univ Western Ontario, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Winer, Stanley L.] Carleton Univ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Carleton University,"Davies, JB (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.",,"Winer, Stanley L/GLS-3909-2022","Winer, Stanley L/0000-0001-9128-0797",,,,,56,5,5,0,7,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

As in Barsky et al.

Next we incorporate the measured risk preferences into a household portfolio allocation model, which explains portfolio shares, while accounting for incomplete portfolios and fixed costs. Our results show that a measure based on factor analysis of answers to a number of simple risk preference questions has the most explanatory power. The Barsky et al. (1997) measure has less explanatory power than this a-the-oretical measure, suggesting that sophisticated measures based on economic theory may exceed the financial capability of respondents.

J,"Kim, NS; Van Wee, B",,,,"Kim, Nam Seok; Van Wee, Bert",,,The relative importance of factors that influence the break-even distance of intermodal freight transport systems,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Break-even distance; Intermodal freight; Monte Carlo method,COSTS,"The break-even distance of an intermodal freight system is a crucial piece of information for shippers as they decide whether to choose a specific freight transport system. It is also important for policy makers who want to demonstrate to shippers that the intermodal system is substantially more beneficial over a certain distance and encourage shippers to use it. However, the break-even distance is highly dependent on market situations. In other words, it is not possible to estimate the definitive break-even distance that is generally applicable. To date, the literature has addressed factors, including costs and distances, that impact the break-even distance without considering the relative importance of each of these factors. This study attempts to address this gap in knowledge by evaluating the relative importance of geometric and cost factors. The former includes drayage distances (i.e., pre- and post-haulage by trucks), truck-only distance, rail distance, the shape of the market area, and the terminal location, while the latter includes the drayage truck rate, the long-distance truck rate, the rail rate, and the terminal handling rate. Finally, by developing a Monte Carlo-based simulation model, the relative importance can be evaluated. The key finding is that the geometric factors and terminal handling costs are not more significant than the transport costs (i.e., rail costs and long-distance trucking costs) in general. Specifically, to shorten the break-even distance, either reducing the rail rate or increasing the truck rate is the most effective strategy. A 1% change in these factors is almost seven times, three times, and twice as effective as a 1% change in the handling costs at terminals, rail distance, and drayage cost, respectively. Furthermore, neither the oval-shaped market area nor a terminal relocation attracts customers to intermodal systems in general. When two options are combined, the synergic effect is significant.

Researchers have traditionally associated individualism with high rates of firm creation, arguing that an orientation towards achievement and the pursuit of personal objectives (dominant aspects in individualist cultures) are determinants of entrepreneurial activity. The current analysis shows that a country's culture correlates to entrepreneurship, but cannot uphold the idea that higher levels of individualism mean higher rates of entrepreneurship. Using data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor on 52 countries, the results show that a country's entrepreneurship rate is negatively related to individualism when development is medium or low, and positively related to individualism when the level of development is high. Thus, individualism is not related to entrepreneurship in the same way in countries with differing levels of development.","[Pinillos, Maria-Jose; Reyes, Luisa] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Pinillos, MJ (通讯作者)，Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Madrid, Spain.",mariajose.pinillos@urjc.es,"Recio, Luisa-Eugenia LERR Reyes/C-1666-2014","Pinillos, Mariajose/0000-0001-5526-7210; Reyes-Recio, Luisa Eugenia/0000-0002-5670-3384",,,,,70,180,221,3,112,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Accessibility is thus defined objectively for each area, contemplating its needs regarding production or consumption of cargo or promotion of intermodal transport of products. The proposed approach determines the most suitable area for locating the terminal according to the perception of each actor participating in the process as well as the set of actors, seeking to conjugate conflicting interests and facilitate convergence and the establishment of negotiated solutions. With this, it provides a more transparent and participative decision-making process and supplies basic elements for government bodies to formulate their socioeconomic development policies.

Commuting is, therefore, an important equilibrating vehicle in a City Network constellation. Cities act as attractors of commuters, as most economic activity occurs in cities, thus providing a high share of attractive workplaces. Cities that are centrally connected in a network may act as both centripetal and centrifugal forces in the whole system. The present paper focuses on what is named the City Network (CN) approach. A central idea is the accessibility concept, which is interpreted here as the potential of opportunity for interaction, which has a positive impact on economic growth. In our paper, the accessibility concept and the CN concept are linked together by positioning accessibility in the CN system. Since accessibility measures give geographical insights into the distribution of economic activities and the related (dis)equilibrium of regional development patterns, the connection with the labour market is evident, and, therefore, a second focus of our analysis. In an applied setting, our paper aims to investigate spatial accessibility patterns in the main CN in Germany. The 17 districts which belong to the country's CN were chosen from the 439 German labour market districts on the basis of three criteria: (a) their connection to the high speed railway network; (b) the most accessible districts according to previous results (2002); (c) relevant districts for the German economy. Our applied modelling research concerns home-to-work commuters travelling between the selected districts belonging to the German CN, for both 2003 and 2007. Here, a comparative analysis of the ranking of the most accessible districts - also for different intra-zonal travel times - is carried out in order to map out the changes in accessibility between 2003 and 2007, especially in the light of new high speed connections and commuting flow dynamics.

Differences in schools' intakes regarding characteristics such as mother's education are not accounted for due to the lack of background information in the data. In this paper, we use linked survey and administrative data to assess the potential biases that missing control variables cause in the calculation of CVA measures of school performance. We find that ignoring the effect of mother's education leads the DfE to erroneously overpenalise low-achieving schools that have a greater proportion of mothers with low qualifications and to over-reward high-achieving schools that have a greater proportion of mothers with higher qualifications. This suggests that collecting a rich set of controls in administrative records is necessary for producing reliable CVA measures of school performance.","[Dearden, Lorraine; Miranda, Alfonso; Rabe-Hesketh, Sophia] Univ London, Inst Educ, London WC1E 7HU, England; [Rabe-Hesketh, Sophia] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of London; University College London; UCL Institute of Education; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Dearden, L (通讯作者)，Univ London, Inst Educ, London WC1E 7HU, England.",ldearden@ifs.org.uk; A.Miranda@ioe.ac.uk; sophiarh@berkeley.edu,"Miranda, Alfonso/AHC-1802-2022; Dearden, Lorraine M/D-4926-2017; Dearden, Lorraine/AAO-6720-2020; Rabe-Hesketh, Sophia/B-1643-2008","Miranda, Alfonso/0000-0002-8176-0946; Dearden, Lorraine M/0000-0002-9529-8860; Rabe-Hesketh, Sophia/0000-0002-5257-4837",ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,15,18,20,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0143-5671,,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

Conversely, low long-term interest rates do not soften lending standards.

Although numerous studies have investigated the effects of information quantity on individual-level decisions, it is still unknown how the amount of attribute information affects group-level patterns of behavior, particularly when consumers are also aware of a choice's popularity. In the present studies, we hypothesized that when attribute information increases, it may exceed the individual's cognitive capacity to process this information, and as a result conformity - choosing the most popular item - becomes more likely. In this study, we first examined empirical data collected from human subject experiments in a simulated online shopping experience, and then developed an agent-based model (ABM) to explore this behavioral clustering. Both studies confirmed our primary hypotheses, and the ABM shows promise as a tool for exploring extensions of these ideas. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, rather than relying solely on the sensitivity of industry returns, we examine the cash flow sensitivity to foreign exchange exposure, of primary interest to firm managers. Critically, decomposing the exposure into cash flow and discount rate components unlocks the exact extent and nature of exposure. Our results show industries have significant cash flow and discount rate exposures.

In contrast to prior research on the anomalous properties of hedge fund returns, we observe the mechanisms used to price the fund's investment positions and report the fund's performance to investors, thereby allowing us to differentiate between asset illiquidity and misreporting-based explanations. We find that funds using less verifiable pricing sources and funds that provide managers with greater discretion in pricing investment positions are more likely to have returns consistent with intentional smoothing. Traditional controls, however, such as removing the manager from the setting and reporting of the fund's net asset value and the use of reputable auditors and administrators, are not associated with lower levels of smoothing. With respect to asset illiquidity versus misreporting, investment style and portfolio characteristics explain 14.0-24.3% of the variation in our smoothing measures, and pricing controls explain an additional 4.1-8.8%, suggesting that asset illiquidity is the major factor driving the anomalous properties of self-reported hedge fund returns.","[Cassar, Gavin] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Gerakos, Joseph] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Pennsylvania; University of Chicago,"Gerakos, J (通讯作者)，5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",cassar@wharton.upenn.edu; jgerakos@chicagobooth.edu,"Cassar, Gavin/A-1038-2007","Cassar, Gavin/0000-0002-2097-7738",,,,,42,31,37,0,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Basic findings of these studies are: Fasting leads to decrease in alertness and perception, and increase in incidence of headaches, lethargy and irritability. Economic implications of these consequences constitute the basis for this paper The preliminary aim is to propose a regressor for examining the effect of fasting on production and then to quantify this effect. According to the estimation results, Ramadan effect on production is found to be significant. Negative coefficient for that regressor implies Ramadan has attenuator effect on production.

From a theoretical point of view, we argue that this result is related to a set of labor market reforms introduced in many OECD countries, which affected the relative strictness of institutions.","[Lopez-Villavicencio, Antonia] Univ Paris N, Paris, France; [Ignacio Silva, Jose] Univ Girona, Girona, Spain",Universitat de Girona,"López-Villavicencio, A (通讯作者)，Univ Paris N, Paris, France.",,"; Silva, Jose I/G-3365-2015","Lopez-Villavicencio, Antonia/0000-0002-4569-4742; Silva, Jose I/0000-0002-0425-6199",,,,,24,5,5,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

We construct a new dataset with information on 604 companies and 63 universities in Spain and group the data across 36 geographical areas from 2001 to 2004 (144 observations). After controlling for several traditional cost factors and agglomeration characteristics, we find that university spillovers are relevant in explaining the location of new businesses in high-technology sectors in Spain.

However, activist-sponsored say-on-pay proposals target large firms, not those with excessive CEO pay, poor governance, or poor performance.

This paper uses approximately 18000 annual observations on euro area banks over the period 2001-2008 and presents strong empirical evidence that low-interest rates indeed increase bank risk-taking substantially. This result is robust across a number of different specifications that account, inter alia, for the potential endogeneity of interest rates and/or the dynamics of bank risk. Notably, among the banks of the large euro area countries this effect is less pronounced for French institutions, which held on average a relatively low level of risk assets. Finally, the distributional effects of interest rates on bank risk-taking due to individual bank characteristics reveal that the impact of interest rates on risk assets is diminished for banks with higher equity capital and is amplified for banks with higher off-balance sheet items.

We find that youths are generally pessimistic about probabilities of their own deaths and being violent crime victims. After smoking initiation, youths increase subjective probabilities of death by more than the objective increase in mortality risk, implying recognition of potential harms. Virtually all 12-14 year-olds know that smoking causes heart disease. The minority who believe that smoking causes AIDS are less likely to become smokers; i.e., risk misperceptions deter rather than cause smoking initiation.

The first component-flow-driven risk-is large, accounting for approximately 50% of market variance, and it is not transient. This risk represents the joint effect of net trade demand and the price impact of that demand-i.e., illiquidity. We find that flows are largely unpredictable, and lagged flows have no price impact. Flow-driven risk is time varying because price impact is highly variable. Illiquidity rises with market volatility, but not with flow uncertainty. Net selling increases illiquidity, which amplifies downside flow-driven risk. The findings are consistent with flow-driven shocks resulting from fluctuations in aggregate risk-bearing capacity. Under this interpretation, investors with constant risk tolerance should trade against such shocks (i.e., supply liquidity) to achieve substantial utility gains. Quantitatively accounting for the scale of flow-driven risk poses a major challenge for asset pricing theory.","[Deuskar, Prachi; Johnson, Timothy C.] Univ Illinois, Coll Business, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Deuskar, P (通讯作者)，340 Wohlers Hall,1206 S 6th St, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",pdeuskar@illinois.edu,"Deuskar, Prachi/F-8164-2015","Deuskar, Prachi/0000-0001-6431-8833",,,,,28,29,33,1,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

In addition, it provides evidence that established banks react by lowering the interest rates that borrowers pay, thus reducing bank system profits. In contrast, banks are able to sustain higher bank profit margins during recessions. These findings suggest that this pricing strategy is aimed at deterring the entry of new bank competitors into highly segmented regional retail niches. Consequently, monopolistic banking not only creates an inefficient wedge between lenders and borrowers but, as credit becomes cheaper in booms and more expensive during recessions, it further contributes to macroeconomic volatility. Empirical evidence for 124 countries and a general equilibrium model suitable to quantify the welfare losses of this monopolistic framework are provided.","Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Res Dept, Atlanta, GA 30309 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Atlanta,"Mandelman, FS (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Res Dept, 1000 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30309 USA.",federico.mandelman@atl.frb.org,,,,,,,56,11,11,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

The paper analyzes the sequence of coping strategies and the background factors behind the sequence. Self-insurance, the dissaving of assets or cash, is given priority over intra-party strategies, such as loans or gifts. The reason for this lies in the persistent severe credit constraints faced by households, both in terms of access and cost (high level of interest rates), and the absence of strong social norms for mutual insurance in the community. Both factors appear to force these households to self-insure themselves from the outset.","JETRO, Inst Developing Econ, Chiba, Japan",,"Okamoto, I (通讯作者)，JETRO, Inst Developing Econ, Chiba, Japan.",,,,,,,,27,9,9,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

Among the fixed-price offerings, 84% of issuers would have had lower total issue costs in terms of the sum of gross spread and SEO underpricing, if the bookbuilding procedure was selected instead. It raises a question: Why do most SEO issuers in Taiwan prefer the costly fixed-price offer to the bookbuilding offer? Extending Barry (1989), we propose a measure of wealth loss to the existing shareholders to analyze this question. After considering the effect resulting from the pre-emption rights held by the existing shareholders, we find that the average wealth loss of fixed-price offerings is less than that of the bookbuilding offerings.

In this context, workplace training plays an essential role for the harmony of interdependence between community and company. This paper provides a top-down analysis of training effects and a model for an empirical evaluation of explanatory variables for training intensity in the case of a multinational telecommunications company. The analysis of training effects revealed that there are important motivational, social and functional benefits for the employee. Empirical results were dependent on the calculation method of training intensity. Thus, the percentage of employees from a subsidiary, which participates in a training program, is related to the degree of market development but not to the average labour productivity. Nevertheless, when training intensity is expressed as the number of hours of training compared to the total person-hours worked, there is empirical evidence that both labour productivity and market development can be accepted as explanatory variables.

Explorative econometric methods have been utilised that combine the analysis of dimensionality with subset variable selection and multiple linear regression. Both NIS hypotheses are thereby supported, although slightly different in the cases of the mainland and island nations. It is concluded that expressions of openness have a larger impact on the number of NIS per unit territorial area in the mainland nations, whereas biota variables play a more dominant role in the case of the island nations. It is also concluded that different expressions of NIS occurrence affect the result, where NIS per area unit facilitates excellent explanatory performance.","[Gren, Ing-Marie] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Thierfelder, Tomas] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Energy & Technol, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Berglund, Helena] Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Lund University,"Gren, IM (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, POB 7013, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",ing-marie.gren@ekon.slu.se; tomas.thierfelder@et.slu.se; helena.berglund@ekol.lu.se,"Berglund, Helena/GOH-3411-2022","Berglund, Helena/0000-0003-0066-5128",,,,,40,4,4,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Certain natural resources called point-source, such as oil and minerals, exhibit concentrated and capturable revenue patterns, while revenue flows from resources such as agriculture are more diffused. Developing countries that export the former type of products are regarded prone to growth failure due to institutional failure. We present an explicit model of growth collapse with micro-foundations in rent-seeking contests with increasing returns. Our econometric analysis is among the few in this literature with a panel data dimension. Point-source-type natural resource dependence does retard institutional development in both governance and democracy, which hampers growth.

In this paper, models are developed to assess how two alternative policy approaches impact a herder's decisions on carnivore hunting and livestock protection. We find that while the well-established ex-post compensation policy induces suboptimal livestock protection it can generate sufficient incentives for the herder to refrain from hunting so that the carnivore population reaches its socially optimal level. Performance payments are proposed as alternative policy. They are found not to distort livestock protection incentives and can also help achieve a socially optimal carnivore population level. Which of the two scheme types gives rise to less cost is ambiguous.

We identify age and income as important determinants of preference classes in both surveys and age is also identified as a key determinant of variability (scale).

The failure rate of these IPOs is lower than in the US for larger IPOs, probably because of lax delisting rules and the market's capacity to refinance non-profitable firms. The survival of new issuers is significantly associated with their characteristics at the IPO and with the level of initial listing requirement they meet. The involvement of reputable intermediaries in the IPO process mitigates this effect. Success, estimated by the graduation to a senior exchange, is not linked to the financial conditions at the IPO.

Financial markets, in particular derivative markets, provide fertile ground for understanding how perceptions of economic uncertainty and cash-flow risk manifest themselves in asset prices. We demonstrate that the variance premium, defined as the difference between the squared VIX index and expected realized variance, captures attitudes toward uncertainty. We show conditions under which the variance premium displays significant time variation and return predictability. A calibrated, generalized long-run risks model generates a variance premium with time variation and return predictability that is consistent with the data, while simultaneously matching the levels and volatilities of the market return and risk-free rate.

Based on motivation theory and switching cost, we propose a research model to examine several factors that affect bloggers' intention to switch to social networking sites. The results suggest that relative usefulness, effectiveness of expression and relative playfulness are positive factors to motivate bloggers' switching and switching cost is negative factor to inhibit switching intention. Furthermore, switching cost has the moderating effects to weaken the positive influences of effectiveness of expression and relative playfulness on switching intention.

Motivation and needs are basic dynamics in the person's behavior and foundation of learning and training for each activity and profession. This paper gives brief theoretical approach to motivation in general, students' motivation, and theories on profession choice. It addresses the important question on how potential students in Bosnia and Herzegovina attend to absorb and store data in order to make logical and rational decisions when choosing the undergraduate program and what motivates them. Quantitative research was conducted for analyzing the motivation and needs for the undergraduate program selection. Survey was conducted among students who completed high school education in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The main goal of this study is to determine the level of individual motivational factors as predictors for selection of the degree program. Four hypotheses were defined and confirmed by the research. Several factors are identified as potential motives: clearly defined life goals, level of student's curiosity, aspiration, creativity, achievement and socialization. Research aim was accomplished through the quantitative analysis of affirmative answers to the survey question, specially designed for this purpose. Authors had used a random sample for questionnaire, and those results were processed, analyzed and a conclusion was given in the accordance with the research objectives. Regression and correlation indicators showed good and very good motivation of high school students for vocational training. Their career's goals have slightly higher values than their motivation to achieve these goals. In the time of the economic downturn, it is difficult to predict what professions are going to be popular. The overall trend is moving toward the practically oriented skills, and away from the theoretical and philosophical ones. Theoretical, practical and economic contribution of this paper is in the knowledge of the relevant factors of motivation and need in the process of selection of carrier, and therefore success of studying and future career.","[Husic-Mehmedovic, Melika; Kadic, Selma; Arslanagic, Maja] Sch Econ & Business Sarajevo, Dept Mkt, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Sarajevo,,melika.husic@efsa.unsa.ba; selma.kadic@efsa.unsa.ba; maja.arslanagic@efsa.unsa.ba; poprzenovicalma@yahoo.com,"Husic-Mehmedovic, Melika/C-3420-2019; Arslanagic-Kalajdzic, Maja/V-1582-2018","Husic-Mehmedovic, Melika/0000-0002-0802-2752; Arslanagic-Kalajdzic, Maja/0000-0002-4954-782X",,,,,40,0,0,0,1,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

Paired sample t-test was used as a technique to test the significance of bank loans before and after the introduction of SMEEIS. Mean scores and standard deviation was used to present and analyze the primary data obtained via questionnaires. The result shows that there was no significance difference between the loans disbursed by banks to SMEs before and after the introduction of SMEEIS and the conditions for accessing SMEEIS funds was beyond the reach of the predominant SMEs in Nigeria. This shows that SMEEIS, as a formal financing option, has not made any significant impact towards SMEs growth in Nigeria. The major recommendation is that both the government and the banking sector should mutually agree on a credit guaranteed scheme strategy that will incorporate a. risk-sharing arrangement as a way of encouraging the banks to channel funds to the SMEs sub sector for their growth and development which would translate into the national economic growth and sustainable economic development of Nigeria.","[Isa, Kabiru Dandago] Bayero Univ, Bayero Consultancy Serv Unit, Kano, Nigeria; [Terungwa, Azende] Benue State Univ, Dept Accounting, Accounting & Finance, Makurdi, Nigeria",Bayero University; Benue State University,"Isa, KD (通讯作者)，Bayero Univ, Bayero Consultancy Serv Unit, Kano, Nigeria.",kidandago@gmail.com; tazende@yahoo.com,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,2,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8720-9,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,4.0,,,,,,416,+,,,,,,2,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX59,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303217400082,0

Externalities of their activities affect the economy deeply. Therefore, regulation of their behavior is of utmost importance for the general public. In addition, national and supranational prudential authorities request various forms and extents of mandatory disclosure. Nevertheless, voluntary disclosure is being recognized by the banks as a mechanism of asymmetric expectations' reduction and confidence enhancement of current and potential both shareholders and stakeholders. Upgrading information availability and updating its quality might be a useful way of reducing the probability of systemic banking crisis as well as a useful tool for improving market discipline. However, the causes and consequences of banks' disclosure of accounting and other information are still challengeable issues in financial literature. In that regard, the purpose of the paper is to explore the determinants of Croatian banks' online disclosure of financial information. Bank specific and industry specific factors of disclosure are being empirically examined using univariate and multivariate statistical methods. Further research objective is to compare the volume and the structure of mandatory disclosed information using content analysis. It is expected that banks with higher transparency achieve significantly better financial performance. However, the paper does not empirically investigate benefits or drawbacks of both mandatory and voluntary disclosure.

Law 25/2007 replaces separate laws on foreign and domestic investment from 1967 and 1968, and provides a single legislative framework for domestic and foreign investment. The law states that all business sectors are open to investment, including foreign investment, unless specified in a presidential regulation containing Indonesia's Investment Negative List (DNI). This paper summarises the results of four sector studies undertaken to review implementation of the investment law. The purpose of the DNI is to provide certainty to investors by documenting restrictions in a single list, thereby eliminating the power of ministries to set their own rules. This paper finds that, in practice, considerable uncertainty remains, arising particularly from the law's implementing regulations. Furthermore, new ministerial decrees and laws appear to bypass the list and may reflect a trend towards greater restriction of foreign investment in Indonesia.","World Bank, Jakarta, Indonesia",The World Bank,"Magiera, S (通讯作者)，World Bank, Jakarta, Indonesia.",,,,,,,,21,9,9,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-4918,,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Since prior studies suggest that corporate ownership could influence reporting quality, this paper argues that the family and government ownership, which are common in Malaysia could have some influence on the recognition of goodwill impairment loss. Evidence shows that family controlled firms are more likely to record impairment of goodwill than non-family controlled firm. The effect is however not significant for government controlled firm. In addition, firms that are expected to engage in income smoothing behavior significantly report higher magnitude of goodwill impairment loss than firms that are not expected to engage in income smoothing behavior. Additional analysis suggests that firms are more likely to recognize and record higher goodwill impairment loss in the first year of impairment standard adoption than in the years afterwards. The result of this study contributes to current literature by providing the evidence that managers in family controlled firm has significant influence on goodwill impairment.","[Omar, Noraini; Mohd-Saleh, Norman] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi 43600, Malaysia",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Omar, N (通讯作者)，Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi 43600, Malaysia.",,,,,,,,15,1,1,0,2,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9084-1,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,11.0,,,,,,400,404,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000392766500077,0

The protection provided by patents is more useful in some industries than in others. For example, chemical and pharmaceutical firms are large users of the patent system partly because innovations within these industries tend to be relatively cheap to imitate. Companies within these industries see patent registration as an important part of maintaining competitive advantage.

This rejection implies that the risk premium on both real and nominal bonds varies predictably over time. We also find strong evidence that the spread between the nominal and the real bond risk premium, or the breakeven inflation risk premium, also varies over time. We argue that the time variation in real bond risk premia most likely reflects both a changing real interest rate risk premium and a changing liquidity risk premium, and that the variability in the nominal bond risk premia reflects a changing inflation risk premium.

The question is how much of the occurrence of a crisis can be attributed to market expectations and how much to fundamentals. The model is estimated using a Markov switching framework in which the devaluation expectations affect crisis probability via three different specifications. Such a framework which allows for sunspots performs better than a purely fundamental-based model. The study shows that besides the fundamentals in the economy, shifts in agents' devaluation expectations have played a crucial role and that a Markov switching model with constant transition probabilities provides better estimates for the Turkish currency crises.

In a recent report IMF analyses the link between the weak balance sheets of governments and the banking sector revealing new tensions in financial markets, particularly in the Euro area. Further, ECB points out that it is crucial to integrate the monetary and fiscal policies, both at a national and EU level. Therefore, at a national level, a list of priorities would start with restoring public debt sustainability, increasing savings and enhancing potential growth. And at the EU level, fiscal consolidation should be undertaken in a way that would minimize its negative impact on the real economy. Moreover, monetary policies should be guided as to mitigate market volatility while ensuring banks' liquidity and efficient actions taken in order to eliminate weaknesses in balances sheets while safeguarding lending capacity. By using econometric methods as Granger causality or panel-data regression, we capture the interdependencies between the real economy and the financial market, considering the isolated influences of other factors like: effects of global financial crisis on monetary union, differences between Euro area countries, etc. Our results show the existence of a bidirectional causality between stock market and monetary policy, while there is no causality between stock market and real economic growth.","[Tepus, Ana-Maria; Andrei, Elena-Adriana] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Toader, Adelina] Duisenberg Sch Finance, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Tepus, AM (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",anamaria.tepus@yahoo.com; adrianna_andrei@yahoo.com; ade.toader@gmail.com,,,Prof. Anghelache Gabriela and Prof. Huidumac Petrescu Catalin,Prof. Anghelache Gabriela and Prof. Huidumac Petrescu Catalin,The authors of this paper would like to thank Prof. Anghelache Gabriela and Prof. Huidumac Petrescu Catalin for the support and advice in the setting of the research sample and methodology.,,23,0,0,0,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-6-9,,,,2011,,,,,,,597,+,,,,,,3,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEO28,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000317550000055,0

Using a unique and detailed data set on the Swedish manufacturing sector, I am able to separate plants into those owned by foreign MNEs, domestic MNEs, exporting non-MNEs, and purely domestic firms. In line with previous findings, the result, when conditioned on other factors affecting survival, shows that foreign MNE plants have lower survival rates than non-MNE plants. However, separating the non-MNEs into exporters and non-exporters, the result shows that foreign MNE plants have higher survival rates than non-exporting non-MNEs, while the survival rates of foreign MNE plants and exporting non-MNE plants do not seem to differ. Moreover, the simple non-parametric estimates show that domestic MNE plants are more likely to exit the market than other plants, also when controlling for plant-specific differences. Finally, foreign presence in the market seems to have had a negative impact on the survival rate of plants in non-exporting non-MNEs, but not to have affected plants in exporting non-MNEs or plants in domestic MNEs.","[Bandick, Roger] Univ Aarhus, Aarhus Sch Business, Inst Business & Technol, DK-7400 Herning, Denmark; [Bandick, Roger] Univ Aarhus, Aarhus Sch Business, Dept Econ, DK-7400 Herning, Denmark",Aarhus University; Aarhus University,"Bandick, R (通讯作者)，Univ Aarhus, Aarhus Sch Business, Inst Business & Technol, Birk Ctr Pk 15, DK-7400 Herning, Denmark.",roger@hih.au.dk,,"Bandick, Roger/0000-0003-3211-9084",,,,,34,30,31,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

The main insights are (i) aggressive investment strategies are disastrous for the clients; (ii) in most cases it is optimal to gear the bonus reserve; and (iii) the results are far less sensitive to the agent's risk aversion than in the classical case of Merton (1969), and as opposed to Merton horizon matters even with constant investment opportunities (because of the serial dependence between bonuses).

A trade liberalization increases the permanent income of the representative agent, because it removes trade distortions. The increase in permanent income leads to a corresponding increase in the steady state stock of durable goods, and a fall in labor supply. The fall in labor input reduces investment, which tends to generate a current account surplus. To increase the stock of durables savings falls, which tend to generate a current account deficit.

Standard real business cycle models with search frictions but a homogeneous labor force are able to generate some volatility and persistence, but not enough to match the empirical evidence. Moreover, empirical studies emphasize the importance of the heterogeneity of the unemployment pool to fully understand unemployment dynamics. In particular, in most European countries the incidence of long-term unemployment is large and well known. One of the possible causes/consequences of long-term unemployment is the skill deterioration of the unemployment pool. In this paper, we introduce the skill loss mechanism, and therefore a heterogeneous labor force, in a New Keynesian framework with search frictions. Calibrating the model for the Spanish economy, we show that while the skill loss mechanism helps to explain the magnitude of the response of unemployment to monetary shocks, it does not improve the performance of the homogeneous worker model in terms of the persistence of the response, especially for short- and long-term unemployment.","[Faraglia, Elisa] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge,,julen@grips.ac.jp; efaraglia@london.edu,,"Faraglia, Elisa/0000-0003-1755-0618",,,,,23,6,6,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

However, this approach recommends huge fluctuations in positions, enormous changes in portfolios for minor changes in maturities and no presumption it is always optimal to issue long and invest short term in a wide array of model specifications. These extreme, volatile and unstable features are undesirable for two reasons. Firstly fragility of portfolios to small changes in assumptions means that it is often better to follow a balanced budget rather than issue the optimal debt portfolio under some possibly misspecified model. Secondly for even miniscule transaction costs, governments prefer a balanced budget rather than the large positions complete markets recommends. The complete market recommendations conflict with a number of features we believe are integral to bond market incompleteness, e.g. transaction costs, liquidity effects, robustness, etc. and which need to be explicitly incorporated into the portfolio problem.

This literature also claims that the twin theorems are empirically misleading and irrelevant. The present essay argues that the critics have exaggerated the empirical failure of the twin theorems and, more importantly, they have missed the central message of the theorems; especially, that of Stolper-Samuelson on the optimality of free trade.

How does globalization affect IC? While the topic is of great importance, empirical studies on the issue in the literature have been limited. This article attempts to close the gap by estimating the role of foreign direct investment (FDI) and international trade with cross-country data in 1985 and 1998. Taking advantage of a recently constructed IC index, we estimate several regression models of effects of FDI and trade on industrial performance. Results suggest that FDI and trade have a positive impact on IC, and increasing integration with the world economy through FDI and trade contributes to better industrial performance.

The crisis represents an unexplored negative shock to the supply of external finance for non-financial firms. Corporate investment declines significantly following the onset of the crisis, controlling for firm fixed effects and time-varying measures of investment opportunities. Consistent with a causal effect of a supply shock, the decline is greatest for firms that have low cash reserves or high net short-term debt, are financially constrained, or operate in industries dependent on external finance. To address endogeneity concerns, we measure firms' financial positions as much as four years prior to the crisis, and confirm that similar results do not follow placebo crises in the summers of 2003-2006. Nor do similar results follow the negative demand shock caused by September 11, 2001. The effects weaken considerably beginning in the third quarter of 2008, when the demand-side effects of the crisis became apparent.

Firms shape markets rather than the other way around, because of the role organizational innovation plays in redefining the rules of selection in the operating environment. Of such innovations, some proportion will remain proprietary, while others become diffused more widely in the industry, as the choices made by pioneering firms are imitated by others. We argue that the combination of increasing interconnections between geographically dispersed markets and the greater use of market-based transactions have intensified the incentives for MNEs to engage in the development of new routines, and to formalize them into transferable practices. This is likely to increase the overall transparency of the origins of firm capabilities, leading potentially to more specialization and less internalization at the industry level.","[Dunning, John H.] Univ Reading, Dept Econ, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England; [Lundan, Sarianna M.] Univ Bremen, Fac Business Studies & Econ, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",University of Reading; University of Bremen,"Dunning, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Dept Econ, POB 218, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England.",s.lundan@uni-bremen.de,,"Lundan, Sarianna/0000-0001-5348-0106",,,,,82,100,115,2,67,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

We present three hypotheses about the likely effects of trade opening on the following five dimensions of the psyche: mirth (smiles), anger, addiction, stress, and regret. To test the hypotheses we use a survey of similar to 605 people >= 16 years of age from a highly autarkic native Amazonian society of foragers and farmers in Bolivia (Tsimane') with high levels of impulsivity. As explanatory variables we use four measures of trade opening and a wide range of controls. Regret at buying durable assets during the previous year and addiction bore a positive association with two measures of trade opening: monetary income in the last 2 weeks and outstanding monetary debts owed to one or owed to the rest of the world. International trade theory predicts that trade opening expands choices in consumption, but among impulsive people in a highly autarkic society, more choice can beget more addiction and buyer's regret.

To control for learning we run the experimental markets three times with identical subjects at identical information levels. With questionnaires we further check whether the results are driven by subjects' overconfidence. To obtain benchmarks and to measure the impact of the asymmetric information structure on traders' abnormal returns, we run two simulation settings. In the experimental markets insiders outperform the market and uninformed computerized random traders perform equally well compared to average informed traders. This is in line with the results of the equilibrium simulation in which agents choose between a random strategy and their fundamental strategy until equilibrium is reached. Similar to the equilibrium simulation, insiders mainly use a fundamental strategy while average and weak informed subjects ignore the fundamental information given to them. Our benchmark simulations also show that the latter would have ended up worse if they would have used their fundamental information in the experiment. When looking for behavioral explanations we find no evidence for overconfidence and learning in the markets, thus concluding that the information structure is the main driver of our results.?

When the agent has prospect theory preferences relative to the target I show that a performance target can induce greater effort, but, when set too high, it eventually induces lower effort. Also, the agent's preferences for risk-taking hinge on whether the target is set above or below expected output. I find that the principal's optimal target exceeds expected output.

This study uses three measures for domestic demand, namely household consumption, government consumption, and investment. The results show bidirectional Granger causality among these variables, namely exports, domestic demand, and economic growth. Thus, there is a dynamic relationship among exports, domestic demand, and economic growth. Exports and domestic demand are both important for economic growth in China. Moreover, economic growth in China has an impact on its exports and domestic demand.

Since little research has considered how dealers make this trade-off, we empirically investigate how dealers jointly make these decisions in the foreign exchange market using a unique simultaneous equations model. Our model uses an ordered probit model to account for the discrete nature of order aggressiveness and a censored regression model to capture the quantity decision recognizing the clustering of orders at the smallest available quantity, $1 million. Using two currency pairs with very different trading characteristics, we find evidence of a trade-off between order aggressiveness and quantity. We also find a significant role being played by factors related to the levels of information asymmetry and liquidity in the dealers' choices of both the order aggressiveness and quantity.

In our sample of all US publicly traded firms in 2000-2007, we find that companies which have directors with private equity deal exposure gained from interlocking directorships are approximately 42% more likely to receive private equity offers. The magnitude of this effect varies with the influence of directors on their current boards and the quality of these directors' previous take-private experience, and it is robust to the most likely classes of alternative explanations endogenous matching between directors and firms and proactive stacking of board composition by management. The analysis shows that board members and their social networks influence which companies become targets in change-of-control transactions. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Based on a sample of U.S. VC investments between 1980 and June 2009, we find more reputable VCs (older, larger, more experienced, and with stronger IPO track record) and VCs with broader networks exhibit less local bias. Staging and specialization in technology industries increase VCs' local bias. We also find that the VC exhibits stronger local bias when it acts as the lead VC and when it is investing alone. Finally, we show that distance matters for the eventual performance of VC investments. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Shortfalls in aid coincide with shortfalls in GDP and government revenues. This increases the consumption volatility in aid dependent countries, thereby causing substantial welfare losses. This paper finds that indexing aid flows to exogenous shocks, like a change in the terms of trade, can significantly improve the welfare of an aid-dependent country by lowering its output and consumption volatility. Compared to the benchmark specification with stochastic aid flows, indexation of aid flows to terms-of-trade shocks can reduce the cost of business-cycle fluctuations in the recipient country by 4% of permanent consumption. Moreover, use of indexed aid can allow donors to reduce the aid flows by 3% without lowering the level of welfare in the recipient country.","Indian Inst Management, Bangalore, Karnataka, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Bangalore,"Dhasmana, A (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.",,,,,,,,19,0,1,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0012-1533,,,DEV ECON,Dev.

However, that work-and the overwhelming bulk of the empirical literature on determinants of exit or firm survival-dealt entirely with the manufacturing sector of the economy. This paper analyzes annual US data for 1989-2005 for about 50 wholesale and retail sectors to explain small firm exit rates in several employment size categories. The main result is that wholesalers respond negatively to a stronger currency in a manner similar to that of manufacturers, while retailers are generally unaffected.","American Univ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Feinberg, RM (通讯作者)，American Univ, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",feinber@american.edu,,"Feinberg, Robert/0000-0001-8087-3853",,,,,17,4,4,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

We then conduct asset pricing tests in the in-sample and out-of-sample contexts. Our analyses show that the ex ante factors are a key component in asset pricing and forecasting. By using the ex ante factors, the DFPM improves upon the explanatory and predictive power of other competing models, including unconditional and conditional versions of the Fama and French (1993) 3-factor model. In particular, the DFPM can explain and better forecast the momentum portfolio returns, which are mostly missed by alternative models.","[He, Zhongzhi (Lawrence)] Brock Univ, Fac Business, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada; [He, Zhongzhi (Lawrence)] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Huh, Sahn-Wook] SUNY Buffalo, Sch Management, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Lee, Bong-Soo] Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",Brock University; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"He, ZZ (通讯作者)，Brock Univ, Fac Business, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada.",lhe@brocku.ca; swhuh@buffalo.edu; blee2@cob.fsu.edu,"Lee, BongSoo/AAP-3262-2020",,,,,,45,9,11,1,18,UNIV WASHINGTON SCH BUSINESS & ADMINISTRATION,SEATTLE,"C/O OFFICE MANAGER, 115 LEWIS HALL, BOX 353200, SEATTLE, WA 98195-3200 USA",0022-1090,,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

To account for the large fluctuations of oil prices (the terms-of-trade) and their effects on the current account, an intertemporal current account model incorporating such effects is devised. The model estimation reveals significant terms-of-trade effects on the current account and, moreover, does not exhibit any excess capital mobility found in the previous literature. These results indicate that to achieve a more accurate measure of international capital mobility, a proper account of the terms-of-trade effect is essential. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We estimate a multi-level voting process where individuals face a participation decision (whether to vote or abstain) and a voting decision (whether to vote strategically for a likely winner party or as communicating for a sure loser party). Our main findings can be summarized as follows. First, individuals who are either independent or uninformed are less likely to turnout. However, being both independent and uninformed does not have any statistically significant effect on electoral participation. Thus, our results question the empirical relevance of the swing voter's curse theory in large elections. Second, the probability of voting as communicating is positively related with the level of education and the degree of dissatisfaction with the political system. Finally, political preferences and institutional features characterizing the functioning of the political system and of the media market have a significant effect both on electoral participation and on the voting decision.

Using a sample of 180 public-to-private LBOs in the US between January 1, 1997 and August 15, 2007, we find that reputable PEGs are more active in the LBO market when credit risk spreads are low and lending standards in the credit markets are lax. We also find that reputable PEGs pay narrower bank and institutional loan spreads, have longer loan maturities, and rely more on institutional loans. In addition, while we find that PEG reputation is positively related to buyout leverage (i.e., LBO debt divided by pre-LBO earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITDA) of the target), and leverage is significantly positively related to buyout pricing, we do not find any direct relation between PEG reputation and buyout valuations. The evidence suggests that PEG reputation is related to LBO financing structure not only because reputable PEGs are more likely to take advantage of market timing in credit markets and but also because PEG reputation reduces agency costs of LBO debt.

The Role of Networks on Migration and Coyote Use,REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SELF-SELECTION; UNITED-STATES; MEXICO; IMMIGRANTS,"While a large literature has established that migration experience among an individual's family and community networks tends to encourage migration, there is little research investigating the mechanism by which networks exert such effects. This paper aims to determine the relative importance of three potential benefits provided by networks: information on border crossing, information on jobs, and credit. We develop empirical tests of these effects based on a simple model that allows individuals to choose between migrating alone or with the help of a border smuggler. Using a dataset of undocumented Mexican migrants to the United States, we find that larger family networks encourage both migration and coyote use, consistent with the job information hypothesis. In contrast, community networks appear to provide crossing information. The finding that family networks have a smaller impact for asset holders indicates that some of the benefit the family network provides is a source of credit.","[Dolfin, Sarah] Math Policy Res, Princeton, NJ 08543 USA; [Genicot, Garance] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Mathematica; Georgetown University,"Dolfin, S (通讯作者)，Math Policy Res, POB 2393, Princeton, NJ 08543 USA.",sdolfin@mathematica-mpr.com; gg58@georgetown.edu,,,,,,,27,61,70,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

In contrast, relatively heavily traded stocks with low short interest experience both statistically and economically significant positive abnormal returns. These positive returns are often larger (in absolute value) than the negative returns observed for heavily shorted stocks. Thus, the positive information associated with low short interest, which is publicly available, is only slowly incorporated into prices, which raises a broader market efficiency issue.

As a result, a foreign exporter finds it optimal to vary its markup in response to shocks that change the exchange rate, insulating import prices from exchange rate movements. With increased trade integration, exporters have become more responsive to the prices of their competitors, explaining a sizeable portion of the observed decline in the sensitivity of U.S import prices to the exchange rate.

Examining three climate scenarios for 2100, the models predict average losses of between -42% to -54% of land value in Mexico.

As one important argument, the Porter hypothesis claims that tighter regulation improves financial performance. This study provides empirical evidence on this debated effect. In particular, we employ panel data analysis to examine the effect of Clean Water Act regulation, as measured by permitted wastewater discharge limits, on expected future financial performance, as measured by Tobin's q, for publicly owned firms in the chemical manufacturing industries. We find that tighter permitted discharge limits lower Tobin's q; i.e., more stringent Clean Water Act regulation undermines expected future financial performance. By decomposing Tobin's q into its constituent components-market value and replacement costs-and estimating each component separately, we find that tighter permitted discharge limits lower both components with a larger impact on market value, which implies that investors revise their expectations of the discounted present value of future profits in response to changes in Clean Water Act regulation.","[Earnhart, Dietrich] Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",University of Kansas,"Rassier, DG (通讯作者)，PricewaterhouseCoopers,350 S Grand Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90071 USA.",dylanrassier@yahoo.com; earnhart@ku.edu,,,,,,,52,62,64,2,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We examine the cyclicality of budget items among provincial governments in seven federations, showing that own-source taxes are generally highly procyclical, and contrary to common wisdom, revenue sharing and discretionary transfers are either acyclical or procyclical. Constituent governments are thus left alone to smooth their own shocks, and we document the extent to which various restraints on borrowing and saving undermine their ability to do so. The resulting procyclicality of provincial fiscal policy is likely to have important implications in a world where demands for countercyclical fiscal policy are increasing but considerable fiscal responsibilities are being devolved to subnational governments.","[Rodden, Jonathan] Stanford Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wibbels, Erik] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Stanford University; Duke University,"Rodden, J (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 616 Serra St,Encina Hall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jrodden@stanford.edu,,,,,,,45,50,63,0,20,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

Financial crises and instabilities aroused the discussion of the evaluation of monetary system. This debate is related in some way to Hayek proposal for currency competition. Hayek view is that money is a result of consumer choice and competitive process. The interventions of central banks have destabilized the monetary system. In this context, Hayek suggests that currency competition would be capable of providing a stable monetary system. Hayek proposal has been criticized by many modern economists. Since Hayek disregard the evolution of money banking system and central banking. It is highly problematic in methodological terms. Nowadays there are broad controversies over whether money and banking should be managed by public regulators or left to the market. This paper focuses on this controversy in relation to Hayek proposal for currency competition.","[Isik, Sayim] Akdeniz Univ, IIBF, Iktisat Bolumu, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey",Akdeniz University,"Isik, S (通讯作者)，Akdeniz Univ, IIBF, Iktisat Bolumu, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey.",sayim@akdeniz.edu.tr; lfakguc@kastamonu.edu.tr,"AKGUC, Lutfiye Filiz/HQZ-8892-2023; Isik, Sayim/C-2384-2016","AKGUC, Lutfiye Filiz/0009-0001-1779-392X;",,,,,129,0,0,1,10,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

Our results indicate that these technical workers exhibit substantial sensitivity to differences in wages but that they have even stronger preferences for living close to family and friends. The magnitude of these preferences, moreover, suggests that the greater geographic mobility of scientists and engineers, relative to the population as a whole, stems from more pronounced variation across regions in the wages that they can expect. These results remain robust to estimation on a sample of individuals who must select new places of work for reasons unrelated to their preferences-those who had been employed at establishments that discontinued operations.

The rapid rise in CEO pay over the past 30 years has sparked an intense debate about the nature of the pay-setting process. Many view the high level of CEO compensation as the result of powerful managers setting their own pay. Others interpret high pay as the result of optimal contracting in a competitive market for managerial talent. We describe and discuss the empirical evidence on the evolution of CEO pay and on the relationship between pay and firm performance since the 1930s. Our review suggests that both managerial power and competitive market forces are important determinants of CEO pay, but that neither approach is fully consistent with the available evidence.

The focus of the article is on identifying those entrepreneurs' attributes and firm characteristics that tend to generate a significant number of high-growth firms in these countries. To this end, we use a quantile regression, which provides a more complete estimation of the growth distribution of firms conditional on different attributes. The results indicate that firms that engage in product innovation, have their own transport means and are connected to the internet through their own website are especially characterized by higher growth rates and also display a distribution of growth rates skewed to the right, hosting a higher number of high-growth firms. The effect of the last two variables, which relate to distance-bridging modes of infrastructure, points to the self-reinforcing growth effects they generate in creating wider input and output markets. Education raises growth opportunities by affecting the lower quantiles, but it does not appear to influence the upper quantiles. The estimated conditional growth distributions for the technology-intensive machinery and electronics sectors show more extreme tails and a lower mean in comparison to the traditional industries, indicating the more risky nature of doing business in these industries.","[Goedhuys, Micheline] UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Goedhuys, Micheline] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Sleuwaegen, Leo] Catholic Univ Louvain, Vlerick Leuven Gent Management Sch, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium",Maastricht University; Maastricht University; Universite Catholique Louvain; KU Leuven; Vlerick Business School,"Goedhuys, M (通讯作者)，UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands.",Goedhuys@merit.unu.edu; leo.sleuwaegen@econ.kuleuven.be,,"Goedhuys, Micheline/0000-0003-4222-2106; Sleuwaegen, Leo/0000-0002-7396-0606",,,,,60,176,188,1,71,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We design two financial assets that embed the Monty Hall problem, a well-studied choice anomaly. Our experiment requires each subject to value one of these assets. Although these assets are equivalent in terms of standard choice theory, valuation experience with one of the assets lowers the subjects' cognitive error rates more than valuation experience with the other asset.

Risk management is a discipline which comprises methods and principles that are part of the lifecycle of a project. Successful realization of projects and their application greatly depend on the risk management. The risk represents high probability that some kind of a problem will occur in the future. Due to complexity and the impossibility of controlling all the details, there is the possibility that something unexpected is going to happen. The risk is a reality that accompanies every event and does not cause damage in itself. The damage occurs in case we expose ourselves to risk. In that case the resulting damage is usually related only to its correction. Companies should adapt and react fast to the variable market requirements and high risk, since they are constantly exposed to various types of risks. Risk usually accompanies every business and directly affects the result. Therefore, risk management is constantly necessary in an environment where the operating and business conditions change fast, in order to achieve the strategic advantages of a company. The example of introducing a new monitor system in the process of pressing on glass-producing machines will be used to process the risks that occurred in connection with this project. For glass containers to be able to meet the market requirements, apart from a well designed container it is also necessary to achieve excellent distribution of glass (uniform wall thickness of the glass container), which can be realized through a production process, the so-called NNPB (Narrow Neck Press and Blow Process) [1]. In order to improve the production and raise the quality of the finished products, various systems are being introduced, one of which is also WISEPPC (Wireless Sensor Plunger Position Control) [2] of the system that monitors the pressing procedure on the glass-producing machines, and at the same time also the automatic regulation of the glass droplet mass.","[Kovacec, Miroslav] Vetropack Straza DD Glass Factory, Hum Na Sutli 49231, Croatia; [Pilipovic, Ana] Fac Mech Engn & Naval Architecture, Sect Polymer Proc, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb Faculty of Mechanical Engineering & Naval Architecture,"Kovacec, M (通讯作者)，Vetropack Straza DD Glass Factory, Hum Na Sutli 49231, Croatia.",miroslav.kovacec@vetropack.hr; ana.pilipovic@fsb.hr,"Verdonschot, John/F-9196-2018",,"Ministry of Science, Education and Sports of the Republic of Croatia; Vetropack Straza","Ministry of Science, Education and Sports of the Republic of Croatia(Ministry of Science, Education and Sports, Republic of Croatia); Vetropack Straza","This work is part of the research included in the project Increasing Efficiency in Polymeric Products and Processing Development, which is part of program Rapid Production From Vision to Reality supported by the Ministry of Science, Education and Sports of the Republic of Croatia.

It is shown that without aid, the loss of sugar preferences has devastating impact on real output, exports, rural employment, and other macroeconomic indicators. Without aid, the EPA scenarios, on the other hand, lead to some growth in real output but depress rural employment and non-sugar agricultural exports. Although improvements are observed across the scenarios with aid, it is argued that aid would be more effective if it directly addresses the supply-side constraints in Fiji instead of focusing on the sugar sector.
