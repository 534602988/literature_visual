A multiple testing approach",ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,PIRLS; Multiple testing; Multi-country comparisons,FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; COUNTRIES; RATES,"Using PIRLS (Progress in International Reading Literacy Study) data, we investigate which countries' schools can be classified as significantly better or weaker than Germany's as regards the reading literacy of primary school children. The 'standard' approach is to conduct separate tests for each country relative to the reference country (Germany) and to reject the null of equally good schools for all those countries whose p-value satisfies p(i) <= 0.05. We demonstrate that this approach ignores the multiple testing nature of the problem and thus overstates differences between schooling systems by producing unwarranted rejections of the null. We employ various multiple testing techniques to remedy this problem. The results suggest that the 'standard' approach may overstate the number of significantly different countries by up to 30%.

For the first time in almost 100 years since the fall of the Ottoman Caliphate, a Muslim government introduces Shariah currency. In the eyes of many Muslim scholars, the present interest-based fiat monetary system is flawed as it is incompatible with the objectives of the Islamic law or the Shariah. There have been calls for the resurgence of Islamic Gold Dinar (together with the silver dirham) as it is deemed to be the most appropriate medium of exchange to be used in the Islamic economies. Using data from 1970 to 2007, this paper assesses the empirical desirability of the Organization of Islamic Conferences (OIC) countries to an alternative monetary system (Islamic Gold Dinar) that can potentially enhance the exchange rate stability and credibility. The Structural Vector Autoregression (VAR) method is employed to assess the nature of macroeconomic disturbances among the OIC countries. Specifically, the symmetry in macroeconomic disturbances of the OIC economies is examined as satisfying one of the preconditions for forming an Optimum Currency Area (OCA). In addition, this paper also investigates the output and price responses of OIC countries of the underlying structural shocks used to shed light on the suitability of these countries to form a monetary union. The preliminary findings of this study suggest the lack of broad linkages within the entire OIC, although there exists scope among some smaller clusters for potential monetary integration based on the symmetry of their business cycles.

In contrast to the simple framework of single domestic market with foreign entry by entry mode of foreign direct investment (FDI) or exports, our result shows that government should increase the degree of privatization along with increasing proportion of domestic ownership of multinational firms. Furthermore, we show that an increase in domestic ownership of multinational firms raises all domestic private firms' profit and social welfare, while it may either increase or decrease public firm's profit. With the aid of numerical example, intensive competition from private firms in general will enhance the degree of privatization gradually; in particular, the degree of privatization is lower in the presence of multinational firms.

On average, openness promotes growth, but its effect on growth is negative when the levels of openness and domestic performance both are very low. The effect of domestic performance on growth is always positive averagely and locally, but its effect on growth is decreasing when the economy experiences the initial stage of globalization and domestic performance. Our result makes a useful contribution to the globalization debate because the distinction between openness and domestic performance shows how different economies can perform and improve in each aspect. Among the developing economies, openness is a necessary and prerequisite condition for growth, but the achievement of a high level in domestic performance is also important for growth.","[Li, Kui-Wai] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xianbo] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Econ, Lingnan Univ Coll, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong; Sun Yat Sen University,"Li, KW (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",efkwli@cityu.edu.hk,,"Li, Kui-Wai/0000-0001-9834-0027",,,,,12,2,2,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Furthermore, relative deprivation matters only for native-born who subjectively underestimate their well-being, but not for those who overestimate it. When considering other forms of native-born individuals' perceived disadvantage, such as in terms of employment, access to education or medical facilities, there is weak evidence that only a perceived disadvantage in obtaining medical aid negatively affects attitudes.

A notable behavioral implication is that exposure to informational advertising can decrease the consumer's tendency to purchase the promoted product. The structural estimates imply that an exposure to a single advertisement decreases the consumer's probability of not choosing her best alternative by approximately 10%.

This permits a full-fledged equilibrium/welfare analysis of network formation with endogenous productive efforts and heterogeneous agents.

When the intrinsic returns to production and socialization increase, all equilibrium actions decrease at the Pareto-superior equilibrium, while they increase at the Pareto-inferior equilibrium.

To that end, we formulate a simultaneous game of pricing and targeted advertising with two firms producing different levels of quality. We find that the transition from uniform advertising to targeted advertising can turn a pure vertically differentiated market into a hybrid market which incorporates some features of a monopoly, thus changing the pattern of price competition between the firms. In particular, we show that (1) compared to uniform advertising, targeting leads both firms to always charge higher prices, (2) the increase in prices is more intense in highly competitive (low differentiated) markets, (3) the expected price of the low-quality firm is non-monotonic with the degree of product differentiation, and (4) the low-quality product may be sold at a higher expected price than the high-quality product. We also show that a progressive growth of specialized advertising vehicles leads to a further increase in prices. In addition, more specialized targeting may raise price competition, so firms may find it optimal to use low specialized targeting.","[Esteban, Lola; Hernandez, Jose M.] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ, Dept Anal Econ, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Hernández, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ, Dept Anal Econ, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",hernande@unizar.es,"Hernández, José/JKI-8418-2023","Hernández, José/0009-0006-6689-6980",,,,,18,5,5,2,13,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

In contrast, the influence of exchange and unemployment rates proved to be insignificant and the lagged interest rate is significant only for Denmark. The empirical results support the contention that central banks usually design their interest rate policies based on the Taylor Rule.","[Zhou, Sherry Z.

Replacing liquidation with reorganization induces significant allocational consequences across education groups. Overall, reorganization improves welfare relative to liquidation.

Its popularity can be attributed to the simplicity of its characterization of development - an average of achievements in health, education and income - and to its underlying message that development is much more than economic growth. The index was originally conceived by the late Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq, in collaboration with Amartya Sen and other scholars, as a response to their dissatisfaction with GDP as the standard measure of development. As Haq noted, Any measure that values a gun several hundred times more than a bottle of milk is bound to raise serious questions about its relevance for human progress. Yet the HDI's very simplicity prompted critiques from the start, with some contending that it was too simplistic, while others who accepted its self-imposed limitations still questioned its choice of indicators and its computational methodology. This article discusses the concept and key insights learnt from the HDI, provides a detailed review of key critiques of the HDI, today and in the past, and explains the recent changes introduced to the HDI formula and indicators. Recent controversies are highlighted and placed in the context of longer running debates. The innovations to broaden the measurement of deprivations and disparities in human development are introduced, with some key global and regional insights.","[Klugman, Jeni; Rodriguez, Francisco; Choi, Hyung-Jin] UNDPs Human Dev Report Off HDRO, New York, NY USA",,"Klugman, J (通讯作者)，UNDPs Human Dev Report Off HDRO, New York, NY USA.",jeni.klugman@undp.org,"Rodriguez, Francisco/IZP-6348-2023","Rodriguez, Francisco/0000-0002-3774-7517",,,,,82,205,227,3,74,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

The model is calibrated to data from Taiwan, a country that experienced rapid economic growth while undergoing significant demographic transition. Our results suggest that more than one-third of the output growth in Taiwan during the past four decades can be attributed to demographic transition, while TFP growth explains another third and the remainder is mainly due to skill-biased technological progress.

I analyze two datasets that report different expenditure categories and cover the time periods 1970-1997 and 1990-2006, respectively. The results suggest that government ideology has had a rather weak influence on the composition of governments' budgets. Leftist governments, however, increased spending on Public Services in the period 1970-1997 and on Education in the period 1990-2006. These findings imply, first, that government ideology hardly influenced budgetary affairs in the last decades, and thus, if ideology plays a role at all, it influences non-budgetary affairs. Second, education has become an important expenditure category for leftist parties to signal their political visions to voters belonging to all societal groups.","Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, D-78457 Constance, Germany",University of Konstanz,"Potrafke, N (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, Box 138, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",niklas.potrafke@uni-konstanz.de,,,,,,,99,77,88,0,34,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

We model this relative price in a flexible price international economy with two fundamental shocks, namely, the total factor productivity (TFP) shock and the investment-specific technology (IST) shock. We show that the one-to-one correspondence between the IST shock and the relative price of investment goods breaks down in an international economy because of the short-run correlation between the terms of trade and the relative price of investment goods. The data congruent negative correlation between the investment rate and the relative price of investment goods thus does not necessarily reflect decline in investment frictions (rise in IST), as suggested by many studies. A calibration experiment with the US data demonstrates that such an inverse relation between rate of investment and the relative price of investment goods basically reflects the positive effect of TFP on the terms of trade for a broad range of economies where the home bias in consumption exceeds investment and there is a sizable adjustment cost of investment.Est-ce que le prix relatifs des biens d'investissement est un bon indicateur du changement technique fonde sur l'investissement? On construit un modele du prix relatif des biens d'investissement dans une economie internationale a prix flexibles soumis a deux chocs fondamentaux : la productivite totale des facteurs (TFP) et le changement technique fonde sur l'investissement (IST). On montre que la correspondance bijective entre le choc IST et les prix relatifs des biens d'investissement disparait dans une economie internationale a cause de la correlation a court terme entre les termes d'echange et les prix relatifs des biens d'investissement. La correlation negative entre le taux d'investissement et les prix relatifs des biens d'investissement (qu'on retrouve dans les donnees) ne reflete donc pas necessairement un declin dans les frictions d'investissement (accroissement de IST) comme certaines etudes le suggerent. Un effort de calibration a l'aide de donnees americaines montre qu'une telle relation entre le taux d'investissement et le prix relatif des biens d'investissement reflete l'effet positif de la TFP sur les termes d'echange pour un grand eventail d'economies ou la preference pour les produits domestiques est plus grande dans les biens de consommation que dans les biens d'investissement, et qu'il y a donc un ajustement considerable dans le cout de l'investissement.","[Basu, Parantap] Univ Durham, Durham DH1 3HP, England; [Thoenissen, Christoph] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand",Durham University; Victoria University Wellington,"Basu, P (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Durham DH1 3HP, England.",parantap.basu@durham.ac.uk; christoph.thoenissen@vuw.ac.nz,,"Thoenissen, Christoph/0000-0002-7843-8219",,,,,23,5,5,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0008-4085,,,CAN J ECON,Can.

This is because by changing income expectations and volatility, redistribution changes the attractiveness of default and thus endogenous borrowing constraints. Extending results by Krueger and Perri (2011) [8], this paper analyses the conditions under which redistribution can improve private insurance by making default less attractive to the income-rich, whose income it reduces. I first explain why public redistribution typically crowds out private insurance in the two-income economy, and identify the role of income persistence and saving after default. Second, I show how, in endowment economies with three income states or more and in economies with capital, redistributive taxes can improve, or crowd in, private consumption insurance. Finally, in a quantitative exercise using a realistic income process calibrated to US micro-data, moderate redistribution crowds in private insurance with production but not in an endowment economy.

We then use Principal Components Analysis to generate a firm- and year-specific 'innovativeness' index by extracting the common variance in a firm's patenting and R&D expenditure histories. To begin with, we explore the heterogeneity of firms by using semi-parametric quantile regression. We then move on to parametric regressions that include a weighted least squares (WLS) analysis, which explicitly takes into account the different job-creating potential of firms of different sizes. As a result, we investigate the effect of innovation on total number of jobs, whereas previous studies have focused on the effect of innovation on firm behavior. Indeed, previous studies have typically taken the firm as the unit of analysis, implicitly weighting each firm equally according to the principle of 'one firm equals one observation'. Our results suggest that firm-level innovative activity leads to employment creation that may have been underestimated in previous studies.","[Coad, Alex] Max Planck Inst Econ, Evolutionary Econ Grp, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Coad, Alex] Univ Sussex, Freeman Ctr, SPRU, Brighton BN1 9QE, E Sussex, England; [Coad, Alex] Univ Paris 01, CNRS, Equipe MATISSE, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, F-106112 Paris, France; [Coad, Alex; Rao, Rekha] St Anna Sch Adv Studies, LEM, Pisa, Italy; [Rao, Rekha] Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",Max Planck Society; University of Sussex; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; University of Bath,"Coad, A (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Econ, Evolutionary Econ Grp, Kahla Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",coad@econ.mpg.de; r.rao@bath.ac.uk,"Coad, Alex/H-8938-2012","Coad, Alex/0000-0002-5706-0528",,,,,72,73,81,0,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

We use monthly data for the period January 1980 to February 2009 for four Latin America, namely, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico. We conduct our analysis by means of cointegration analysis and multivariate Granger causality tests. The main finding of our analysis suggests that stock and foreign exchange markets in these economies are positively related and that the U.S. stock market acts as a channel for these links. Moreover, it is shown that these links are independent of foreign exchange restrictions. Finally, stability tests proposed by Hansen and Johansen (1993) are applied and it is shown that the dimension of the cointegration space is sample independent while the estimated coefficients exhibit instability in recursive estimations. Instability in these long-run relationships is evident during the Mexican currency crisis of 1994-1995, the Asian crisis of 1997 and the 2007-2009 credit and financial crisis.

Available evidence, however, shows them being subject to constant or decreasing returns to scale. The empirical findings of Gischer and Stiele can more convincingly be explained by assuming savings banks abide by their legal goals to pursue the public interest.","Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Volkswirtschaftliches Inst, D-90020 Nurnberg, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Neumann, M (通讯作者)，Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Volkswirtschaftliches Inst, Postfach 3931, D-90020 Nurnberg, Germany.",neumann-lauf@t-online.de,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1465-6485,,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

This question is of particular concern in the energy markets dominated by cartel-like affiliations (OPEC and oil, Russia's gas exports to Europe) and the interest and practice to stimulate the development of alternative fuels. Making the realistic assumption that none of the players can commit to future policies, subsidies are not a viable strategy for the government. A tax cannot be first best but can be second best if the government cannot force the incumbent monopoly to sell its output at no profit and if the incumbent's profit is discounted. However, stimulating supply by improving the conditions for entry is not the prime concern of taxation (after all it lowers aggregate supplies and may even lower the entrant's supply) but to accrue parts of the monopoly rent.

At the same time, draft lottery estimates of the earnings consequences of Vietnam-era service are close to zero in 2000. The earnings and schooling results can be reconciled by a flattening of the age-earnings profile in middle age and a modest economic return to the schooling subsidized by the GI Bill.

We find that a decline in mean inflation after IT adoption is not necessarily associated with a similar fall in RPV and that what matters most for the structural changes in RPV is the initial inflation regime prior to the adoption of IT rather than IT adoption itself. IT adoption impacts the shape of the underlying relationship between inflation and RPV in countries with initially high inflation rates, moving it from monotonic to the U-shaped profile observed consistently for countries with low-inflation regimes. The minimum point of this U-shaped curve is indicative of the public's expectations of inflation and is very close to the announced target for inflation in most of the countries we study.","[Choi, Chi-Young] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Econ, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Kim, Young Se] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 110745, South Korea; [O'Sullivan, Roisin] Smith Coll, Dept Econ, Northampton, MA 01063 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Smith College,"Choi, CY (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Econ, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.",cychoi@uta.edu,,,,,,,37,9,9,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

The analysis is based on an equilibrium model developed by Just and Weber (Energy Econo 30:3198-3221, 2008) for reserve markets. It reveals the implicit trade-off for the bidders and implicit interdependencies between the reserve and the spot markets. Even if the markets are not explicitly coordinated, they are interrelated through the dispatch decisions of the power plant owners. The paper concludes that the current German reserve market design is inefficient and should be improved. The results clearly show that shorter periods (with resulting lower variations in overall electricity demand) lead to more efficient dispatch and market results. Not only prices in the reserve capacity markets are expected to be lower, but also spot market prices. As these benefits can be partially reaped by owners of large generation portfolios also under longer contract durations, it discriminates against smaller generation companies and can potentially deter market participation. Further, the paper takes a broader perspective and discusses security concerns against shorter contract durations. It is shown that the opportunity costs character of the reserve market implies sufficient incentives for supplying online reserve capacity. The concerns do not appear to be predominant and it should be possible to manage them appropriately.","Univ Duisburg Essen, Chair Energy Econ & Management Sci, D-45117 Essen, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen,"Just, S (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Chair Energy Econ & Management Sci, Univ Str 12, D-45117 Essen, Germany.",Sebastian.Just@wiwinf.uni-due.de,,,,,,,41,15,15,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Although the evaluator cannot commit ex ante to an acceptance criterion, she decides up front between informed review, where the agent's ability is directly observable, or blind review, where it is not. An ideal acceptance criterion balances the goals of incentive provision and project selection. Relative to this, informed review results in an excessively steep equilibrium acceptance policy: the standard applied to low-ability agents is too stringent and the standard applied to high-ability agents is too lenient. Blind review, in which all types face the same standard, often provides better incentives, but it ignores valuable information for selecting projects.

We show that the model exhibits a unique interior steady state which is asymptotically stable under real wage adjustment dynamics of the type considered in Blanchard and Katz (1999), and under a type of Okun's Law that links the level of utilization of firms to their hiring and firing decision. The introduction of a company pension fund can be shown to contribute to the viability of the analyzed economic system. However, when credit is incorporated in the model, in place of savings-driven supply side fluctuations in economic activity, investment-driven demand side business cycle fluctuations (of a probably much more volatile type) can take place.

The theory underlying our model is consistent with Melitz (2003). A nonlinear structural estimation procedure identifies a set of core parameters and unobserved firm-level trade frictions that best fit the geographic pattern of trade. Our estimation model is consistent with the specified general equilibrium model, and we conduct general equilibrium counterfactual analyses to illustrate model responses. We first assess the economic effects of reductions in measured tariffs. Taking the simple-average welfare change across regions the Melitz structure indicates welfare gains from liberalization that are four times larger than in a standard trade policy simulation. Furthermore, when we compare the economic impact of tariff reductions with reductions in estimated fixed trade costs we find that policy measures affecting the fixed costs are of greater importance than tariff barriers.

Employers' reticence to hire in the preceding expansion, associated in part with a lack of confidence it would last, contributed to an employment shortfall equivalent to 40 percent of the missing employment decline in the recession. Another 20 percent may be explained by wage moderation. A third important element was the widespread adoption of working time accounts, which permit employers to avoid overtime pay if hours per worker average to standard hours over a window of time. We find that this provided disincentives for employers to lay off workers in the downturn. Although the overall cuts in hours per worker were consistent with the severity of the Great Recession, reduction of working time account balances substituted for traditional government-sponsored short-time work.","[Burda, Michael C.] Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Hunt, Jennifer] Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Burda, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",,,,,,,,62,112,120,0,25,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

We focus primarily on understanding contemporaneous differences in the level of spending, generally from the 2000s. Medical spending differs across countries either because the price of services differs (for example, a coronary bypass surgery operation may cost more in the United States than in other countries) or because people receive more services in some countries than in others (for example, more bypass surgery operations). Within the price category, there are two further issues: whether factors earn different returns across countries and whether more clinical or administrative personnel are required to deliver the same care in different countries. We first present the results of a decomposition of healthcare spending along these lines in the United States and in Canada. We then delve into each component in more detail-administrative costs, factor prices, and the provision of care received-bringing in a broader range of international evidence when possible. Finally, we touch upon the organization of primary and chronic disease care and discuss possible gains in that area.","[Cutler, David M.; Ly, Dan P.] Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Cutler, DM (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",dcutler@fas.harvard.edu; dan_ly@hks11.harvard.edu,,"Cutler, David/0000-0002-4949-8917",NIA NIH HHS [P01 AG031098] Funding Source: Medline,NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,63,62,78,0,19,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

The market-clearing mechanism introduces a pecuniary externality that individual rational households do not consider when making decisions but a publically shared rule of thumb can exploit. For typical calibrations, the improvement of the welfare of irrational households is robust to the introduction of rational agents. Although transitions to the optimal irrational steady state are not Pareto improving, transitions do exist that will improve a Pareto social welfare function with a sufficiently small generational discount rate. Generalizing to a more realistic lifecycle model, we find that the Save More Tomorrow (TM) (SMarT) Plan, if properly parameterized, can confer higher lifetime utility than the permanent-income rule.

Assuming a twist (= generalized Spence-Mirdees single-crossing) hypothesis, quasi-linear utilities, and that agents can choose only pure strategies, we identify a structural condition on the value b(x, y) of product type y to agent type x - and on the principal's costs c(y) - which is necessary and sufficient for reducing the profit maximization problem faced by the principal to a convex program. This is a key step toward making the principal's problem theoretically and computationally tractable; in particular, it allows us to derive uniqueness and stability of the principal's optimal strategy - and similarly of the strategy maximizing the expected welfare of the agents when the principal's profitability is constrained. We call this condition non-negative cross-curvature: it is also (i) necessary and sufficient to guarantee convexity of the set of b-convex functions, (ii) invariant under reparametrization of agent and/or product types by diffeomorphisms, and (iii) a strengthening of Ma, Trudinger and Wang's necessary and sufficient condition (A3w) for continuity of the correspondence between an exogenously prescribed distribution of agents and of products. We derive the persistence of economic effects such as the desirability for a monopoly to establish prices so high they effectively exclude a positive fraction of its potential customers, in nearly the full range of non-negatively cross-curved models.

Aggregate exports and agricultural exports tend to decrease corruption, while fuel exports increase corruption. The influence of agricultural exports in more pronounced in more corrupt nations, while fuel exports contribute to corruption in least corrupt nations. Manufacturing and ore exports, on the other hand, generally fail to show significant impacts on corruption. Our findings demonstrate that the resource curse is sensitive to prevailing corruption levels, and this finding is novel in the literature. Consistent with the extant literature, corruption decreases with income, and (at some corruption levels) as political freedom increases, and with larger government size.

On the 2-year/4-year margin, there is evidence of growing ability constraints among women. Furthermore, income has become more important among higher-ability men, and increases in 2-year attendance among high-ability but low-income men come at the expense of 4-year college enrollment.

Our aim is to assess whether old and new EU countries are rated differently and to determine whether new ones are assigned lower ratings, ceteris paribus, than old ones. We find that country-specific factors (in the form of heterogeneous intercepts) are a crucial determinant of ratings. Whilst new EU countries typically have lower ratings than old ones, after controlling for financial variables we also discover that all countries have significantly different intercepts, confirming our prior belief. This intercept heterogeneity suggests that each country's rating is assigned uniquely, after controlling for differences in financial factors, which may reflect differences in country risk and the legal and regulatory framework that banks face ( such as foreclosure laws). In addition, we find that ratings may respond differently to the liquidity and operating expenses to operating income variables across countries. Typically ratings are more responsive to the former and less sensitive to the latter for new EU countries compared with old EU countries.","[Caporale, Guglielmo Maria] Brunel Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Ctr Empir Finance, London UB8 3PH, England; [Matousek, Roman] London Metropolitan Univ, London Metropolitan Business Sch, Ctr Int Capital Markets, London EC2M 6SQ, England",Brunel University; London Metropolitan University,"Caporale, GM (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Ctr Empir Finance, London UB8 3PH, England.",Guglielmo-Maria.Caporale@brunel.ac.uk; r.matousek@londonmet.ac.uk; c.stewart@londonmet.ac.uk,"Stewart, Chris/J-8242-2019; Stewart, Chris/G-6755-2011","Stewart, Chris/0000-0001-7893-1364; Matousek, Roman/0000-0002-4066-9580",,,,,15,13,16,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

While increasingly important politically, technical barriers to trade (TBTs) have received less attention.

We calibrate the model for 14 industries in order to clarify the theoretical ambiguities.

In the static model in which a player's commitment decision is made simultaneously with his choice of bargaining stance, compromise becomes unattainable (Ellingsen and Miettinen, 2008). We first analyze a static bargaining model, in which the players decide whether to attempt commitment after announcing their demands. In contrast to the aforementioned strong result, our model accommodates both incompatible commitments and compromises as equilibrium outcomes. We then extend our analysis to a dynamic setting. It is shown that compromise is possible if the players can alter their demands quickly and the chances of successful commitment are low. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Golf provides a natural setting to test for loss aversion because golfers are rewarded for the total number of strokes they take during a tournament, yet each individual hole has a salient reference point, par. We analyze over 2.5 million putts using precise laser measurements and find evidence that even the best golfers-including Tiger Woods-show evidence of loss aversion.

It is proved that the Fundamental Marxian Theorem is not preserved and that no meaningful subjectivist exploitation index can be constructed. A minimal objectivism is necessary in exploitation theory, whereby subjective preferences do not play a direct, definitional role. An objectivist approach related to the 'New Interpretation' is proposed which captures the core intuitions of exploitation theory, provides appropriate indices of individual and aggregate exploitation, and preserves the Fundamental Marxian Theorem in general economies.","[Veneziani, Roberto] Queen Mary Univ London, Dept Econ, London E1 4NS, England; [Yoshihara, Naoki] Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Tokyo 1868603, Japan",University of London; Queen Mary University London; Hitotsubashi University,"Veneziani, R (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Dept Econ, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",r.veneziani@qmul.ac.uk; yosihara@ier.hit-u.ac.jp,,"Yoshihara, Naoki/0000-0002-0804-787X",,,,,19,8,9,1,5,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0026-1386,,,METROECONOM,Metroeconomica,FEB,2011,62.0,1,,,,,53,68,,10.1111/j.1467-999X.2010.04089.x,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,704OE,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000286061500003,0

These can cause significant problems for econometric analyses. The FGLS(Parks) estimator has been demonstrated to produce considerable efficiency gains in these settings. However, it suffers from underestimation of coefficient standard errors, oftentimes severe. Potentially, jackknifing the FGLS(Parks) estimator could allow one to maintain the efficiency advantages of FGLS(Parks) while producing more reliable estimates of coefficient standard errors. Accordingly, this study investigates the performance of the jackknife estimator of FGLS(Parks) using Monte Carlo experimentation. We find that jackknifing can-in narrowly defined situations-substantially improve the estimation of coefficient standard errors. However, its overall performance is not sufficient to make it a viable alternative to other panel data estimators.","[Reed, W.

It also helps in impoverishment, undermining human security and sustainable development. Public facilities contribute to the quality of life for both individuals and groups in the community. This research paper, therefore, attempts to examine the impact of violent ethno-religious conflicts on neighbouhood facilities in Jos metropolis of northern Nigeria. This is imperative because residential property is viewed as a bundle of services or a basket of goods which includes the physical structure itself, the ancillary facilities and services within and around it, as well as the general environmental qualities and amenities that surround the building The stratified random sampling technique was employed in order to generate the data for the research. Simple percentage distribution tables and charts were used to analysed the data for the research Among the issues this paper examined are the natures of the existing neighbourhood facilities in the study area, their availability, and the conditions of the neighbourhood facilities before and after the conflicts. It also examined the relationship between violent ethno-religious conflicts and the provision and maintenance of neighbourhood facilities. The results of the correlation analysis show that there is negative relationship between violent ethno-religious conflicts and provision and maintenance of neighbourhood facilities in the study area. This implies that frequent violence affects the provision and maintenance of neighbourhood facilities. This result suggests that policies that encourage social integration, psycho-social healing and psychological transformation could enhance the attainment of sustainable neighbourhood facilities in the study area.","[Aliyu, Aliyu Ahmad; Kasim, Rozilah; Martin, David] Univ Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Dept Construct & Real Estate Management, Fac Technol Management Business & Entrepreneurshi, Darul Tazim 86400, Johor, Malaysia",,,aaaliyu1978@yahoo.com; rozilah@uthm.edu.my; martin@uthm.edu.my,"Kasim, Professor Sr. Dr. Rozilah/B-5995-2018","Kasim, Professor Sr. Dr. Rozilah/0000-0002-3931-5507",,,,,8,0,0,0,1,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9083-4,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,10.0,,,,,,255,262,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZY02,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303284800048,0

Using a long panel from the Norwegian Manufacturing Census, we find that greenfield entry both in the same industry and in the same labour market region has a negative impact on the productivity of domestic plants, while entry via acquisition affects the productivity of domestic plants in the same industry positively. The positive effect from acquisitions is consistent with knowledge spillovers as these plants have pre-established linkages within the industry. The negative effects from greenfield entry can be attributed to increased competition both in the product market and for qualified employees in a tight labour market.

We use such trajectories to construct a debt ceiling, that is, the largest value of external debt that does not jeopardize long-run indebtness sustainability.

The information is obtained from 43 Taiwanese banks for the period 1998 to 2002. We also employ the nonradial and slacks-based Malmquist Total Factor Productivity (TFP) index to measure the impact of productivity change on the panel data. Our empirical results from the DEA approach are summarized as follows: (1) Loan quality factors have an impact on a bank's efficiency. In general, the bank with a higher degree of problem loans drops down its efficiency by incorporating account risk; however, the bank with a lower degree of problem loans increases its efficiency by incorporating account risk. (2) Super efficiency provides a good framework for ranking efficient units. (3) Based on the nonradial and slacks-based Malmquist TFP index, we find that bank productivity has increased and technical change has improved.

And what are the determinants of the share of total sales exported by a firm, once the decision of becoming an exporter has been made? We apply a Heckman selection model to the Ecuador's Investment Climate Survey (ICS) to investigate supply-side constraints to export performance at the firm level. We estimate export propensity (the probability of exporting) and export intensity (the share of total sales that are exported). The application of the Heckman selection model to a rich dataset as the ICS is a major contribution as previous applications of the Heckman selection model used much limited datasets, limiting the range of hypotheses to be tested. Furthermore, other studies on export performance based on ICS data use either Tobit or Probit models, incurring important methodological limitations. We find robust and stable relationships for export propensity and intensity with firm size, import of inputs, labor regulations, in-house RD, quality certification, Web use, and foreign ownership. Capacity utilization and trade with the US positively affect export intensity, while trade within the Andean Community has the opposite effect in our outcome variable.

However, empirical work has failed to support the existence of scale effects. As a result, much human capital has been expended in order to 'fix' this problem by eliminating scale effects in endogenous growth models. We contend that econometric techniques used in the empirical search for scale effects are inconsistent with growth theory. Using data from US states and an econometric technique that better matches growth theory by allowing each economy to have its own steady state, we provide empirical support for the existence of scale effects.

Focusing on the role of financial liberalization, we find that it has mainly affected the short-term dynamics of residential prices. In particular, the impulse effects on house prices of income and mortgage debt have become smaller. On the other hand, the effects of interest rates, past house prices and, to a lesser degree, stock market have strengthened. In other words, there seems to have been a certain 'de-linking' of short-term house price dynamics from income, whereas the housing market may have become more similar to a financial asset market, with interest rates and expectations of capital gains playing a more prominent role.","[Giuliodori, Massimo] Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Ganoulis, Ioannis] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",University of Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; European Central Bank,"Giuliodori, M (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",M.Giuliodori@uva.nl,,,,,,,31,5,5,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The process of reverse supply chains are more complicated since return flows may include several activities such as collection, checking, sorting, disassembly, remanufacturing, disposal and redistribution. Moreover, the quality and the quantity of the used products are uncertain in the reverse channel. The complexity of reverse supply chain has motivated several researchers to use System dynamics (SD) modelling techniques in the search for better strategies and policies for integrating the forward and reverse supply chains by addressing the effects of uncontrollable factors such as uncertainty of returns. The paper aims at not only proposing a methodology that provides an understanding of the system structure as it identifies the important factors or variables influencing the system and to study the characteristics of the process but also it highlights the measurement and improvement of the reverse supply chain.","[Geethan, K.

Unfortunately, many new lawyers practicing in Lithuania do not seem to meet the minimum expectations established by Lithuanian society. It makes one wonder whether such new lawyers actually learned the values, knowledge and skills that are indispensable to modern lawyers while they were in the law school. If many new practicing lawyers have not learned such things, one must also question whether their respective university law schools effectively taught them such values, knowledge and skills. In addition to being challenged by expectations established by Lithuanian society, Lithuanian universities must also prepare law school students for the global economy. The Bologna Process 1 specifically challenges Lithuanian universities to meet new international educational standards and goals, including international mobility, competitiveness, transparency, high quality teaching, and employability. We will analyze the legal authorities that regulate legal education in Lithuania. We will also review the educational guidelines that have been established to insure the highest quality of legal education in Lithuania. The first part of this article is devoted to analyzing the quality parameters of educational services in the context of Bologna Process. The survey shows that the Bologna Process offers sufficient legal educational standards to assure the quality of legal education in Lithuania. These standards include the framework of comparable and compatible qualifications for higher education systems, European Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance and cooperation of agencies for higher education quality assurance in every member state. Although various legal scholars may disagree, the legal educational standards used in the Bologna Process are the most appropriate to use because such standards (a) are more precise, (b) provide a common understanding, and (c) can be used as a common currency by allowing study programs to be more transparent at both local and international levels. In the second part of this article, we analyze the adequacy of learning outcomes as one of the main parameters of ensuring the quality of legal education. This will be done by analyzing the regulation of legal education in Lithuania. The analysis concludes that not enough attention is being devoted to teaching general competencies to law students in Lithuania. For example, competencies in the areas of leadership, creative problem solving, team work, communication (including communication in foreign languages), professional ethical behaviour and professional responsibility appear to be deficient. It is especially worth noting that neither a legal ethics course nor a lawyer's professional responsibility course are required before becoming a licensed lawyer or judge in Lithuania. In our opinion, ignoring professional ethics and failing to require a professional ethics course in all university law schools allows students to form a false impression that ethics is a secondary matter in a lawyer's education.","[Gruodyte, Edita; Kirsiene, Julija] Vytautas Magnus Univ, LT-44248 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Gruodyte, E (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, K Donelaicio St 58, LT-44248 Kaunas, Lithuania.",e.gruodyte@tf.vdu.lt; j.kirsiene@tf.vdu.lt,"Gruodyte, Edita/ABC-4109-2020; Kirsiene, Julija/AEH-8693-2022","Gruodyte, Edita/0000-0003-1105-9860; Kirsiene, Julija/0000-0003-2196-5648",,,,,54,2,2,0,19,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The country model structures typically combine short-term Keynesian-type dynamics with a consistent long-run neo-classical supply-side. While retaining a conventional treatment of international trade and payments linkages, the model has a greater degree of stock-flow consistency, with explicit modelling of domestic and international assets, liabilities and associated income streams. Account is also taken of the influence of financial and housing market developments on asset valuation and domestic expenditures via house and equity prices, interest rates and exchange rates. As a result, the model gives more prominence to wealth and wealth effects in determining longer-term outcomes and the role of asset prices in the transmission of international shocks both to goods and financial markets.

We study the effects of firms' innovation and exchange rate change on their international expansion choices. As in Petit and Sanna-Randaccio (2000), the market structure is endogenously determined by the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium of a three-stage game that involves three different decisions by the firms: how to expand abroad, how much to invest in R&D, and how much to sell in each country under different market configurations. Since the price of output is directly affected by the exchange rate, we carefully include the impact of an anticipated exchange rate change in the future on firms' current decisions. The results show that an increase in R&D productivity leads firms towards multinational expansion. Furthermore, home currency appreciation also raises the likelihood of FDI by firms. Compared with the results of Petit and Sanna-Randaccio (2000), mixed duopoly is more likely to arise under exchange rate fluctuation in our model.","Feng Chia Univ, Dept Int Trade, Taichung 40724, Taiwan",Feng Chia University,"Hsu, J (通讯作者)，Feng Chia Univ, Dept Int Trade, Taichung 40724, Taiwan.",yphsu@fcu.edu.tw,,,,,,,27,1,2,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

It would be an error to break the bonds between the consumer's and producer's theories, which is one of the most present interpretative connotations of the consumer-producer behavior. It is in fact the recognition of the way consumer's respond to the diverse stimuli the companies use to achieve the profit goal. Without any doubt, the consumer's behavior is a constantly open field in theory but also in practice, because it coincides with the complex mechanism of transforming the needs into demands, and then into consumption.

Ignoring them can have consequences at the human level, but most importantly in the global development of the society and individual.","[Iovitu, Mariana; Huettner, Andrei Stefan] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Iovitu, M (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,2,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-606-12-0139-6,,,,2011,,,,,,,388,391,,,,,,4,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH0UM,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000396639300055,0

The analysis utilised data from the Manufacturing Industrial Survey, Department of Statistics Malaysia comprising 24 years, from 1985 to 2008. There are six sub-industries covered in the analysis, namely, the production, processing and freezing meat, fish, fruits, vegetables, oil and fat; manufacturing sieved petroleum products; manufacturing chemical based products; manufacturing iron based and metal; manufacturing office equipment, accounting and calculators; and manufacturing valves and electronic tubes and other electrical components. A multi regression model using panel data is estimated. Results show that globalisation indicators like FDI, foreign labour and economic openness have negative significant impact on labour productivity in the services sector.

The analysis tries to assess the impact of global crisis on employment and unemployment and to explain the different reation of labour markets in the individual countries to the crisis. The author analysies the impact of the crisis on output, employment and unemployment. work hours, and wages. The analysis shows that global crisis caused significant changes in labour markets of the analysed group of countries. The major change was the decrease of employment and the increase of unemployment, both as regards their absolute levels, as well as percentage rates. Changes in these variables were relatively small in Poland, but more pronounced in Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic. The reaction of employment and unemployment to the crisis depends on many factors. Significant is the scale of changes in the output volume, as well as changes observed in real wages, work hours, and productivity. In all the countries analysed procyclical behaviour was observed in the evolution of such macroeconomic variables as GDP, employment, real wages, working hours and labour productivity. The change in employment and unemployment levels in Poland was relatively small, due to relatively advantageous behaviour of output (some increase in real GDP). hut also due to the decrease in real wages and working hours.","Uniwersytet Lodzki, Katedra Makroekon, Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Kwiatkowski, E (通讯作者)，Uniwersytet Lodzki, Katedra Makroekon, Lodz, Poland.",ekwiatk@uni.lodz.pl,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,2,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2011,,1,,,,,37,53,,,,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,741CJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288840400002,0

Empirical results demonstrated that both exchange rates have a nonlinear relationship with the comovement equilibrium, which was captured by the Logistic Smooth Transition Vector Error Correction Model with GJR-GARCH and Spillover Volatility (LSTVECM-GJR-GARCH-SV). Both exchange rates will quickly reverse to equilibrium when there are large deviations between the two exchange rates, implying that information traders obtain profit in two markets, and then both exchange rates continue to deviate from equilibrium when small deviations exist from comovement, owing to noise trader to expand mispricing. Moreover, small and large deviations may have obvious differences and adjustment speeds when reverting to equilibrium for large negative and large positive deviations.

First in the literature, this article suggests the 'rolling probit model' to successfully demonstrate that high reserves can be effective in offsetting vulnerable fundamentals in a vulnerable zone. The more vulnerable fundamentals in the vulnerable zone require higher levels of international reserves to reduce the probability of a crisis. If the fundamentals are sufficiently bad, the level of needed reserves may be explosive, which makes a crisis unavoidable.

Consistent with the habit formation framework of Campbell and Cochrane (1999, 2000), we find that reasonably large portions of predictability of long-horizon industry portfolio returns are explained by the ratio of aggregate consumption in surplus of habit or its instrument, the consumption-wealth ratio. The time-varying beta s and, more importantly, time-varying market risk premium associated with either the surplus consumption ratio or the consumption-wealth ratio help explain the predictable variation of long-horizon expected returns on over half of the industry portfolios. The conditional Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) with beta s varying with the proposed conditioning variable performs better than the static CAPM, but not as well as the Fama-French (1993, 1997) three-factor model in explaining the time-series variability of returns.","[Zhong, M.] Univ Queensland, UQ Business Sch, St Lucia, Qld 4067, Australia; [Li, Y.; Lu, W.] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Finance, Fullerton, CA 92634 USA; [Zhong, M.] Zhongshan Univ, Dept Finance, Lingnan Coll, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",University of Queensland; California State University System; California State University Fullerton; Sun Yat Sen University,"Zhong, M (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, UQ Business Sch, St Lucia, Qld 4067, Australia.",m.zhong@uq.edu.au,,,,,,,20,3,3,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, European integration has had an effect not only on convergence of gross domestic product (GDP) but also on convergence of prices as well as on alteration of living standards. The goals of Lithuanian integration to the EU were noted in the National Lithuanian Sustainable Development Strategy. The key objective of sustainable development in Lithuania was to achieve the present developmental level of the EU countries according to indicators of economic and social development. Therefore, the paper compares the convergence across the old and newer member-states of the EU in terms of GDP, household final consumption expenditure and comparative price level indices. In addition, it is revealed that Lithuanian expenditure patterns rapidly approach those of the old member-states of the EU. Consequently, Lithuanian integration to the EU contributes to approaching the EU-15 level what means the successful achievements of Sustainable Development Strategy as well. So, the aim of this paper is to show how successful are Lithuanian sustainable development achievements in terms of GDP, comparative price level and household expenditure within framework of integration to the EU.","[Liobikiene, Genovaite; Mandravickaite, Justina] Vytautas Magnus Univ, LT-44404 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Liobikiene, G (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, Vileikos G 8, LT-44404 Vilnius, Lithuania.",g.liobikiene@gmf.vdu.lt; j.mandravickaite@pmf.vdu.lt,"Liobikiene, Genovaite/I-9276-2019; Mandravickaitė, Justina/AAD-5922-2022","Liobikiene, Genovaite/0000-0002-9361-2609;",,,,,30,12,13,1,14,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The main idea is that the creation and development processes of the knowledge based society and knowledge economy may be attributed to the category of synergy effects oriented processes, therefore, all general phenomena and characteristics of synergy effects oriented processes in general, are absolutely typical for the creation and development of the knowledge based society and knowledge economy. The institutional interaction and the processes of the internationalization of scientific and technological progress could be described as the typical synergy effects oriented processes. The institutional interaction and the processes of the internationalization of the scientific and technological progress analyzed in the general context of the creating of knowledge based society and knowledge economy. The new definitions of the knowledge based society and knowledge economy are described. The main principles of creating the knowledge based society and knowledge economy are presented. Creating and modernization of the knowledge based society and knowledge economy are very complicated processes, oriented to the formation of the new quality of society and qualitatively new lifestyle, these processes may be described as twice as complicated, because they win distinction by orientations to the pursuit of new quality in two aspects: - the knowledge based society and knowledge economy, compared to traditional society and economy, are in all cases described as qualitatively new; - creating and development of the knowledge based society and knowledge economy takes place under the conditions of the global changes, which means that qualitative changes take place in all global space, the essence of those changes is the creation and spread of the knowledge based society and knowledge economy. A special attention is given to the conclusion that in the environment of the knowledge based society creation and generating knowledge economy and development, the provisions for effective institutional interaction and for complex cultural, mental, social, economic and technological interaction in the context of internationalization processes The following general conclusions are made: - the processes of creating knowledge based society and generating knowledge economy and its further development should be understood as the undivided unity; - the processes of creating knowledge based society and generating knowledge economy and its further development should be perceived as relevant to all spheres of life - meaning social, economic and political life, culture, advancement of science and technologies, interaction with nature in general and environment in particular; - the processes of creating knowledge based society and generating knowledge economy and its further development should be comprehended as the ones providing economic preconditions for the modernization of the society and refinement of its life in accordance with the standards, norms and values of knowledge based society; - the processes of creating knowledge based society and knowledge economy and further development should be interpreted as a multi-dimensional and extremely complex and uninterrupted process which manifests itself in cyclical changes and leaps towards higher quality standards; - the complex approach towards knowledge based society and knowledge economy creation and further development should be implemented in all stages of scientific research, studies and practical activities, including the prioritizing various programmes on multi-and cross-disciplinary research and studies, as well as strategic solutions of the complex character in various stages of regional development, planning and designing of economic and technological leaps. - the processes of creating knowledge based society and knowledge economy and further development should be analyzed and assessed in the context of the priorities of synergy effects oriented processes, including - processes of institutional interaction and internationalization of the scientific and technological progress.

While initially designed as an instrument addressed to low income working families, the tax credit was implemented without any upper earnings limit, and its generosity was substantially extended in 2007 implying an annual budgetary cost of about 0.5% of the GDP. The current design of the credit grants largest income gains in absolute terms to families in the upper half of the income distribution, while proportional gains are most significant for those in the middle of the income distribution. Households with children in the bottom 10% of the income distribution gain on average about 7.60 PLN per month, and those in the top 40% gain over a 100 PLN per month on average. The paper also analyses the possible effects of potential reforms of the CTC aimed at reducing its cost. The recently proposed eligibility limitation to families with three or more children would reduce the fiscal cost of the tax credit by 80-90%, while a simulated reduction of generosity of the credit by 50% would save in the state budget about 2.2 bn PLN per year. The latter policy would leave the incomes of families with children in the lowest deciles largely unchanged, and it would reduce the benefits from the credit to households in the upper half of the income distribution by about 50% on average.","[Morawski, Leszek] Univ Warsaw, Dept Econ, PL-00325 Warsaw, Poland; [Morawski, Leszek; Myck, Michal] CenEA, Szczecin, Poland; [Myck, Michal] DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Myck, Michal] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England",University of Warsaw; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Morawski, L (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Dept Econ, PL-00325 Warsaw, Poland.",lmorawsk@wne.uw.edu.pl; mmyck@cenea.org.pl,"Morawski, Leszek/ABA-3220-2020; Myck, Michal/ABA-7136-2021","Morawski, Leszek/0000-0003-3464-3963; Myck, Michal/0000-0002-9894-838X",,,,,14,2,2,0,7,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2011,,6,,,,,815,830,,,,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,880HY,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299399400003,0

The driving factor behind this result is economic integration in the Eurozone (in the form of trade openness and highly correlated technological processes), which almost compensates for idiosyncratic regional shocks and causes national and Euro-wide inflations to move together.

Both laboratory and field studies largely confirm these initial findings, showing that gender differences in competitiveness tend to result from differences in overconfidence and in attitudes toward competition.

Every enterprise, endeavouring to survive and keep the necessary flexibility in a complicated economic latter-day situation has to be creative and innovative. Benchmarking can be taken as an expedient tool for the implementation of innovative and tried processes or methods in an organization. Unfortunately, this tool doesn't come up with expectations, if it is employed by the ill-prepared organization, which is stick to conservatism, formalism and avoidance of risk. In other words, a special culture, stimulating changes, proactivenes is necessary for the successful results of the benchmarking use. Entrepreneurial enterprises distinguish themselves for their ability to tolerate risk and ambiguity, promote creativity, improvement and innovativeness. So, entrepreneurship can be described as the basic element for success in the process of the creation of innovations using benchmarking. The object of the article is entrepreneurship as the basic element for successful employment of benchmarking and business innovations. The purpose of this article is to stress the link between entrepreneurship and benchmarking by detecting entirely entrepreneurial abilities, which help to use benchmarking successfully in the activity of business innovations. The following methods were applied in this article: systematic and comparative analysis of scientific literature, which allowed to study entrepreneurship, innovations, benchmarking and their interrelationship; logical deduction method was useful and expedient trying to explain the main features, linking together entrepreneurship and benchmarking as the activities of innovations creation; inference generation. Applying the mentioned methods, the links among entrepreneurial management of the enterprise and benchmarking are educed. Primarily, big attention is paid to the entrepreneurship influence on the creation of innovations. This influence is analysing standing on the concise research of concepts, formulated by different authors. The similarity of innovative enterprise to entrepreneurial enterprise is examined too. After the consideration of entrepreneurship as the base of innovations' creation the benchmarking's possibilities to change, improve and innovate the enterprise are explored. Lastly, entrepreneurship as the enabler or successes factor of the benchmarking is presented. The conclusions. It can be noticed that the connection between the entrepreneurship and benchmarking is tight enough. Benchmarking can be analysed as entrepreneurial tool, because it enables to transform organizational processes, bring changes in the obsolete work's order and to create innovations. But it should be stressed that benchmarking's successful termination depends on the possibilities to invoke entrepreneurial thinking, because carrying the serving the purpose practice is not the simple process of copying. Obviously, that the substantial discernible and latent differences, existing among enterprises, demand creativity and flair to use attainments of others for their own organization's improvement and innovations.","[Petuskiene, Edita; Glinskiene, Rasa] Kaunas Univ Technol, Panevezys Inst, LT-37164 Panevezys, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Petuskiene, E (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Panevezys Inst, Nemuno St 33, LT-37164 Panevezys, Lithuania.",edita.petuskiene@ktu.lt; rasa.glinskiene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,66,13,15,1,38,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In this paper, we consider the role that wastewater recycling plays in the optimal extraction of groundwater, a renewable resource. We develop a two-sector dynamic optimization model to solve for the optimal trajectories of groundwater extraction and water recycling. For the case of spatially increasing recycling costs, recycled water serves as a supplemental resource in transition to the steady state. For constant unit recycling cost, recycled wastewater is eventually used as a sector-specific backstop for agricultural users, while desalination supplements household groundwater in the steady state. In both cases, recycling water increases welfare by shifting demand away from the aquifer, thus delaying implementation of costly desalination. The model provides guidance on when and how much to develop resource alternatives.","[Roumasset, James; Wada, Christopher A.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Roumasset, J (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",jimr@hawaii.edu; cawada@hawaii.edu,,,,,,,34,6,7,1,15,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

An equilibrium is robust if the corresponding strategies remain approximately optimal for a class of games with ambiguous beliefs that results from an appropriately defined perturbation of the belief structure of the original non-ambiguous belief game. The robustness definition is based on a novel definition of equilibrium for games with ambiguous beliefs that requires equilibrium strategies to be approximate best responses for all measures that define a player's belief. Conditions are derived under which robustness is characterized by a newly defined strategic continuity property, which can be verified without reference to perturbations and corresponding ambiguous belief games.

Different methods have been used to estimate the impact of climate change on human welfare. Studies agree that there are positive and negative impacts. In the short term, positive impacts may dominate, but these are sunk benefits that will obtain regardless of abatement policy. In the longer term, there are net negative impacts. Poorer people tend to be more vulnerable to climate change. Estimated aggregate impacts are not very large, but they are uncertain and incomplete. Estimates of the marginal impacts suggest that greenhouse gas emissions should be taxed and that the emission reduction targets announced by politicians are probably too ambitious. Estimates of the willingness to pay for climate policy suggest that lay people are probably more concerned than experts about the total impact of climate change, whereas lay people and experts agree on estimates of the incremental impact of carbon dioxide emissions.","[Tol, Richard S.

The need to choose among alternatives may be faced by various interested parties: fire safety regulators (authorities on national level), insurers, architects (building designers), manufacturers of fire protection measures, property owners and buyers. The problem of choice will often involve the need to consider simultaneously several characteristics (attributes) of alternatives, and those related to fire safety will be accompanied by economic and non-economic ones. Such a choice can be formalised as a problem of multi-attribute selection (MAS), a filed known also as multi-criteria decision making (MCDM). The present paper aims to formulate and solve several problems of multi-attribute selection by taking into account attributes related to fire safety. The problems are considered in an attempt to facilitate decision-making on three levels: the level of a property buyer/renter, the level of a property owner, and the level of an architect (building designer). It is shown that a different level of decision making requires to apply attributes of different nature. The well-developed field of fire safety offers a range of quantitative and qualitative indicators describing fire performance of building materials, construction and fire protection products as well as entire buildings. These indicators are introduced, with relative ease, into MAS problems. The attributes of economic nature fit naturally in the MAS problems involving fire safety. They can be introduced passively and accompany fire-related attributes as well as other non-economic attributes. However, economic aspects of MAS problems can be used in a more subtle way, namely, by introducing elements of formal expression of risk posed by fires. Monetary losses caused by fires are among the elements of a risk profile. An expected value of these losses can be used as an MAS attribute.","[Vaidogas, Egidijus Rytas; Sakenaite, Jurgita] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Vaidogas, ER (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Av 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",erv@st.vgtu.lt; jurgita.sakenaite@st.vgtu.lt,,,,,,,47,20,22,0,13,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Every component of e-commerce system can be influenced by many disturbances originating in internal and external environment and by hostile attacks which can be considered as a special type of such disturbances. Disturbances and attacks usually cause negative effects on e-commerce system usability, stability, performance, security, availability, functionality and operability. Internet and other computer networks implemented either separately or as a part of CRM (Customer Relationship Management) can be regarded as basic communication means of such systems. From the safety point of view, web server is one of the critical elements of the whole e-commerce system and may be affected by many disturbances and attacks that can have negative impact on its functionality. E-commerce systems generally, e-shops particularly, are based on client/server architecture. Hence, the safe data transfer between client and server is necessary for both customers and sellers. The web server should meet the web design and application standards, its architecture, semantic web approaches and other options have to ensure the appropriate, intuitive and safe functionality of the e-commerce system. Generally, if we want to ensure the stable functioning of the whole system, we need to identify possible disturbances and attacks, determine their metrics and define regulatory interventions to minimize or eliminate their negative effects.

Our findings suggest that study design is crucial for the resulting scores. The differences between the scores estimated using parametric and non-parametric approaches arise when the Fourier-flexible functional form is used since this functional form yields lower scores. Generally, the higher the number of observations, the higher is the average estimated efficiency. The removal of scale effects using equity capital increases the profit efficiency but it is insignificant for other scores. The efficiency analysis should distinguish the commercial banking from other bank types because the former tends to deliver lower efficiency scores.","[Irsova, Zuzana; Havranek, Tomas] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, CR-11636 Prague 1, Czech Republic; [Havranek, Tomas] Czech Natl Bank, Econ Res Dept, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Czech National Bank,"Irsová, Z (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, CR-11636 Prague 1, Czech Republic.",zuzana.irsova@ies-prague.org; tomas.havranek@ies-prague.org,"Havranek, Tomas/M-8888-2015; Irsova, Zuzana/K-6387-2016","Havranek, Tomas/0000-0002-3158-2539; Irsova, Zuzana/0000-0002-0753-8124",,,,,67,27,27,2,23,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

J,"King, SP",,,,"King, Stephen P.",,,Does Tort Law Reform Help or Hurt Consumers?,ECONOMIC RECORD,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Legal limits on insurance damage claims have been introduced in Australia, the United States and other jurisdictions. In this article, I construct a simple competitive model to analyse the effect of tort law reforms on consumers. The model shows that reforms to limit non-economic losses make consumers unambiguously worse off ex ante. Although insurance premiums fall and these reductions are passed on to consumers in full, this gain is more than offset by the increased risk that consumers are forced to bear. In contrast, reforms for income-related (i.e. economic) losses lead to ambiguous outcomes. The potential benefits from limits to economic loss arise due to the inability of insurers to price discriminate on the basis of income or expected loss. Because of this, there is an implicit cross subsidy from low- to high-income consumers that is embedded in the insurance premium and relevant product price. Tort law reforms partially unwind this cross subsidy. The results presented in this article show that tort law reforms may achieve their stated goal, such as lowering monetary prices, but can still make consumers worse off by introducing an uninsurable risk. There is also an important difference between reforms that limit claims for economic and non-economic losses. Insurance for economic loss will generally include an implicit cross subsidy and, as a consequence, reforms can alter the ex ante utility for different groups of consumers in different ways.","Monash Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia",Monash University,"King, SP (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia.",stephen.king@buseco.monash.edu.au,,,,,,,11,1,2,0,5,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0249,,,ECON REC,Econ.

We insist there is an alternative to a neoclassical macroeconomics, in the guise of possible alternative heterodox microfoundations for Minsky's account of economic crises, beyond the Kaleckian markup model. The sketch is based upon elevation of some formal notions of computational complexity to pride of place, and characterization of crises as a collapse of complexity. It is an attempt to portray a market system evolving to a point of 'inherent vice': an endogenous development which by its very nature, cannot be tamed through conventional insurance or risk models.","Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",University of Notre Dame,"Mirowski, P (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",pmirowsk@nd.edu,,,,,,,62,24,29,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

In this manuscript the variation in an ordinal endogenous SAH variable is modeled with an ordinal endogenous cigarette smoking variable, using the copula approach to accommodate skewness in the error distribution. The treatment approach avoids several selection issues that could bias empirical estimates. The empirical model is estimated for a random sample of adult males from nine Chinese provinces in the 2006 China Health and Nutrition Survey. The results for our sample suggest that heavy smokers are more likely to report excellent health. Government and those in health policy might target heavy smokers with the message that quitting does result in benefits, keeping in mind that their own reported assessment of their health is itself a function of several factors.

It is argued that money growth is a superior indicator of the monetary environment than the federal funds rate and, thus, the focus is on the inflation/unemployment responses to money growth shocks. Structural vector autoregression (SVAR) and generalised method of moments (GMM) estimations confirm earlier findings in Karanassou, Sala, and Snower (2005, 2008b) obtained from chain reaction structural models: the slope of the US Phillips curve is far from vertical, even in the long-run, which implies that the nominal and real sides of the economy are symbiotic.

However, the literature has focused almost exclusively on production side externalities and whether dirty industry migrates to countries with lax environmental laws. More recently, concerns have been raised about the rapid explosion of consumption side pollution such as e-waste and its trade in international markets. Between 1996 and 2007, US exports of waste plastics and ferrous waste along the USA-Asia trade route increased by 917% and 482%, respectively. Over the same time period the average freight rate on commercial liners along the USA-Asia trade route fell by 46%, while average freight rates along the Asia-USA trade route increased by 2.9%. This paper develops a two country trade model with endogenous asymmetric transport costs as well as externalities associated with harmful waste generated from consumption. It shows that even when both governments set optimal Pigouvian taxes on the consumption of the dirty good, endogenous asymmetric transport costs can lower the 'backhaul' rate from North to South. This creates an environmental arbitrage condition by which it is cheaper for the North to export its waste to the South rather than dispose of it at home. The model yields a number of clear predictions regarding the relationship between country characteristics, the international terms of trade, the backhaul shipping rate, and the North's export supply function of waste.","Univ Montana, Dept Econ, Missoula, MT 59812 USA",University of Montana System; University of Montana,"Kellenberg, D (通讯作者)，Univ Montana, Dept Econ, 32 Campus Dr 5472, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",Derek.Kellenberg@mso.umt.edu,,,,,,,44,22,24,3,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

A theoretical model is first explored within a partial equilibrium framework, and then an empirical examination is conducted for Korea's FTA with the US. Empirical results show that, unlike the case of homogeneous goods and small importing countries, Korea's beef industry is expected to lose overall. Although beef consumption will increase due to the increase in imports from the partner country at lowered prices, the consumer surplus will not increase enough to offset the decrease in producer surplus together with tariff revenue and the welfare loss in the import market from non-member countries. Trade diversion, as well as trade creation, occurs in this case regardless of cost-efficiency differences between member and non-member countries. Regarding FTA deals with particular countries such as the US, the general belief that the industry as a whole will gain, despite a large producer loss, might be flawed where Korea's beef market is concerned.","Yeungnam Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Taegu, South Korea",Yeungnam University,"Lee, YK (通讯作者)，Yeungnam Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Taegu, South Korea.",yklee@ynu.ac.kr,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,14,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

We relate our equilibrium characterization to Myerson's Poisson games, and examine the potential uniqueness of equilibrium. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

It has been argued that as many as a 100 million women could be missing. The possibility of gender bias at birth and the mistreatment of young girls are widely regarded as key explanations. We provide a decomposition of these missing women by age and cause of death. While we do not dispute the existence of severe gender bias at young ages, our computations yield some striking new findings: (1) the vast majority of missing women in India and a significant proportion of those in China are of adult age; (2) as a proportion of the total female population, the number of missing women is largest in sub-Saharan Africa, and the absolute numbers are comparable to those for India and China; (3) almost all the missing women stem from disease-by-disease comparisons and not from the changing composition of disease, as described by the epidemiological transition. Finally, using historical data, we argue that a comparable proportion of women was missing at the start of the 20th century in the United States, just as they are in India, China, and sub-Saharan Africa today.","[Anderson, Siwan] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Ray, Debraj] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",University of British Columbia; New York University,"Anderson, S (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",,,,,,,,68,110,123,3,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Typically, the information in question is assumed to have bilateral payoff relevance, meaning it affects the expected payoffs of both the plaintiff and defendant. When there is bilateral payoff relevance, trials may be predicted, regardless of whether it is the informed or uninformed party who makes the offer. However, there may be important cases in which information has unilateral payoff relevance. For example, if the plaintiff's risk preferences are private information, this information will affect the plaintiff's expected payoff at trial, but will have no effect on the expected payoff of the defendant. When there is unilateral payoff relevance, inefficient trials never occur when the informed party makes the offer. Trials can occur when the uninformed party makes the offer assuming that the private information affects the payoff of the individual holding the private information.","[Farmer, Amy] Univ Arkansas, Dept Econ, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Pecorino, Paul] Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Farmer, A (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Dept Econ, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",amyf@walton.uark.edu; ppecorin@cba.ua.edu,"Pecorino, Paul/AAA-9292-2019","Pecorino, Paul/0000-0002-7659-7873",,,,,28,4,7,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

In exchange for partial benefits, these applicants must continue their search of regular full-time work. This study analyzes the implications of working on partial benefits for subsequent transitions to regular employment. The timing-of-events approach is applied to distinguish between causal and selectivity effects associated with the receipt of partial benefits. The results suggest that partial unemployment associated with short full-time jobs facilitates transitions to regular employment. Also part-time working on partial benefits may help men (but not women) in finding a regular job afterwards. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Wealth was highly concentrated at the beginning of the sample period, but inequality falls towards the end of the nineteenth century and continues to fall until the 1970s. However, there does not appear to be a Kuznets-type process at work. Instead, using data on socio-occupational status, it is suggested that the fall in wealth concentration appears to be associated with the demise of the titled classes. Interestingly, similar to the findings of other studies, wealth has become more concentrated since the 1970s.","Queens Univ Belfast, Queens Univ Management Sch, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland",Queens University Belfast,"Turner, JD (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Queens Univ Management Sch, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland.",j.turner@qub.ac.uk,,,,,,,33,13,13,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Here we examine the time allocation of Italian couples on which there are surprisingly few studies to date. We analyze simultaneously the time allocated by husband and wife to market work, childcare and housework, allowing for various interactions. We use data drawn from the Italian national Time Use Survey 2002-2003 for the analysis. We find that spousal time allocation is sensitive to personal and household characteristics, such as, in particular, education and children's age. Evidence shows that men married to more highly educated women spend more time with their children. The husband's own characteristics have less of an effect on women's time allocation. We also find that patterns differ substantially between weekends and weekdays. The estimated correlations between the unobservable factors affecting the couple's time allocation suggest that the time devoted by parents to childcare is complementary and that the time they devote to housework is substitutable across weekends and other weekdays.","[Stancanelli, Elena G.

We distinguish between good deflation, (driven by positive aggregate supply shocks) and bad deflation (driven by aggregate demand shocks). We use an empirical Blanchard/Quah model which decomposes the behaviour of prices, output and the money stock into the impact of shocks such as a world price level shock, a domestic supply shock, and domestic demand shocks including a shock to the domestic gold stock. Our key finding is that the European economies were essentially classic in the sense that output was mainly supply driven and that money was neutral even when country specific gold stocks are included.

This process relies on two intertwined dynamics. First, in the establishment of the rule of law, legal instruments are appropriated by those who call for more autonomy, resulting in a progressive equalization of rights. Second, development of a capable and impartial state is a prerequisite to implementation of rights, including their translation into services delivered to citizens. The mutual expansion of these dynamics relies on a vertical negotiation between the elite and the governed. The governed call for rights that are more firmly established and more extended. The ruling elite can grant these rights to maintain its legitimacy and hence its recognized authority.

Using panel unit root tests that are robust to cross-sectional dependence, we find that inequality and poverty indicators converge at both rural and urban levels. Further, per capita consumption converges at urban level but not at rural level.

Participation in these activities plays an important role in increasing rural households' income. This paper analyzes the factors that drive rural households and individuals in their income-source diversification choices in a Northern China township. At the household level, we distinguish three types of diversification as opposed to grain production only: within-farm (non-grain production) activities, local off-farm activities, and migration. We find that land availability stimulates on-farm diversification. Local off-farm activities are mostly driven by households' asset positions and working resources, while migration decisions strongly depend on the household size and composition. At the individual level, we analyze the determinants of participation in three different types of jobs as compared to agricultural work: local off-farm employment, local self-employment and migration. We find a clear gender and age bias in access to off-farm activities that are mostly undertaken by male and by young people. The households' asset positions as well as village networks are found to strongly affect participation in off-farm activities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Their management decisions are not guided completely by a budget system, but in part also by a market mechanism. Still, budget management is crucial as survival is not primarily determined by the amount of equity capital, but by the annual funding received from the government. For the evaluation of capital management, a capitalization factor is introduced to measure the amount of capital employed by an educational institute in relation to its annual income. It can signal possible inefficiencies reflected in excessive capital assets. Actual budget and capital management is assessed with the help of four financial indicators. There appears to be scope for improvements in financial policies and some recommendations are offered on how to attain them.","Netherlands Competit Author, NL-2500 BH The Hague, Netherlands",,"Don, H (通讯作者)，Netherlands Competit Author, POB 16326, NL-2500 BH The Hague, Netherlands.",f.j.h.don@nmanet.nl,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,SEP,2010,158.0,3,,,,,323,335,,10.1007/s10645-010-9145-2,0.0,,,13,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,648CP,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000281668300004,0

Bernardo (1996, p. 5) writes that its message is very clear: if a sequence of observations is judged to be exchangeable, then any subset of them must be regarded as a random sample from some model, and there exists a prior distribution on the parameter of such model, hence requiring a Bayesian approach. We argue that although exchangeability, interpreted as symmetry of evidence, is a weak assumption, when combined with subjective expected utility theory, it also implies complete confidence that experiments are identical. When evidence is sparse and there is little evidence of symmetry, this implication of de Finetti's hypotheses is not intuitive. This motivates our adoption of multiple-priors utility as the benchmark model of preference. We provide two alternative generalizations of the de Finetti Theorem for this framework.

In addition to 21 distinct explanatory variables extensively used in the empirical growth literature, I consider several fragmentation and polarization indices capturing the heterogeneity in a population to deal with measurement uncertainty, and utilize Bayesian Model Averaging techniques to address uncertainty issues regarding model specification. My results indicate that while substantial data evidence favors the inclusion of population heterogeneity as a theory when proxied by fragmentation indices, it does not support the inclusion of this theory when proxied by polarization indices. Furthermore, the religious fragmentation index has the strongest evidence in favor of its inclusion as opposed to ethnic and linguistic fragmentation indices and income inequality.

In this paper we study the effects of this fiscal policy on the Spanish economy. We try to answer two important questions. First, we want to quantify the effects of the announced rise in the VAT on the key macroeconomic variables and on total fiscal revenues. Second, we focus on the effects derived from the anticipation of the policy. Calibration of a dynamic general equilibrium for the Spanish economy shows that the announcement of the future VAT increases will generate a rise in consumption in the short-run, until July 2010, but it also will reduce investment.","[Fernandez-de-Cordoba, Gonzalo; Torres, Jose L.] Univ Malaga, E-29071 Malaga, Spain",Universidad de Malaga,"Fernández-de-Córdoba, G (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.",,"Torres, José/ABF-6814-2021",,,,,,15,1,1,1,10,UNIV ZARAGOZA,ZARAGOZA,"DEPT ESTRUCTURA ECONOMICA ECONOMIA PUBLICA, GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

Panel cointegration test statistics suggest that not all energy commodities are spatially homogenous in prices and the processes of energy price cointegration are different over time and over groups of fuels. The statistics demonstrate China's gradual, spatially partial and idiosyncratic energy reform process. Coal and electricity price series have co-moved since 2003, while the national panel cointegration test statistics suggest that gasoline and diesel price series have co-moved since 1997. Regional panel tests also show that there are apparently differences in the emergence of energy price co-movement. This suggests that regional energy markets have emerged in China. One of the important lessons of the research is that an energy market has, to some extent, already emerged in China and, as a consequence, energy prices are much less distorted than previously.

This paper examines empirically whether pairs of countries with more bilateral production fragmentation arrangements tend to have more correlated business cycles. Using cross-country data from 30 countries, we find that bilateral production fragmentation has a positive effect while the standard bilateral trade intensity indicator has a negative impact on business-cycle comovement. We also find that the positive effect of trade in complements (captured by bilateral production fragmentation) dominates the negative effect of trade in substitutes (explained by bilateral trade intensity), resulting in an overall positive impact of trade. Hence, bilateral production fragmentation plays a key role underlying the positive response of business-cycle comovement to increases in trade. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In the United States, since top income shares began to rise rapidly in the early 1980s, incomes of those in the top 1 percent of the income distribution have averaged 14 times average income and been 2.4 times more cyclical. Before the early 1980s, incomes of the top 1 percent were slightly less cyclical than average. The increase in cyclicality at the top is to a large extent due to increases in the share and the cyclicality of their earned income. The high cyclicality among top incomes is found for households without stock options; following the same households over time; for post-tax, post-transfer income; and for consumption. We study cyclicality throughout the income distribution and reconcile our findings with earlier work. Furthermore, greater top income share is associated with greater top income cyclicality across recent decades, across subgroups of top income households, and, in changes, across countries. This suggests a common cause. We show theoretically that increases in the production scale of the most talented can raise both top incomes and their cyclicality.","[Parker, Jonathan A.; Vissing-Jorgensen, Annette] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Parker, JA (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,,,,,,,36,28,31,0,15,BROOKINGS INST,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

By incorporating the Bern carbon cycle module into the RICE model developed by Nordhaus and Yang (1996), we set up a framework for tracking regional contributions to carbon concentration and to global climate change. Our proposal, labeled the color preservation principle, uses regional contribution share to global carbon concentration as the criterion for international cooperation. Through simulations in RICE model with Bern module (RICE-B), we examine the rationales of the arguments made by the United States and China. We conclude that both countries' standpoints are severely flawed. To facilitate the global cooperation on carbon mitigations, major concessions are needed from the two top carbon emitters.

We argue Post Keynesian Institutionalism (PKI) provides insight into the causes of increasing income inequality and our contribution is threefold. First, we compare PKI to the financialization literature, noting key similarities and differences. Second, we examine changes in financial structure and income inequality for a sample of developed nations, showing that financialization has increased in nearly all the countries sampled and that this increase has generally been accompanied by a rise in income inequality. Third, we demonstrate that the development of modern financial structures does not preclude an expansive welfare state and egalitarian public policies. Our finding is congruent with Hyman Minsky's conception of PKI, which stressed both that economic systems are not natural systems and that capitalism comes in as many varieties as Heinz has of pickles.","[Zalewski, David A.] Providence Coll, Providence, RI 02918 USA; [Whalen, Charles J.] SUNY Coll Technol Utica Rome, New York, NY USA",Providence College; State University of New York (SUNY) System,"Zalewski, DA (通讯作者)，Providence Coll, Providence, RI 02918 USA.",,,,,,,,79,59,62,2,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Starting from the model provided by Benhabib and Spiegel (2005), here we show that the impact of trade openness on productivity growth is nonlinear. In particular, we will see how for low levels of trade openness a trade liberalization policy will reduce the rate of technology growth. On the other hand, we will see that the same policy will increase the rare of technology growth in more open economies. Therefore, our conclusion is that the lack of evidence in favour of a strong link between trade and productivity growth is due to the use of linear methods instead of nonlinear regression techniques.",,,,,"Bassetti, Thomas/AAE-4756-2020","Bassetti, Thomas/0000-0003-0172-6658",,,,,48,0,0,0,8,SOC ED IL MULINO,BOLOGNA,"STRADA MAGGIORE 37, 40125 BOLOGNA, ITALY",1120-2890,,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

The analysis, based on administrative data, focuses on the impact of a series of major changes in payroll taxes which varied across geographical areas. This setup offers two main advantages over previous studies. First, using longitudinal data, the variation in tax rates across space and time provides a plausible source of identification of their effects on employment and wages. Second, the use of legal tax rates for each area at each point in time provides a remedy for the measurement error bias raised by the use of empirical rates constructed from observed tax and wage bills. Once this bias is accounted for, the results indicate that changes in payroll tax rates are only partially shifted onto wages, and they point to the absence of any significant effect on employment.

In this literature, the tax rate is exogenous. We endogenize the tax rate, and require that a successful theory should explain, jointly, the facts on the tax rate, tax gap and the level of government expenditure. We find that the data is best described by taxpayers using PT and the government using standard utility theory, EUT. The results are robust to several possible alternative specifications.

Today, there is the growing importance of intellectual property and copyright protection for authors and creators of literary, dramatic, musical, artistic and other intellectual works. The digital age has placed added pressure on songwriters, lyricists and composers in their ability to derive economic benefits from their intellectual creativity in the form of a copyright. Copyright laws protect and enable the creation of music by allowing authors and composers to license the control and use of their creations, and receive compensation in the form of royalty payments for their work. The PROs license, collect and distribute royalty payments for non-dramatic public performances of copyrighted musical works created and owned by its members or affiliates. In this paper, skewness and heavy tail of returns in the form of member royalty payments are estimated using the skew-normal and skew-t distributions in a parametric approach. We found strong evidence of the so-called 'superstar effect' in which the average royalty payment made by a PRO is still dominated by extreme outcomes, and relatively few members earned a substantial share of royalty payments from blockbuster hits that have endured over time. There is little evidence of smaller niche members dominating or replacing the 'superstars.' Economists and others will benefit from this empirical study which emphasizes a new understanding of the music industry from a PRO, member royalty payment and performance copyright perspective.","Amer Soc Composers Authors & Publishers, New York, NY 10023 USA",,"Pitt, IL (通讯作者)，Amer Soc Composers Authors & Publishers, ASCAP Bldg,1 Lincoln Plaza, New York, NY 10023 USA.",ipitt@ascap.com,,,,,,,25,13,13,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,,,J CULT ECON,J.

In this article we reanalyze two classic public goods experiments and focus on the nature of individuals' responses to others' behavior in order to help distinguish alternative motives for giving, including altruism, warm glow, reciprocity, and inequality aversion. Analysis that allows for asymmetric feedback responses generates support for inequality aversion motives but little for reciprocity (matching), altruism, and warm glow.

The essential claim of loanable funds theory is that disequilibrium in the goods market affects the rate of interest. This paper introduces financial accounting concepts and a new understanding of the principle of effective demand to clarify that loanable funds theory relies on a concept of income other than current income, namely yesterday's income in the case of Robertson, or full-employment equilibrium income in the case of Hicks. In Robertson's case, this is a matter of bad accounting, a confusion between an income statement and a balance sheet. In Hicks's more subtle case, it is about the inapplicability of Walras' Law to a monetary economy. Keynes's principle embodies a Marshallian concept of system equilibrium under which the goods market is treated as never in disequilibrium in the sense required by loanable funds theory.","Univ Cambridge, Robinson Coll, Cambridge CB3 9AN, England",University of Cambridge,"Hayes, MG (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Robinson Coll, Grange Rd, Cambridge CB3 9AN, England.",mgh37@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,41,7,7,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We use a generalised ordered probit model to explore the existence of reporting bias and to purge the self-reported measure of health of this bias. This model takes into account the possibility that anticipated retirement may influence reporting of health. There is evidence that health shocks are a determinant of retirement age. This is the case for both men and women and is observed for both health limitations and a measure based on latent health status derived from the generalised ordered probit model. While the size of the health effect varies according to how we measure health, the relative effect is large compared to the other variables, and in particular when compared to the effects of private pensions. However numerical simulations show that this high hazard ratio interacts with the, relatively low, incidence of new health limitations among the age group of interest to generate only a modest number of excess early retirements. Further, our results do not show evidence that the health status of their partner affects the hazard of early retirement for both men and women. Having an employed partner does reduce the hazard of early retirement. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

By solving the robust control problem analytically, we show why model uncertainty does not affect the optimal monetary policy response to demand and productivity shocks, whereas it causes a stronger reaction of the monetary policy instrument to a cost-push (i.e., markup) shock. Differently from what occurs in sticky price models, the antiattenuation effect can result in a degree of price level stabilization that is greater or less than that experienced in the rational expectation model, depending on the central bank's degree of conservatism. These results dramatically affect the rationale for delegating monetary policy to a central banker more conservative than the society.","Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Publ Econ, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Giuli, F (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Publ Econ, Rome, Italy.",francesco.giuli@uniroma1.it,,,,,,,34,4,4,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

It adds to the literature in this area by incorporating explicit controls for child care subsidies and the EITC into the estimation. Doing so provides an opportunity to examine mothers' sensitivity to prices and wages net of policies that influence these amounts. Results suggest that lower child care expenditures, higher wages, and more generous subsidy and EITC benefits increase the likelihood of employment. Allowing the impact of child care subsidies and the EITC to vary with expenditures and wages reveals substantial heterogeneity. In particular, the largest labor supply effects of child care subsidies are generated for mothers with higher child care costs, while the largest labor supply effects of the EITC are found for mothers with lower wages.","Arizona State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Herbst, CM (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",chris.herbst@asu.edu,,,,,,,65,49,66,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Candidates competing in local and national elections therefore face a trade-off between targetability and efficiency, which causes some profitable projects to be discarded.

We also study the model's transitional dynamics.","[Zeng, Zhixiong] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Caulfield 3145, Australia; [Li, Bin] Hunan Univ Sci & Technol, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Lichao] Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Monash University; Hunan University of Science & Technology; Peking University,"Zeng, ZX (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, 900 Dandenong Rd, Caulfield 3145, Australia.",zeng.zhxng@gmail.com,"Zeng, Zhixiong/K-2295-2019; Cheng, Lichao/I-6278-2012","Zeng, Zhixiong/0000-0003-3143-9756;",,,,,12,5,5,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

Furthermore, the structure of public spending is skewed towards local spending.

It argues against the view that the saving glut in China (along with other Asian emerging economies) played a significant causal role in the crisis. The global financial crisis did not engender much damage in China's financial structure, thanks to the relatively closed, bank-centered financial system. However, the impacts on the real side of the Chinese economy were hard felt. Growth and employment have fallen, largely due to the decline in exports and foreign direct investment. The crisis reveals the vulnerability of the export-dependent growth pattern. Policy responses of the Chinese Government, including monetary, fiscal and social policies, have helped to stem the downfall of the economy in the immediate term, but some of the policies have not addressed the structural problems of the Chinese economy and might well aggravate such problems over time. The present paper proposes a tentative reform blueprint to rebalance the economy and to sustain long-term growth.","Willamette Univ, Salem, OR 97301 USA",Willamette University,"Liang, Y (通讯作者)，Willamette Univ, Salem, OR 97301 USA.",liangy@willamette.edu,,,,,,,29,19,19,0,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAY-JUN,2010,18.0,3,,,,,56,72,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2010.01196.x,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,597ZO,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277801400004,0

To this end we introduce a discrete-time evolutionary stock market model that accommodates time periods of arbitrary length. The dynamics is time-consistent and allows the comparison of paths with different frequency of trade. The main result in this paper is the derivation of the limit model as the length of the time period tends to zero. The resulting model in continuous time generalizes the workhorse model of mathematical finance by introducing asset prices that are driven by the market interaction of investors following self-financing trading strategies. Our approach also offers a numerical scheme for the simulation of the continuous-time model that satisfies constraints such as market clearing at every time step. An illustration is provided.

For this purpose, we use a natural experiment framework which contrasts Sao Tome and Principe to Cape Verde, a control West African country sharing the same colonial past and important recent economic and political shocks. Our measurement is based on tailored household surveys we conducted in both island countries. The unique survey instrument was retrospective and used personal histories to elicit memories from the respondents. We analyze changes in perceived corruption across a wide range of public services and allocations. We find clearest increases on vote buying, education (namely in the allocation of scholarships) and customs, ranging from 31 to 40% of the subjective scale. We interpret these findings as symptoms of increased competition for core state resources. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We provide a theory of the persistence of civil wars. The civilian government can successfully defeat rebellious factions only by creating a relatively strong army. In weakly institutionalized polities this opens the way for excessive influence or coups by the military. Civilian governments whose rents are largely unaffected by civil wars then choose small and weak armies that are incapable of ending insurrections. Our framework also shows that when civilian governments need to take more decisive action against rebels, they may be forced to build oversized armies, beyond the size necessary for fighting the insurrection, as a commitment to not reforming the military in the future.

J,"Blum, BS",,,,"Blum, Bernardo S.",,,"Endowments, Output, and the Bias of Directed Innovation",REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TECHNOLOGY; SPECIALIZATION; LOCATION; TRADE; SIZE; OECD,"In this paper, I ask the question: Does the output-mix of countries change in response to changes in factor endowments? If so: How long does it take? Using data on capital, as well as skilled and unskilled labour employed in three-digit International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) manufacturing industries for a sample of 27 developing and developed countries over the 1973-1990 period, I find that the output-mix of countries does not change in response to endowment changes, even after 15 years. This answer raises another question: How then do countries absorb changes in factor endowments? The data show that in both the short and long runs, an increase in the supply of a production factor reduces its rate of return and makes it more intensively used in all sectors of the economy: changes in production techniques. In the long run, the point estimate is that the reduction in the rate of return is more than 50% larger than in the short run. This is consistent with induced innovations being predominantly biased towards the scarce factor.","Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",University of Toronto,"Blum, BS (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",,,,,,,,29,12,17,2,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Such a formulation forces economies of scale to be frozen so that firm size never changes. We use a Bertrand-Nash interpretation of the equilibrium that allows the elasticity of demand facing each variety to depend on the number of varieties, thus allowing the gains from globalization to reflect both the increase in variety and the exploitation of economies of scale. We also develop a precise expression for per capita real income with any number of sectors and examine the age-old question of the socially optimal number of varieties.","[Cox, W.

We find evidence of in-group favoritism only on the part of rich first movers. Rich first movers trust their in-group members significantly more in the presence of income inequality not only before but also after they gain enough experience. Poor first movers, in contrast, do not exhibit such in-group bias. They do not discriminate between in-group and out-group at the very outset of the experiment, and once they become experienced, they behave with significantly more trust toward the rich than toward the poor.

In this paper, we analyse the effect of price flexibility on these features as well as on market welfare properties. Assuming an exchange economy with H agents consuming two goods with one strategic complement, we show that flexibility of prices may remove both the multiplicity of the equilibria and the instability of behavior when the externalities are strong. Moreover, we find conditions to correct instability when it is caused by perverse wealth effects. When preferences are quasilinear and identical, if the externality is beneficial, any equilibrium is Pareto optimal despite the externality. But if the externality is detrimental, corrections are required.","[Randon, Emanuela] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Simmons, Peter] Univ York, Dept Econ, York Y01 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of Bologna; University of York - UK,"Randon, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",emanuela.randon@unibo.it; ps1@york.ac.uk,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,7,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Since a major portion of larger gem-quality diamonds are used for engagement rings, such an outcome is consistent with Bernheim's model of conformism, where individuals try to conform to a single standard of behavior that is often established at a focal point.

If this Classical Dichotomy is false monetary policy may induce hysteresis because the natural rate of interest would depend upon the money rate of interest. We use data for Israel to test Wicksell's Classical Dichotomy. We proxy the natural rate of interest by the forward yield to maturity on indexed-linked treasury bonds. If the null hypothesis is false it is difficult to suggest persuasive instruments that would identify the causal effect of the money rate on the natural rate of interest. Our identification strategy is therefore built around quasi-experimentation and event analysis. Large and seemingly orthogonal shocks to the natural rate of interest have no measurable effect on the natural rate of interest according to non-parametric and parametric tests. Therefore, Wicksell's Classical Dichotomy is empirically valid. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Do incentives alter behavior and generate economically consistent choices? Lichtenstein and Slovic (1971) document inconsistencies (reversals) in revealed preference in gamble pairs across paired choice and individual pricing tasks. The observed pattern is inconsistent with stable underlying preferences expressed with simple errors. Lichtenstein and Slovic (1973) and Grether and Plott (1979) introduce incentives, but aggregate reversal rates change little. These results fostered numerous replications and assertions that models of non-stable preferences are required to explain reversals. Contrary to this research, we find that incentives can generate more economically consistent behavior. Our re-evaluation Of existing experimental data shows that incentives have a clear impact by better aligning aggregate choices and prices.

It has not been possible, until now, to investigate more closely the interplay of different factors in the time dimension because the empirical research has been based on cross-section analysis. This omission makes biased estimates of the investment-uncertainty relationship likely. The aim of this paper is to extend the findings of the empirical literature using a panel of Italian firms in the period 1996-2004, covering a complete business cycle. The availability of panel survey data on companies' investment plans, expected future sales and demand uncertainty allows us to account for unobservable individual differences between firms, macroeconomic shocks and the evolution of the investment-uncertainty relationship. A key finding of our paper concerns the role of the competition encountered by Italian firms in 1996-2004. The gradual loss of market power over time of Italian manufacturing firms, along with the increasing flexibility of labour input has weakened the negative effect of uncertainty on investment decisions. We show that, in repeated cross-section estimates, the omission of firm-specific effects together with the dynamic interplay described above, would have lead to misleading conclusions about the relevance of demand uncertainty in explaining investment decisions.

To examine this, we offer a model of clock games, which we then test experimentally. Each player's clock starts upon receiving a signal about a payoff-relevant state variable. Since the timing of the signals is random, clocks are de-synchronized. A player must decide how long, if at all, to delay his move after receiving the signal. We show that (i) delay decreases as clocks become more synchronized, and (ii) when moves are observable. players herd immediately after any player makes a move. Our experimental results are broadly consistent with these two key predictions of the theory. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Some generalize classic social-choice-theoretic domain conditions, others have no counterpart. Our most general condition generalizes Sen's triplewise value-restriction, itself the most general classic condition. We also prove a new characterization theorem: for a large class of domains, if there exists any aggregation function satisfying some democratic conditions, then majority voting is the unique such function.

This paper empirically examines the impact of differential amounts of shareholder power on governance arrangements. When U.S. states enacted statutory antitakeover protections in the 1980s, the states differed in the power granted to shareholders to opt out of the antitakeover protections without agreement by the board of directors. These differences in shareholder power are associated with little change in governance arrangements. The results suggest that simply altering shareholder power without changing other governance mechanisms is unlikely to lead to widespread changes in corporate governance.

However, since these data are specific to Medicare, it is unclear to what extent this finding generalizes to the private sector. Economic theory suggests that private insurers have stronger incentives to restrain utilization and costs, while public insurers have greater monopsony power to restrain prices. We argue that these two differences alone should lead to greater regional variation in utilization for the public sector, but either more or less variation in spending. We provide evidence that variation in utilization in the public sector is about 2.8 times as great for outpatient visits (p < 0.01) and 3.9 times as great for hospital days (p = 0.09) as in the private sector. Variation in spending appears to be greater in the private sector, consistent with the importance of public sector price restraints.","[Philipson, Tomas J.; Lockwood, Lee M.] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Seabury, Seth A.] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA 90406 USA; [Goldman, Dana P.; Lakdawalla, Darius N.] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Chicago; RAND Corporation; University of Southern California,"Philipson, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,"Goldman, Dana P/E-7667-2013; Lakdawalla, Darius/B-4409-2011","Goldman, Dana P/0000-0001-8498-6396; Lakdawalla, Darius/0000-0001-5934-8042",,,,,30,30,35,0,12,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

The first to apply the MS unit root test to the issue of US external debt in order to examine local stationarity and global stationarity were Raybaudi et al. (2004). This paper introduces an extended MS unit root test where the transition probability is time-varying rather than fixed, as is usually the case, and the change of probability is explained by the real exchange rate, which theory suggests has a close relationship with the external balance. The extended MS unit root test calculated by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method provides us with new insights on the issue of US external debt in recent years, suggesting that even though the debt/current account-GDP ratio remains relatively high, the probability of stationarity (sustainability) is unexpectedly high when recent US dollar depreciation is taken into account.

The crunch occurred because regulation was too lax, and we need to develop new and more effective tools of regulatory control. To focus on current account imbalances or mistakes in setting interest rates as a prime cause of the credit crunch is unconvincing, and has the danger of diverting attention away from the need to increase financial regulation. The current recession does require a re-evaluation of the role fiscal policy can play when interest rates hit a zero bound. An expansionary fiscal policy is required because monetary policy-makers are reluctant to promise higher future inflation, and the impact of quantitative easing is likely to be small. Although rising debt may place a limit on how much conventional fiscal policy can do, not all expansionary fiscal measures require additional borrowing. There are two important lessons for the future. First, although monetary policy should remain the primary tool to stabilize the business cycle, the combination of fiscal implementation lags and uncertainty means that some precautionary fiscal action may be appropriate during the early phase of some economic downturns. Second, to play this 'backstop' stabilization role effectively, a policy that results in the government debt-to-GDP ratio declining (albeit gradually and erratically) in normal times seems appropriate.","[Wren-Lewis, Simon] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Wren-Lewis, Simon] Univ Oxford Merton Coll, Oxford OX1 4JD, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Wren-Lewis, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",simon.wren-lewis@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/G006873/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G006873/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,26,19,19,1,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Money in our model has an informational role which facilitates the estimation of the unobserved shocks that drive potential output and thus the state of the economy. For this purpose we estimate a small-scale sticky price model using Bayesian techniques. Our findings support the view that money has information value. This is reflected in higher precision in terms of unobserved model concepts such as the natural rate of output. Moreover, our results highlight how modelling money demand can provide insights about structural features of the economy that may be important for the design of interest rate rules. Focusing on money also allows for a step towards resolving the price puzzle. Money demand shocks can confound monetary policy shocks to generate a perverse price response in vector autoregressions (VAR).","[Arestis, Philip] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Chortareas, Georgios] Univ Athens, GR-10679 Athens, Greece; [Chortareas, Georgios] Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Tsoukalas, John D.] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Cambridge; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; University of Essex; University of Nottingham,"Arestis, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",,,,,,,,52,7,7,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

In this paper, we estimate the value of school facility investments using housing markets: standard models of local public goods imply that school districts should spend up to the point where marginal increases would have zero effect on local housing prices. Our research design isolates exogenous variation in investments by comparing school districts where referenda on bond issues targeted to fund capital expenditures passed and failed by narrow margins. We extend this traditional regression discontinuity approach to identify the dynamic treatment effects of bond authorization on local housing prices, student achievement, and district composition. Our results indicate that California school districts underinvest in school facilities: passing a referendum causes immediate, sizable increases in home prices, implying a willingness to pay on the part of marginal homebuyers of $1.50 or more for each $1 of capital spending. These effects do not appear to be driven by changes in the income or racial composition of homeowners, and the impact on test scores appears to explain only a small portion of the total housing price effect.","[Cellini, Stephanie Riegg] George Washington Univ, Trachtenberg Sch Publ Policy & Publ Adm, Washington, DC 20052 USA; Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Goldman Sch Publ Policy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",George Washington University; University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Cellini, SR (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Trachtenberg Sch Publ Policy & Publ Adm, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",scellini@gwu.edu; fferreir@wharton.upenn.edu; rothstein@berkeley.edu,,"Rothstein, Jesse/0000-0001-6140-0858",,,,,59,221,322,5,98,M I T PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"238 MAIN STREET, STE 500, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1046 USA",0033-5533,,,Q J ECON,Q.

The defining characteristic of collective annuities is that they do not depend on an individual's survival probabilities. We show that such a system may be welfare improving (with a utilitarian social welfare function) even when private annuity markets are perfect and when life expectancy and earning abilities are positively correlated (i.e., in a setting that is a priori biased against collective annuities). We first concentrate on linear pension systems and contrast two schemes: a pure contributory (Bismarckian) pension and a flat rate (Beveridgean) pension. We show that the case for collective annuities is stronger when they are associated with a flat pension system. Then we analyze nonlinear pension schemes. We show that the solution can be implemented by a pension scheme associated with annuities that reflect some degree of collectiveness. Unlike under pure collective annuities, benefits do depend on life expectancy but to a lesser degree than with actuarially fair private annuities. In other words, the impact of survival probabilities is mitigated rather than completely neutralized.","[Cremer, Helmuth] IDEI, GREMAQ, Toulouse Sch Econ, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Cremer, Helmuth] Inst Univ France, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Lozachmeur, Jean-Marie] CNRS, GREMAQ, Toulouse Sch Econ, F-75700 Paris, France; [Pestieau, Pierre] Univ Liege, CREPP, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Pestieau, Pierre] Univ Catholique Louvain, CORE, Louvain, Belgium",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Institut Universitaire de France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; University of Liege; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Cremer, H (通讯作者)，IDEI, GREMAQ, Toulouse Sch Econ, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France.",helmut@cict.fr; jean-marie.lozachmeur@univ-tlse1.fr; p.pestieau@ulg.ac.be,,,,,,,17,17,17,0,10,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Fiscal shocks are shown to yield endogenously determined (dampened) cycles for a realistic calibration of the model. Impulse response functions of fiscal policy shocks in the finite-horizon model differ substantially from those resulting from an infinitely lived representative agent model.

Privatization phases alternate with nationalization episodes. The post WWII nationalization policies in Europe gave way to a privatization wave in the 1980s and are now followed by a return to nationalization in the context of the current financial crisis. Theories of privatization or nationalization typically compare, in a static framework, the economic or political efficiency of private and state ownership, either in general, or for a list of specific goods and services. They do not explain, however, why the privatization phenomenon occurred at about the same time in many countries, and why not before, nor can they account for changes in these policies and especially the policy reversals. We model the fluctuating allocation of property rights in firms between private investors and the state, as the outcome of a competitive bidding for ownership in which the private investors value shareholders wealth, and the government values political support and survival, obtained through the transfer of the firms' cash flow to various political clienteles. The investors who value the firm most get the rights of control - a privatization or a nationalization according to which type of investor has the lowest cost of funds. Recent data on 15 years of privatization in 8 countries lend support to our theory.","[Rosa, Jean-Jacques; Perard, Edouard] Inst Etud Polit Paris, Paris, France",,"Rosa, JJ (通讯作者)，Inst Etud Polit Paris, Paris, France.",jjr@jjrosa.com; edouard.perard@sciences-po.org,,,,,,,41,11,15,0,14,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0023-5962,,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,FEB,2010,63.0,1,,,,,110,132,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2010.00465.x,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,543UR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273604700007,0

The analysis is then extended to account for self insurance (taking the form of a first-period contingency fund) financed through taxation. An increase in aid volatility is shown to raise the optimal contingency fund.

Two main candidate explanations may be singled out: common shocks and common transmission mechanisms. In the article it is shown that they are complementary, rather than alternative, explanations. By means of a large-scale Factor Vector Autoregressive (FVAR) model, allowing for full economic and statistical identification of all global and idiosyncratic shocks, it is found that both common disturbances and common transmission mechanisms of global and country-specific shocks account for business cycle comovement in the G-7 countries. Moreover, spillover effects of foreign idiosyncratic disturbances seem to be a less important factor than the common transmission of global or domestic shocks in the determination of international macro-economic comovements.","[Morana, Claudio] Univ Piemonte Orientale Amedeo Avogadro, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Metodi Quantitat, I-28100 Novara, Italy; [Bagliano, Fabio C.] Univ Turin, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Finanziarie G Prato, I-10100 Turin, Italy",University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro; University of Turin,"Morana, C (通讯作者)，Univ Piemonte Orientale Amedeo Avogadro, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Metodi Quantitat, Via Perrone 18, I-28100 Novara, Italy.",Claudio.morana@eco.unipmn.it,"Morana, Claudio/F-1680-2013; Bagliano, Fabio C./G-1402-2013","MORANA, CLAUDIO/0000-0001-8624-3158; Bagliano, Fabio C./0000-0001-8915-6519",,,,,37,13,15,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Exploiting the idiosyncratic spread of television across markets, we use micro data from the Survey of Consumer Finances to test whether households with early access to television saw steeper debt increases than households with delayed access. Results indicate that exposure to television advertising increases the tendency to borrow for household goods and the tendency to carry debt. Television access is associated with higher debt levels for durable goods, but not with the total amount of non-mortgage debt. We provide suggestive evidence that increased labor supply may drive our results. The role of media in household debt may be greater than suggested by existing research.","[Baker, Matthew J.; George, Lisa M.] CUNY Hunter Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Baker, Matthew J.; George, Lisa M.] CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY 10021 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Hunter College (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Baker, MJ (通讯作者)，CUNY Hunter Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA.",mjbaker@hunter.cuny.edu; lisa.george@hunter.cuny.edu,"Baker, Matthew John/HNP-3223-2023; Baker, Matthew/HOC-6606-2023",,,,,,46,19,19,0,15,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

For the past two decades, the information technology (IT) industry has formed the backbone of Taiwan's economy. There are many theories that have identified a plethora of factors which contribute to the success of a small business. This case study applies the theory of absorptive capacity to ASUSTek Computer Inc., a small Taiwanese business founded on April 2, 1990 by four engineers with capital of NT$30 million (US$950,000) which has grown to become a global leader in the IT industry with a total revenue of NT$755 billion (US$24 billion) and market capitalization of NT$49 billion (US$1.5 billion) as of December 31, 2007. (Based on exchange rate US$1=NT$31.5. ASUS's revenue dropped to NT$668 billion in 2008 mainly due to the global financial crisis.) ASUS' business significantly took off after Jonney Shih joined the company as CEO in 1993. He remains a key anchor of ASUS. ASUS' ability to not only absorb, transform, and utilize new knowledge but develop new technology in-house to create and sustain competitive advantage in the market place has ensured the company's continuing success as well as propelling it to a position of leadership in the IT industry worldwide. This paper will discuss how ASUS' in-house RD; apprenticeship-style on-the-job training; management leadership's organizational culture and structureall of which stress learning and innovation; financial resources and conservative fiscal policy; as well as pro-business government policies have provided the foundation and environment for great absorptive capacity to develop and adapt technology, enabling ASUS to become a oGiant Liono in the global computer industry.","[Chen, Chyong Ling Judy] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Business, Taichung 40724, Taiwan; [Belcher, Susan Margaret] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Int Trade, Coll Business, Taichung 40724, Taiwan; [Belcher, Susan Margaret] Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada",Feng Chia University; Feng Chia University; University of Alberta,"Chen, CLJ (通讯作者)，Feng Chia Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Business, 100 Wen Hwa Rd, Taichung 40724, Taiwan.",clchen@fcu.edu.tw,,,,,,,50,5,6,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1226-508X,,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

And nowhere is this more important than for Africa, where economies depend heavily on agriculture and hunger is on the rise. Agriculture is in the headlines, but for the wrong reasons: failures instead of successes. It is receiving rare political attention and financial commitments by governments and donors. This creates unique opportunities in using agriculture for development. But will opportunities be seized? Governments and donors have increasingly turned their backs on agriculture over the last 20 years, contributing to the current food crisis. Will African governments and donors respond by successfully using agriculture for development, or, after a brief concern with agriculture motivated by food riots and human distress, are we to witness a return to business as usual? This paper attempts to answer that question, identifying causes that have led to the crisis, opportunities for new departures and forces that could be mobilised in order to avoid the business-as-usual scenario and promote instead the agriculture-for-development outcome.","[de Janvry, Alain; Sadoulet, Elisabeth] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"de Janvry, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, 207 Giannini Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",alain@are.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,35,9,9,1,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Human capital is projected by cohorts, and allowance is implicitly made for the impact of ageing and potential labour market and pension reforms on employment growth. Leaving aside deeper sources of uncertainty such as model and parameter uncertainty, projections are found to be sensitive to future economic policies in the areas of education, pensions, tabour markets and climate change mitigation, and even more so to total factor productivity and population trends.

This investment hunger can lead to unanticipated declines in the returns to investment, and resulting financial insolvencies. Private consumption remains low and there are concerns that high savings rates cannot be sustained. We construct a dynamic general equilibrium model and apply it to a stylized Asian economy, loosely based upon China. We calibrate a benchmark equilibrium, and carry out various counterfactual simulations to analyze alternative policies, in particular tax cuts and exchange rate revaluations, as instruments in increasing private consumption while avoiding bank failures.

A seller and a buyer with private and independent valuations exchange a unit of good. Trade is mediated by an intermediary, who observes a coarse signal about the buyer's valuation and may reveal it to the seller before bargaining. We show that if the broker gets a fixed per-transaction fee, he can fully transmit information via cheap talk. This information transmission increases ex ante welfare of the seller and the broker but has an ambiguous impact on the buyer. We show that limits to informative communication may arise if the intermediary observes signals about valuations of both participants or because of competition between intermediaries. Finally, using mechanism design approach, we show that choosing an appropriate system of two-part tariffs allows the intermediary to secure the same expected profit as in the optimal direct mechanism.","[Femminis, Gianluca] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Martini, Gianmaria] Univ Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; University of Bergamo,"Femminis, G (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",gianluca.femminis@unicatt.it; gianmaria.martini@unibg.it,"Martini, Gianmaria/N-6165-2016","Martini, Gianmaria/0000-0001-9503-4999",,,,,33,0,0,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

The formation of regional trade agreements has been, by far, the most popular form of reciprocal trade liberalization in the past 15 years. The discriminatory character of these agreements has raised three main concerns: that trade diversion would be rampant, because special interest groups would induce governments to form the most distortionary agreements; that broader external trade liberalization would stall or reverse; and that multilateralism could be undermined. Theoretically, all these concerns are legitimate, although there are also several theoretical arguments that oppose them. Empirically, neither widespread trade diversion non stalled external liberalization has materialized, whereas the undermining of multilateralism has not been properly tested. There are also several aspects of regionalism that have received rod little attention from researchers, but which are central to understanding its causes and consequences.","[Freund, Caroline] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Ornelas, Emanuel] London Sch Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England",The World Bank; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Freund, C (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",cfreund@worldbank.org; e.a.ornelas@lse.ac.uk,"ornelas, emanuel/A-7413-2014; Julian, Craig/B-3954-2018",,ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,109,102,110,1,56,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4602-7,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

Using cross-country data from 1970 to 2000, and several indicators of volatility (such as inflation, exchange rate, government expenditure, output and investment volatility) this article shows that although, all these measures of volatility are remarkably harmful for growth, business cycle investment volatility is the main source that hampers long-run growth. This relation is robust to different measures of business cycle, and to different sub-samples of countries.","[Furceri, Davide] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60680 USA; [Furceri, Davide] Univ Palermo, Ist Econ Polit, Palermo, Italy",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of Palermo,"Furceri, D (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60680 USA.",furceri@economia.unipa.it,,,,,,,36,6,7,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Besides the well-known congestion externalities, we show that on-the-job search in combination with monopsonistic wage setting without commitment creates a business-stealing externality. In the absence of congestion effects, this leads to excessive vacancy creation. Under wage setting with commitment this externality is absent because when posting a wage, firms take into account the expected productivity of future workers in their current jobs. If firms are able to make and respond to counteroffers, then they will not have to pay no-quit premia and this also leads to excessive vacancy creation.","[Gautier, Pieter A.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, CEPR, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Gautier, Pieter A.] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Teulings, Coen N.] Univ Amsterdam, CPB, CEPR, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Teulings, Coen N.] Tinvergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; University of Amsterdam,"Gautier, PA (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, CEPR, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,"Gautier, Pieter/IRZ-2524-2023","van Vuuren, Aico/0000-0001-8761-7879; Gautier, Pieter/0000-0003-1001-3967",,,,,25,34,44,2,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Firstly, it attempts to determine the timing and factors that have influenced the movement of each of the four CE countries through their IDP stages. Secondly, it aims at identifying differences and similarities between the individual countries' IDP trajectories and at drawing conclusions which might prove to be useful for other countries in the region. The data sets used in this study have been derived from UNCTAD's World Investment Reports and Handbook of Statistics. The period covered by the authors' analysis spans the entire period of the four countries' transition (with the exception of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, for which data series do not include the years 1990-92), up to 2006, the last year for which the relevant data was available. The paper sets out by presenting the IDP model and reviewing empirical studies applying, or at least relating to, the IDP model in CEE. The main body of the paper contains a comparative analysis of IDP trajectories of the four countries under study. Here, analysis focuses on three key issues: the passing from IDP stage 1 to stage 2; the effects of the EU accession on the countries' IDP trajectories and the movement towards IDP stage 3. The concluding section summarizes the main findings, pinpoints their limitations and identifies future research avenues.","[Gorynia, Marian] Poznan Univ Econ, Poznan, Poland; [Nowak, Jan] Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary; [Wolniak, Radoslaw] Univ Warsaw, PL-00325 Warsaw, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business; Central European University; University of Warsaw,"Gorynia, M (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ, Poznan, Poland.",,"Wolniak, Radoslaw/ABA-9722-2020; Gorynia, Marian/P-7786-2018","Wolniak, Radoslaw/0000-0003-1801-2408; Gorynia, Marian/0000-0002-7633-8249",,,,,25,20,20,0,13,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

An examination of the distribution of lottery funds in England,APPLIED ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PUBLIC-EXPENDITURE; UK,"The UK National Lottery has been in operation since 1994. An examination of the regional distribution of awards per head of population suggests marked spatial disparities with London doing particularly well and Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and the North East faring much better than other regions. Such disparities also exist at English Local Authority level with London and some major provincial centres doing much better than more rural authorities. Such inequalities may give grounds for concern, given that they appear to replicate those for other types of Government spending. The results of an empirical model designed to explain the spatial distribution of awards suggest that, in addition to a London effect, levels of deprivation have a positive impact. Another important explanatory variable which has a positive impact on lottery funding is the qualifications of residents which might plausibly reflect the quality of lottery bids received from an area. However, once these factors are taken account of, there is little evidence that rural areas fare badly.","[Gripaios, Peter; Bishop, Paul; Brand, Steven] Univ Plymouth, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",University of Plymouth,"Brand, S (通讯作者)，Univ Plymouth, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.",p.gripaios@plymouth.ac.uk,,,,,,,19,0,2,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Tariff policy is designed to promote economic development and the industrial sector tariff structure may reflect characteristics of the industries protected. We seek to identify the effect of tariffs by taking advantage of multilateral tariff liberalization using reductions in industrial sector tariffs in other world regions as instruments for sectoral tariff reductions in South Africa. The data cover 28 manufacturing sectors over the period 1988-2003. We find that tariff reductions have stimulated labour productivity when instrumented by multilateral tariffs. The ordinary least-squares estimates show downward bias and this confirms the endogeneity of tariffs.

We survey how U.S. economists viewed European monetary unification from the publication of the Delors Report in 1989 to the introduction of euro notes and coins in January 2002. U.S. academic economists concentrated on whether a single currency was a good or bad thing, usually using the theory of optimum currency areas, and most were skeptical towards the single currency. In contrast, Federal Reserve economists had a less analytical and a more pragmatic approach. Both groups adjusted their views as European monetary unification progressed. It is surprising that academic economists, living in and benefiting from the U.S. monetary union, were so skeptical of monetary unification in Europe. We explain the skepticism as resulting from the strong influence of the original theory of optimum currency areas; failure to see monetary unification as an evolutionary process; failure to identify pegged exchange rates, rather than floating rates, as the practical alternative to a single European currency; and the belief that the single currency for Europe was primarily a political project that ignored economic fundamentals.","[Jonung, Lars] Commiss European Communities, Directorate Gen Econ & Financial Affairs, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium; [Drea, Eoin] Tom Phillips & Associates, Dublin 8, Ireland",,"Jonung, L (通讯作者)，Commiss European Communities, Directorate Gen Econ & Financial Affairs, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium.",lars@jonung.se; eoin@tpa.ie,,,,,,,188,45,48,0,37,INST SPONTANEOUS ORDER ECONOMICS,FAIRFAX,"9745 KINGS CROWN COURT #102, FAIRFAX, VA 22031 USA",1933-527X,,,ECON J WATCH,Econ.

Specifically, this article aims to investigate, at cross-country level, the linguistic and nonlinguistic factors influencing the variation of proficiency in the use of English as a second language. As a proxy for English proficiency, we use the average Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) scores achieved by residents of a total of over 60 countries. The regression results suggest that linguistic factors such as historical affinity and similarity in word order between English and a given language have an influence on the proficiency in English achieved by people whose native language is not English. Among the nonlinguistic factors, expected years of schooling and degree of globalization have a positive relation with proficiency in English. These results seem robust, even when the computer-based TOEFL score is used in place of the paper-based TOEFL score and even when the overall score is replaced by the respective score in listening comprehension, structure and written expression, and reading comprehension.","[Lee, Hyun-Hoon] Kangwon Natl Univ, Div Econ & Int Trade, Chunchon 200701, Gangwon Do, South Korea; [Kim, Myung-Hee] Hanyang Univ, Div English & Culture, Ansan 425791, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Kangwon National University; Hanyang University,"Lee, HH (通讯作者)，Kangwon Natl Univ, Div Econ & Int Trade, Chunchon 200701, Gangwon Do, South Korea.",hhlee@kangwon.ac.kr,,,,,,,24,2,2,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Reunification seems to have induced two structural changes in the empirical housing market model. First, the speed of equilibrium adjustment via residential investment slowed down substantially and real house prices lost the capacity to contribute to the adjustment process.

The increasing scope of foreign economic activity of enterprises encourages enterprises to give more attention to the decisions of transformation of national brands into international ones. In order to present a brand as a strong brand that can compete on an international level, it is necessary to acknowledge and understand the similarities and differences of branding in local and foreign markets. Studies of transformation of a national brand into an international one have been fragmentary to date. There are only several researches that are deeper and more single-mindedly dedicated to the study of introduction of a national brand into foreign markets. The main objective of this research is to prepare a conceptual model of transformation of a national brand into an international one. Based on the analysis of research performed in the area of international branding, the main decisions of brands in foreign markets and factors that determine them were identified. The creation of international brands is more complex than the creation of national ones because at least four levels of brand creation must be considered: (1) branded product vs. no brand (generic product), (2) manufacturer brand vs. private brand, (3) single brand vs. multiple brands, (4) global brand vs. local brand. When introducing a brand in a new market at first attention should be given to the increase of brand awareness, and only later brand image may be considered. The image is determined by the decisions of brand core essence or positioning that offers unique added value to consumers. Means, used for consolidating the brand in the national market, will not always be suitable for foreign markets. Inner as well as outer environmental factors of the enterprise should be considered when making international brand decisions. Inner factors of the enterprise are also factors that form supply. The following factors are emphasized in this factor group: the degree of centralisation of the enterprise activity, the budget of brand creation, and the possibilities of decreasing cost. When creating an international brand, differences between the national and foreign markets must be taken into account. The following aspects of the markets may differ: consumer behaviour, marketing infrastructure, scope of competition, level of economic development, cultural values, and state regulation. These differences may have a decisive influence on the creation of the brand and its management beyond the limits of the national market. The result of theoretical studies is an original conceptual model of transformation of a national brand into an international one, connecting decisions of situation analysis, brand decisions in foreign markets, adaptation of brand identity roots and integrated brand communications, and control of brand success in a market. The presented model will enable to ensure that when a national brand is introduced in a foreign market successful brand adaptation in foreign markets will be purposefully sought.","[Kuvykaite, Rita; Mascinskiene, Jurate] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Kuvykaite, R (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Laisves Av 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",rita.kuvykaite@ktu.lt; jurate.mascinskiene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,45,6,7,5,38,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In the model, firms sign upon entry long-term contracts with banks that finance their entry and per period labor costs. Firms may exit due to liquidation by banks or exogenous exit shocks. The model has a unique stationary equilibrium with turnover of jobs and firms. A quantitative exercise shows that endogenous financing constraints account for a significant amount of job reallocation observed in U.S. manufacturing and the observed negative relationship between gross job flow rates and firm size as measured by employment.","Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Li, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",shuyunl@unimelb.edu.au,"Li, Shuyun May/O-6198-2015","Li, Shuyun May/0000-0001-5825-866X",,,,,24,4,4,0,4,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

It makes several contributions. First, a detailed theoretical analysis of the measures proposed in the previous literature as proxies for speculative activity clarifies the circumstances in which they fail, as well as the assumptions that have to be made, when they are used as intended. Second, we propose a new way of combining the volume and the open interest figures, which provides additional information regarding the type of trading activity that takes place in the market on a given date. Finally, we analyse empirically the basic statistical properties of all the ratios when they are applied to real data for some of the stock index futures contracts most actively traded in the world. This empirical analysis shows the diverse behaviour of the ratios when they are applied to a common sample of real data, which confirms our previous theoretical findings. Our contributions should be taken into account when any of the measures is used as a proxy for the relative importance of speculative demand in empirical analyses.","[Lucia, Julio J.; Pardo, Angel] Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Financial Econ, Valencia 46022, Spain",University of Valencia,"Pardo, A (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Financial Econ, Avda Naranjos S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",angel.pardo@uv.es,"Pardo, Angel/E-8919-2017","Pardo, Angel/0000-0002-8624-0640",,,,,15,40,49,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

To account for fat tails in the empirical distribution of the series, we compare models based on the normal, Student's t and generalized exponential distribution. We focus on out-of-sample predictability by ranking the models according to a large array of statistical loss functions. The results from the tests for predictive ability show that the GARCH-G model fares best for short horizons from 1 to 3 days ahead. For horizons from 1 week ahead, no superior model can be identified. We also consider out-of-sample loss functions based on value-at-risk that mimic portfolio managers and regulators' preferences. Exponential GARCH models display the best performance in this case. The swings in oil prices that gave investors and traders whiplash in 2004 are not preventing new investors from rushing into oil and other energy-related commodities this year. (...) Ultimately, the rising number of speculator could lead to even more price volatility in 2005, pushing the highs higher and the lows lower. (...) After a generation in the wilderness, the oil futures that are used to make a bet on oil prices have become a bona fide investment, said Charles O'Donnell, who manages Lake Asset Management, a small energy fund based in London.

Different patterns are observed in the public sector, where EWP remain basically stable over time. A number of robustness checks and various econometric specifications are also applied in order to address sample selection issues.

Similar to other studies of the reaction to this Act, we observe that investors consider the FSM to be good news. More interestingly, we also observe that systematic risk increased for some types of firms, but decreased for others as barriers were lowered. This finding is consistent with the idea that the reduction of regulation may increase systematic risk, but that the effects of deregulation on risk may be mitigated by anticipated effects of diversification. Specifically, bank holding companies that chose to diversify into other financial industries experienced increases in systematic risk while those that did not diversify realized decreases in systematic risk. Overall, we find that the systematic risk of financial firms converged and increased in the past few years as firms expanded into non-traditional businesses. In addition, we find that the Act reduced systematic risk for some firms, specifically those that diversified their product lines with insurance products.","[Neale, Faith R.; Clark, Steven P.] Univ N Carolina, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Drake, Pamela Peterson] James Madison Univ, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; James Madison University,"Neale, FR (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",frneale@uncc.edu; drakepp@jmu.edu; spclark@uncc.edu,,,,,,,53,2,2,0,25,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The USREP model tracks nine different income groups and twelve different geographic regions within the U.S. We find that the allocation schemes in all proposals are progressive over the lower half of the income distribution and proportional in the upper half of the income distribution. Scenarios based on the Cantwell-Collins allocation proposal are less progressive in early years and have lower welfare costs due to smaller redistribution to low income households and, consequently, lower income-induced increases in energy demand and less savings and investment. Scenarios based on the three other allocation schemes tend to overcompensate some adversely affected income groups and regions in early years, but this dissipates over time as the allowance allocation effect becomes weaker. Finally, we find that carbon pricing by itself (ignoring the return of carbon revenues through allowance allocations) is proportional to modestly progressive. This striking result follows from the dominance of the sources over uses side impacts of the policy and stands in sharp contrast to previous work that has focused only on the uses side. The main reason is that lower income households derive a large fraction of income from government transfers, and we hold the transfers constant in real terms, reflecting the fact that transfers are generally indexed to inflation. As a result, this source of income is unaffected by carbon pricing while wage and capital income is affected.","[Rausch, Sebastian; Reilly, John M.; Paltsev, Sergey] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Metcalf, Gilbert E.] Tufts Univ, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Tufts University,"Rausch, S (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",rausch@mit.edu; gilbert.metcalf@tufts.edu; jreilly@mit.edu; paltsev@mit.edu,,"Rausch, Sebastian/0000-0002-6379-8406; Paltsev, Sergey/0000-0003-3287-0732",,,,,45,62,66,0,20,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

During this process, regulators and policymakers have found themselves under immense pressure from the private sector over the nature and degree of regulation of commercial activities. Some argue that an economy left to the market will reduce the burden on the State, improve efficiency and growth, and thus contribute to the country's developmental objectives. There are others, however, who argue otherwise. They believe that competition law and policy can play important roles in the advancement of developing countries. We argue that competition policy and law are essential. What might vary between countries, however, is the mix between ex ante and ex post regulation. While regulatory frameworks are being developed in small countries, the State or the regulatory institution might have difficulty in undertaking ex post regulation for several reasons. This article demonstrates how unfair trading practices and anti-competitive behaviour were curbed in Fiji's telecommunications sector.","[Reddy, Mahendra] Fiji Natl Univ, Coll Business Hospitality & Tourism Studies, Suva, Fiji; [Reddy, Mahendra] Fiji Commerce Commiss, Suva, Fiji",Fiji National University (FNU),"Reddy, M (通讯作者)，Fiji Natl Univ, Coll Business Hospitality & Tourism Studies, Suva, Fiji.",,,"Reddy, Mahendra/0009-0007-8102-3974",,,,,21,0,0,0,1,ASIA PACIFIC PRESS,CANBERRA,"AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIV, CRAWFORD SCH ECONOMICS & GOVERNMENT, CANBERRA, ACT 0200, AUSTRALIA",0817-8038,,,PAC ECON BULL,Pac.

In the early phases of industrialization, public education was undesirable for the young poor who relied on child labor. Compulsory schooling therefore discouraged childbirth, while the accompanying industrialization stimulated their demand for education. The subsequent rise in the share of the old population, however, limited government resources for education, placing heavier financial burdens on the young. This induced further fertility decline and population aging, and the resulting cycle may have delayed the growth of advanced economies in the last few decades. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The question of the effectiveness of aid has tried to be solved through an empirical process, in which the economic theory contributes different growth models that guide the specification of the empirical relations to be estimated. The analysis of the macroeconomic impact of aid falls within the broader debate on the forces that boost growth, understanding that aid may contribute among other factors to the economic progress of the developing world. Nevertheless, given that none of the proposed theories of growth perfectly explains the process of economic growth, the theoretical basis of the aid-growth connexion is still debatable.

However, competition among nonprofits creates an incentive for managers to under-report management and fund-raising expenditures to make their firms appear relatively efficient. Increasingly, researchers suspect that information provided in the Form 990 may not accurately portray the true financial condition of nonprofit firms. Inaccurate price information weakens the ability of donors to promote efficiency and discipline excess among nonprofit managers. This article examines the reaction of donors to variation in Form 990 reporting quality. We find that donors reward nonprofit firms for investments in more accurate financial reporting. Additionally, higher quality financial information sharpens the ability of donor markets to discipline nonprofit firms by increasing price sensitivity. The primary implication of this study is that regulatory improvements in reporting quality could increase the ability of donor markets to serve as a viable governance mechanism for improving nonprofit efficiency.","[Thornton, Jeremy P.] Samford Univ, Dept Econ, Birmingham, AL USA; [Belski, William H.] Samford Univ, Dept Accounting, Birmingham, AL USA",Samford University; Samford University,"Thornton, JP (通讯作者)，Samford Univ, Dept Econ, Birmingham, AL USA.",jpthornt@samford.edu,,"Thornton, Jeremy/0000-0001-9941-7524",,,,,26,16,25,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It has an innovation in its matching structure that makes it more consistent with some key stylized facts of the informal sector in these countries. The model is numerically solved using Brazilian data and several policy simulations are performed. Reducing formal sector's entry cost significantly reduces the size of the informal sector and improves overall labor market performance. Increasing enforcement significantly reduces informality but has strong adverse effects on unemployment and welfare. Thus, the results indicate that the tradeoff between lower informal employment and higher unemployment rates is not present when one looks at policies that aim at reducing the costs of being formal, as opposed to policies that simply increase the costs of being informal.

The experiment shows that Fortune pioneer startups are able to protect their market leaderships against potential late followers as they experience greater shocks. Among 4 scenarios, the Fortune pioneer startups are more likely to grow rapidly in the first two high first mover shock scenarios. In particular, the Fortune pioneer startups invest more in {high first mover shock, low market luck} than in {low first mover shock, high market luck}, which suggests that, of the two types of driving forces, their survival and strategic investment depend more on first mover advantage than on market luck.

Between Incentives and Knowledge (J.E.L. codes B0, L1, L2, O3) The aim of the paper is to critically review contributions on the role of innovation upon industrial dynamics and the evolution of sectors. Two theoretical and interpretative divides stream along the literature; on the one hand, there is the well known divide technology push vs. demand pull. The technology push literature assumes that, being the set of possible human needs limitless, users cannot provide information for firms, which ultimately make their decision based upon technological opportunities and bottlenecks. Conversely, demand pull theories suggest that there is tendency of new technology to lag behind the revelation of human needs. On the other hand, both technology push and demand pull contributions are not monolithic, neither homogenous since a second divide intersects both streams of literature. Indeed there exists a flow of literature both coherent with mainstream economics and focused on the monetary incentives of firms to innovate. On the technology side, this is translated into the analysis of the impact of markets and institutions upon the rewards of innovation. On the demand side, this framework results in the analysis of the market size as the main pull mechanism. A second approach departs from mainstream economics, sacrifices the analytical tractability of the issues, and highlights the role of the knowledge embedded in the innovation processes. The focus is thus on the learning process within and between firms as necessary conditions to innovation. The demand side here is conceived as a flow of information from users and consumers to producers. The organization of the paper will mimic the historical structure of the literature. Specifically, it shows how these approaches emerged, the critiques they are confronted with and, eventually, their refinement. Finally. the paper discusses the recent attempts to overcome both divides in order to have an increasingly coherent theory of innovation and evolution of industries.","[Cantner, Uwe; Guerzoni, Marco] Univ Jena, Sch Business Adm & Econ, D-07743 Jena, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Cantner, U (通讯作者)，Univ Jena, Sch Business Adm & Econ, Carl Zeiss Str 3, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",uwe.cantner@uni-jena.de; marco.guerzoni@uni-jena.de,"guerzoni, marco/AAB-3416-2021; Cantner, Uwe/A-9187-2015","guerzoni, marco/0000-0001-7415-0771; Cantner, Uwe/0000-0002-2067-493X",,,,,152,6,6,1,24,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

An enormous amount of creative and ingenious work by a great many economists has gone into seeking explanations for the so-called equity premium return puzzle, but so far without a fully satisfactory answer. We first review the facts about the equity premium and then discuss a range of explanations that have been proposed. We conclude that the equity premium puzzle has not been solved: it remains a puzzle. And we anticipate that the equity return premium will continue, albeit at a smaller level than in the past - perhaps four percent per year. (The final draft of this paper was written before the recent stock market crash. As of October 2008, we can say that the crash does not fundamentally alter our conclusions and actually strengthens the case for a substantial future equity premium.)","[DeLong, J.

The input-output method and network analysis are applied to investigate the structure and performance at the system level and the role of each sector at the individual level in 1997 and 2002. Firstly, the R&D-flow matrices for per unit Output are constructed to examine the technology intensity and constitution of each sector. And then they are combined with the economic size and R&D investment structure in order to have a more comprehensive understanding of the system at the gross level, and reveal the main technology diffusion providers, acquirers and techno-economic flows between sectors. Results Of both Years Show that the R&D performance and technology providing for diffusion are more concentrated than technology acquiring. and this difference becomes even greater in 2002. There are fewer sectors which act as main technology diffusion Sources While more sectors participate as acquirers of technology diffusion. The techno-economic flows have high dependence oil a few traditional sectors and the contribution Of high-tech Sectors Such as ICT is quite limited. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Our results provide support for all four explanations of coresidence behavior but especially for the life cycle and dynasty models (both of which assume selfishly motivated parents) and social norms and traditions: the fact that parents who were self-employed before retirement are more likely to live with their children, the fact that parents are less likely to live with sons who adopt their wife's surname, and the fact that parents are more likely to live with daughters whose husbands adopt their surname constitute evidence in favor of the dynasty model. The fact that parents who were (relatively wealthy) executives before retirement and parents who are homeowners are more likely to live with their children and the fact that parents are more likely to live with less educated children constitute evidence in favor of the selfish life cycle model (or the altruism model). And the fact that parental attitudes toward their children affect their coresidence behavior, the fact that parents are more likely to live with their eldest child if their eldest child is a son, and the fact that parents are most likely to live with their eldest son even if he is not the eldest child constitute evidence in favor of social norms and traditions.

The experimental outcomes indicate that subjects underestimate their probability of winning the auction, and indeed overbid. When provided with feedback on the precision of their predictions, subjects learn to make better predictions, and to curb significantly overbidding.

When demand is linear, even if prices, outputs, costs and the number of firms can be observed, PWL is arbitrary in both Cournot and Bertrand equilibria. If in addition the elasticity of demand (resp. cross elasticity of demand) is known, we can calculate PWL in a Cournot (resp. Bertrand) equilibrium. When demand is isoelastic and there are many firms, PWL can be computed from prices, outputs, costs and the number of firms.

The Impact of Harmonised Standards on African Exports,JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,F13; F15,INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; REGULATIONS,"We test the hypothesis that product standards harmonised to de facto international standards are less trade restrictive than ones that are not. To do this, we construct a new database of European Union (EU) product standards. We identify standards that are aligned with International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) standards (as a proxy for de facto international norms). We use a sample-selection gravity model to examine the impact of EU standards on African textiles and clothing exports, a sector of particular development interest. We find robust evidence that non-harmonised standards reduce African exports of these products. EU standards which are harmonised to ISO standards are less trade restricting. Our results suggest that efforts to promote African exports of manufactures may need to be complemented by measures to reduce the cost impacts of product standards, including international harmonisation. In addition, efforts to harmonise national standards with international norms, including those through the World Trade Organisation Technical Barriers to Trade Agreement, promise concrete benefits through trade expansion.","[Shepherd, Ben] Princeton Univ, Niehaus Ctr Globalizat & Governance, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Czubala, Witold] Bank Amer, Charlotte, NC USA; [Wilson, John S.] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Princeton University; Bank of America Corporation; The World Bank,"Shepherd, B (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Niehaus Ctr Globalizat & Governance, Robertson 442A, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",bashepherd@gmail.com,,,,,,,40,58,65,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Each such game is determined by the set of (anonymous) minimal winning profiles. This makes it possible to count the possible systems, and the counts suggest some interesting patterns. In the (3, 2) case, the approach yields a version of May's Theorem, classifying all possible anonymous voting rules with abstention in terms of quota functions.

This generalized model helps to shed new light on a recent debate concerning the impact of factor substitution and income distribution on economic growth. We show that this impact relies on both an efficiency and a distribution effect, where the latter is caused by the distributional consequences of an increase in the elasticity of substitution. While the efficiency effect is always positive, the sign of the distribution effect depends on the particular savings hypothesis. If the savings rate out of capital income is substantial so that a certain threshold value is surpassed, the efficiency effect dominates and higher factor substitution accelerates the accumulation of capital and works as a major engine of growth.","[Irmen, Andreas] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Klump, Rainer] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany; [Klump, Rainer] CFS, Frankfurt, Germany",Ifo Institut; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Irmen, A (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Bergheimer Str 58, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany.",airmen@uni-hd.de,,"Irmen, Andreas/0000-0003-0410-8855",,,,,15,20,23,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

We investigate this claim in a broad sample of emerging markets during the period 1976-2002. If the banking sector does not experience a systemic crisis, sudden stop events fail to have a significant impact on investment. Bank crises, on the other hand, have a significant negative effect on investment even in the absence of a contemporaneous sudden stop crisis. We also find that openness to capital flows worsens the adverse impact of banking crises on investment. Our results provide statistical support for the policy view that a strong banking sector which can withstand the negative fallout of capital flight is essential for countries that open their economies to international financial flows.

We study two distinct types of such shocks: large declines in the price of a country's commodity exports and severe natural disasters. Unsurprisingly, adverse shocks reduce the short-term growth of constant-price GDP and we analyse which structural policies help to minimize these losses. Structural policies are incentives and regulations that are maintained for long periods, contrasting with policy responses to shocks, the analysis of which has dominated the literature. We show that some previously neglected structural policies have large effects that are specific to particular types of shock. In particular, regulations which reduce the speed of firm exit substantially increase the short-term growth loss from adverse non-agricultural export price shocks and so are particularly ill-suited to mineral exporting economies. Natural disasters appear to be better accommodated by labour market policies, perhaps because Such shocks directly dislocate the population.","[Collier, Paul] Univ Oxford, Ctr Study African Econ, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",University of Oxford,"Collier, P (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Ctr Study African Econ, Dept Econ, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",Paul.Collier@economics.ox.ac.uk; Benedikt.Goderis@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,16,12,13,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Using linear approximation, we characterize equilibrium strategies and payoffs in the three tournament games and compare them to the benchmark symmetric case of identical players. We describe small deviations from the symmetric equilibria by elasticities of a player's equilibrium effort with respect to her own ability and the abilities of her rivals. Our results only require general symmetry and smoothness assumptions but not specific functional forms for the probabilities of winning in tournaments. We show that, in equilibrium: (i) a player's effort and payoff depend on her rivals' abilities in a model-independent way, either through the average ability of the field (for static games), or through the properly discounted average ability of the field (for dynamic elimination tournaments); (ii) players respond stronger to changes in their own relative abilities than to changes in their rivals' relative abilities; (iii) aggregate effort (dissipated rent) does not change compared to the benchmark case; (iv) it is not possible to manipulate aggregate effort through seeding in binary elimination tournaments, although optimal seeding schemes for other purposes can be identified; and (v) balanced seeding and a uniform distribution of relative abilities cancel out the dependence of a player's effort on her rivals' abilities in binary elimination tournaments.","Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Ryvkin, D (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",dryvkin@fsu.edu,,"Ryvkin, Dmitry/0000-0001-9314-5441",,,,,31,10,10,0,12,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Understanding these cooperative games helps us to find stable, efficient, and fair allocations of risk. We show that the class of risk allocation and totally balanced games coincide, hence a stable allocation of risk is always possible. When the aggregate portfolio is riskless, the class of risk allocation games coincides with the class of exact games.

I argue, first, that rejection of the neutrality of money goes beyond nominal rigidity to explain the possibility of insufficient effective demand. Second, I relate Davidson's rejection of the gross substitution axiom to the Keynesian critique of the coordination of saving and investment through the loanable funds market, and to the possible failure of wage and price adjustment to assure full employment aggregate demand. Third, I propose that the inherent uncertainty implied by Davidson's assumption of a nonergodic system affects the way economists understand human behavior.","Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",Washington University (WUSTL),"Fazzari, SM (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",,,,,,,,14,5,5,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Play paths implementing Pareto dominant equilibrium payoffs are uniquely determined in all but the first period. Full cooperation does not necessarily implement these payoffs even when it maximizes total stage game payoffs. Rather, when the difference in players' discount factors is sufficiently large, Pareto dominant equilibrium payoffs are implemented by partial cooperation supported by repeated payments from the impatient to the patient player. When both players are sufficiently patient, such payoffs, while implemented via full cooperation, are supported by repeated payments from the impatient to the patient player. We characterize conditions under which public randomization has no impact oil the Pareto dominant equilibrium payoffs and conditions under which such payoffs are robust to renegotiation.

First, as a review, four major schools of thought on the rental of land in India are described. I focus on their normative and ontic assumptions. Second, noting that none of these schools is value-neutral, a plurality of six complex moral reasoning strategies emerge from this review. The advantage of the social researcher doing an overview of these normative positions is that we can compare and contrast the meta-criteria that are used. The six moral reasoning strategies are a neoliberal growth strategy, a human capabilities approach, a redistribution approach, a transformative approach, a social equality approach, and a Pareto-optimality approach. The study of these six strategies leads toward the conclusion that more research on complex moral reasoning strategies is called for, because combining them rapidly leads to difficulties. Scientific research can provide evidence to underpin and shape the moral reasoning that takes place in real-world dialogues and debates.","Univ Manchester, Cathie Marsh Ctr Census & Survey Res, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Olsen, W (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Cathie Marsh Ctr Census & Survey Res, Room G-11, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",wendy.olsen@manchester.ac.uk,"Olsen, Wendy/B-8586-2014","Olsen, Wendy/0000-0003-1440-5810",,,,,148,4,4,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Evidence on the relationship between education and labor market segmentation This paper assesses labor market segmentation across formal and informal salaried jobs and self-employment in three Latin American and three transition countries. It looks separately at the markets for skilled and unskilled labor, inquiring if segmentation is an exclusive feature of the latter. Longitudinal data are used to assess wage differentials and mobility patterns across jobs. To study mobility, the paper compares observed transitions with a new benchmark measure of mobility under no segmentation. It finds evidence of a formal wage premium relative to informal salaried jobs in the three Latin American countries, but not in transition economies. It also finds evidence of extensive mobility across these two types of jobs in all countries, particularly from informal salaried to formal jobs. These patterns are suggestive of a preference for formal over informal salaried jobs in all countries. In contrast, there is little mobility between self-employment and formal salaried jobs, suggesting the existence of barriers to this type of mobility or a strong assortative matching according to workers' individual preferences. Lastly, for both wage differentials and mobility, there is no statistical difference across skill levels, indicating that the markets for skilled and unskilled labor are similarly affected by segmentation.

By applying a multi-level modeling equation approach on responses to the subjective economic ladder (SEL) question, I find that it is not the mean income or expenditure of a reference group that affects SEL but rather the individual's ordinal ranking within a reference group (for example, the individual is from the 5th or 40th richest household in the community). Consistent with Hirsch (Hirsch, F.: Social limitation to growth.

Second, we examine the effects of splitting the largest electric power company, which is located in the eastern region, focusing on the mitigation of market power.

By applying a Heckman two-stage procedure, we investigate the causes that determine SOE privatization outcome. We find that the factors most conducive for privatization are the rise of competition, the increase of FDI concentration of both industries and provinces, and the hardening of SOEs' budget constraints. Moreover, it is shown that relatively better performing SOEs, measured by per employee value-added, profitability, and export propensity, are more prone to privatization. However, we should be careful in interpreting this result, due to the problem of selection bias. Results of the first-stage selection equation suggest that many small and non-performing SOEs dropped out of the sample, possibility due to privatization. What we can conclude is that, among the remainders, the better performing SOEs are more likely to be privatized. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

As a first estimate, $CDN2005 12/Mscf is the lowest gas price that would allow economically viable production from gas hydrates in the absence of associated free gas, while an underlying gas deposit will reduce the viability price estimate to $CDN2005 7.50/Mscf.

The results show that the overall performance of these firms improves after the transfer of their controlling shareholders, due to improvements in both operating and non-operating performance. When we separate all samples into solely SOEs and other SOEs based on the controlling shareholder, we find that operating performance improved significantly in the solely SOE group, whereas non-operating performance improved significantly in the SOE group. In addition, we identify sources of performance improvement from two perspectives: corporate governance and related party transactions. The results imply that the Chinese Government should continue to decentralize control and, at the same time, continue to monitor firm operating efficiency.","Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Wang, K (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",wangk@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,,,,,20,4,4,2,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,SEP-OCT,2009,17.0,5,,,,,52,68,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2009.01166.x,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,496LU,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000269976400004,0

The index is used to examine energy efficiency in China. Using 1997-2006 panel data for 29 provinces, we find that energy efficiency is negatively associated with the secondary industry share in GDP, the state-owned economic share in GDP and the government expenditure share in GDP, and is positively associated with the technical level and non-coal share in energy consumption. In addition, we find that there exists a large gap in energy efficiency among eastern, central and western regions. The eastern region has a significantly higher energy efficiency level than the central and western regions. We conclude that the different levels of industry structure, government intervention, energy structure, and the technology content in the three regions lead to the differences in energy efficiency.","[Wei, Chu; Shen, Manhong] Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Ni, Jinlan] Univ Nebraska, Dept Econ, Omaha, NE 68182 USA",Zhejiang Sci-Tech University; University of Nebraska System,"Wei, C (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",xiaochu@zstu.edu.cn; jni@mail.unomaha.edu; smhsmh@zstu.edu.cn,"Wei, Chu/AAB-4872-2021; Ni, Jinlan/IVH-7063-2023","Wei, Chu/0000-0002-7704-5544; Ni, Jinlan/0000-0001-6326-8096",,,,,37,91,93,2,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,SEP-OCT,2009,17.0,5,,,,,88,103,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2009.01168.x,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,496LU,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000269976400006,0

In particular, it intends to investigate and to empirically test three hypotheses concerning the relations between: product quality and prices; variety in technical characteristics and prices; variety in service characteristics and prices. Our empirical investigation finds that prices are positively affected by product quality and positively affected by variety in service characteristics. This means that a high degree of product variety allows firms to charge a premium price on consumers, who are able to find the product that best meets their needs and are therefore willing to pay a higher price. By contrast, variety in technical characteristics negatively impacts prices. In a context where a dominant design has emerged and new varieties are not radically different from each other, the gains in economies of scale and scope outweigh the costs of the increased flexibility in the equipment required to produce variety.","[Guerzoni, Marco] Univ Jena, Sch Econ & Business Adm, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Corrocher, Nicoletta] Bocconi Univ, Dept Econ, KITeS, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Corrocher, Nicoletta] Univ Tromso, NFH, Dept Econ, N-9037 Tromso, Norway",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Bocconi University; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Guerzoni, M (通讯作者)，Univ Jena, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Carl Zeiss Str 3, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",marco.guerzoni@uni-jena.de,"guerzoni, marco/AAB-3416-2021","guerzoni, marco/0000-0001-7415-0771; Corrocher, Nicoletta/0000-0003-2642-8227",,,,,22,8,9,1,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Using a sample of 789 Korean manufacturing subsidiaries established in China over 1989-2003 (3,987 observations), the article finds the important main effects on subsidiary survival to be the liability of size and age, entry mode, and diversification. The findings demonstrate that wholly owned subsidiaries are more likely to survive than international joint ventures. Further, subsidiaries which remain in core product lines show a higher likelihood of survival than those diversifying into different product lines from parent firms. Concerning liabilities, the results suggest that subsidiaries of larger size and younger age are more likely to survive than those of smaller size and older age.","Sunchon Natl Univ, Dept Int Trade, Sunchon, South Korea",Sunchon National University,"Han, BS (通讯作者)，Sunchon Natl Univ, Dept Int Trade, Sunchon, South Korea.",bshan@sunchon.ac.kr,,,,,,,88,1,1,0,18,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

This may be because of the difficulty in describing the attributes of a performance, particularly in terms of its quality, and the heterogeneity of consumer preferences. This article uses conjoint analysis, also called choice experiments, to investigate the impact of the attributes of live theatre performances on demand, using data collected from 483 randomly chosen attenders at live theatre performances at the 2008 South African National Arts Festival. Attributes include the type of cast (professional, semi-professional or amateur), reputation of the producer/director, the context or setting, production type and ticket price of the show. Results largely support the a priori expectations based on the results of other demand studies. For example, it is found that the age of consumers affects the type of show chosen, that utility and willingness to pay increase for shows with professional and semi-professional casts and that 93% of the potential audience prefer shows with a South African context. It is concluded that the method could prove useful to both event organisers and policy makers, especially where the goal is to broaden access to the arts.","[Willis, K.

Reducing the investment of both parties at the same time would then lead to a Pareto improvement. Given that concealment and detection costs are hardly measurable in reality, we show in a controlled laboratory experiment that the welfare losses from a concealment-detection contest depend positively on the prevailing tax rate, but not on the penalty which is imposed in case of detected tax evasion. Hence, policy makers who are concerned about socially inefficient concealment and enforcement costs should focus on tax rates rather than penalty rates. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In a frictionless world, it is desirable to have large movements in prices and exchange rates. But once a small degree of price rigidity is introduced not only should prices be stabilized but also the response of the exchange rate should be muted. There is a minor role for valuation effects that depends both on the size and composition of assets and liabilities. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This possibility depends on two economically meaningful requirements: agents are differentially informed and observe only the number of agents having chosen each option, such as consumers observing only market shares. We show that minority wisdom arises when information is sufficiently heterogeneous and the well-informed are not overly abundant, yet the conditions necessary are not overly restrictive. In fact, it is possible for the minority to be wise even when the minority consists of alone dissenter and a majority of citizens are well informed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

At the country level, increasing the bias of domestic investors toward home equity lowers the market valuation of home equity. At the firm level, firm value increases as the compositions of local equities held by domestic and foreign investors tend toward the firms' global market capitalization weights, but decreases as their weights deviate from global weights. Overall, the evidence is consistent with the optimal global risk-sharing hypothesis that the greater risk sharing between domestic and foreign investors in international capital markets reduces the cost of capital and hence enhances market valuation.

Results are obtained from a country-wide provincial-level panel data set with information on poverty and indigence head-count ratios, measures on the severity of poverty as captured by the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke P-2 statistic, per capita public expenditures on health and education, as well as other variables that are thought to influence well-being. We use fixed-effects techniques to correct for time-invariant province-specific characteristics that may affect program placement. Our analysis demonstrates that per capita public health and education expenditures significantly reduce the incidence of poverty and indigence in Chile. In particular, for a 10,000 pesos (about $23) increase in provincial per capita health spending, the poverty head-count ratio decreases by 0.48 percent. Per capita education expenditures are particularly important to reducing the severity of poverty. Our results indicate that for a 10,000 pesos increase in education spending, the severity of poverty declines by as much as 1.53 percent. Furthermore, we provide evidence that public spending in Chile is non-random.

Three strands of literature have addressed this issue: the literature on equilibrium refinements, the literature on knowledge-based epistemology and the literature on interactive epistemology. This paper surveys seminal frameworks within the first two strands of research and assesses the extent to which they provide a satisfactory solution to the problem. These approaches are illustrated using a three-legged version of Rosenthal's centipede game, which is the classical example in the literature. The paper argues that some of these frameworks provide sensible answers to the riddle of BI or, at least, succeed in bringing the paradox to another level.

Based on a theoretical model that emphasizes the impact of duration, i.e. of the number of years households spent part-time farming or full-time farming, respectively, we investigate the shifts between these two states. We also identify socioeconomic factors that determine these shifts. The empirical study is based on discrete time hazard approaches, using micro-level panel data from Zhejiang, Hubei, and Yunnan provinces from 1995 to 2002. Estimation results suggest relatively high chances of shifts from full-time to part-time farming and a considerable lower risk for the shift in the opposite direction. Significant negative duration dependence is found for the move from full-time to part-time farming suggesting lock-in effects. In addition, we find that labor market participation decisions are significantly related to several household, farm and village characteristics. In particular, the likelihood of shifts from full-time farming to part-time farming is positively related to the educational level of households' workforce. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We find that the public sector has undergone substantial labor retrenchment. The removal of employment guarantees for state workers has led to substantial employment shifts both within and between sectors. As compared to many Central and East European countries and the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States in their early phases of transition, China has experienced a more synchronized pace of job destruction and creation as well as higher rates of excessive reallocation. Our results also show that the employment adjustment and downsizing process has been driven largely by market forces.

The new models of trade that emerged from that work didn't supplant traditional trade theory so much as supplement it, creating an integrated view that made sense of aspects of world trade that had previously posed major puzzles. The new trade theory-an unfortunate phrase, now quite often referred to as the old new trade theory-also helped build a bridge between the analysis of trade between countries and the location of production within countries. In this paper I will try to retrace the steps and, perhaps even more important, the state of mind that made this intellectual transformation possible.

The results show that poverty incidences vary greatly among villages and inequality is relatively high within villages in these impoverished areas. Although agriculture is still the major source of livelihood in this inland western region, income from local nonfarm jobs and remittance is more unevenly distributed and accounts for the largest share of overall income inequality. Surprisingly, blood donation is another major source of cash income. On the expenditure side, health care was found to be one of the most important sources of inequality. The paper also found that the distribution of assets, particularly land holdings, contributes to overall income inequality. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

This paper aims to empirically assess the impacts of Korea's FDI on Korea's exports and employment by using time-series and panel analyses. Particularly, the paper compares the impact of Korea's FDI into developed countries with the impact of Korea's FDI into developing countries. The manufacturing sector is categorized into 11 sub-industries to account for the possible industry-specific effects. According to the time series analysis, the FDI in China caused exports in several capital-intensive industries. According to the panel analysis, FDI induced more exports, and this effect is particularly strong among Korea's FDIs in developing economies. In particular, Korea's FDI in China has induced more exports, but Korean domestic employment has suffered.

Thus policy instruments which foster participation in International Environmental Agreements (IEA) are in demand. Among the instruments under discussion are trade sanctions. Multi-region optimal growth models are a state of the art tool for integrated assessment, but introducing trade sanctions distorts the competitive equilibrium, making it difficult to compute numerically. We introduce trade and trade sanctions into a model of coalition stability to assess the potential of trade sanctions to support an IEA. Trade is modeled by having all countries produce a generic output good, but adopting national product differentiation (Armington assumption). Coalitions are free to impose tariffs on imports from non-cooperating countries. We solve the model numerically using a refined version of Negishi's [Negishi,T., 1960. Welfare economics and existence of an equilibrium fora competitive economy. Metroeconomica 12, 92-97] basic algorithm. We then apply the model to analyze the influence of tariffs on international cooperation. The model suggests that there is indeed a significant potential to raise participation through trade sanctions, even when goods from different countries are nearly perfect substitutes. Furthermore we investigate the effect of trade sanctions on global welfare, environmental effectiveness, and the credibility of the tariff mechanism. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Corruption affects income redistribution, government expenditures on infrastructure, firms' incentive to invest, and workers' incentive to supply labor. An increase in corruption in infrastructure development decreases capital accumulation and output if the decrease in the savings of ordinary workers is sufficiently large. An increase in corruption in the capital market decreases capital accumulation and output. An increase in corruption in labor market decreases capital accumulation and output when labor supply is completely inelastic. Simulation results based on plausible parameter values indicate that an increase in corruption in the labor market will also reduce labor supply, capital accumulation and output.","[Lin, Shuanglin] Univ Nebraska, Dept Econ, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Lin, Shuanglin] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wei] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB3 9DA, England",University of Nebraska System; Peking University; University of Cambridge,"Lin, SL (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Dept Econ, CBA 512, Omaha, NE 68182 USA.",slin@mail.unomaha.edu; wz210@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,54,6,7,2,15,SPRINGER WIEN,Vienna,"Prinz-Eugen-Strasse 8-10, A-1040 Vienna, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for approachability, and again establish that checking these conditions is NP-hard, even when D is a singleton. On the other hand, if the dimension of the reward vector is fixed, an approximate version of these conditions can be checked in polynomial time. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Policymakers' equilibrium decisions depend on both their reputation and the proximity of the next election. Typically, incentives to influence election results are stronger closer to the election (for a given reputation level), as argued in the political cycles literature, and these political cycles are less important when the policymaker's reputation is better.

In particular. we examine whether players from the former Soviet Union acted as a cartel in international all-play-all tournaments - intentionally drawing against one another in order to focus effort on non-Soviet opponents - to maximize the chance of some Soviet winning. Using data from international qualifying tournaments as well as USSR national tournaments, we consider several tests for collusion. Our results are inconsistent with Soviet competition but consistent with Soviet draw-collusion that yielded substantial benefits to the cartel. Simulations of the period's five premier international competitions (the FIDE Candidates tournaments) suggest that the observed Soviet sweep was a 60%-probability event under collusion but only a 25%-probability event had the Soviet players not colluded.

Time dependent bounded rationality, for player i, is reflected in part in the number psi(i)(t) of distinct strategies available to him in the first t-stages. We examine how the growth rate of psi(i)(t) affects equilibrium outcomes of repeated games. An upper bound on the individually rational payoff is derived for a class of two-player repeated games, and the derived bound is shown to be tight. As a special case we study the repeated games with nonstationary bounded recall and show that, a player can guarantee the minimax payoff of the stage game, even against a player with full recall, by remembering a vanishing fraction of the past.

This is an issue in the developing world, where policymakers often argue that increasing the level of health care, for example, will decrease gender inequality. However, increases in access to services often haven empirically ambigous effects in inequality, increasing it in some cases and decreasing it in others. This paper argues that this is not surprising, and simple economic theory suggests that we should expect a non-monotonic relationship between access and inequality. At low levels of access to investments. there is no investment for either the advantaged or disadvantaged group, producing equality. Increases in access increase investment for the advantage group first, generating inequality. Further increases in access increase investment in the disadvantaged group, decreasing inequality. I test the predictions of this theory using data on the availability of health camps (or distance to health centers) and gender differences in vaccinations in India. I find strong support for a non-monotonic relationship between access and gender equality. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

If players realize that their own actions modify their opponents' beliefs and actions, they might play certain actions to. this specific end and forego immediate payoffs if the expected payoff gain from a teaching strategy is high enough. Our results support the existence of a teaching strategy in several ways. After exhibiting some regularities consistent with teaching, we examine more precisely the existence of such a strategy. First we show that players update their beliefs in order to take account of the reaction of their opponents to their own action. Second, we examine whether players actually use a teaching strategy by playing an action that induces a poor immediate payoff but is likely to modify the opponent's behavior so that a preferable outcome might emerge in the future. We find strong evidence of such a strategy in the data and confirm this finding within a logistic model that suggests that the future expected payoff that could arise from a teaching strategy has indeed a significant impact on choice probabilities. Finally, we investigate the effective impact of a teaching strategy on achieved outcomes and find that more tenacious teachers can successfully use such a strategy in order to reach their favorite outcome at the expense of their opponents.

It seeks to capture the stylized facts behind growth in countries as different as the Republic of Korea, Taiwan Province of China, Mauritius, Finland, China and Chile, all of which have relied on export diversification. The widening of comparative advantage is thus seen as the main driver of economic growth. The export diversification hypothesis is tested using an empirical growth model. Controlling for other variables that affect growth, export diversification -both alone and in interaction with growth in per capita export volumes - is found to be highly significant in explaining per capita GDP growth over the 1980-2003 period.","Univ Chile, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile,"Agosin, MR (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile.",managosin@econ.uchile.cl,"Agosin, Manuel/AAD-9648-2019; Agosin, Manuel R./ABH-1852-2020","Agosin, Manuel R./0000-0002-4196-918X",,,,,17,27,31,0,24,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, CHILE",0251-2920,,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,APR,2009,,97,,,,,115,131,,,,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,485UI,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000269149900007,0

If there is no universal commitment, all deposits are refunded and the standard game is played. For suitable deposits, prior commitment and full ex post contributions are supported as a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium for the resulting game.

J,"Lawless, M",,,,"Lawless, Martina",,,Firm export dynamics and the geography of trade,JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Firm exports; Market coverage; Market entry and exit,COLOMBIA; GROWTH,"Two recent trends in international economics have been an increased focus on the geography of trade (e.g. what factors determine where a country exports) and the emergence of new theoretical and empirical work examining exporting activity at the firm-level. However, data limitations have prevented much progress in combining these two areas, because very few countries provide firm-level data breaking down firm exports by their destination. This paper uses a unique survey of Irish exporting firms with information on over fifty destinations for a five-year period to fill some of the gaps in this empirical literature. In particular we investigate how well the predications of a model of exporting with firm heterogeneity fits with the patterns of this detailed data source. Amongst our findings are that firm productivity differences are a factor in explaining the number of export markets a firm has but the prediction of a hierarchy of markets could only be weakly upheld by the data. Firm involvement in individual export markets is found to be much more dynamic than export status. Entry and exit to markets is shown to be a quantifiably important component of overall export flows, with this factor becoming more important for less popular markets. The paper also shows how the patterns of entry and exit into export markets combine to determine the overall firm-level distribution of number of markets entered. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It is then worth asking the following questions: what is, exactly, Behavioral Economics? What are the reasons behind its recent Success? This survey aims at providing a first answer, both directly and indirectly, 10 Such question,,,, by illustrating the main contributions developed within such ambitious research program. Behavioral Economics aims at increasing the explanatory and predictive power of economic analysis through an increase in the degree of realism Of the assumptions at the basis of economic models, i.e. by means of a greater and greater integration between economics and psychology (but also between economics and Social sciences Such as, for example, cultural anthropology). While standard economics assumes that agents are driven by well-defined and stable preferences and act rationally, psychology reveals that it is often the case that Such assumptions cannot he taken as an adequate and satisfactory description of human behavior. In this light, Behavioral Economics focuses on markets where some (if not at all) economic agents involved make choices which appear to substantially deviate from traditional economic predictions. In this survey WC focus On the following two fields of studies within Behavioral Economics: a first field deals with the main cognitive limitations affecting economic behavior (Sections 2 and 3), whereas a second one is related to the role of the so called << social preferences >> (Section 4). Both areas aim at incorporating the major results obtained both experimentally and empirically into formal economic analysis. Within the first area, it is assumed, analogously to neoclassical models, that agents act according to the self-interest hypothesis, but also that << rational >> behavior is affected by several cognitive limitations (in line with classical contributions on bounded rationality; see, in particular, Simon 1978 1979; 1992). By contrast, the second area departs from the neoclassical approach by introducing modifications at motivational level. Unlike traditional analyses, social preferences studies focus, at both theoretical and experimental level, on interaction scenarios where players act not on classic selfish preferences but on different types of social preferences. In other words, it is still assumed that individual behavior is rational, but so that various forms of non-selfish rationality get into the picture. In particular, behavioral choices by individual agents (as well as their objective functions) Call be (either positively or negatively) affected by other players' preferences, intentions, material Outcomes and/or behaviors.","[Luppi, Barbara] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Fac Econ, Dipartimento Econ Polit, I-41100 Modena, Italy; [Zarri, Luca] Univ Bologna, Fac Ingn, I-40110 Bologna, Italy",Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia; University of Bologna,"Luppi, B (通讯作者)，Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Fac Econ, Dipartimento Econ Polit, Viale J Berengario 51, I-41100 Modena, Italy.",barbara.luppi@unimore.it; uca.zarri@mail.ing.unibo.it,"Luppi, Barbara/J-3175-2016",,,,,,76,1,1,1,26,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

State-level panel data for the past 30 yr show that any nationwide impact of the MLDA is driven by states that increased their MLDA prior to any inducement from the federal government.

In this work we insist on the significance of differentiating the maquiladora component from external trade flows, since the maquila trade corresponds to an interchange of goods in different stages of production, while the FIT has been analyzed and measured as the trade of goods that belong to the same stage of production. In addition, we estimate the marginal IIT indices to verify whether NAFTA has supported two-way trade. In that analysis, we offer an adjusted estimation of these indices, also taking into account the differentiation regarding their horizontal and vertical nature. Our results show that Mexican bilateral trade has been mainly of a vertical nature and has been concentrated in a small number of industrial sectors.

We show that this can be achieved by appropriately designing the contingency of taxation on ex post public information regarding the realized fundamentals and aggregate activity. When information is common ( as in the Ramsey literature) or when agents have private information only about idiosyncratic shocks ( as in the Mirrlees literature), the contingency on fundamentals alone suffices for efficiency. When instead agents have private information about aggregate shocks, the contingency on aggregate activity is crucial. An appropriate combination of the two contingencies permits the government to: (i) dampen the impact of noise and hence reduce non-fundamental volatility, without also dampening the impact of fundamentals; (ii) induce agents to internalize informational externalities, and hence improve the speed of social learning; (iii) restore a certain form of constrained efficiency in the decentralized use of information; and (iv) guarantee that welfare increases with the provision of any additional information.

In the first stage we employ super SBM (super slacks-based measure) to estimate the scores relating bank efficiency including internal risk. In the second stage a stochastic frontier regression model is then employed to estimate the external environment risk effects. In the third stage we employ the DEA method again to estimate the scores relating bank efficiency including the internal risk and excluding the external risk. Our empirical results from the three-stage approach are summarized as follows: (1) the mean efficiency score of public-owned banks is higher than that in mixed banks and private-owned banks under the first and third stages. (2) The super-efficiency of domestic banks adjusted by three stages of risk is less than that of internal risk adjusted in one stage. (3) External environmental variables do influence the efficiency of the domestic banks. (4) The influence of external environmental adjustment toward the efficiency of the privately-owned banks is largest when comparing mixed and publicly-owned banks. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Korea has recorded sustainable economic and export growth, and its export prices have been deteriorating over the last decades. Unlike the standard assumption of one good per country, the new theoretical approach by Krugman [Krugman, P. (1980) 'Scale Economics, Product Differentiation, and Pattern of Trade'. American Economic Review 70, 950-959, Krugman, R (1989) 'Differences in income elasticities and trends in real exchange rates'.

And many studies suggest that traditional estimates without variety effect have been rather under-stated. Therefore this paper develops a proper modeling for quantifying the impact of export variety on an exact export price index. Throughout the period (1984-2000), the conventional export price index without variety effect leads to Under-state Korea's export price by 89.3%. This paper shows that the fall in Korean export prices has been offset by the effect of export variety. This paper emphasizes the effect of export variety on international trade.

J,"Prince, JT",,,,"Prince, Jeffrey T.",,,How do households choose quality and time to replacement for a rapidly improving durable good?,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Durable good; Personal computer; Vertical differentiation; Replacement cycle length; Quality choice,MODEL; MARKET; CYCLE,"Many durable goods, particularly in the high technology sector of the economy, experience rapid quality improvement. As a result, replacement is typically due to obsolescence rather than breakdown, and replacement cycles are relatively short. When these goods are vertically differentiated, consumers must make two important, inter-related choices upon making a purchase: what quality level to buy, and how long to wait between purchases. in this paper, we analyze how these two decisions relate to underlying preferences and to each other both theoretically and empirically. We demonstrate how a single, tenuous assumption in a commonly used theoretical model can drive the relationships we would predict when we take this model to the data. This highlights the necessity of a more direct empirical analysis. In our empirics, we show that quality choice and replacement cycle length (RCL) are generally positively correlated. We also find evidence of non-monotonic relationships between quality choice and marginal utility of quality and RCL choice and marginal utility of money. That is, households who value quality more don't always buy higher-quality PCs, and households who value money less don't always buy more frequently, ceteris paribus. Our results provide new insights into the nature of durable goods demand, the proper characterization of markets and market segments, and welfare measures. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Conventional statistical methods fail to explain a strong risk-loving bias in the first Katrina-evacuees sample. We utilize Bayesian Networks to investigate all relevant conditional distributions for gamble choices, demographic variables, and responses to psychometric questionnaires. We uncover surprising results: Contrary to prior experimental evidence, we find that women in our sample were significantly more risk loving in the first Katrina sample and only mildly more risk averse in the other two samples. We find that gamble choices are best predicted by positive-emotion variables.

Three main conclusions arise from our cross section and panel analysis for a sample of 20 OECD countries: first, discretionary fiscal policy has a significant and sizeable effect on volatility of GDP (per capita) and all of its components. Second, there is no direct effect on inflation volatility; since output volatility is an important determinant of inflation volatility, discretionary fiscal policy indirectly exacerbates inflation volatility. These results turn out robust with respect to alternative fiscal policy measures and endogeneity concerns.

Depending on the relative strength of the two effects, depreciation could be expansionary or contractionary. We employ the bounds testing approach to cointegration and error-correction modelling to evaluate the effects of exchange rate depreciation on output growth, both in the short and in the long-run, across a sample of MENA countries. Exchange rate fluctuations are found to be important to fluctuations in real output growth in the short-run. Anticipated exchange rate depreciation may induce long-run expansionary or contractionary effects on output supply. Consistent with theory's predictions, the expansionary effect of unanticipated depreciation is only transitory on output growth. Nonetheless, unanticipated depreciation is found to have a contractionary effect on output growth in the long-run via an increase in the cost of imported inputs.","[Bahmani-Oskooee, Mohsen] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Res Int Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Bahmani-Oskooee, Mohsen] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Kandil, Magda] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; International Monetary Fund,"Bahmani-Oskooee, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Res Int Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",bahmani@uwm.edu,,,,,,,62,22,23,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This targeting does not occur in nonelection years or in private bank lending.

Objectives should probably be distinctive because the risk of conflict is typically much higher. I argue that appropriate responses are job creation for young men, and deep cuts in military spending. Political opportunities are likely to be distinctive because reform may be easier than at other times. Economic opportunities are likely to be distinctive because conflict distorts the structure of the economy.

We calculate by how much the welfare gains of increased output due to incentives outweigh workers' disutility from increased effort. We accomplish this by studying the use of incentives by a firm in the check-clearing industry. Using this firm's production records, we model and estimate the worker's dynamic effort decision problem. We find that the firm's incentive scheme has a large effect on productivity, raising it by 12% over the sample period for the average worker. Using our parameter estimates, we show that the cost of increased effort due to incentives is equal to the dollar value of a 5% rise in productivity. Welfare is measured as the output produced minus the cost of effort; hence, the net increase in the average worker's welfare due to the introduction of the firm's bonus plan is 7%. Under a first-best scheme, we find that the net increase in welfare is 9%.","[Monnet, Cyril] Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Philadelphia,,,,"Monnet, Cyril/0000-0001-6376-4129",,,,,27,21,25,0,21,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Modelling results suggest that farm scale is a significant determinant of profit per hectare but that the age of the operator is not. The economic gains from releasing land through a scheme were conditional on transfers bringing about significant farm expansion and changes in land use. When these conditions were satisfied pensions payments of only about one-third the statutory maximum could be justified. Survey responses indicated that participation in the scheme would bring forward farmers' retirement age by an average of 4 years. Moreover, 'deadweight' payments would equate to about 23% of potential total expenditure. Overall, the economic case for the introduction of an Early Retirement Scheme to Northern Ireland is judged to be weak.","[Davis, J.] Agri Food & Biosci Inst, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Davis, J.] Queens Univ Belfast, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Caskie, P.] Dept Agr & Rural Dev, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Wallace, M.] Univ Coll Dublin, Dept Agribusiness Extens & Rural Dev, Dublin, Ireland",Agri-Food & Biosciences Institute; Queens University Belfast; University College Dublin,"Davis, J (通讯作者)，Agri Food & Biosci Inst, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",john.davis@qub.ac.uk,"Bertheau, Yves/A-5773-2010; Bertheau, Yves/K-9701-2015","Bertheau, Yves/0000-0002-9641-7104",,,,,15,25,29,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Our findings suggest that milestone payments and annual payments are common because moral hazard, risk sharing, and adverse selection all play a role when embryonic inventions are licensed, Milestones address inventor moral hazard without the inefficiency inherent in royalties. The potential for a licensee to shelve inventions is an adverse selection problem which can be addressed by annual fees if shelving is unintentional, but may require an upfront fee if the firm licenses an invention with the intention to shelve it. Whether the licensing contract prevents shelving depends in part on the university credibly threatening to take the license back from a shelving firm. This supports the rationale for Bayh-Dole march-in rights but also shows the need for the exercise of these rights can be obviated by contracts. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

(1989), this paper analyzes the gift exchange between agents with privately observed nonpaternalistic altruism. I find that gift giving between agents under private information of altruism can be analyzed as a conventional signaling game. After applying standard refinements of signaling games, I show that, over nondegenerate ranges of parameter values, private information introduces systematic biases in agents' behavior. First, agents tend to give larger gifts than under full information. Second, despite that fact that agents have no intrinsic concern for reciprocity or fairness, the more altruistic the recipient is, the more the donor exaggerates the gift size. The second finding gives rise to a new theory of reciprocity according to which private information of unconditional altruism can lead to reciprocal behavior.","Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Fong, YF (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",y-fong@kellogg.northwestern.edu,,,,,,,36,1,1,0,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

However, most studies from the field of economics only distinguish between exporting and nonexporting companies, using the firms' export status as a binary treatment variable and comparing the performance of exporting and nonexporting firms. This article introduces the newly developed generalized propensity score (GPS) methodology to the literature of individual firms' export behaviour. Instead of a binary treatment variable, the GPS method allows for continuous treatment, that is, different levels of the firms' export activities. Based on the GPS methodology, a dose-response function is estimated, depicting the relationship between the firms' export-sales ratio and their subsequent sales growth rate as a measure of firm performance.","Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Dept Ind Econ & Int Management, D-68034 Mannheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Fryges, H (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Dept Ind Econ & Int Management, POB 103443, D-68034 Mannheim, Germany.",fryges@zew.de,,,,,,,23,15,18,2,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Should the monopolist be allowed to vertically integrate into the downstream market? Policy makers often argue that the vertically integrated subsidiary enjoys an undue advantage, because it receives access at marginal cost. We show that there is no undue advantage. With perfect competition downstream vertical integration is irrelevant because the subsidiary substitutes downstream output one-to-one and faces a per-unit opportunity cost equal to the access charge. With an oligopoly consumers and the bottleneck monopoly gain with vertical integration. By contrast, competitors lose oligopolistic rents. Social welfare increases, unless output is redistributed towards a very inefficient vertically integrated firm.","[Galetovic, Alexander; Sanhueza, Ricardo] Univ Los Andes, Bogota, Colombia",Universidad de los Andes (Colombia),"Galetovic, A (通讯作者)，Univ Los Andes, Bogota, Colombia.",alexander@galetovic.cl; rsanhueza@uandes.cl,,,,,,,24,3,3,0,5,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Our framework is rich enough to highlight three broad reasons for productivity differences: inappropriate technologies, policy-induced barriers to technology adoption, and within-country misallocations across sectors due to policy distortions. We also discuss the effects of two aspects of globalization, trade in goods and migration, oil the wealth of nations through their impact on the direction of technical progress.

Nevertheless, conditional on entry into international markets, only greater absorptive capacity (associated with scientific knowledge) seems to further boost export performance in such markets, whereas spending on RD no longer has an impact on exporting behaviour once we have taken into account its endogenous nature.","[Harris, Richard] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Li, Qian Cher] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Econ, Glasgow G4 0GE, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow; University of Strathclyde,"Harris, R (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",Cher.Li@strath.ac.uk,,"Li, Qian Cher/0000-0002-6524-161X; Harris, Richard/0000-0001-8066-3629",ESRC [ES/G005966/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G005966/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,68,131,141,0,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

One issue that has not received sufficient attention in the eBay auction literature is the effect of reserve-prices (or minimum prices) on the probability of a sale. Studies that have included this variable in their empirical specifications include Lucking-Reiley et al. (2000), Eaton (2002) and Jin and Kato (2002). However, all these studies used the book-price itself to determine its effect on auction outcomes. This study used alternative specifications of the reserve-price to determine if there were different effects of this variable on the probability of sale of baseball cards. These alternative specifications combined the reserve-price with the published book-prices for the baseball cards being sold. None of the three specifications of the reserve-price affected the probability of a sale including a binary variable representing reserve to book-price ratios 2.00. The rationale offered for these results is that there is a geographic mismatch when baseball cards are distributed and eBay extends the reach of the card market, which allows collectors to buy desirable cards at a premium.","[Highfill, Jannett; O'Brien, Kevin] Bradley Univ, Dept Econ, Peoria, IL 61625 USA",Bradley University,"O'Brien, K (通讯作者)，Bradley Univ, Dept Econ, Peoria, IL 61625 USA.",kmo@bradley.edu,,,,,,,6,8,8,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

This article examines the extent to which traditional markers of social and economic power are associated with political giving. A Tobit analysis of 56 663 households participating in the Consumer Expenditure Survey from 1995 to 2005 indicates that political giving is positively associated with income, wealth, education and White racial status and is negatively associated with single female (but not single male) status. A double-hurdle analysis indicates that nonWhite or single female status affects expected giving most clearly through diminished participation in political giving, rather than simply through lower amounts given by such contributors. Descriptive statistics and a multinomial logistic regression suggest that the importance of traditional markers of social and economic status is greater for political giving than for charitable giving or religious giving.","Univ Georgia, Dept Consumer Econ & Housing, Athens, GA 30622 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"James, RN (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Dept Consumer Econ & Housing, 203 Consumer Res Ctr, Athens, GA 30622 USA.",rjames@uga.edu,,"James, Russell/0000-0002-1887-8183",,,,,11,5,5,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Also, even if in Romanian regions the demand for services is inelastic regarding the total income of the households and the dynamics of productivity in services was lower than the average of the national economy, the positive growth rate of employment in services exceeded the productivity gap between the national economy and the services sector.","[Jula, Dorin] Univ Bucharest, Romanian Acad & Ecol, Inst Econ Forecasting, Econ Sci Fac, Bucharest, Romania; [Jula, Nicoleta] Nicolae Titulescu Univ Bucharest, Finance & Accounting Fac, Bucharest, Romania",University of Bucharest; Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Jula, D (通讯作者)，Univ Bucharest, Romanian Acad & Ecol, Inst Econ Forecasting, Econ Sci Fac, Bucharest, Romania.",dorinjula@yahoo.fr; nicoletajula@yahoo.com,"JULA, Dorin/JKI-6633-2023",,,,,,11,1,1,0,6,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Drawing from the development and the specifics of the financial crisis in Russia, the paper focuses on the frame of mind, behaviour, goals and means of Russian policy-makers that are reminiscent of Soviet formal and informal institutions and may have an impact on post-crisis developments and structures. A sui generis corporate state is emerging, the basic features of which range from the complex of the great power and belief in the state as a driver of growth to secrecy, mutual distrust, lack of transparency and accountability, and efforts to increase command on resources. The seeds of a Russian-style corporate state that emerged in the early 2000s with the creation of goskorporatsii are reinforced by economic slow-down and Russia-specific market failures. Competition for power - the President versus the Premier may help strengthen the demand from below for a stronger state and limited property rights. Retrenchment from competition, openness to Foreign Direct Investment and commitment to entry into the WTO expose the country to the risk of prolonged technological backwardness and possible regression to a society where private elite organisations are closely tied to the state and institutions are subservient to the leadership: a framework highly unsuitable for modernisation and growth.","Univ Verona, Dept Econ Sci, Ctr EW Studies & European Integrat, I-37100 Verona, Italy",University of Verona,"Malle, S (通讯作者)，Univ Verona, Dept Econ Sci, Ctr EW Studies & European Integrat, I-37100 Verona, Italy.",silvana.malle@univr.it,,,,,,,37,12,12,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2009,21.0,3,,,,,249,282,,10.1080/14631370903090582,0.0,,,34,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,596GR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277673700001,0

Social mobility models based on social classes arising from an occupational classification scheme are analysed. A test for the statistical validity of classification schemes is proposed and tested using Danish sample survey data that was first collected in 1976 and augmented in 2000. This is referred to as a homogeneity test and is a likelihood ratio test of a set of linear restrictions which define social classes. For Denmark it is shown that this test fails for an Erikson-Goldthorpe classification system, raising doubts about the statistical validity of occupational classification systems in general. We also estimate regression models of occupational earnings, household earnings, and educational attainment using family background variables as covariates controlling for unobservables, measurement error, and simultaneous equation bias. In these models homogeneity tests are also rejected. We conclude from these results that the individual's family background has a small but significant impact on lifetime chances which is not captured by the Erikson-Goldthorpe classification scheme.

Based on a reading of the business revitalization plan submitted by banks requesting government funds, we identify four primary goals for the capital injection plan in Japan: (1) to increase the batik capital ratios; (2) to increase write-offs of non-performing loans (3) to increase lending, in particular to small and medium enterprises, if order to avoid a credit crunch; (4) to encourage restructuring. Using a panel of individual bank data, we empirically estimate the effectiveness of the Japanese government policy Of public fund injection in achieving the first three of these stated goals. Our empirical analysis reveals that, in general, the capital injections into the large internationally active banks were more effective than those into the smaller domestic banks in Japan. In addition, the second round capital injection, administered in 1998, was more effective than the first round, administered in 1997. The first capital injection in 1997 mostly served as it stop-gap measure to help the large international banks clear the 8% capital adequacy ratio (BIS ratio) required under the Basel Accord and did not make much contribution to the other policy objectives. The second round of capital injections in 1998 were more effective, boosting capital adequacy ratios for the domestic as well as international banks and supporting other policy objectives as well by stimulating banks to write off bad loans and increase domestic lending, in particular to small and medium enterprises.

Science offered, so far, instruments to explore the world but the actual dynamic conditions employ original multidisciplinary approaches based on mathematical methods and algorithms. The most complex models take into consideration the sustainable development level connected to the lower levels consisting of economic and engineering fields. There are also other approaches which connect economics to engineering and other domains that are apparently completely different. The development of a common platform employed to create models in different fields of science is a long run concern of the authors. Mathematics and computer science are the basic layers of the study which was developed according to the requirements of several doctoral studies in different fields of science. The solution was to create a matrix-based library which includes numerical methods modules, graphical facilities and interfaces which allows a model designer to create a new application in a fast and facile way. This original solution was used along the time with significant results, in different fields of science, as well as in multidisciplinary approaches. Latest models are used to solve complex.problems, such as: crisis management, probabilistic models and automatic design. Last but not least, the libraries already developed are used to offer a new youth to classic technical disciplines because of the computer-based approach which is the main instrument to create the according analytical model.

Theory predicts that the introduction of performance-related pay (PRP) may produce both incentive and sorting effects, making the incumbent workers more productive and attracting the most able workers from outside. Furthermore, productivity gains may be shared with the workers through higher wages and heterogeneous effects may be expected by union density. Matching estimates based on panel data for a representative sample of Italian metalworking firms in the 1990s show positive effects on labour productivity (around 7-11%) and to some extent on wages (around 2-3%), while worker sorting is negligible. Estimates by union density suggest that incentive effects are more present in low unionized firms, while wage effects are more significant in highly unionized ones. Extended sensitivity analysis shows that these results are overall robust with respect to the existence of unobserved confounding factors. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Empirical results strongly suggest that inflation expectations are the key ingredient of the inflationary process for the euro area and they have a significant negative effect on output.

The basic idea of this work is that the unpredictability of a system gives a measure of its complexity, so that in order to predict a future state of a complex system one must find the system structure explained by some simpler components that can be predicted. The complexity of the economic system is reflected in the synthetic macroeconomic indicators (GDP and its components). We find the principal components of the macroeconomic variables as a preprocessing step and model them as linear combinations of some simpler non observable predictable variables; we have constructed empirical models for domestic and public consumption; it was shown that these models are sufficiently accurate to predict for two or three periods ahead.","[Scutaru, Cornelia; Saman, Corina; Stanica, Cristian] Acad Romana, Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Scutaru, C (通讯作者)，Acad Romana, Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania.",corneliascutaru@yahoo.com; csaman@ines.ro; stanicacris@yahoo.com,"Saman, Corina/AAC-7452-2020","Saman, Corina/0000-0002-5855-7771",,,,,9,4,4,0,1,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Participation is viewed as the act of society members' taking part in making decisions, and motivation is understood as the determination of activity or stimulation to act. Thus, motivation being a secondary derivative with respect to motive, its perception needs motives identification. Researchers state that latent participation potential is characteristic to most citizens, however, only some scientists have asked who/what stimulate them to participate. The answer of the representatives of behavioral and social sciences to the question why people take part in collective activities is based on the theory of classical games (decisions): people act for the collectives benefit only when they are personally interested in this or that activity. Although self-interest is an important motivating factor, however, it is not the only one as most researchers consider. There is less argument upon the issue of other motives except self interest. The theme has been selected because motivation including the perception of civic participation (embracing both political and non-political participation) and its conceptual empirical study is not known by the authors, however, some separate areas, e.g. political, voluntary or simply activity aimed at common benefit and motivation issues are often in the focus of discussions. The research and its results are presented in this article. The research is based on the triangularity conception combining a descriptive theoretical analysis and an inlet-active interview as well as a written questioning and an expert interview as an additional method. Quantitative research is based on Simmons and Birchall mutual stimuli theory (MST). This methodology has been used in investigating participation motivation in Lithuania. Simonons and Birchall have been interested in stimuli and approach to participation motivation. MST has combined two sociopsychological motivation theories (individualistic and collectivistic). Rigita Tijunaitiene, a student of Doctoral Studies at Kaunas University of Technology, has carried out a research in this field. Methodology creators have suggested to research collective motives applying the scale of thirty collective approaches, the latter being grouped into groups of common values, mutual feelings and common aims. After the validation procedure there have been twenty five stimuli left in this subscale. Having summed up the results of the research, it could be stated hat motive identification helps to understand stimulating motives that are necessary for motivation recognition and construction of motivation increase models. The research of civic participation in Lithuania has, in some sense, proved the data received in other countries: active participants are the people who have taken part in beneficial activity for 2-5 years. These people are not always leaders, however, they manage several people, give orders, have constant jobs, are university graduates, live in regional centres and earn 1000-3000 Lt. Women dominate in such activity. It should be noted that collective motives are influenced not by all sociodemographic characteristics, the latter influencing various motives in a different way. Five clusters of participants have been indentified. These groups of similar participants could be influenced by various motives.","[Tijunaitiene, Rigita; Balciunas, Sigitas] Siauliu Univ, LT-78366 Shiauliai, Lithuania; [Neverauskas, Bronius] Kauno Tech Univ, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Siauliai University; Kaunas University of Technology,"Tijunaitiene, R (通讯作者)，Siauliu Univ, Archileku G 1, LT-78366 Shiauliai, Lithuania.",,,,,,,,43,9,10,0,14,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Studies have shown that the time trending variables used to explain gasoline demand could be difference stationary and therefore, may require cointegration analysis to assess the relationship among the trending variables. In this work we use the cointegration technique to derive long-run and short-run demand elasticities of noncommercial gasoline consumption using time-series data for the USA from 1949 to 2004. We also attempt to incorporate the presence of a structural break in the data generation process of the time trending variables. Our results show that the consumption of gasoline and lifetime income have a long-term stable relationship after the second oil shock of 1978.

This paper documents that their analysis relies on largely imputed emission data that overstate emission reductions compared to emission data that countries reported to UNEP. The imputation procedure appears to induce a spurious positive correlation between income and CFC reductions. In a replication of the econometric analysis using UNEP data, the hypothesis of a positive and linear relationship between the two variables is rejected. These findings call for a more cautious interpretation of emission targets set by the Montreal Protocol and alert researchers to important limitations of a data set that has been widely used in empirical studies of this treaty.","Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, New York, NY 10025 USA",Columbia University,"Wagner, UJ (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, 2910 Broadway,MC 3277, New York, NY 10025 USA.",ulrich.wagner@columbia.edu,,"Wagner, Ulrich/0000-0002-4046-2803",,,,,26,4,4,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

This paper builds an alternative function on very different (albeit also neoclassical) microfoundations aimed at both addressing those theoretical drawbacks and providing a better empirical fit than the Cobb-Douglas formula. The new model, unlike the Cobb-Douglas function, does not portray installed capacity as aggregate capital but as a sunk cost generating economic rents. An analysis of 1949-2008 annual U. S. growth data suggest this alternative model explains nearly 85 percent of GDP fluctuations and is empirically more robust than the Cobb-Douglas, whilst both contemporary and lagged aggregate capital are statistically rejected as explanatory variables. This lends support to the old Cambridge Critique, according to which using value-weighted capital aggregates to explain production simply makes no sense. At face value, these results not only pose a question on any macroeconomic model assuming a Cobb-Douglas function but also point towards an alternative interpretation of phenomena such as the way monetary policy impacts productivity.","[Gracia, Eduard] Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Gracia, E (通讯作者)，39 Palace Court, London W2 4LS, England.",eduard.gracia@booz.com,,,,,,,30,2,3,1,15,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,DEC 2,2011,5.0,,,,,,,,201119,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2011-19,0.0,,,51,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,865CE,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298287600001,0

We first show that, up to a second-order approximation using perturbation methods, regime switching in the variances has an impact only on the intercept coefficients of the decision rules. We then demonstrate how to derive the exact model likelihood for the second-order approximation of the solution when there are as many shocks as observable variables.

We investigate how, in turn, knowledge sharing affects the long-run dynamics of mutual aid. In our economy, agents with specific knowledge are held up by their principals. Inside communities, agents aid each other by sharing their specific knowledge. This process generates a new type of knowledge which exacerbates the specificity of the existing types and induces more agents to engage in mutual aid. However, since the knowledge generated is shared, it progressively renders agents inside communities more flexible and, thus, less dependent on mutual aid. We characterize conditions under which in the long-run mutual aid spreads or is abandoned. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We find that the growth elasticity of poverty is higher for countries with fairly equal income distributions, and declines in nations with greater income disparities. Moreover, when controlling for differences in estimation technique, we find that the reported values of the GEP in the literature (based on the World Bank's now-defunct 1993-PPP based poverty data) are systematically larger in magnitude than estimates based on the latest 2005-PPP based data.","[Chambers, Dustin] Salisbury Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA; [Dhongde, Shatakshee] Rochester Inst Technol, Rochester, NY USA",University System of Maryland; Salisbury University; Rochester Institute of Technology,"Chambers, D (通讯作者)，Salisbury Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 1101 Camden Ave, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA.",DLChambers@salisbury.edu,"Chambers, Dustin L/A-8328-2009","Chambers, Dustin L/0000-0001-7722-2240",,,,,35,9,10,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

We show that the decision to employ a dual licensing strategy occurs whenever the feedbacks of the open source community are valuable enough compared to the quality of the software that the firm is able to develop in-house. Our analysis points to the central role of an appropriate managing of OS licenses in order to balance the pros and cons of going open source and to make this versioning strategy viable for software vendors; our analysis also suggests a possible explanation for the observed proliferation of open source licenses.

We find that the UK's attempts at exchange rate pegs in the form of shadowing the deutschmark and entering the ERM were ineffective, and in the latter case counterproductive in lowering inflation uncertainty. The 1981 budget, however, greatly lowered uncertainty, and the adoption of a formal inflation target also had a palpable, negative impact on inflation uncertainty. As a suggestive exercise, we examine inflation uncertainty in the US, and find that, over 2005-2008, in the absence of an inflation target, uncertainty rose in the US, while uncertainty remained low in the UK over this period of rising commodity prices and financial turmoil.

Since innovation is the only source of volatility, any variable that influences innovation directly affects volatility and growth. This joint endogeneity is illustrated by working out the effects through which economies with different tax levels differ in their volatility and growth process. We obtain analytical measures of macro volatility based on cyclical output and on output growth rates for plausible parametric restrictions. This analysis implies that controls for taxes should be included in the standard growth-volatility regressions. Our estimates show that the conventional Ramey-Ramey coefficient is affected sizeably. In addition, tax levels do indeed appear to affect volatility in our empirical application.","[Waelde, Klaus] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, CESifo, Mainz Sch Management & Econ, D-55131 Mainz, Germany; [Waelde, Klaus] Catholic Univ Louvain, D-55131 Mainz, Germany; [Posch, Olaf] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Posch, Olaf] CESifo, CREATES, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; Ifo Institut; Aarhus University; CREATES,"Wälde, K (通讯作者)，Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, CESifo, Mainz Sch Management & Econ, Jakob Welder Weg 4, D-55131 Mainz, Germany.",,,"Walde, Klaus/0000-0001-5717-0383",,,,,38,17,17,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

It develops a model with endogenous fertility, endogenous labor supply and endogenous size of government spending. Family policies which concern childcare services are assumed to reduce the time that parents spend on their children. The model shows that gender discrimination may explain differences in household decisions between countries. The solution shows a U-shaped relationship between fertility and gender discrimination if the quality of childcare services is sufficiently high. In the decreasing part of this U-shaped curve, a decrease in the discrimination level implies a related increase in fertility, women's participation in the labor force and in family-friendly policies.","Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, F-75647 Paris 13, France",Paris School of Economics; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Recoules, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, CES 106-112,Blvd Hop, F-75647 Paris 13, France.",magali.recoules@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,34,3,3,3,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

By analyzing the behavior in a wide range of quantiles, this method allows us to quantify the influence of various sizes of shocks that hit the inflation, and is able to capture possible asymmetric adjustment of the inflation towards to its long-run equilibrium. It therefore sheds new lights on the inflation dynamics compared with the conventional unit root methodologies. Our results suggest that generally, the inflation rates are not only mean-reverting but also exhibit asymmetries in their dynamic adjustments, in which large negative shocks tend to induce strong mean reversion, and on the contrary, large positive shocks do not. Policy implications related to the empirical findings are also provided. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Increases in wage inequality started in the US and UK at the end of the 1970s, but are now widespread. A good fraction of this inequality trend is due to technology-related increases in the demand for skilled workers outstripping the growth of their supply. Since the early 1990s, labor markets have become more polarized with jobs in the middle third of the wage distribution shrinking and those in the bottom and top third rising. I argue that this is because computerization complements the most skilled tasks, but substitutes for routine tasks performed by middle wage occupations such as clerks, leaving the demand for the lowest skilled service tasks largely unaffected. Finally, I argue that technology is partly endogenous, for example it has been spurred by trade with China. Thus, trade does matter for changes in the labor market, but through a different mechanism than conventionally thought. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We show experimentally that in the presence of sanctioning, our experimental subjects adjust their behavior in order to avoid being a free rider. They do this not only in the STANDARD sanctions treatment, where they directly experience any sanctions assigned to them, but also in our main treatment, the SECRET sanctions treatment, where no information on sanctions received is available until the end of the experiment. We observe no such free riding avoidance in the treatment without sanctioning. The mere knowledge that sanctions might be assigned increases cooperation among the members of our subject pool; subjects expect that non-strategic sanctioning occurs against the free riders. Moreover, these expectations are correct as we observe a similar pattern and extent of sanctioning in both treatments. We propose that sanctioning in itself is a social norm and may be culturally dependent, as suggested in the literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We propose that the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar measured both by the appreciation of the Euro and of gold prices, played an important role as oil suppliers demanded compensation for the declining value of the dollar.

To what extent can innovation policies complement carbon pricing (taxes or permit trading) and improve the economic efficiency of a mitigation policy package? To answer these questions, we use an integrated assessment model with multiple externalities and an endogenous representation of the technical progress in the energy sector. We evaluate a range of innovation policies, both as stand-alone and in combination with other mitigation policies. Our analysis indicates that innovation policies alone are unlikely to stabilize global concentration and temperature. As for the benefits of combining climate and innovation policies, we find efficiency gains of 10% (6 USD Trillions in net present value terms) for a stringent climate policy, and 30% (3 USD Trillions) for a milder one. However, such gains are reduced when more plausible (sub-optimal) global innovation policy arrangements are considered. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this study we show that the backward-shooting method is inherently unstable, and that this instability cannot be eliminated by changing the numerical methodology of the backward solver. Moreover, this instability becomes more severe as the number of players increases. We then present a novel boundary-value method for computing the equilibrium strategies of asymmetric first-price auctions. We demonstrate the robustness and stability of this method for auctions with any number of players, and for players with mixed types of distributions, including distributions with more than one crossing. Finally, we use the boundary-value method to study large auctions with hundreds of players, to compute the asymptotic rate at which large first-price and second-price auctions become revenue equivalent, and to study auctions in which the distributions cannot be ordered according to first-order stochastic dominance.

Our results show that, when a consumption-based system is adopted, China's emissions are lower than those reported by some international organizations. The rapid growth in China's exports is a key determinant of China's rising total emissions. All countries should strengthen their cooperation in improving their current greenhouse gas inventories.

Usually explained in terms of cost developments and/or foreign-trade considerations, this trend could also be a reflection of demand-side regularities. Estimation of a cross-country demand system indicates that goods are 'necessities' whereas services are 'luxuries'. The relative price of goods responds negatively to the rising supply of goods and positively to the rising supply of services, with the former response being much stronger. If the supplies of both items were to rise at the same speed, the relative price of goods would have to fall.","[Podkaminer, Leon] Wyzsza Szkola Adm, Bielsko Biala, Poland; [Podkaminer, Leon] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Econ Sci, PL-00901 Warsaw, Poland; [Podkaminer, Leon] Vienna Inst Int Econ Studies, A-1060 Vienna, Austria",Polish Academy of Sciences; Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies,"Podkaminer, L (通讯作者)，Vienna Inst Int Econ Studies, A-1060 Vienna, Austria.",podkaminer@wiiw.ac.at,,,,,,,14,2,2,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,NOV,2011,62.0,4,,,,,712,728,,10.1111/j.1467-999X.2011.04136.x,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,836SR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000296132000010,0

The awareness of this issue remains however limited amongst economists, who tend to focus on the motivational effects of financial incentives. Accountability and incentives may provide different motivations for decision makers, and disentangling their effects is thus important for understanding real-world situations in which both are present. Separating accountability and incentives, I find different effects. Accountability is found to reduce preference reversals between frames, for which incentives have no effect. Incentives on the other hand are found to reduce risk seeking for losses, where accountability has no effect. In a choice task between simple and compound events, accountability increases the preference for the normatively superior simple event, while incentives have a weaker effect going in the opposite direction.","Univ Munich, D-80539 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Vieider, FM (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Geschwister Scholl Pl 1, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",fvieider@gmail.com,,,,,,,26,19,20,3,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,,,EXP ECON,Exp.

Apparently, the international integration of the Newly Industrializing and Eastern European economies prompted firms in 'high-wage' countries to exploit factor price differences in order to increase their international competitiveness. However, theory predicts that, beside factor price differences, international fragmentation of production should be driven by a multitude of additional determinants. Against this background, the present paper reveals empirical evidence on parts and components trade as an indicator for international fragmentation of production in the European Union and determines its main explanatory factors. The results of a panel data analysis show that especially industry specific factors as well as communication and transportation infrastructure are likewise important for shifting production to or sourcing components from foreign countries.","Halle Inst Econ Res IWH, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH),"Zeddies, G (通讯作者)，Halle Inst Econ Res IWH, Kleine Maerkerstr 8, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany.",goetz.zeddies@iwh-halle.de,,,,,,,36,15,15,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,NOV,2011,38.0,4,,,,,511,537,,10.1007/s10663-010-9138-z,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,022WA,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000309993700003,0

Using data from randomized natural field experiments at 600,000 treatment and control households across the United States, I estimate that the average program reduces energy consumption by 2.0%. The program provides additional evidence that non-price interventions can substantially and cost effectively change consumer behavior: the effect is equivalent to that of a short-run electricity price increase of 11 to 20%, and the cost effectiveness compares favorably to that of traditional energy conservation programs. Perhaps because the treatment included descriptive social norms, effects are heterogeneous: households in the highest decile of pre-treatment consumption decrease usage by 6.3%, while consumption by the lowest decile decreases by only 0.3%. A regression discontinuity design shows that different categories of injunctive norms played an insignificant role in encouraging relatively low users not to increase usage. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, the impact of immigration on the relative task supply of natives is twice as great in Spain as in the United States. The magnitude of the immigration impact in a country with a large share of immigrants originating from Spanish-speaking countries suggests that host country language proficiency is not the sole factor driving the observed impact.

In particular, we define the LCOE for a cycle with full actinide recycling in fast reactors in which elements of the fuel are reused an indefinite number of times. To our knowledge, ours is the first LCOE formula for this cycle. Others have approached the task of evaluating this cycle using an 'equilibrium cost' concept that is different from a levelized cost. We also show how the LCOE implies a unique price for the recycled elements. This price reflects the ultimate cost of waste disposal postponed through the recycling, as well as other costs in the cycle. We demonstrate the methodology by estimating the LCOE for three classic nuclear fuel cycles: (i) the traditional Once-Through Cycle, (ii) a Twice-Through Cycle, and (iii) a Fast Reactor Recycle. Given our chosen input parameters, we show that the 'equilibrium cost' is typically larger than the levelized cost, and we explain why. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The former is the traditional, unrestricted, multiplier effect; the latter is the result of expenditure reallocation to uphold effective financing constraints. Unrestricted multipliers will therefore be, as a general rule, upward biased and policy designs based upon them should be reassessed in the light of the countervailing substitution effects.

There exists no previous study that estimates empirically the determinants of life expectancy in Turkey on the basis of time series data and cointegration framework.

Better political institutions increase financial development by making financial repression more costly for the elite.

This paper proposes a transformation of the reserve regime that would cause Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) issued by the International Monetary Fund to become the main reserve asset.

Our empirical results demonstrate that there is a strongly non-linear link among electricity consumption, real income, electricity price, and temperature, a result that is new to the literature. As real income rises, electricity consumption rapidly increases first, and after the level of real income exceeds approximately US$2500, its increasing rate turns slow down. An increase in electricity price has a negative or no influence on electricity consumption. Evidence of a U-shaped relationship between electricity consumption and temperature is supported, and the threshold value of temperature is approximately 53 F, which is endogenously determined. Furthermore, the estimated elasticities of time dynamic indicate that electricity demand is income inelastic, price inelastic, and temperature inelastic. As time goes on, the absolute elasticities of electricity demand gradually decrease with respect to real GDP and electricity price, whereas they gradually increase with respect to temperature, suggesting that the impact of temperature on electricity demand is becoming more important in recent years.

Our findings show that small European states can be divided into two groups. The first group is characterized by the causality running from real GDP to oil consumption and is composed of the most developed European countries and a number of transition countries. In the former case, the direction of causality is a consequence of a highly developed post-industrial society with a strong tertiary sector. In the case of transition economies the direction of causality can be related to deindustrialization process and transition depression that resulted in a sharp industrial decline and decreased industrial oil demand. The second group is characterized by the causality running from oil consumption to economic growth, in which case the state should employ additional resources in subsidizing oil prices and securing long term and stable oil sources for its economy. In such countries the reduction of oil consumption because of different reasons (external prices shocks, increased taxes on oil and its derivatives, restrictive ecological laws regarding CO2 emission) could lead to a fall in economic growth.","[Zikovic, Sasa; Vlahinic-Dizdarevic, Nela] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Zikovic, S (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, I Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",szikovic@efri.hr; nela@efri.hr,"Lenz, Nela Vlahinić/P-9560-2018; Žiković, Saša/P-9458-2018","Lenz, Nela Vlahinić/0000-0002-2317-0446;",,,,,45,16,16,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Resources are concentrated on the most able individuals in order to get a cake as big as possible to share among individuals through income taxation. In this paper, we put forward another reason to push for regressive education. It is not linked to heterogeneity in innate ability but to the property that welfare may be a convex function of an individual's wage. For simplicity, we assume a linear education technology and a given education budget. To give the equal wage outcome the best chance to emerge, we also assume that individuals have identical learning abilities. Nevertheless, it turns out that in the first-best wage inequality is always preferable to wage equality. Even more surprisingly, this conclusion remains valid in the second-best when the feasible degree of wage differentiation is sufficiently large. This is in spite of the fact that wage equalization would eliminate any need for distortionary income taxation.","[Cremer, Helmuth] Univ Toulouse, GREMQ, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Cremer, Helmuth] Univ Toulouse, IDEI, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Pestieau, Pierre] Univ Louvain, CORE, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Pestieau, Pierre] Univ Liege, CREPP, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Racionero, Maria] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Universite de Toulouse; Universite de Toulouse; University of Liege; Australian National University,"Cremer, H (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse, GREMQ, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France.",CremerHelmuth@aol.com,"Racionero, Maria/K-3208-2017","Racionero, Maria/0000-0002-4556-7444",,,,,22,8,10,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

We modify this requirement, first, by taking into account the status quo (given by the current wealth) and the possibility of rejecting gambles, and second, by comparing rejections that are substantive (i.e., uniform over wealth levels or over utilities). This yields two new stochastic orders: wealth-uniform dominance and utility-uniform dominance. Unlike stochastic dominance, these two orders are complete: any two gambles can be compared.

Moreover, the formation of a collaboration has significant external effects on the other firms in the same connected component of the network.

Unconditioned differences in the results of standardized tests that point to higher levels of quality in private schools diminish when sociodemographic factors are controlled for, but the question as to what control variables should be used and which methodology is the most appropriate, as well as the extent of the reduction, all continue to be a subject of debate. Here we undertake a meta-analysis of 17 of the main studies that have been done on the subject. The analysis shows how sensitive the results are to the controls and estimation methods that are used. In the aggregate, private subsidized schools score approximately four points higher than municipal schools do.

There is uncertainty and the choice is repeated at least once a year. We study decisions and decision strategies in a laboratory experiment where we create a controlled environment that closely mirrors this setting. We use an electronic information board that allows to carefully monitor the individual's decision strategy. The number of alternatives, switching costs, and the speed at which health deteriorates are varied across treatments. We find that most subjects' search is based more on attributes than on policies. Moreover, we find that an increase in the number of alternatives increases decision-making time; makes subjects consider a lower fraction of the available information; makes it more likely that subjects will switch; and decreases the quality of their decisions. The introduction of positive costs of switching makes people switch less often but improves the quality of their decisions. Finally, if health deteriorates only gradually, individuals tend to stick to their current policy too long. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The collective action space is the Cartesian product A = Pi(p)(p=1) A(p). A profile of actions y epsilon A is a Nash equilibrium (NE) profile if y is played with positive probability in some existing NE. Assuming that we observe NE behavior in the data, we characterize bounds for the probability that a prespecified y in A is a NE profile. Comparing the resulting upper bound with Pr[ Y = y] (where Y is the observed outcome of the game), we also obtain a lower bound for the probability that the underlying equilibrium selection mechanism ME chooses a NE where y is played given that such a NE exists. Our bounds are nonparametric, and they rely on shape restrictions on payoff functions and on the assumption that the researcher has ex ante knowledge about the direction of strategic interaction (e. g., that for q not equal p, higher values of Y-q reduce p's payoffs). Our results allow us to investigate whether certain action profiles in A are scarcely observed as outcomes in the data because they are rarely NE profiles or because M epsilon rarely selects such NE.

Strategic delays in technology development are most likely to occur when earlier dates of success enable imitators to enter an industry, that is, when imitation is swift and relatively cheap and/or patent protection is relatively lengthy.

One comprehensive reform option being considered is the implementation of an EU wide flat area payment (EUWFAP) system and a reduction of the total budget available for direct payments. It is hypothesised that the implementation of this policy proposal would lead to significant changes in the distribution of the EU budget and to the redistribution of agricultural production between the Member States, which could hinder the implementation of the proposal. This paper evaluates the rationality of the EUWFAP, based on the analysis of its budgetary and market impacts. Using the AGMEMOD 2020 combined model, the introduction of the EUWFAP in 2013 is compared with a baseline continuation of the current policy. Results suggest that there would be minor negative impacts on the agricultural production at the EU level, but that more substantial impact for some commodities, most notably beef, and could occur in the individual EU Member States. An important outcome of such a policy reform would be a substantial change in the budget allocation between Member States, which could help mitigate the budgetary tensions between the Member States.

We show that these spillovers substantially affect the equilibrium of the dynamic game. Even for low spillover values, the leader delays her investment until the stochastic fundamental has gone past the level such that the follower's optimal strategy is to invest as soon as he attains the spillover. This bears several interesting implications. First, because the follower invests as he benefits from the spillover, in equilibrium the average time delay between the two investments is short, as it should be expected. Second, in case of a major innovation, an optimal public policy requires an intervention in favor of the investment activity; an increase in uncertainty - delaying the equilibrium - calls for higher subsidization rates. Third, numerical simulations show that the spillover reduces the difference between the leader's and the follower's maximum value functions. Accordingly, our model can help generate realistic market betas. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

What steps can ensure a rapid and efficient transition to an economy that has much lower net carbon emissions? This paper shows that, under limited conditions, a necessary and sufficient condition for an appropriate innovational environment is a universal, credible, and durable price on carbon emissions. Such a price would balance the marginal damages from carbon emissions against the marginal costs of abating emissions: it should not contain a correction factor for inducing technological change. This result, which the paper calls price fundamentalism, applies principally to the market-oriented part of research and innovation. It is subject to qualifications regarding the efficacy of intellectual property protection and the proper level of carbon prices, and it applies primarily to market sectors.

The components of four official measures of monetary constructs - M1, M2, M3 and Li - are used to construct monthly CE monetary aggregates for the period from April 1993 to June 2009. The empirical evidence indicates that the growth rate of CE aggregates has an edge over their sum counterparts in predicting inflation. Moreover, the predictive power of the growth rates of CE aggregates improves as the level of aggregation increases.

Under the new view of dividend taxation (e.g. Poterba and Summers, 1985), proportional dividend taxes do not distort investment decisions, and thus have no impact on asset returns. By contrast, we find that corporate income taxes introduce additional tax-related risk factors into the economy by distorting investment decisions. We uncover a mechanism through which corporate taxes amplify the responses of consumption and investment to technology shocks, and consequently lead to a lower risk-free interest rate and a higher equity premium. This amplification mechanism is the strongest when there exists a strong preference for consumption smoothing and high costs of adjusting the capital stock. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The household's choice of a particular solution from the resulting feasible set is found by the maximization of a household welfare function, a generalization of a suggestion originally made by Samuelson. This nests as special cases the objective functions used in currently popular models of households engaged in one-shot cooperative games. We take a specific example of such a household welfare function, characterize the determinants of the household utility distribution, and then apply the model to examine the effects of a move from joint to individual taxation. We show that on standard stylized facts, secondary earners are always better off absolutely, and define the conditions under which they will also be relatively better off. This confirms the conclusions from models that concern themselves only with the across-household welfare distribution.

Even though the theoretical foundations of the field are well developed, there are only a few empirical papers on developing countries, especially on the comparison of different measures. This paper applies a decomposable multidimensional measure developed by Alkire and Foster (2007) to a cross-sectional dataset on South Africa. This measure allows for decomposition of final outcome into the dimensions used. Furthermore, South Africa provides an interesting case study as the country is renowned for its high income-inequality rate. The contribution of the paper is to draw significant policy implications when a decomposable multidimensional measure is used as opposed to measures that are either multidimensional but not dimensionally decomposable or unidimensional. Specifically, it evaluates the current policy-making mechanism in South Africa at the provincial level and suggests alternative revenue-allocation schemes by using the Alkire-Foster measure.","Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, AD Alcuin Coll 162, York YO10 5NB, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Basarir, H (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, AD Alcuin Coll 162, York YO10 5NB, N Yorkshire, England.",hb518@york.ac.uk,"Basarir, Hasan/K-8532-2019","Basarir, Hasan/0000-0002-3202-4563",,,,,58,5,6,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The assumption of homogeneous, rational expectations is replaced with a heterogeneous expectations model where a fraction of agents hold rational expectations and the remaining fraction adopt parsimonious forecasting models that are, in equilibrium, optimal within a restricted class. Our approach nests the literature on rational expectations in business cycle models with a recent approach based on adaptive learning. We demonstrate that (i.) heterogeneous expectations can lead to substantial improvement in the internal propagation of equilibrium business cycle models and (ii.) the internal propagation depends on the degree of heterogeneity. A calibrated model with heterogeneity provides a closer fit to business cycle data than its representative agent, rational expectations counterpart.","[Branch, William A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [McGough, Bruce] Oregon State Univ, Dept Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; Oregon State University,"Branch, WA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",wbranch@uci.edu; bruce.mcgough@oregonstate.edu,,,,,,,35,20,21,3,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Mayors with reelection incentives misappropriate 27 percent fewer resources than mayors without reelection incentives. These effects are more pronounced among municipalities with less access to information and where the likelihood of judicial punishment is lower.

The goal of this paper is to compare the explanatory power of four business cycle models three mainstream and one Post Keynesian for the U.S. economy since 1971.

The academic success of senior students, however, has received less attention in South Africa. This paper presents the findings of an investigation into the academic performance of second-year economics students at Stellenbosch University. Using a Heckman two-step model, the study analyses whether the factors explaining first-year academic success are applicable in the second year or if other factors are relevant. The results suggest that most matriculation subjects become statistically insignificant for second-year students, whereas lecture and tutorial attendance remain important contributors to academic success.

We find intergenerational income elasticities for Greater Santiago in Chile in the range of 0.52 to 0.54. This is lower than recent nation-wide elasticities for Chile of about 0.6-0.7, but still stands as fairly high in comparison with the comparable international evidence. We also find that intergenerational educational mobility is lower for the younger cohorts, which however does not necessarily imply an increase of intergenerational educational mobility in the last decades, as life-cycle effects may be at work. Finally, we find evidence of a higher degree of intergenerational. persistence of income at the two extremes of the income distribution, which is more accentuated at the top centiles of the distribution. We suggest that this may mirror the unusually high concentration of income at the top of the income distribution in Chile, a hypothesis that requires further research.","[Nunez, Javier] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Miranda, Leslie] Univ Chile, Ctr Microdatos, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile; Universidad de Chile,"Núñez, J (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile.",,,,,,,,28,22,24,2,28,UNIV CHILE DEPT ECONOMICS,SANTIAGO,"DIAGONAL PARAGUAY 257, REGISTRO PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL 112.761, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0718-5286,,,ESTUD ECONOMIA,Estud.

In contrast, theories that emphasize the importance of reciprocity suggest that this relationship may go the other way around. In this paper we test these predictions by means of a laboratory experiment. By and large our findings confirm standard theory. Incentive instruments typically become less attractive when the scope for rent-seeking activities increases. However, reciprocity motivations do seem to mitigate the adverse effects of rent-seeking opportunities to a considerable extent. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The central question is whether or not New Mexico's counties are subject to the resource curse, a phenomenon documented frequently in the literature. Most empirical studies of the resource curse hypothesis have used national or state level data and a broad definition of natural resources. In contrast, this analysis uses county level data with a focus on oil and gas extraction. The estimated models suggest that oil and gas extraction in New Mexico counties has had a small but positive effect on income, employment and population. Similar results were obtained when the model was estimated for 925 counties in 13 energy producing states for the year 2000.","[Peach, James; Starbuck, C.

CGE models are discovered in 1960., but there was no major development until 1978. These models have become a standard tool of empirical economic analysis. These models dominate in major part of applied econometric analysis, which is involved on problem solving in economic development and local economic policies. They are inevitable tools for analysis in international trade and government planning, changes in oil markets, and at the same time they are used in the analysis in tax reforms, welfare distributions, and even in the analysis of global warming. From that it concludes that uses of CGE models are very wide-spread. In the last few years, improvements in a specification of the model, availability of data and development in computer technology results in increased efficiency and reduced cost of analysis, which is based on CGE models. CGE models are most commonly used for analysis in countries that are in transition, but basic framework and specification of a model can be used from global to the local level.",,,,,"Škare, Marinko/L-5504-2019","Škare, Marinko/0000-0001-6426-3692; Stjepanovic, Sasa/0000-0003-1938-3681",,,,,33,3,3,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We argue that informalisation of employment, and in particular job precariousness, have consequences on other dimensions of vulnerability such as high debt servicing and financial stress. The empirical analysis is based on a 2002 sample survey data of men and women workers in urban poor communities of Ecuador. By employing an index of job quality, we investigate and compare the job quality of women and men workers in these households and find gender-based patterns with women working in relatively low quality jobs compared to men.

By means of regression analyses, the paper demonstrates that low quality jobs tend to lead to higher debt servicing.

Although we estimate that the income gains from migration are very large, not everyone migrates and many return. Within this group of highly skilled individuals the emigration decision is found to be most strongly associated with preference variables such as risk aversion and patience, and choice of subjects in secondary school, and not strongly linked to either liquidity constraints or to the gain in income to be had from migrating. Likewise, the decision to return is strongly linked to family and lifestyle reasons, rather than to the income opportunities in different countries. Overall the data suggest a relatively limited role for income maximization in distinguishing migration propensities among the very highly skilled, and a need to pay more attention to other components of the utility maximization decision.

Consistent with standard intuition, a change from independent to strictly affiliated valuations can result in high-value buyers and low-value sellers bidding closer to their actual values while low-value buyers and high-value sellers distort their bids farther from their true values. However, there also exist equilibria for which either type of trader responds to a change in the distribution of values in the opposite direction. Whether a given trader bids more aggressively or less aggressively can also be non-monotonic with respect to the trader's value. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In contrast to conventional time-series UIP, cross-sectional UIP is examined with a single-equation estimation and panel regression model estimation. The exchange rates analyzed here include a broad spectrum of countries: developed, developing, low-inflation, and high-inflation countries. Based on the empirical evidence, there does not appear to be a well-publicized UIP puzzle for cross-sectional UIP, and the slope estimates remain largely between zero and one throughout the sample periods, with a few exceptions. Evidence of UIP is more clear for low inflation countries than for high inflation countries.

This is because backward-looking expectations impart a substantial degree of inertia to the inflation rate whereas forward-looking expectations lead to rapid adjustment in response to shocks. In this paper we examine the policy implications for the Indonesian economy of the form taken by the price adjustment equation. We allow for both backward-looking and forward-looking effects of inflation expectations, proxying forward expectations with the realised rate and using a GMM estimator to allow for the resulting endogeneity. Using monthly data from 1980:1 to 2008:12, our estimates show that CPI inflation in Indonesia is significantly determined by backward-looking inflation expectations, forward-looking inflation expectations, the output gap, exchange rate depreciation, and money growth. However, the backward expectation attracts a significantly higher weight than the forward rate leading to the conclusion that inflation in Indonesia has considerable inertia. The implication of this is that a gradualist monetary policy is likely to be more effective as a means of smoothing fluctuations in inflation and real output. (C) 2010 Society for Policy Modeling.

This paper investigates the intergenerational persistence of health across time and region as well as across the distribution of maternal health. It uses comparable microdata on as many as 2.24 million children born of about 0.6 million mothers in 38 developing countries in the 31 year period, 1970-2000. Mother's health is indicated by her height, BM! and anemia status. Child health is indicated by mortality risk and anthropometric failure. We find a positive relationship between maternal and child health across indicators and highlight non-linearities in these relationships. The results suggest that both contemporary and childhood health of the mother matter and that the benefits to the next generation are likely to be persistent. Averaging across the sample, persistence shows a considerable decline over time. Disaggregation shows that the decline is only significant in Latin America. Persistence has remained largely constant in Asia and has risen in Africa.

It is in the spirit of Sen (1970)'s partial orderings and follows the dominance approach to making inequality comparisons. By focusing on those below a multidimensional inequality frontier, we are able to reconcile the literature on multivariate relative poverty and multivariate inequality. Some existing approaches to multivariate inequality actually reduce the distributional analysis to a univariate problem, either by using a utility function first to aggregate an individual's multiple dimensions of well-being. or by applying a univariate inequality analysis to each dimension independently. One of our innovations is that unlike previous approaches, the distribution of relative well-being in one dimension is allowed to affect how other dimensions influence overall inequality. Our methods are also robust to choices of individual utility or aggregation functions. We apply our approach to data from India and Mexico to show inter alia how dependence between dimensions of well-being can influence relative poverty and inequality comparisons between two populations.

Either player has to decide in continuous time whether to use a safe arm with a known pay-off or a risky arm whose expected pay-off per unit of time is initially unknown. This pay-off can be high or low and is negatively correlated across players. We characterize the set of all Markov perfect equilibria in the benchmark case where the risky arms are known to be of opposite type and construct equilibria in cut-off strategies for arbitrary negative correlation. All strategies and pay-offs are in closed form. In marked contrast to the case where both risky arms are of the same type, there always exists an equilibrium in cut-off strategies, and there always exists an equilibrium exhibiting efficient long-run patterns of learning. These results extend to a three-player game with common knowledge that exactly one risky arm is of the high pay-off type.","[Klein, Nicolas] Univ Bonn, D-5300 Bonn, Germany; [Rady, Sven] Univ Munich, D-80539 Munich, Germany",University of Bonn; University of Munich,"Klein, N (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, D-5300 Bonn, Germany.",,,,,,,,20,40,56,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Within this framework we use an indirect evolutionary approach to study the endogenous formation of preferences and the co-evolution of norm compliance. The multiplicity of equilibria, which emerges in the presence of social norms, is linked to the evolutionary analysis: individuals face situations where many others cooperate as well as situations where a majority free-rides. The evolutionary adaptation to such heterogenous environments favors conditional cooperators, who condition their pro-social behavior on the others' cooperation. As conditional cooperators react flexibly to their social environment, they dominate free-riders as well as unconditional cooperators.","[Traxler, Christian] Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Spichtig, Mathias] Univ Amsterdam, IBED, NL-1090 GE Amsterdam, Netherlands",Max Planck Society; University of Amsterdam,"Traxler, C (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Kurt Schumacher Str 10, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",traxler@coll.mpg.de; spichtig@science.uva.nl,,,,,,,29,15,16,0,25,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,,,J ECON,J.

Using our in house agent based simulation model IFSIM we show that sharing equally the parental leave can increase or reduce poverty among elderly women depending on the macro and behavioural (i.e. labour supply) responses that the reform off-sets. In general, the reform can be good for highly educated women, who will have an incentive to work more full time thanks to their higher earnings, which can compensate any loss in household income due to the man's staying home. For lower educated however, work might not pay as much and a reduction in labour supply might actually ensue (e.g. to reduce childcare costs). This will reduce also their pension rights at retirement. Furthermore, keeping men at home might slow down economic growth, and consequently growth of income pension accounts will be lower. This effect, combined with lower pension contributions (due to reduced labour supply), might result in higher poverty rates for women with lower education, compared to a scenario where the woman takes the whole leave. Other policies, such as more subsidised child care, might be an alternative worth considering to reduce female poverty in old age more evenly across educational levels.

It is shown that the existence and uniqueness of the well-known forward solution are preserved in a general context. We also propose a key property embedded in the forward solution - the no-bubble condition - as an economically sensible solution refinement in the class of fundamental solutions. In the literature, the no-bubble condition has been assumed to rule out non-fundamental bubble solutions. We show that the forward solution is the only rational expectations equilibrium satisfying the no-bubble condition and consequently, it is the most relevant fundamental solution within the class of fundamental equilibria. Several economic examples are provided where the fundamental solutions obtained by other solution methods and refined by other solution selection criteria violate the no-bubble condition.

Rising energy prices constrain consumer budgets and thereby raise mortgage delinquency rates. This hypothesis is tested by estimating a quarterly cointegrating vector autoregressive (CVAR) model that seeks to quantify the factors that influence the percentage of US mortgages that are 30 to 89 days past due and those that enter foreclosure. Results identify a long-run relationship for the percentage of US mortgages that are 30 to 89 days past due that includes the interest rate on one-year adjustable mortgages, household expenditures on energy, nominal home prices, rates of home ownership, and the fraction of mortgages 90 days or more past due that enter foreclosure unemployment rates have a short-run effect. Together, these variables account for much of the historical variation in the percentage of US mortgages that are 30 to 89 days past due and indicate that the post 2006 rise in this measure of mortgage delinquency is associated with falling home prices, an increase in household expenditures on energy, and rising unemployment.

Feasibility of the proposed model is demonstrated in G7 stock markets. Additionally, two conventional random-coefficient frameworks, including time-varying betas derived from GARCH models and state-varying betas implied by Markov-switching models, are employed and subjected to comparative analysis. The empirical findings of this work are consistent with the following notions. First, the beta smile (beta skew) curve for the Italian, U.S. and U.K. (Canadian, French and German) markets. That is, covariance risk among global stock markets in extremely bull and/or bear market states is significantly higher than in stable periods. Additionally, the Japanese market provides a special case, and its beta estimate at extremely bust state is significantly lower, not higher than that at the middle region. Second, the quantile-varying betas are identified as possessing two key advantages. Specifically, the comparison of the system with quantile-varying betas against that with time-varying betas implied by GARCH models provides meaningful implications for correlation-volatility relationship among international stock markets. Furthermore, the quantile-varying beta design in this study relaxes a simple dual beta setting implied by Markov-switching models of Ramchand - Susmel (1998) and can identify dynamics of asymmetry in betas.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Accountancy, Grad Inst Finance & Banking, Tainan 701, Taiwan; [Yen, S.

The conventional wisdom is that pattern bargaining takes labor out of competition and therefore softens bargaining between the union and firms, resulting in higher industry wide wages. However, this does not explain why firms agree to pattern bargaining. We introduce a model in which the agents face uncertainty about the relative product-market positions of the firms and compare the trade-offs involved in adopting different bargaining mechanisms. We show that with sufficient heterogeneity in non-labor costs, there are situations in which both the union and the firms prefer pattern bargaining. We also show that in such situations, the adoption of pattern bargaining harms consumers. This provides an explanation as to how pattern bargaining can arise in equilibrium and why there is often strong political opposition to it. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

I thus approach the model from the household level and estimate the effects of aggregate institutions on household wealth. Under the benign assumption that institutions are exogenous to household choices this model gives unbiased estimates of multiple institutional variables. Issues then arise of the basic concepts and measurements of institutional variables. I revisit these issues and present new regional level institutional variables that are representative of 151 regions in thirteen African countries and measure clear concepts of institutions. I find that regional level institutions have significant effects on household wealth in a nonlinear fashion. Fear of crime, expectations of law enforcement and corruption at multiple levels are all estimated to have significant nonlinear effects on household wealth.","Lander Univ, Greenwood, SC USA",,"Green, A (通讯作者)，Lander Univ, Greenwood, SC USA.",agreen@lander.edu,,,,,,,32,16,16,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,FEB,2011,64.0,1,,,,,87,105,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2010.00496.x,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,705ES,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000286112300005,0

This article extends the analysis to multimarket oligopoly. Provided all ad valorem taxes are equal and positive, unit costs are constant, firms are active in all considered markets, and a representative consumer has convex preferences, ad valorem taxes are shown to dominate in multiproduct equilibrium. Conditions exist, however, under which economic efficiency declines upon replacing specific taxes with ad valorem taxes that preserve output levels. We discuss the roles of unit cost covariances across multiproduct firms, and also of complementarity in demand, in determining the extent of cost efficiencies arising under ad valorem taxation.

Existing research is plagued by methodological problems that obscure the empirics and avoid the theoretical problem of why democracies may or may not trade more. In this paper, I seek to correct these shortcomings. I test two theories as to why democracies might trade more. First, political freedom may be correlated with economic freedom, thus prompting higher levels of economic activity, thereby driving states to trade more. Second, democracy implies higher quality governance either through institutions or policy making procedures. To test the impact of democracy on trade and the potential transmission mechanisms, I utilize a bilateral gravity trade model covering approximately 150 countries from 1950 to 1999, with fixed effects for time, importers, and exporters. I find the theory that democracy, and many of its components, promotes international trade unconvincing. The coefficients are the theoretically correct sign; however, many are statistically or economically insignificant and fragile to changes in modeling or data. Economic freedom does not have the expected impact on international trade levels, but quality of governance variables have broad economic and statistical significance.","Peking Univ, HSBC Business Sch, Grad Sch, Univ Town, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Balding, C (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, HSBC Business Sch, Grad Sch, Univ Town, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.",cbalding@szpku.edu.cn,,,,,,,56,7,8,1,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Competitiveness as well as sustainable development have therefore long been focal points among strategic goals of the European Union. These goals were therefore documented in some strategies, namely European Single Market programme, the Lisbon Strategy and the Europe 2020. The Lisbon Strategy was aimed at turning the European Union into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion by 2010. However, it was obvious that the Lisbon goals have not been achieved and a new strategy, Europe 2020, was hence initiated. Many Lithuanian and foreign authors analyzed (Tamosiuniene et al., 2007; Daugeliene, 2008; Grybaite, Tvaronaviciene, 2008; Melnikas, 2008; Tvaronaviciene et al., 2008; Martinkus et al., 2009; Kirch, 2010; Balezentis et al., 2010) the situation of Lithuania and other Baltic states in a global economic system during the processes of globalization and European Union (EU) integration. However, the need for the evaluation of the Lisbon Strategy's outcomes and proposal of guidelines for ongoing strategy Europe 2020 is still topical. Hence this study focuses on the improvement of the open method of coordination and thus the implementation of strategy Europe 2020 by integrating quantitative methods with respect to the experience gained during the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy. This study is aimed at proposing a framework for a strategic management model dedicated to successful implementation of the new strategy Europe 2020. This article is organized in four sections according to the following tasks defined in order to achieve the aim: 1) to overview main the strategies dedicated to promoting competitiveness of the European Union, namely the Lisbon Strategy and strategy Europe 2020; 2) to assess efforts of the EU Member States in seeking Lisbon goals applying multi-criteria evaluation method MULTIMOORA; 3) to evaluate reliability of selected structural indicators applying multiple correspondence analysis; and 4) to summarize the proposed guidelines for the new strategy Europe 2020 according to the results of this study and other works. The novelty of this study lies in the fact that it introduces the application of multi-criteria decision making methods in EU policy making procedures. Multi-criteria evaluation method MULTIMOORA as well as multiple correspondence analysis were the most important methods of the research. Analysis of EU Member States performance in the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy resulted in describing three groups of states and structural indicators: high performance group, medium performance group, and low performance group. Moreover, indicators of youth education attainment level, business investment and employment rate of older workers, are not highly correlated with economic performance of certain Member States and therefore can be regulated uniformly at the European level. These findings can be considered as the premises for successful EU-level targets translation into those for certain groups of countries. The synthesis of proposals for target-setting and transformation methodology resulted in framework for strategic management model dedicated to successful implementation of strategy Europe 2020. The model should encompass: 1) selection of targets for the EU, certain groups of states and separate Member States; 2) mutual learning enabling to transfer the best practice among member States; 3) development of appropriate structural indicators, equally identifying all dimensions of sustainable development; 4) benchmarking (selectonovation) principles applied for an effective distribution of EU support among Member States. Multi-criteria methods (e. g. MULTIMOORA) can be successfully applied in such benchmarking.","[Balezentis, Alvydas] Mykolas Romeris Univ, LT-10101 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Balezentis, Tomas] Vilnius Univ, LT-01513 Vilnius, Lithuania",Mykolas Romeris University; Vilnius University,"Balezentis, A (通讯作者)，Mykolas Romeris Univ, Valakupiu St 5, LT-10101 Vilnius, Lithuania.",a.balezentis@gmail.com; t.balezentis@gmail.com,"Balezentis, Tomas/D-8609-2015; Roman, Urszula/G-2225-2011","Balezentis, Tomas/0000-0002-3906-1711;",,,,,55,16,17,1,37,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We find that changes in observed characteristics account for little of the aggregate decline. However, changes in characteristics are found to be important for population sub groups. In particular, changes in partner status and partner employment status have acted to decrease employment rates of younger males, but increase employment rates of older males. A further finding is that, holding observed characteristics constant, there has been a very large decline in the employment rate of 55-64-year-olds with bachelor degree qualifications. In the course of applying the decomposition method, we illustrate that validity of inferences depends on 'appropriate' specification of the reweighting function.","[Black, David; Tseng, Yi-Ping; Wilkins, Roger] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Wilkins, R (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",r.wilkins@unimelb.edu.au,"; Tseng, Yi-Ping/D-7062-2016","Wilkins, Roger/0000-0002-8548-757X; Tseng, Yi-Ping/0000-0001-6917-893X",,,,,27,2,3,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This paper applies a slightly modified version of the computable general equilibrium model developed by the International Food Policy Research Institute (Lofgren et al., 2002), to a SAM (Social Accounting Matrix) of the province of Huesca in north-eastern Spain. The model disaggregates the agricultural sectors into irrigated and unirrigated farming, taking into account the improvements in irrigation efficiency.

Then a reduced form model is put forward to reveal the determinants of film advertising in the four media. While major distribution companies have different preferences for the use of the alternative advertising media, results highlight the importance of quality signals, such as critical reviews, in determining advertising expenditures in the film industry.

This fact has always been a serious hindrance to the large number of market efficiency studies implemented either to demonstrate the profitability of market-beating systems or to deny their operational feasibility. For evident reasons it is practically impossible and theoretically weak to systematically analyse the entire body of all trading rules. We therefore propose a novel method to form natural classes of trading rules which are found to be robust to changing market scenarios. In particular, groups are formed adopting a similarity measure based on the investing signals of the trading rules. Our clustering methodology adopts a Markov chain bootstrapping technique to generate differentiated scenarios preserving volume and price joint distributional features. An application is developed on a sample of 674 trading rules. Results show that six groups (here identified as trading styles) are sufficient to explain the large portion of the investing signals variance.

In this article we provide evidence that these risks might have been smaller until 2005 than regularly assumed. Three basic findings support this view. First, a sectoral breakdown of money holdings shows that current excess liquidity conditions have been partly related to the acceleration of nonbank financial intermediaries' money demand, as well as to the accumulation of marketable instruments. Such increases are likely to be associated more to portfolio choices than to transaction motives. Second, evidence from balance sheet data on investment funds points to a general increase in the relative importance of this sector in the economy, rather than to a higher degree of liquidity of their asset positions, thus reflecting, to a large extent, a permanent change in the financial structure of the economy. Third, excess liquidity measures that exclude nonbank financial intermediaries' money holdings have more predictive power for future inflation at medium-term horizons than those that include them.","[Ferrero, Giuseppe; Nobili, Andrea; Passiglia, Patrizia] Banca Italia Econ Outlook & Monetary Policy, I-00184 Rome, Italy",,"Nobili, A (通讯作者)，Banca Italia Econ Outlook & Monetary Policy, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",andrea.nobili@bancaditalia.it,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This paper addresses the question: What keeps China's migrant workers going? We seek to answer this question through examining the determinants of the happiness of China's rural-urban migrants, drawing on a large-scale survey administered across 12 cities in 2005. We find that expectations as to future income are important determinants of happiness. This suggests that many migrants expect their financial position and, by extension, their lives more generally to get better in the future and that this is having a positive effect on their current levels of happiness. The effect of optimistic expectations outstrips any realistic increase in their own income. We find that for those who expect a big increase in income over the next five years, this translates to an increase of 380% in average monthly income and for those who expect a small increase in income over the next five years, this translates to an increase of 200% in average monthly income to obtain an equivalent increase in happiness compared with those who expect no change in income. This finding has important implications for economic growth and socio-economic stability in China, given that maintaining socio-economic stability is important to maintain China's high rate of economic growth and positive expectations about future income are important for maintaining socio-economic stability during times of economic transition.","[Smyth, Russell] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Gao, Wenshu] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Populat & Labour Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Gao, Wenshu] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Populat & Labor Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Monash University; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Smyth, R (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic, Australia.",russell.smyth@monash.edu,"Smyth, Russell/AAE-1492-2019","Smyth, Russell/0000-0001-6593-5462",,,,,66,41,48,1,68,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Merging information from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Structural Analysis database with data from the EU Labour Force Survey, we construct a cross-country panel of 22 industries in eight euro area countries for 1991-2002. Data inspection confirms the existence of a fairly stable inter-industry wage structure that is similar across countries. We then apply panel data techniques to identify factors explaining inter-industry wage differentials in the euro area. Both workforce characteristics (e.g. human capital variables) and firm-related characteristics (e.g. capital intensity, productivity) contribute significantly. However, considerable wage heterogeneity across sectors remains. Idiosyncratic sector and country specifics, reflecting different socio-cultural and institutional backgrounds, appear to bear a major role.

We also show that productivity shocks are quite heterogeneous not just across industries but also over time, whereas shocks to sectoral demand growth are more systematic.

The results indicate that syndication is more pronounced for younger funded firms. For firms where products are far from commercialization, the risks that investors face are more severe. With respect to disentangling the role of diversification and managerial resource motives we analyse the impact of syndication activities on the industry concentration in VC portfolios. The results indicate that (all else equal) more syndication leads to more pronounced concentration on certain industries. These findings are in line with the argument that VCs involve partners to leverage upon their idiosyncratic skills and knowledge to either improve deal selection and/or provide a better quality of managerial advice to the funded firm rather than simply using syndication to diversify portfolios.","[Hopp, Christian] Univ Vienna, A-1210 Vienna, Austria; [Rieder, Finn] Rasenberger Toschek AG, World Trade Ctr, CH-1000 Lausanne 30, Switzerland",University of Vienna,"Hopp, C (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Brunner Str 72, A-1210 Vienna, Austria.",Christian.Hopp@univie.ac.at,,,,,,,31,24,29,2,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The analysis focuses on an evaluation of the quality of forecasts for the real and nominal growth of GDP and for the average annual inflation rate for the period from 1997 to 2009. The quality of forecasts for selected macroeconomic variables was evaluated based on five groups of criteria: statistical measures of accuracy, comparison with the results of naive models, trace test, sign test and statistical tests of the unbiasedness and efficiency of forecasts. The results of the analysis do not provide an absolute winner, but they do indicate the features of particular forecasts. It is also clear that the developers of models have until now most likely given priority to reducing forecasting errors, while neglecting the congruence in the direction of trend between the forecast and the actual result. The latter criterion in particular is very important for effective economic policy making.","[Jagric, Timotej; Beko, Jani] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Jagric, T (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Razlagova 14, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia.",timotej.jagric@uni-mb.si; jani.beko@uni-mb.si,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,3,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

We have explored, first, the time series properties of the growth rates of gross domestic product and labour productivity with an extended battery of unit-root tests. Then, in a multivariate setting, we use the VAR model methodology to provide evidence that physical and human capital accumulation, R&D expenditure, openness and competitiveness are the main drivers of output, labour productivity and total factor productivity growth in the long run. Additionally, we also show that although China has not yet converged to its long-run equilibrium, it is in the process of catching up. These results are more consistent with some versions of the endogenous growth models than with Solow-type models of growth, since they support active strategies of economic policy to stimulate economic growth and catching up with more advanced economies.","[Jesus Herrerias, Maria; Orts, Vicente] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Castellon De La Plana, Spain; [Orts, Vicente] Univ Jaume 1, Inst Int Econ, Castellon De La Plana, Spain",Universitat Jaume I; Universitat Jaume I,"Herrerias, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Castellon De La Plana, Spain.",herreria@eco.uji.es; orts@eco.uji.es,"Orts, Vicente/K-5921-2014","Orts, Vicente/0000-0003-1708-9868",,,,,104,14,15,2,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

In the first part of this article, perspectives of national competitiveness are analyzed. In the second part of the article methodology of international competitiveness measurement is presented. In the third part of the article the analysis of Republic of Kazakhstan competitiveness is done. The results showed that there are many controversies in competitiveness definition and measurement. One of the examples is evolution of Kazakhstan's competitiveness in 2010 due to some activities by IMF and WEF. Though the measurements include many similar factors of competitiveness, the main competitive advantage of Kazakhstan is a huge reserve of mineral resources and stable macroeconomic situation. The main weaknesses are low innovation capability and high corruption rate.","[Macerinskiene, Irena] Mykolas Romeris Univ, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Sakhanova, Gaukhar] Abai Kazak Natl Teachers Training Univ, Alma Ata, Kazakhstan",Mykolas Romeris University; Kazakh National Women's Teacher Training University,"Macerinskiene, I (通讯作者)，Mykolas Romeris Univ, Ateities St 20, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania.",irena.macerinskiene@mruni.eu; ecolady@mail.ru,,"Sakhanova, Gaukhar/0000-0002-4017-3059",,,,,31,8,8,1,22,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

For example, the squared poverty gap- which measures the severity of poverty- fall by 55.72 percent when non farm income are included in household income, and by 23.35 percent when transfer payment are included in such income. This is true because agricultural households receive a very large share of their total household income from non farm income compared to transfer payment.

We find that foreign aid not exceeding 20% of a country's GDP significantly promotes export diversification, while foreign aid in excess of 20% of GDP significantly impedes export diversification. The latter result corroborates evidence from related literature, which has shown that foreign aid can have an anti-export bias due to a Dutch disease effect. However, our results show that aid as a percent of GDP is below 20% in most low-income countries. This implies that in many low-income countries, varying amounts of additional aid can be used to enhance export diversification without causing a Dutch disease effect. As in the previous literature, we find that the level of development, infrastructure, transactions costs, and natural resources significantly affect export diversification. Our results are robust to the use of two different export diversification measures and different sub-samples.","Salisbury Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Salisbury, MD USA",University System of Maryland; Salisbury University,"Munemo, J (通讯作者)，Salisbury Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Salisbury, MD USA.",jxmunemo@salisbury.edu,,,,,,,22,23,25,1,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Therefore, remittances although somewhat beneficial to families, are not a guaranteed developmental answer to families; and remittances could also deter economic growth and mobility of migrant women workers.","[Nkomo, Faith D.] Gauteng Prov Legislature, Johannesburg, South Africa",,,dnkomo@gpl.gov.za,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9083-4,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,10.0,,,,,,426,429,,,,,,4,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZY02,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303284800080,0

(2005, 2007), we explore the extent to which income inequality in Chile is associated with inequality of 'opportunities', proxied by inequality in observed socioeconomic circumstances of origin. We found that equalizing a diverse set of observed circumstances across individuals reduces the Gini and the Theil coefficients by about 15 and 25%, respectively. Almost half of the effect of observed circumstances on incomes is transmitted directly to earnings, whereas the rest is indirectly transmitted through the accumulation of schooling. Further results suggest that the influence of unobserved circumstances on income inequality may be limited; hence aspects such as preferences, choices, transitory income shocks and income measurement errors may be important factors behind observed income inequality.","[Nunez, Javier] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Tartakowsky, Andrea] Minist Planning, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile,"Núñez, J (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago, Chile.",jnunez@fen.uchile.cl,,,,,,,16,10,13,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Export is one of the ways to survive and develop business for companies of small open-economy countries. Such a tendency especially became evident during economic decline, when consumption in home market shrank. Recent Lithuania's economic growth is based on increasing exports, as well. On the other hand, estimation of trade credit risk factors is getting more and more important for exporting companies as the most popular settlement mode in the world is trade on an open account. Exporters, aiming to be the first in rivalry struggle and make a contract with a customer, have to propose the most beneficial conditions to the customer they can, i.e. to provide the customer with a trade credit. Exporter, when providing a trade credit for a foreign customer, takes a risk to lose financial resources. Risk of provided trade credit is evaluated on purpose to avoid the risk, i.e. the factors determining credit non-repayment and factors envisaging the risk are identified. One of the main factors determining trade credit risk is customer's insolvency, therefore designing a model to evaluate trade credits risk factors it is essential to analyse what predicts customer's ability to repay the trade credit given. Two approaches may be found in literature: evaluation is based on the analysis of financial indicators or on the analysis of both financial and non-financial indicators. Usually only financial indicators are used. In a traditional credit analysis mainly a company's accounting data is used aiming to assess if the company is able to generate cash enough to meet its liabilities. The research done shows, however, financial assessment is insufficient and does not give complete view about a company's business. In literature researches are found to be aimed at choosing such non-financial indicators that would be able to predict a company's insolvency, though a systematic approach to the use of certain indicators is scarce, especially which of them should be used to evaluate foreign customer's reliability in the case of export. Providing a foreign customer with the credit, an exporter incurs impact of the foreign country environment forces, as well. This is true because, when an exporter provides a trade credit, crediting relations bind subjects from two different countries and those subjects are both affected by different countries' forces. Country risk evidences for the exporter as the customer is another country; here country risk is understood as the manifestation of forces that affect customer only in the home business environment (customer's home country). These forces may circumvent the exporter from getting repaid or affect customer in such a way that the latter will become insolvent.","[Pridotkiene, Jurate] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Dapkus, Mindaugas] Vytautas Magnus Univ, LT-44248 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology; Vytautas Magnus University,"Pridotkiene, J (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",jurate.pridotkiene@ktu.lt; mindaugas.dapkus@vdu.lt,,,,,,,32,2,2,2,17,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In this paper, the relationships between migration and both regional economic circumstances and individual characteristics are investigated using a micro-dataset on Dutch college and university graduates. Over the last decade, some Dutch regions have retained increasingly higher proportions of college graduates. We find that the presence of a large labour market is the most important structural economic determinant for these higher retention rates. Cyclical determinants appear to affect university graduate migration more than college graduate migration. Une analyse des tendances dans la mobilite spatiale de diplomes de l'education superieure aux Pays-Bas Reume Differentes publications se sont consacrees dans une grande mesure a la mobilite spatiale, en tant que mecanisme pour la transition de l'etude a la pratique. Dans la presente communication, on se penche sur les rapports entre d'une part la migration, d'autre part des circonstances economiques regionales ainsi que des caracteristiques individuelles, en appliquant un micro fichier sur des diplomes de colleges et universites des Pays-Bas. Au cours des dix dernieres annees, certaines regions des Pays-Bas ont retenu une proportion toujours plus elevee de diplomes de colleges. Nous avons etabli que la presence d'un important marche du travail est l'element economique structurel le plus determinant pour justifier ces taux de retention eleves. Des determinants cycliques semblent affecter la migration de titulaires de diplomes universitaires plus qu'ils n'affectent la migration de diplomes de colleges.

En esta investigacion se analiza la relacion entre la migracion, las circunstancias economicas regionales y las caracteristicas individuales, utilizando un micro conjunto de datos de egresados de universidades y colegios holandeses. Durante la ultima decada, algunas regiones de Holanda mantienen cuotas cada vez mas altas de egresados de colegios. Creemos que la presencia de un mercado laboral amplio es el determinante economico estructural mas importante para estos indices de retencion mayores.

Although there is much work for these people, however the number of hiring people with disabilities remains quite small, due to the fact that employers must invest in job accessibility, which means additional costs for the employers.","[Zodieriu, Elena] Univ Alex I Cuza, Dept Management, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Zodieriu, E (通讯作者)，Univ Alex I Cuza, Dept Management, Iasi, Romania.",elena_zodieriu@yahoo.com,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,3,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-606-12-0139-6,,,,2011,,,,,,,662,667,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH0UM,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000396639300097,0

Using a sample of Flemish firms, we show that there exists considerable heterogeneity in the type of links to science at the firm level. Overall, firms with a science link enjoy superior innovation performance, in particular with respect to innovations that are new to the market. At the invention level, our findings confirm that patents from firms engaged in science are more frequently cited and have a broader technological and geographical impact. We show that it is crucial to distinguish between direct science links at the invention level and indirect science links at the firm level to encounter distinct positive effects.","[Cassiman, Bruno] IESE Business Sch, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Cassiman, Bruno; Veugelers, Reinhilde] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Brussels, Belgium; [Zuniga, Pluvia] OECD, Madrid, Spain",University of Navarra; IESE Business School; KU Leuven; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Cassiman, B (通讯作者)，IESE Business Sch, Ave Pearson 21, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",bcassiman@iese.edu,,,,,,,45,12,13,1,30,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics-Kiel,DEC 8,2010,4.0,,,,,,,,201033,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2010-33,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,865BH,,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298285200001,0

We show that inherited trust of descendants of US immigrants is significantly influenced by the country of origin and the timing of arrival of their forebears. We thus use the inherited trust of descendants of US immigrants as a time-varying measure of inherited trust in their country of origin. This strategy allows to identify the sizeable causal impact of inherited trust on worldwide growth during the twentieth century by controlling for country fixed effects.
