Sellers have directed much more their efforts than ever before toward marketing on the Internet. Consumers, on the other, spend more time and money on the Internet browsing and shopping online. The website traits represent the external stimuli to consumers. These stimuli lead to the consumers' basic reaction: buying impulsiveness, and one step forward, impulse buying online. Previously, some studies have demonstrated that there is impulse buying in the Internet environment. However, neither theoretical research nor imperial study has revealed the relationships among website traits, buying impulsiveness, and impulse buying online. This paper focuses on e-marketing, and investigates the website traits, buying impulsiveness, and impulse buying online. The paper proposes a theoretical model which suggests that website traits stimulate buying impulsiveness and increase the likelihood of buying impulse online via increasing the length of time on web browsing.","[Zeng Kaisheng] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University,,zengks@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,,,,,,9,0,0,7,21,ORIENT ACAD FORUM,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204, AUSTRALIA",,,,,,,2010,,,,,,,469,472,,,,,,4,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS34,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287959400077,0

The BPEIR model and Delphi method were applied as an evaluation index system to evaluate the developing level of circular economy of agriculture in Fujian province, China. The result shows that the development of the circular economy of agriculture is restrained in the past 24 years. Most of contributions of economy, society, resource circulation factor to the circular economy of agriculture were effectively counteracted by the devoted factor of the resource-reduced amount in this period. It leads to a slow increase in the integrating evaluation index for the circular economy of agriculture in Fujian. Reducing devoted level of resources for the agriculture system should be on the top of resolution in Fujian. The resources should be utilized more efficient in order to gain the more production with the lower devotions.

Using data from road and railway concessions in Latin America, the paper examines the probability of renegotiation in connection with the selected award criteria. It shows that auctioneers tend to adopt the multidimensional format when the need for social considerations, such as alleviation of unemployment, is high. But more renegotiations would likely happen when the multidimensional format is used.

Under SIM 2, productivity has a negative employment impact in the selected sectors, on all skills mostly in labour-intensive sectors.

Our main result is that favoritism substantially facilitates collusion. It increases the gains from collusion and contributes to solving basic implementation problems for a cartel of bidders operating in a stochastically changing environment. A most simple allocation rule where firms take turns in winning, independently of stochastic social preferences and firms' costs, achieves full cartel efficiency (including price, production, and design efficiency). In each period the selection criteria is fine-tailored to the in-turn winner: the environment adapts to the cartel. This result holds true when the expected punishment is a fixed cost. When the cost varies with the magnitude of the distortion of the selection criteria (compared to the true social preferences), favoritism only partially shelters the cartel from the environment. We thus find that favoritism generally facilitates collusion at a high cost for society. Our analysis suggests some anti-corruption measures that could be effective in curbing favoritism and collusion in public markets. It also suggests that the much-advocated rotation of officials is likely to be counter-productive.","[Lambert-Mogiliansky, Ariane] Paris Sch Econ, F-75014 Paris, France; [Kosenok, Grigory] New Econ Sch, Moscow 117418, Russia",Paris School of Economics; New Economic School,"Lambert-Mogiliansky, A (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",alambert@pse.ens.fr; gkosenok@nes.ru,,,,,,,18,11,11,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

To obtain an unbiased estimate of the effect of consummated mergers, I propose an approach that focuses on the response of rivals to mergers and accounts for the endogeneity of exposure to these mergers. I apply this approach to evaluate the impact of independent hospital mergers in the United States between 1989 and 1996. Using the physical colocation of rivals as an instrument for whether they merge, I find a sizeable, one-time increase in price following a rival's merger, with the greatest increase occurring among hospitals nearest the merging hospitals. These results are more consistent with predictions from structural models of the hospital industry than with prior observational estimates of the effects of hospital mergers.","Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Dafny, L (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,,,,,,,33,96,141,2,38,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

In other words, if care and activity levels are the only relevant variables of the injurer's set of actions to reduce the risk of accident, it is true that inefficiency arises when the court ignores one element of this set. But, considering that some dimensions of care are in practice not verifiable, it can be efficient for the judge not to take into account the activity level of the defendant.

Forecasts are built from univariate autoregressive and single-equation models. The analysis is undertaken for both individual countries and EU aggregate variables. Aggregate forecasts are constructed by both employing aggregate variables and by aggregating country-specific forecasts. Using financial variables for country-specific forecasts tends to add little to the predictive ability of a simple AR model. However, they do help to predict EU aggregates.

This is particularly interesting from the perspective of the European Central Bank, who require forecasts of economic activity and inflation to formulate appropriate economic policy across the enlarged group.

This system necessarily entails a subsidy that dramatically raises the demand for medical services. In the face of the increased demand, the government suppresses costs by suppressing prices. Through biographical and income data on more than 4,000 Tokyo physicians, I explore the effect of this price suppression on the allocation of talent and the development of expertise. Crucially, this national health insurance does not cover services-like elective cosmetic surgery-deemed medically superfluous. Facing price caps in the covered sector but competitive prices in these superfluous sectors, the most talented doctors disproportionately shift into the superfluous sectors and there invest heavily in their expertise: cosmetic surgeons are more likely than other doctors ( more likely even than noncosmetic plastic surgeons) to have attended a more selective medical school, to have served on a medical school faculty, to be board certified, and to earn high incomes.","Harvard Univ, Sch Law, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Ramseyer, JM (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Law, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,18,6,7,0,11,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Our empirical examination of the debate relies on a dataset that is constructed from three sources: firm-level data of 1,881 high-tech firms in all 40 Dutch regions, regional economic data and network data constructed from the membership registrations of all business associations in a sample of 11 regions. The results show that the total amount of regional network activity has no effect on individual firm performance; however, participation in local business networks does support firm employment growth. With regards to the Marshall-Jacobs controversy, the results show that having local links to other high-tech firms is conducive to a firm's employment growth, while links to other types of firms provided no such lift.","[Boshuizen, Johannes; Geurts, Peter] Univ Twente, Sch Management & Governance, Enschede, Netherlands; [Van der Veen, Anne] ITC, Int Inst Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat, Enschede, Netherlands",University of Twente,"Boshuizen, J (通讯作者)，Univ Twente, Sch Management & Governance, Enschede, Netherlands.",j.boshuizen@utwente.nl; p.a.t.m.guerts@utwente.nl; veen@itc.nl,"van der Veen, Anne/A-5331-2010","van der Veen, Anne/0000-0003-1574-9332",,,,,64,17,20,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

The paper claims that the different conceptual dimensions - industrial, socio-cultural/cognitive and geographic - build upon the three micro-foundations of agglomeration economies - indivisibility, synergy and proximity - and explain their nature, scope and intensity. The paper stresses two main issues. The first is that a socio-cultural/cognitive perspective still today ignored by mainstream approaches to agglomeration economies is an additional important conceptual dimension on which to understand the complex mechanisms whereby exchanges of knowledge, labour or intermediate goods take place in agglomerated areas. The second is that a multidimensional approach comprising the three different dimensions in the study of agglomeration economies makes it possible to overcome a deterministic approach to agglomeration economies and move instead towards a stochastic interpretation which opens the black box of this complex phenomenon.","Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Ingn Gestionale, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Capello, R (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Ingn Gestionale, Via G Colombo 40, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",roberta.capello@polimi.it,,"Capello, Roberta/0000-0003-0438-6900",,,,,57,35,35,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

For much of the 1990s up to the more recent past, answers to this pertinent question frequently referred to the embeddedness-network paradigm of the new economic sociology. At the same time, economic geography more and more drew inspiration, metaphors, and practices from an increasingly diverse range of schools. In terms of the disciplinary orientation, economic geography, on the one hand, remains firmly engaged with sociology, although interest seems to expand from the Granovetterian paradigm to the poststructuralism of Latour and Callon. On the other hand, economic geography's interest in heterodox economic geography is gaining new momentum. Above all, evolutionary approaches have attracted considerable attention that most recently culminated in a range of programmatic statements to develop a distinct evolutionary economic geography. It is these attempts to develop a collective agenda that Danny MacKinnon, Andrew Cumbers, Andy Pike, Kean Birch, and Robert McMaster take issue with. Subsequently, Ron Boschma and Koen Frenken, Jurgen Essletzbichler, and Geoffrey Hodgson comment on this sympathetic critique. A rejoinder by Andy Pike and his coauthors concludes this symposium.","Univ Bonn, D-53115 Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Grabher, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Meckenheimer Allee 166, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",grabher@giub.uni-bonn.de,"Grabher, Gernot/C-4875-2013; Kim, Soohyun/N-6460-2014; Schiller, Gabrielle/H-7617-2012",,,,,,55,58,72,5,89,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Agglomeration economies are based on the distance between firms, labour and the market. Infrastructure investment can be a tool used by governments to affect this distance, where, in doing so, they induce agglomeration economies and increase economic growth. In this paper, we will discuss the importance of considering types of networks when analysing agglomeration economies using multiregional new economic geography (NEG)-based spatial general equilibrium models. These models typically use abstract bi-regional origin-destination networks to describe the cost of transporting or commuting between regions. These abstract networks are like tunnels between regions and do not take into account the actual roads in real infrastructure networks used for transport and traffic between destinations. In other words, in real infrastructure networks, which we label full networks, people and goods move from one region to another via actual roads and possibly via third regions. In the empirical economic literature, there is a significant difference between the economic effect of changes in a bi-regional origin-destination network and the economic effect of changes in a full network. To date, no systematic explanation has been given for this difference in the size of the effects. Lack of an explanation for this difference may lead to confusion among policy-makers who have to decide on infrastructure investment. In this methodological paper, we discuss the reason for this difference. We do not discuss the absolute size of the agglomeration effects, only the relative difference that exists when using different types of networks. In order to explain the difference, we introduce a methodology that translates the effects in a bi-regional origin-destination network into similar effects in a full network, making it possible to systematically compare the economic importance of all links (roads) in such a network. This is highly relevant to policy-makers, who can now interpret the model results on a real full infrastructure network. We will also show the mathematical relationship between the importance of agglomeration economies on a link in a full network and the importance of agglomeration economies on a link in a bi-regional origin-destination network. Finally, the methodology is illustrated with a case study from the Netherlands.","[Thissen, Mark; Hilbers, Hans; Van de Coevering, Paul] Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, NL-2500 GH The Hague, Netherlands",Netherlands National Institute for Public Health & the Environment,"Thissen, M (通讯作者)，Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, POB 30314, NL-2500 GH The Hague, Netherlands.",mark.thissen@pbl.nl; hans.hilbers@pbl.nl; paul.vandecoevering@pbl.nl,"Thissen, Mark/ABA-8140-2020","Thissen, Mark/0000-0001-7654-3253",,,,,17,2,2,0,8,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0040-747X,,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Second, over-optimism of experts is found to cause adjustments to be upwards more often than downwards. We analyze a unique database containing one-step-ahead model-based forecasts adjusted by many experts, who are located in 37 countries, and are making forecasts for pharmaceutical products within 7 distinct categories. Our results are consistent with earlier findings that the experts make frequent adjustments and that these tend to be upward. Next, and this is new to the literature, we document the fact that expert adjustment itself is largely predictable, where the weight of a forecaster's own earlier adjustment is about three times as large as the weight of past model-based forecast errors. We also show that expert adjustment is not independent of the model-based forecasts, and we argue that this affects the way we should evaluate the contribution of expert adjustment to the overall forecast quality.

The variants differ, among other things, with respect to taking the alternative specific constant (ASC), indicating the status quo option, into account or not. While including the ASC results in our Study in overall negative welfare measures, excluding it causes positive measures. However, both variants might be inappropriate because of an underestimation or an overestimation of the benefits. Avoiding an underestimation or ail overestimation would require differentiation between respondents who demand compensation for a move away from the status quo, and respondents who Would not suffer a loss but chose the status quo alternative because of choice task complexity, for instance.

The findings show that technology ventures are more likely to enter these relationships when they obtain CVC investment, introduce professional executives and set outside directors. And technology ventures may be reluctant to cooperate when their key technology is from internal R&D. Overall, the findings show that corporate governance mechanisms can promote new venture's capability of building cooperative ties.

This essay presents two of them: a poetical reflection and a philosophical pondering that are characterized by either factual inquiry or empirical wisdom. The former is deplorably sentimental and unforgettable with regard to the deadliest mode of warfare that has ever occurred in human history. The philosophical pondering from a Taoist viewpoint is thought-provoking and instructive with ongoing relevance to the problematic globe. Hence when the poet calls out No More Hiroshimas, we shall go ahead and appeal for No More Wars, No More Sharp Weapons, or No More Excessive Forces. However, what haunts the world all the time is constant warfare at varied scales here and there; and what worries us right now is the hard fact that some nations are presumably taking the risk of developing nuclear weapons on a starvation budget, for they think that they are under the threat and pressure of other countries armed with plenty of such mass-destructive devices.

But the question is whether the notion of 'public finance' can dovetail into the existing finance system or not, and which index can reflect the 'public finance'. If Chinese existing finance can fully be characteristic as pubic finance, the financial function, redistribution, can reduce the income inequality. Through the empirical analysis between the relevance of finance expenditure and the degree of income distribution equality, it reflects that Chinese existing public finance expenditure can not efficiently reduce the income distribution gap.

Automated learning systems induce the winner's curse when several pricing types compete. Bidders frequently compete with different data, which induces randomization in equilibrium. Machine learning causes the value of information to leak across participants. Discrimination may be used to induce efficient exploration, although publishers (websites) may balk at participating. The creation of learning accounts, which divorce payments from receipts, may be used to internalize learning externalities. Under some learning mechanisms the learning account eventually shows a surplus. The solution is illustrated computationally.","Yahoo Res, Burbank, CA 91504 USA",Yahoo! Inc; Yahoo!

We dispute this popular claim. We show that although it is true that high-pressure steam technology developed only after the expiration of Watt's patent, the delay was due to factors other than that patent itself, including the widely held opinion that the use of high-pressure engines were excessively risky. Indeed, Watt's monopoly rights may actually have hastened the development of the high-pressure steam engine by inspiring Richard Trevithick to revive a supposedly obsolete technology so as to invent around them.","[Selgin, George; Turner, John L.] Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Selgin, G (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",,,,,,,,61,11,14,0,17,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

This paper analyses prices in the market assuming that in noncompetitive markets prices are higher and the variation coefficient is lower. We use weekly retail petrol (petrol 95 and diesel) price data from the ten biggest cities in Spain to employ a variance screen to detect suspicious behaviour in retailing. We conclude that this market shows low price dispersion, regardless of brand or city However, this symmetrical behaviour in prices among all petrol stations does not enable us to reach any robust conclusions as to the existence of collusive behaviour in the Spanish petrol market.","[Perdiguero Garcia, Jordi] Univ Barcelona, Dept Polit Econ, Grp Recerca Governs & Mercats GiM, IREA, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona,,jljimenez@daea.ulpgc.es; jordi.perdiguero@ub.edu,"Perdiguero, Jordi/K-8460-2017","Jimenez Gonzalez, Juan Luis/0000-0002-3808-2588",,,,,33,3,3,0,13,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

However, no study has been conducted to gauge the potential impact of such measures. In this paper we utilise a dynamic microsimulation model developed for Ireland to simulate the impact of both an income contingent loan system (ICL) and a graduate tax system from a fiscal and redistributional viewpoint and to analyse the repayment length under the former system. Our results suggest that an ICL system could be more equitable, while the graduate tax system could be a better alternative from a fiscal viewpoint. The results also illustrate the importance of the interest rate attached to any future student loan system within Ireland from a fiscal viewpoint.","[Flannery, Darragh] Natl Univ Ireland, Univ Limerick, Galway, Ireland",University of Limerick; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"Flannery, D (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, Univ Limerick, Galway, Ireland.",darragh.flannery@ul.ie,"O’Donoghue, Cathal/AAW-4109-2021; flannery, darragh/F-2722-2015","O’Donoghue, Cathal/0000-0003-3713-5366; flannery, darragh/0000-0001-7192-8621",,,,,50,6,7,0,11,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

The model is simulated to produce qualitative results and to illustrate the differences between economies with different distributional features. We show that a distortion in the democratic rule in favor of the rich reduces transfers while the size of the informal sector may remain at high levels. Despite a greater demand for redistribution in societies where the majority has few resources (skills), we find that political systems which work in favor of a rich minority will produce little redistribution. Our results call for pro-poor measures such as free training and education programs that should be offered to those who cannot afford it.","[Hatipoglu, Ozan] Bosphorus Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey; [Ozbek, Gulenay] Reform Corp, Istanbul, Turkey; [Ozbek, Gulenay] NYU, New York, NY USA",Bogazici University; New York University,"Hatipoglu, O (通讯作者)，Bosphorus Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey.",ozan.hatipoglu@boun.edu.tr,,,,,,,17,11,12,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Morale can change and react to new incentives. In particular, a deep economic crisis with increasing unemployment and reduced prospects for market income may have a norm eroding effect. This study explores the link between economic crisis and morale. Our theoretical reasoning is based on an economic approach to the evolution of norms, according to which norms are influenced by self-interest. A distinction is made between two dimensions of citizens' morale: benefit and tax morale. Our econometric evidence based on data from the World Value Survey suggests that a sharp hike in unemployment reduces the morale standards along both dimensions. The crisis impact on benefit morale is conditional on the existence of generous benefit schemes.","ZEW, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Heinemann, F (通讯作者)，ZEW, L 7,1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.",heinemann@zew.de,,,,,,,28,13,13,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

In the late 1980s, Japanese investors constructed captive governance arrangements to coordinate the production of high-value beef for the Japanese market. Two decades later, this trade has come to be structured around a quite different set of principles. This is the result of a path-dependent, co-evolution of firm strategies and the institutional environment. It has involved (i) rising and then declining per capita beef consumption in Japan; (ii) the impacts of Japanese retail consolidation on competitive advantage within the beef trade; (iii) the ability of Australian and US beef firms to undertake process upgrading and (iv) the exogenous shock of a BSE outbreak in the USA in 2003. These insights have relevance for a broader appreciation of the changing incorporation of Japanese food demand within global agri-food systems.","[Pritchard, Bill] Univ Sydney, Sch Geosci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Oro, Kohei] Natl Agr & Food Res Org Western Reg, Hiroshima 7218514, Japan",University of Sydney,"Pritchard, B (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Geosci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",b.Pritchard@usyd.edu.au,,"Pritchard, Bill/0000-0001-7506-2095",,,,,47,17,18,0,45,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Considering that just accessing external knowledge is not sufficient, this paper tries to approach this issue from the perspective of absorptive capacity building and enhancing and related knowledge and knowledge flows. From the perspective of national dimension, absorptive capacity enhancing can be regarded as having geographic elements in knowledge flows within national territory. This paper tries to utilise patent citation data made by USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office) for finding out the characteristics of knowledge flows which has been underlying the catch-up phenomenon of catching-up countries. We can find out that even though there is a marked difference between advanced countries and catching-up economies in terms of strong or weak localisation of knowledge flows, it is evident that the geographic localisation exists in spite of the heavy dependence on external knowledge. In addition, even in catching-up countries, technological development accompanies a strengthening of the localisation of knowledge flows, from weak to strong as well as from low to high. Therefore, we discover that technological catch-up necessitates the active attitude toward available external knowledge, not just the passive attitude, and some mechanism to spillover the adapted knowledge to other innovative firms, and a way to innovate to confirm this attitude and mechanism.","Korea Univ Technol & Educ, Cheonan 330708, Chungnam Prov, South Korea",Korea University of Technology & Education,"Park, KH (通讯作者)，Korea Univ Technol & Educ, Cheonan 330708, Chungnam Prov, South Korea.",khpark@kut.ac.kr,,,,,,,21,5,5,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

Specifically, the paper shows that the innovator may find it optimal to patent her innovation even if litigation is not pursued in the event of patent imitation. The patent is valuable because it can be used to influence the entrant's location decision in a way that is profitable for the incumbent. In addition to showing that a patent need not be legally enforced to be valuable, the paper shows that the lower is the entrant's R&D cost, the smaller is the innovator's incentive to patent her product.

A literature review identifies important factors in examining the transfer of policies. Results of interviews in eleven cities in Northern Europe and North America investigate these factors further. The principal motivations for policy transfer were strategic need and curiosity. Local officials and politicians dominated the process of initiating policy transfer, and local officials were also the leading players in transferring experience. A range of information sources are used in the search process but human interaction was the most important source of learning for two main reasons. First, there is too much information available through the Internet and the search techniques are not seen to be wholly effective in identifying the necessary information. Secondly, the information available on websites, portals and even good practice guides is not seen to be of mixed quality with risks of focussing only on successful implementation and therefore subject to some bias. Officials therefore rely on their trusted networks of peers for lessons as here they can access the 'real implementation' story and the unwritten lessons. Organisations which have a culture that is supportive of learning from elsewhere had strong and broad networks of external contacts and resourced their development whilst others are more insular or inward looking and reluctant to invest in policy lessons from elsewhere. Solutions to the problems identified in the evidence base are proposed. City to city policy transfer is a very active process in the field of transport. Not enough is yet understood about its benefits or the conditions under which it is most effective. Such understandings should help to promote and accelerate the uptake of effective and well matched policies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Marsden, G.; May, A.

We examine combining exponential smoothing point and interval forecasts using weights derived from AIC, small-sample-corrected AIC and BIC on the M1 and M3 Competition datasets. Weighted forecast combinations perform better than forecasts selected using information criteria, in terms of both point forecast accuracy and prediction interval coverage. Simple combinations and weighted combinations do not consistently outperform one another, while simple combinations sometimes perform worse than single forecasts selected by information criteria.

We explain this phenomenon on the basis of percentage limits which require shareholders to hold a minimum amount of shares in order to bring a lawsuit. We show that, under this legal regime, managers will collude with large shareholders by means of settlements or bribes that impose a negative externality on small shareholders. Contrary to conventional agency models, we find that large shareholders do not monitor the management: as a consequence, there is no free riding opportunity for small shareholders.

There has long since been a view however that P&R in its current guise may actually be exacerbating the problems of traffic congestion, fuel use and emissions instead of mitigating them. This paper aims to reconsider this proposition whilst also testing a range of alternative forms of car-bus interchange in the context of traffic reduction, drawing on evidence from a large survey of P&R users in Cambridge, UK. Overall the results suggest that while current P&R significantly increases the vehicle miles travelled by its users, some of the alternative models presented potentially offer considerable improvements.

An important accountability mechanism is the Value for Money (VFM) assessment which procuring authorities in Ireland must conduct prior to adoption of PPP. This paper examines the application of VFM appraisal procedures in the case of the water services sector. As the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, considers PPP as the preferred model of procurement, VFM assessments fail to deliver an acceptable level of accountability.

The study contends that values and habits can be shaped through learning environment that promotes meta-cognitive thinking skills and a deep approach to learning. For this to happen, a change must take place where Gen Y's values and learning preferences are and accommodated, and learning environment are tailored to meet the needs of a generation of learners who seek greater autonomy and connectivity as well as opportunities for socio-experiential learning.

This paper is part of a stream which focuses on the relationships between technological innovation and innovation in management practices. It explores how technological innovation may be a source of innovation in management practices. It is based on the empirical case study of the development of Episkin (R). Episkin is an in-vitro solution which is used by firms to test new products on engineered tissues. It allows scientists to screen and measure with high precision, the irritation, penetration, metabolism, or efficacy of a large number of formulations or active ingredients on reconstituted artificial skin and/or epidermis obtained by cell culture, in order to eliminate unsuitable ones. The development of this alternative method has led to a phasing out of animal testing by the cosmetics company L'Oreal and has accompanied regulatory change at the institutional level. Using a methodology which rests on the analysis of archival sources complemented by focused interviews, the paper firstly analyzes the process of technological innovation which led to the development of Episkin in the SkinEthic Laboratories, which are owned by L'Oreal. It then studies why and how this technological innovation was part of L'Oreal's management strategy. Finally, it shows that L'Oreal's use of technological innovation became a source of innovation in management practices. The paper aims to contribute to the important literature which is devoted to the study of various forms and sources of innovation. By its implications for policy making and management practices it also contributes to the strategic management literature, as well as to the policy literature.","[Auplat, Claire] Adv Sch Entrepreneurship, Paris, France",,,cauplat@advancia-negocia.fr,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,11,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,98,103,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800013,0

The research results are obtained using principal component analysis and regression analysis and they highlight that life expectancy is influenced predominantly (R Square equal to 0.655) by the simultaneous variation of the two composed factors identified, healthcare expenditure and occupational structure. The distribution of countries according to the values on the two factorial axes allows identifying similarities in healthcare management and occupational structure among countries.

Second, the open economy Taylor rule including foreign exchange rate and forward-looking variables is good for output increment.","[Chang, Xinxin; He, Guohua] Wuhan Univ, Dept Finance, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China",Wuhan University,"Chang, XX (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Dept Finance, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",changxinxin88@163.com; ghhe@whu.edu.cn,,,"Economic openness, the monetary policy validity and international monetary policy cooperation [10YJA790066]; Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities","Economic openness, the monetary policy validity and international monetary policy cooperation; Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities","This topic is subsidized by project fund Economic openness, the monetary policy validity and international monetary policy cooperation ([10YJA790066]) and supported by the Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities.",,12,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1865-0929,1865-0937,978-3-642-23022-6,COMM COM INF SC,,,2011,208.0,,1.0,,,,258,+,,,,,,2,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BXA64,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000295545200039,0

The main outcome of our research is the finding that only 10.4 percent of students manifested categorical intent to do own business - the statistic analyses did not supported assumption about differences between men and women, technique and economic students. Only rural students manifested stronger entrepreneurial intent. The university students realise the advantages and disadvantages of entrepreneurship. There are also differences from the point of view of gender, domicile and branch of study.

It is necessary to seize here all the interest for innovation in our knowledge economy, where tangible advantages are not enough anymore to ensure access to resources and to protect the assets. Innovation determines in large part the competitiveness of the firms, mainly because it facilitates their distinction, supports the renewal of their offer and induces an organizational flexibility in face of the increasingly turbulent competing environment. The adoption of innovations, which belongs to this process of competing renewal, depends partly on the relational capital of the company, meaning the whole of the relations it maintains. Through these relations, the firm is enabled to supplement its resources and competences. The relational capital of the firm thus reflects it capacity to acquire and exploit external knowledge in new business opportunity. Nevertheless, relational capital may also have a rather stabilizing effect instead of being stimulating for the exploration and exploitation of knowledge. Indeed, the firms sometimes suffer from an effect of isolation from other sources of knowledge when overly brooded within their relations. It can be noted that family businesses, which represent nearly 70% of the Canadian companies and which employ more than half of the country labour, maintain a relational capital made particular because of the family relations. Taking into account the importance of the family businesses' role and that of innovation for the Canadian economy, it appears more than relevant to seek a better knowledge of the impact of the family and non-family relational capital on the adoption of innovations in family firms. Based on an evolutionist and relational perspective, the literature from relational capital, family business, organizational cooperation, learning and innovation is reviewed to propose a conceptual model regarding the use of family and non-family relational capital by family firms for the adoption of innovations. The model suggests that both the family and non-family relational capital support and then stabilize the innovation adoption activity as cooperation links intensify between the family business and local actors. This logarithmic relation is expected to be steeper and sooner stabilized for the subset of the family relational capital as reciprocity and trust in the inter-firm relations arise more rapidly from family involvement. It is finally expected that higher intensity of the family relational capital not only stabilize but then bring down the level of activity in innovation adoption because of conservative pressures exerted by the family on the business. A glance at future research describes the use of this model as the conceptual framework for a descriptive study based on a survey of Canadian family businesses.","[Guihur, Izold; Koffi, Vivi] Univ Moncton, Moncton, NB E1A 3E9, Canada",University of Moncton,,izold.guihur@umoncton.ca; vivi.koffi@umoncton.ca,"yongquan, hu/G-7450-2011",,,,,,35,0,0,0,12,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,429,435,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800053,0

Therefore in this paper we study the impact of declining forest productivity on the land expectation value and the optimal rotation length. We start from the research by Lu and Chang (1996) and try to fill the gap between the stable site productivity (best) and the site mining (worst) cases. For that we extend the classical Faustmann model by availability of different recovering technologies. In general the model allows the analysis of the two plantation groups: mining the site by high productive plantation followed by management of degraded areas and high productive plantation and regeneration cycling with the same comparative static. The model, analysis and comparison with the two extreme cases in Lu and Chang (1996) leads to a detailed understanding of land use management when site productivity decline is possible. Particularly the relation between declining periods with intensive land use and land use alternatives after declining periods with regeneration can be well understood. Findings are: Not ever declining process asks for regeneration. Many declining processes can be stopped at early times by high cash flows after mining periods. Shortenings of the regeneration time can boost site mining intensities. (C) 2011 Department of Forest Economics, SLU Umea, Sweden. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

But this hypothesis has long been questioned, and thus a very different two types of views about this issue are formed. With the expansion of the portfolio theory, the paper demonstrates the intrinsic correlation mechanism between real estate investment returns and inflation. Based on Chinese 2001 2011 monthly data, implementing ARIMA techniques to decompose the rate of inflation, the paper uses VECM model to study the effect of inflation on the real estate investment return rate and finds that real estate investment can not hedge against inflation. The cause of detail is studied and we find in China, due to the proxy effect and inflation illusion effect, higher inflation will weaken the real estate price appreciation, reduce the real estate investment return. The paper concludes that guiding reasonably inflation expectations can improve the ability of real estate investment's hedging against inflation.

In this paper we show how SMEs can use an Innovation Council to improve their effectiveness in commercializing innovations. The mechanisms and processes of an Innovation Council include idea generation, providing education for the project teams about the radical innovation life cycle, setting expectations, helping team members to accept ambiguity, forecasting technology futures, recognizing and evaluating opportunities, developing a fast track screening process and a fast track intellectual property process. In addition, the Innovation Council maintains an Innovation Repository, and regularly evaluates the ideas and projects. They define the Innovation Metrics appropriate to their business and manage an effective Innovation Portfolio. Innovation Metrics provide strategic direction for innovation activities within the business and guide the allocation of resources. We offer a sample of metrics. When an innovative idea is approved for initial funding, the Innovation Council forms a project team with team members with the necessary skills and helps them advance the project through stages. The Innovation Council holds a quarterly Innovation Roundtable, a meeting with 10-20 people, four to eight presentations and a chance for cross pollination of ideas. Many large enterprises use the mechanisms and processes of the Innovation Council. This paper describes the mechanisms and processes appropriate for SMEs, adapting the processes to fit a smaller organization. This presentation provides the scaffolding and structure for creating an Innovation Council within a business with fewer than 250 employees, with explicit roles and responsibilities, most of which are already done on an ad hoc basis. SMEs can adopt this set of processes without adding headcount. Moving the organization from an ad hoc approach to innovation, to a structured process, moves it from serendipity to strategy.","[Martinich, Leslie] Competit Focus, Austin, TX 78746 USA; [Bozic, Mila] BE I Inst, Dragomer, Slovenia",,"Martinich, L (通讯作者)，Competit Focus, Austin, TX 78746 USA.",leslie@competitivefocus.com; mila.bozic@be-i.org,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,8,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,1085,1089,,,,,,5,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800130,0

Hence, in locations where intensification occurs, greater concentrations of traffic tend to occur, and this worsens local environmental conditions. This phenomenon is defined below as the 'paradox of intensification'. The consequent challenges for planners and policymakers, which arise, are considered. The analysis suggests that a compromise involving limited intensification would merely redistribute the balance between the two sets of problems: global and local. It is concluded that urban intensification should be accompanied by more radical measures to constrain traffic generation within intensified areas. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Whereas its theoretical background highlights the role played by small firms (henceforth SF) in the conduct of innovation, the empirical model it is based on does not. Rather, it compares SF contribution to economic growth to that of large firms without illustrating how innovation is instrumentalized for entrepreneurship. This is the purpose of our paper which arguments that absorption capacity as a device can help in such a project. For this, it mixes conceptions of entrepreneurship as innovation conduct with that of entrepreneurship as opportunity exploitation. It suggests to distinguish economic agents involved in entrepreneurship from opportunities sources being exploited. The paper elaborates on how to turn the process into variables, measure and introduce them into a model for regressions and tests at an aggregated level. Specifically, literature on SF and innovation helps to define entrepreneurial capacity which is for a country or industry its share of SF whereas the vast work on technological change is useful to quantify opportunities. Variables interact and entrepreneurship matters when ones obtain a significant coefficient suggesting absorption or exploitation. It happens for critical levels of SF presence which must be considered carefully for at least two reasons: (1) critical levels of firm size are specific to our dataset and moving from them for country or industry purposes need subsequent works. (2) Respective influences of entrepreneurship components are not of same intensities, that of opportunities being the most important, it incentives for interest in other agents involved in exploitation.

The work presents practical achievements to perform an anti-allergic fabric using natural active principles as well basic strategy to solve problems raised on dermatological diseases. The advantage is that the active ingredients are natural, clean and deliver not by oral route, to reach the location of the digestion way. Were prepared and tested knitted fabric from 100% cotton on which are stored natural active principles. They are applied on the inner side of pajama and then transferred directly to the skin. One used an inclusion compound as a sorption surface. There have been determined experimentally the characteristics of knitted fabric by means of hygienic- physiological indices. Determinations have been made to obtain therapeutic concentrations, measurements of hygiene-physiological comfort index. Textile fabric is designed to provide researchers information on a new methodology for brand new products for medical use. The originality consists in developing and obtaining textile fabrics using natural, effective anti-allergic products on their surface as a topic response to conventional technologies for treatment of patients with contact dermatitis. The research implies a method to avoid the discomfort of an allergy episode and can diminish the risks or even could provide an efficient weapon against allergy episodes.

These policy scenarios were developed by combining 2 alternatives climate targets and 5 different modes of achieving the different climate change mitigation targets. Analysis of scenarios results provides a lot of information however it is difficult to judge about these scenarios and to develop policy recommendations as some scenarios show better results according contradicting criteria such as costs and GHG emission reduction therefore the sustainability assessment approach was proposed seeking to rank policy scenarios. Criteria for sustainability assessment of policy scenarios were developed based on EU sustainable energy policy targets: increase use of renewable, increase of energy use efficiency and GHG emissions reduction. These main EU energy policy targets are called 20/20/20. The European Union's '20/20/20' targets for 2020 are the following: reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% comparing with 1990 level (to become a 30% reduction if other major global economies join); increase the share of renewable in the final energy consumption to 20% and to achieve 20% improvement in energy efficiency compared to the level in 2020 if existing trends were to continue. Therefore EU energy policy scenarios were ranked based on these criteria and scenario costs. The results of multi-criteria analysis performed in the paper allow indentifring the best EU energy policy scenarios in terms of energy sustainability.","[Streimikiene, Dalia; Mikalauskiene, Asta; Barakauskaite-Jakubauskiene, Neringa] Vinius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania",,"Streimikiene, D (通讯作者)，Vinius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Muitines G 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",dalia@mail.lei.lt; astam@mail.lei.lt; neringa.barakauskaite@khf.vu.lt,"Streimikiene, Dalia/AAF-2180-2020; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020","Streimikiene, Dalia/0000-0002-3247-9912;",,,,,36,22,22,1,19,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Charts sometimes indicate out of control conditions that are in fact in control. This leads to wrong conclusions when a process participating in production is examined. Therefore it is important that the charts used provide as less false alarms as possible. We propose Control Charts using Non Asymptotic Fuzzy Estimators (NAFE). In standard Control Charts, control limits and observations are taken as crisp numbers while in NAFE charts, limits and observations are non asymptotic fuzzy estimators. In standard charts, if a sample exceeds a limit by 0,001 it is an out of control condition. In NAFE Charts, the ratio of exceeding a control limit is taken into account which results to a smaller false alarm rate. Quality assessors, policy makers and practitioners have a new tool for evaluating whether a process has achieved its initial goals. NAFE can also be used in short run cases were the false alarm rate is critical for the evaluation. Production manager can decide if the sample is out of control, judging by how strict quality control is necessary to be according to each procedure case. Charts that lead to more trustable conclusions are produced with economical benefits to organizations and companies. Reliable control charts with small false alarm rate decrease delays in production and great cost of money.","[Tsiliki, P.

We argue that those factors in SMEs are mainly shaped by leaders, often owners-managers of the firms. There is much evidence that leadership style (especially transformational one) has strong impact on performance (eg. Lim & Ployhart, 2004) therefore we decided to extend the model of positive traits with hope, optimism and transformational leadership (idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration). Based on the feedback we received on our prior work we take a slightly different perspective of high performance. Instead of measuring performance using arbitrary measures we use KPIs to evaluate if the firm is successful against performance expectations (performance-to-plan). That approach requires qualitative research as we want to investigate the extent to which KPIs are used and the set of KPIs varies among firms, along with their importance and constant monitoring by owner-manager. We closely examine small group of gazelles (profitable, high growing SMEs with good reputation) focusing on relationships between positive traits and cultural factors, use of KPIs and performance. The qualitative methods are supported with data envelopment analysis (DEA). As the previous research shows there is high level of positive traits among leaders in high performing SMEs. There are however some differences in positive traits, transformational style dimensions and shared values, so there is not one size fits all pattern of high performance leader. The use of KPIs is rather low and informal, performance is mostly measured using key results indicators. The study has implications for research (more insight into high performing SMEs), business practice (best practice of behaviours and use of KPIs) and educators (focusing attention on crucial behaviours and shared values). The study adds to understanding high performance of SMEs, especially its antecedents in positive traits and use of KPIs. It merges well-established theories and notions (such as transformational leadership and KPIs) with new approaches (such as positive organisational scholarship (POS) and high performance organisation (HPO)).","[Zbierowski, Przemyslaw; Bratnicki, Mariusz] Univ Econ Katowice, Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,,przemek@zbierowski.com,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,31,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,891,898,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800107,0

This paper examines effects of removing physical barriers according to current Swedish governmental accessibility directives on older peoples' perceptions of outdoor environments (usability) and on their mobility and perceived safety as pedestrians. This paper also focuses on municipal planners' views on the implementation of improved accessibility. A before-after study, using both qualitative and quantitative methods, is conducted. The results from the questionnaires show that older peoples' overall satisfaction with the outdoor environment has increased after implementation: however no differences are found if physical barriers specifically are considered. Older peoples' mobility is also unchanged; nevertheless, fewer respondents are stating difficulties in walking due to barriers in the outdoor environments as reason to avoid outdoor mobility. Problems do remain after implementation, for example concerning safety/security-related issues and inaccessible entrances and indoor environments. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A cohort of everyday cyclists was supplied with a global positioning system device and a heart rate monitor and asked to collect data from their journeys in Leeds, UK. The analysis determines the cyclists' speeds and accelerations at every point on their journey and elevation data, corroborated by mapping information, was used to determine the gradient. Two linear regression models of speed and acceleration were estimated and show that the influence of a downhill gradient on speed is less pronounced than the effect of an uphill gradient. The results indicate an eighty-fifth percentile speed on the flat of 22 kph, and for a downhill gradient of 3%, 25 kph. The power required to cycle has been estimated and shows that cyclists deliver around 150 Won the flat, but that this rises to around 250 W climbing hills. Mean acceleration on the flat is 0.231 m/s(2) and the average power output over the acceleration phase, which is of mean duration 26 s, is approximately 120 W. Air resistance accounts for approximately 70% of the resistive force when cycling at design speed. It is recommended that designers adopt 25 kph as a design speed for gradients less than 3%, but that consideration should be given to design speeds of up to 35 kph for steeper gradients. Free-flow speeds in this range should be used when modelling mode and route choices and in benefit appraisal. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that this approach provides explanations for a number of empirical findings concerning real-world new- and used-car markets, including that leasing has become more popular over time, very high income new- car drivers lease more, and used cars that were leased when new sell for more than used cars that were purchased when new.

I suggest that the crowding-out effect increases the cost to society of organizing the provision of collective goods and argue in favor of designing selective incentives that mitigate this effect.","Univ Girona, Dept Econ, Girona 17071, Spain",Universitat de Girona,"Kyriacou, AP (通讯作者)，Univ Girona, Dept Econ, Girona 17071, Spain.",andreas.kyriacou@udg.es,"Kyriacou, Andreas/G-8973-2015","Kyriacou, Andreas/0000-0001-9571-2833",,,,,40,10,19,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The operational experiences in the initial stage for equivalent systems in Japan, France, Germany, and elsewhere are introduced herein. This study first presents Taiwan's HSR system development and conducts an ex post cost-benefit analysis of this transportation system. Second, unsatisfied ridership is examined to look for possible solutions to increase it. Third, the paper examines the impact of HSR on the intercity transportation market. Finally, the integration between HSR and various existing transportation modes is discussed. Several policy suggestions are included, which are useful for the decision makers of transportation systems' entrepreneurs, the central government, and the local authorities to derive a comprehensive post-HSR planning strategy for a more integrated transportation system.

The case study was Bogota's Transmilenio (Colombia). This research conducted a city-wide econometric hedonic analysis with 2000 to 2004 Department of Housing Control data across different walking distances, subsystems (trunk, feeder), socio-economic strata and time. The main results showed that, with respect to the value of properties in relation to proximity, the housing market places value premiums on the properties in the immediate walking proximity of feeder lines. The analysis by socio-economic strata showed that middle-income properties were valued more if they fell closer to the system, while there were opposite results for low-income housing. Finally, analysis across time reflects slight average annual increases in property values correlated with the implementation of the system in two specific areas analyzed. Throughout the paper, the author acknowledges some of the challenges of using hedonic modeling for property value impact assessments and emphasizes that the interpretation of the results are case specific.

The hypotheses are based on supply-side factor endowment and economic geography, and demand-side level of economic development variables. The CEEC-14 agro-food specialization to the EU-15 is in bulk raw commodities at lower export price-quality compared to the other exporters to these markets. The CEEC-14 export price-quality competitiveness on the EU-15 markets is better in processed intermediates and consumer-ready food, but the export size is smaller and varies by the CEEC-14, implying structural problems and opportunities for transformations in the food processing businesses and marketing chain. The panel regression analysis confirms that the CEEC-14 agro-food quality differentiation on the EU-15 markets is explained by comparative advantages from the relative factor endowment.","[Bojnec, Stefan] Univ Primorska, Fac Management Koper, SI-6104 Koper, Slovenia; [Ferto, Imre] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, H-1112 Budapest, Hungary; [Ferto, Imre] Corvinus Univ Budapest, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary",University of Primorska; Hungarian Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies; Corvinus University Budapest,"Bojnec, S (通讯作者)，Univ Primorska, Fac Management Koper, Cankarjeva 5,Koper Pp 345, SI-6104 Koper, Slovenia.",stefan.bojnec@fm-kp.si; ferto@econ.core.hu,"Bojnec, Stefan/AFG-8313-2022; Ferto, Imre/GPS-7523-2022; Fertő, Imre/AAQ-4634-2021; Ferto, Imre/A-7371-2009","Bojnec, Stefan/0000-0002-1270-6372; Ferto, Imre/0000-0002-3742-5964",,,,,38,5,5,0,8,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Building upon our previous work on forecasting the French Front National's vote across time, we construct a comparable model for three other European countries - Austria, Denmark and Norway - with significant RRPs, using economic, cultural and political predictors. We find that the model performs surprisingly well, with the partial exception of Norway, and provides an accurate forecast of RRP electoral performance which improves upon naive endogenous models and, significantly, upon polling estimates. Moreover, the model is firmly rooted in existing explanations of RRP success, allowing a robust explanation not only of variation in these parties' votes, but also of less successful estimates in a small number of country-specific contexts. Overall, we find that standard approaches to electoral forecasting in fact offer a useful tool in the analysis of RRPs.

The amended French Forest Law of 2001 provides for schemes with a voluntary contract, in terms of which private forest owners are paid to maintain an open-access forest for nature-based recreational activities, which are largely public goods. The main objective of this paper is to analyze private forest landowners' commitment to free-access recreation services on their properties. We develop a framework to estimate their willingness-to-accept (WTA) values as a measure of the financial compensation that they expect in exchange of reduced forest amenity values due to a public recreation use management plan. Since forest holdings are permanently exposed to several types of risk, the willingness-to-accept measure is defined within a subjective expected utility modeling approach. Our empirical analysis draws on data from a contingent valuation design carried out in 2006 in the Landes district in France. The empirical distribution of the subjective probability of fire risk is deduced from the forest owners' perception of fire risks due to free recreation use. We then introduce our measurements of the fire risk as explanatory variables of the forest owners' financial compensation requirements. (C) 2010 Department of Forest Economics, SLU Umea Sweden.

This paper sheds light on the process of decentralisation of port related activities, a phenomenon that had already been conceptualised as port regionalization by NOTTEBOOM/ RODRIGUE (2005). This concept analyses the relocation of services or facilities out of core port areas and the emergence of wider network relations, in order to overcome negative externalities of agglomeration as a result of increased port competition and related concentration effects. Here it is applied in the case of Antwerp/Belgium, the second largest port in Europe based on commodity-throughput. Antwerp represents a particular case in this respect, since it deploys the issue of concentration versus de-concentration quite significantly. It also has a strong tradition as a concentrated mainport based on maritime services, industry and logistics. The paper follows different perspectives on this issue, i.e. a port- and a hinterland-related view. It contends that the port of Antwerp is seeking to improve the spatial development conditions and to maintain its competitive position by pursuing a strategy of moderate rather than excessive regionalization.","Univ Luxembourg, Geog & Spatial Planning Res Ctr Urban Studies Etu, L-7201 Walferdange, Luxembourg",University of Luxembourg,"Hesse, M (通讯作者)，Univ Luxembourg, Geog & Spatial Planning Res Ctr Urban Studies Etu, Campus Walferdange,BP 2, L-7201 Walferdange, Luxembourg.",markus.hesse@uni.lu,,,,,,,49,2,2,5,27,BUCHENVERLAG,BAD SODEN,"POSTFACH 1128, BAD SODEN, 65796, GERMANY",0044-3751,,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

Discussions on the future of the Dutch countryside in general and a designated National Landscape north of Amsterdam in particular illustrate how the term rural vitality, depending on the discourse, is used to either support or oppose residential development. As in the region studied, the utilitarian discourse is increasingly important and its consequences - residential development in a highly valued landscape - are most controversial, we chose to evaluate its validity. This quantitative evaluation makes use of a geographical information system (GIS) and highly detailed spatial data. The results show no clear relationship between the construction of houses and different indicators of rural vitality such as employment and facility levels.

The empirical research methodology is based on mixed strategy of approaching organizations (employees), which means that the quantitative (factor analysis, cluster analysis, correlation, regression, descriptive statistics and frequency distributions) and qualitative parts (in-depth interviews analysis) of research were conducted simultaneously. The results of the research indicate that there are in fact two groups of older employees, which can be referred to as susceptible and insusceptible in terms of how the employer can affect their decisions. The unsusceptible have already decided to retire as soon as possible and they cannot be influenced by any employer measure. On the other hand, the susceptible employees are sensitive to employers' measures aimed at prolonging their working lives. Besides, a regression analysis confirmed a statistically significant correlation between the inclination towards extending one's employment period and the susceptibility to the employer measures. It can thus be concluded that, through age management measures, an employer has an impact on an extended employment period of older employees. However, employers should be interested primarily in those employees who are inclined towards extending their working lives.","Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Dept Management & Org, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Znidarsic, J (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Dept Management & Org, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",jana.znidarsic@ef.uni-lj.si,,,,,,,80,6,6,1,18,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

It found that banks are currently using an integrated approach combining personal and remote interaction and emphasising the promotion of financial literacy.

Duty of care is smuggled into strict liability hidden under the scope of liability requirement (traditionally called proximate causation). As far as the scope of liability requirement is common to negligence and to many forms of strict liability, there is a fairly large common ground to both liability rules, and consequently the marginal Hand formula is applied to both rules. Indeed, under a negligence rule, the marginal Hand formula is applied twice: first to assess whether or not the defendant did breach his or her duty of care, and, second, to delimit whether or not the defendant's behavior was a proximate cause of the harm suffered by the victim. However, under a strict liability rule, the Hand formula is applied only once when the proximate causation question is raised. Traditional law and economics analysis has almost always taken the normative question raised by the causation requirement as given, which is a potential major problem due to the importance of scope of liability or proximate causation in legal practice. Defining the scope of liability, that is to say, the boundaries of the pool of potential defendants, is the basic legal policy decision for each and every liability rule. In the normative model presented in this paper, the government first chooses efficient scope of liability, and given the scope of liability, the government then decides the liability rule and damages that guarantee efficient precaution. In the article, most known scope of liability rationales developed by both common law and civil law systems are discussed in order to show the substantial common ground between negligence and strict liability.","[Salvador-Coderch, Pablo; Gomez-Ligueerre, Carlos] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Dret, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Garoupa, Nuno] Univ Illinois, Coll Law, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",Pompeu Fabra University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Gómez-Ligüerre, C (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Dret, Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain.",pablo.salvador@upf.edu; ngaroupa@law.uiuc.edu; carlos.gomez@upf.edu,"Gomez-Liguerre, Carlos/M-5501-2013; Salvador-Coderch, Pablo/J-8573-2016; Gómez-Ligüerre, Carlos/AAU-9260-2020","Gomez-Liguerre, Carlos/0000-0002-0595-2444; Salvador-Coderch, Pablo/0000-0001-8250-4867; Gómez-Ligüerre, Carlos/0000-0002-0595-2444",,,,,51,5,6,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

There is ample evidence in the body of Smith's work to support the thesis that Smith would support public policies that might ensure the achievement of a living wage. The argument rests, in part, on the conclusion that Smith had reservations concerning the ability of the economy to experience sufficient growth and the ability of growth, if achieved, to secure living wages. This article argues that, given Smith's views about justice and given Smith's ideas, as part of the Scottish Enlightenment, of how the rules of justice evolve, a living wage law could be one of the general rules of which Smith could approve.","[Clary, Betsy Jane] Coll Charleston, Sch Business & Econ, Honors Program, Charleston, SC 29401 USA",College of Charleston,"Clary, BJ (通讯作者)，Coll Charleston, Sch Business & Econ, Honors Program, Charleston, SC 29401 USA.",,,,,,,,22,15,18,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Our study explores one consequence of this formula, the effect of social comparison for wage acceptance, in multilateral ultimatum games. The results of our laboratory experiments indicate that the availability of information concerning ultimatum offers to other responders influences acceptance behavior even if responders have differing Outside options. Particularly, behavior is only partly influenced by self-regarding social comparison: that is, the probability of acceptance decreases significantly for offers that put responders at a substantial disadvantage compared with others. On the contrary, responders are also partly concerned about unfavorable discrimination against others. However, we find that in Our setting, i.e. in a setting where the wage offer relation is endogenously chosen, a slightly unequal relation maximizes the joint acceptance frequency for both responders.

In Western Europe, this experience gave birth to a new class that gradually improved its trade ability and expanding industries and markets under a capitalist system. The Ottoman imperial policy was mostly concerned about the continuity of strong central authority and land expansion, which never meant improving the industry or trade concerns. Instead, the economic policies of the Ottomans were subsistence of the people, provisioning the major population centers, collection of taxes, and maintaining freedom of trade. The balance and stability in society explain the priority for the Ottomans in the economy. However, commercialization and profit explain the priority for the Dutch nation in the economy.

The programs reviewed are the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) in the United States, the Framework Program in the European Union (EU), technology development programs in Japan, and industrial technology development programs in Korea. The evaluation of the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology Evaluation and Planning (ITEP) mainly focuses on the economic effects of the project, therefore detailed information on commercialization such as sales volume, cost reduction, increase in market share, costs of commercialization, changes in price, changes in demand, causes of suspended commercialization, and employment effects is required. ATP's Performance Report is interested not only in commercialization but also in creation and dissemination of knowledge. The performance report in EU measures three dimensions of performance: the achievement of goals, the outputs and outcomes, and the macro impacts of the research projects. The evaluation in Japan, both in project and in program, balances between the achievement of national policy goals and the economic effects. The results suggest that qualitative evaluation factors indicating creation and dissemination of knowledge and the macro impacts of the research projects/programs should be considered in the evaluation system of ITEP. In conclusion, R&D performance evaluation system is necessary to measure the achievement of goals, outputs, outcomes, and impacts using a multidimensional performance indicator.

Policy design therefore assumes an understanding of the relationship between property and human nature, a matter of great interest to John Locke. Locke's teaching, however, is far from clear, often composed of a set of dual arguments. Yet close attention to the dualistic arguments is revealing: the two objects Locke associates with property-life and convenience-correspond to the two bases upon which he grounds the right to property: labor and consent. His argument reflects the changing economic nature of property, and also provides insight into the poles within which people behave according to the Law of Nature. Thus, a full explication of the relationship between Locke's Law of Nature and doctrine of property illuminates the economic and ethical principles that ought to inform policymakers and analysts.","Coll Holy Cross, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",College of the Holy Cross,"Reno, BJ (通讯作者)，Coll Holy Cross, 1 Coll St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",jreno@holycross.edu,,,,,,,23,3,3,0,13,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

This paper analyzes the globalization process, emphasizing its relationship with human development; to do so, bibliographical and statistical information were reviewed in order to discuss the nature of both concepts and their current and future trends. As a result, the paper explains how trends in the globalization process could stimulate deeper inequalities in the level of human development in countries if it continues to be based on a neoliberal ideological support and a capitalistic, consumption-based, predatory, excluding and short-term development model. Conclusions are that as long as the current scheme of capitalist reproduction on a global scale persists, the globalization process will tend to favour a small group of highly developed countries to the detriment of most people in the planet, making it difficult to overcome human development challenges.","[Romero, Alberto; Vera Colina, Mary A.] Univ Zulia, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela",,"Romero, A (通讯作者)，Univ Zulia, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela.",alromer@gmail.com; maryvera@cantv.net,"Vera-Colina, Mary/AAY-7613-2020",,,,,,20,1,1,0,4,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

Accurate forecasts of health care expenditure are therefore important for both policy makers and industrial practitioners. Extending a branch of the macroeconomics literature that examines the role of asset prices as useful predictors of major macro variables (such as consumption, output growth and inflation), this study investigates whether the current equity market captures useful information on the growth of future health care expenditure. We focus on short-run (one-year) predictability. The preliminary evidence based on US data shows that industry-specific stock returns have some predictive power for personal health care expenditure and its major components (hospital care, durable medical equipment and prescription drugs). Nevertheless, the significance of the improvement in forecasting accuracy depends on the estimation scheme and whether parameter inconstancy is accounted for.

Monte Carlo experiments show the desirable finite sample size and the power of the test with an exact maximum likelihood estimator of the long memory parameter. Simulations also show that a model selection strategy is available to discriminate between the competing threshold ARFIMA models. The methodology is applied to US unemployment rate data, where we find a significant threshold effect in the ARFIMA representation, and a better forecasting performance relative to TAR and symmetric ARFIMA models.

Response data from Such questions are typically treated as ordinal. since the response scale is based on rank-ordered verbal expressions. Their probabilistic nature in combination with a review of empirical Survey results suggest, however, that WTP response data based on verbal expressions Of uncertainty reflect an underlying unmeasured variable at the ratio scale level. The implications were empirically analysed using data From a recent contingent valuation Study on forest land protection for biodiversity Purposes. The verbal response categories to the MBDC (WTP) question were recoded as probabilities. The effects of different probability recodings were analysed when the distribution Of uncertain WTP was assumed to be known. Taking uncertainty into account by means of the underlying probability of acceptance will make contingent Valuation results more meaningful and transparent for both analysts and users.

Based on an empirical investigation of the benefits of interaction with universities, this paper proposes an analytical framework and four ideal types of strategy for localised collaboration between RD subsidiaries and universities. This taxonomy, which largely transcends industry sectors, and the illustrative cases presented in this paper provide insights into the potential scope for localised university-industry interaction from the perspective of multinational enterprises. By connecting the empirical results to the question whether these benefits are significant enough to enhance a region's attractiveness as a location for RD, we are able to develop a better understanding of the alternative strategies for policymakers and university leaders interested in stimulating such linkages.","[Brostrom, Anders] Royal Inst Technol, Ctr Excellence Sci & Innovat Studies, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [McKelvey, Maureen] Gothenburg Univ, Sch Business Law & Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Sandstrom, Christian] Chalmers Univ Technol, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology; University of Gothenburg; Chalmers University of Technology,"Broström, A (通讯作者)，Royal Inst Technol, Ctr Excellence Sci & Innovat Studies, Drottning Kristinas Vag 30, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",andbr@infra.kth.se,"Broström, Anders/P-4580-2019; Broström, Anders/K-5109-2012","Broström, Anders/0000-0003-0820-2769; Broström, Anders/0000-0003-0820-2769; Sandstrom, Christian/0000-0002-8625-8744",,,,,49,17,20,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Due to its extent, the breadth of activities involved and interconnection with Mafia structures, this system is relatively specific and plays a significant role within the labour migration environment. With respect to the fact that the middlemen and the migrant workers are mostly from Ukraine, we regard the entire system as a type of ethnic economy. This system has two hierarchic levels, the first of which deals with the procurement of irregular migrant labour. The second level is based on the relations between middlemen and organised crime. The paper tries to explain the causes for the establishment of the middleman system of labour organisation, to describe its operation, and the roles and mutual links among individual actors.","[Cermakova, Dita] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Social Geog & Reg Dev, Prague, Czech Republic; [Nekorjak, Michal] Masaryk Univ, Fac Social Studies, Inst Res Reprod & Integrat, Brno, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Masaryk University Brno,"Cermáková, D (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Social Geog & Reg Dev, Prague, Czech Republic.",dita.cermakova@seznam.cz; nekorjak@fss.muni.cz,,"Cermakova, Dita/0000-0001-9545-5048","Charles University Science Foundation [G/GEO/254/2005]; Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs [MSM0021622408, 1J 057/05-DP1]",Charles University Science Foundation; Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs,We are grateful to Evert-Jan Visser and two anonymous referees for comments and criticism on earlier drafts of this paper.

It is suggested that a relatively small number of firms have shifted to a new institutional context consisting of common international institutions and practices, while the large majority of firms continue to operate in a more slowly evolving set of domestic institutions or rules. Examining changes since the early 1990s in firm financing and corporate governance, the article finds preliminary evidence to support the thesis of increasing diversity, but also that national patterns of firm finance are still distinct. Rising diversity challenges the long-term viability of coordinated market economies in Europe.","Temple Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Deeg, R (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Gladfelter Hall,Room 409,1115 W Berks St, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",rdeeg@temple.edu,,,,,,,53,52,56,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Expectations and quality perceptions mainly related to the timeliness of forecasts, the provision of a clear justifiable rationale and accuracy. Cost was less important. Forecasts were frequently adjusted when they lacked a justifiable explanation, when the user felt they could integrate their knowledge into the forecast, or where the user perceived a need to take responsibility for the forecast. Forecasts were less frequently adjusted when they came from a well-known source and were based on sound explanations and assumptions. The presence of feedback on accuracy reduced the influence of these factors. The seniority and experience of users had little effect on their attitudes or propensity to make adjustments.

Through the research done on this subject, it has been identified that online learning can assist in complementing studies when coupled with face-to-face learning.

A working definition of reliable function transfer is Put forward, and a suitable statistical test is provided. A novel split sample method is used to test the sensitivity of the models' log-likelihood values to the removal of contingent valuation (CV) responses collected at individual forest sites, We find that a stable function improves Our measure of transfer reliability, but not by much. We conclude that, in empirical Studies on transferability, considerations of function stability are secondary to the availability and quality of site attribute data. Modellers' can study the advantages of transfer function stability vis-a-vis the value of additional information on recreation site attributes. (c) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

Some scholars believe that in our globalising world, local communities and the neighbourhood in general lost their significance, while others argue that the role of community and neighbourhood contacts is still important. These divergent opinions are mainly due to the absence of comparative empirical studies, which require longitudinal data on neighbourhood contacts. Based on unique and rich panel data on the role of neighbours in the personal networks of inhabitants of 161 Dutch neighbourhoods, we analyse whether neighbourhood contacts and their implications have changed over a 10 year period. We find that neighbourhood relationships have become more important in informal personal networks. This implies paying a visit and helping each other out with odd jobs, but at the same time contact frequency and trust declined in neighbour relationships. For elderly, highly educated residents, home-owners, non-movers and people with initially small local networks, the size of neighbour networks increased substantially, suggesting that at least for these groups, the 'community saved' perspective holds.","[Mollenhorst, Gerald; Voelker, Beate] Univ Utrecht, Dept Sociol, ISCS, Interuniv Ctr Social Sci Theory & Methodol, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Schutjens, Veronique] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Utrecht University,"Mollenhorst, G (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Dept Sociol, ISCS, Interuniv Ctr Social Sci Theory & Methodol, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",g.w.mollenhorst@uu.nl; b.volker@uu.nl; v.schutjens@geo.uu.nl,"Volker, Beate/E-7992-2013",,,,,,31,16,16,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

A question of whether to get involved and how to best shape their involvement in online business represents a key strategic decision for many internationalizing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Focusing on the dynamics of online growth, the study is concerned with the question of how firm capabilities affect international performance. In contrast to existing studies on e-commerce and internationalization, the focus is not on Internet new ventures but on established firms which have developed e-capabilities in the context of their conventional business operations. Considering firms' international capabilities and e-capabilities and using a sample of 603 UK SMEs, the chapter analyses conditions that accompany dynamic online growth. Building on the capabilities perspective, the study examines how complementary capabilities in internationalization and e-commerce, together with external knowledge sources and intentional efforts on the part of the firm, affect online growth. The results show that whilst some capabilities stimulate online growth, others have detrimental effects. E-capabilities directed at building relations are most strongly associated with growth. The findings have important implications for policy and practice.","[Morgan-Thomas, Anna] Univ Glasgow, CIER, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,,,,"Morgan-Thomas, Anna/0000-0002-2228-6463",,,,,0,0,0,0,10,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"GLENSANDA HOUSE, MONTPELLIER PARADE, CHELTENHAM GL50 1UA, GLOS, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84720-830-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,123,138,,,,,,16,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BSP51,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285291900010,0

Those factors constitute the basic elements of human capital. Mutual dependency of these factors results in the need of proper management of planning, organisation and motivation as well as of controlling human capital. Business practice confirms the need of developing basic organisational features that would result in creating a unique corporate image. It turns out that an individual character of a company facilitates its winning competitive advantage. Shaping the basic variables in corporate resources enables one to identify technical, organisational, economic and social features. Creating an individual character of a company on the basis of primary material resources rarely brings the desired effect. The material character of technical, organisational and economic resources is a feature that may be easily copied by competitors.

Firms seeking competitive advantage are often advised to develop capabilities. The resource based view of the firm (Wernerfelt 1984 p. 17 1) places a great. emphasis on competing on capabilities, both tangible and intangible (Hall 1993). To achieve competitive advantage, businesses must develop capabilities (Prahalad and Hammel, 1990). Capabilities have been defined as: Complex bundles of skills and collective learning, exercised through organisational processes that ensure coordination of functional activities. (Day 1994, p.38) This study investigates the influence of entrepreneurial orientation of the small technology firms on firm performance. About Eight hundred small technology firms were contacted from a list of Berlin chamber of commerce. With a data set of 143, Structural Equation Modelling was carried out to test the impact of entrepreneurial orientation on Firm Performance. Moreover the impact of Environment Turbulence (Market Turbulence and Technology Turbulence) on Entrepreneurial Orientation and the moderation effect of Environmental Turbulence on Firm Performance were tested. In this empirical study EO was found to significantly influence the Firm Performance. Environmental Turbulence was also found to be having a positive relationship with EO However the moderating impact of Environmental Turbulence was not found to be significant. This study has important implications for both the researchers as well as the practitioners. It highlights the necessity of firms to develop a high degree of EO in the firm as a way of achieving high performance.","[Qureshi, Shahid] TU Berlin, Fac Business Adm, Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin,,shahid@marketing-trommsdorff.de; hongqing.sun@marketing-trommsdorff.de; feitairan@163.com,"de Lima, Andréia/G-8040-2014",,,,,,37,1,1,1,9,CHINA WATERPOWER PRESS-CWPP,BEIJING,"6 SANLIHELU, FUXINGMENWAI, BEIJING, 100044, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5084-6533-3,,,,2009,,,,,,,64,70,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BNO72,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275143800008,0

They consisted of members of the public, political scientists, journalists writing about domestic politics in Swedish daily newspapers, and journalists who were editing sections of readers' letters in daily newspapers. They estimated, using a 12-step category scale, which percentage of the votes that they believed seven parties would get in the election. Data were then obtained on the outcome of the election, and on the two opinions polls closest in time to it. When median forecasts were compared across groups, it was found that the group from the public was most successful in forecasting the outcome of the election. This was in spite of the fact that the median error made by individual members of that group was about 50% larger than the median error made by members of other groups. The two polls were less efficient than the group from the public and overestimated the span between the incumbent government and the opposition by a factor of 2. The members of the public and journalists showed some wishful thinking in their forecasts. There were large and consistent individual differences in forecasting ability. Men performed better than women, as did those who expressed more interest and knowledge in politics.

Virtual systematic learning where teaching/learning takes place only in distance form exists only in few Lithuanian secondary schools. The study of one case contributed to identifying that the respondents mostly used asynchronous tools, which were more meant to handle information, to evaluate knowledge, to observe the process of learning. The tool of forum as well as conversations in real time, video or audio conferences is not very often used. As group work takes place only in virtual environment and is not formally defined, pupils faced difficulties in identifying their roles in a group, to make common decisions and to understand the importance of a group goal. Main reasons why pupils do not participate in groups could be such that they like working individually, they are occupied enough, thus stronger motivation as well as teachers' encouragement to work together is necessary. The results of surveys show that pupils seldom use synchronous tools. Pupils are not subject to cooperate with each other, their individual benefit, their individual learning is more important for them. It could be explained so that teachers seldom form formal groups of virtual learning environment. When learning in a group pupils care for their own creativity, individual learning, experience acquired by learning in a group. Pupils most positively evaluated feedback of synchronous tools, flexibility of asynchronous tools, possibilities of reflection. Thus, when applying different tools of virtual learning environment, they should be more effectively and purposively exploited in order to induce deeper processes of learning.","[Stankeviciene, Nida; Augustiniene, Aldona] Kaunas Univ Technol, Inst Educ Studies, Fac Social Sci, Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,,Nida.Stankeviciene@ktu.lt; minija@mail.lt,"Augustinienė, Aldona/AGR-1794-2022",,,,,,33,0,0,0,0,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,KAUNAS,"K DONELAICIO 73, KAUNAS LT 3006, LITHUANIA",1822-7090,,,CHANGE SOC BUS ENV,,,2009,,,,,,,403,410,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTW62,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288290300061,0

While the important role of networks in the business development of firms is accepted as common wisdom, the author cautions against the tendency to interpret networks as 'a natural given' to firms and as universally beneficial to their business development. Through a study on the role of personal networks in the foreign development of smaller firms in the Chinese context, a gap between the commonly presumed and the actual effects of networks on internationalization is revealed and the limitations of personal networks in supporting the foreign business development of firms are illustrated. The chapter highlights the need to move from a one-size-fits-all analysis of networks to one that accounts for specific contextual conditions. Accordingly, a behavioural approach that puts emphasis on the active influence of a firm on its networking behaviour, and regards the effects of networks as the firm's behavioural outcomes, is proposed. This approach contributes to enhancing the explanation and prediction of variations of network effects on firms, and providing concrete practical implications regarding a firm's deliberate networking efforts in achieving internationalization.","[Tang, Yee Kwan] Univ Glasgow, CIER, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,,,,,,,,,0,5,5,0,3,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"GLENSANDA HOUSE, MONTPELLIER PARADE, CHELTENHAM GL50 1UA, GLOS, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84720-830-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,106,122,,,,,,17,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BSP51,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285291900009,0

Certainly, as an activity it occupies a vast majority of a manager's time, and thus any increase in a manager's effectiveness or skill as a communicator should contribute directly or indirectly to improved organizational performance. All the manager's functions involve communication. Assertiveness is a way of making sure your needs are met while still considering the needs of others. If you suffer from social anxiety disorder (SAD - social anxiety disorder), communicating assertively may seem uncomfortable at first. Chances are that you have adopted a passive communication style that enables you to avoid conflict but leaves you feeling anxious, depressed and helpless, and causes frustration and discomfort to those around you. Learning to communicate assertively is not selfish, but rather an effective way of negotiating social encounters. You may have misconceptions about what it means to be assertive. People who communicate assertively are not obnoxious. They do not step on the feelings of others to get what they want, as is the case with aggressive communication. Instead, assertive communication involves expressing your feelings, needs and desires in a nonjudgmental and nonthreatening way. Communication style are passive, aggressive or assertive. Assertiveness is the best style for nurse managers and the one they should foster in their personnel. However, there are barriers that nurses must overcome to become assertive. The most pervasive barrier is female gender role socialization. Whereas men are characterized as aggressive, competitive, independent, objective, analytical, task oriented, confident, self-disciplined and emotionally controlled, women are expected to be passive, dependent, subjective, intuitive, empathetic, sensitive, interpersonally oriented, weak, inconsistent and emotionally unstable.","[Todarita, Elida-Tomita] Romanogermana Univ, Sibiu, Romania",,,elida_todarita@yahoo.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,11,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,291,297,,,,,,7,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS70,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287984000047,0

The private sector is increasingly involved in these redevelopment projects. This paper visualises to what extent private-sector involvement affects redeveloped public spaces. Six-dimensional diagrams are set up as an analytical tool that enables the comparison of public spaces on a number of criteria. Eight squares are examined in the city centres of Rotterdam, Dordrecht, Enschede and 's-Hertogenbosch. Four are solely redeveloped by the local government; the other four are the result of public-private partnership. The diagrams show that the private sector mainly participates in the redevelopment of retail squares, but its involvement does not result in more fear or fantasy in public space.","Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"van Melik, R (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, POB 80115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",r.vanmelik@geo.uu.nl,,,,,,,16,3,3,1,12,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0040-747X,,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Over this period the Caesarean section rate for singleton births in Ireland increased by over one quarter. Using data from the Irish National Perinatal Reporting System and the Hospital In-Patient Enquiry scheme we examine the contribution of maternal, delivery and clinical characteristics to the rise in the Caesarean section rate over the period. Analyses show small increases in the clinical indicators of risk for Caesarean section driven by significant change in maternal characteristics (age of mothers and number of previous deliveries) and possible changes in obstetric practice. Grouped logit models of risk of Caesarean by hospital and time period account for 55 per cent of the variation in the growth trend across hospitals. We discuss the possible contribution of changes in obstetric practice.","[Brick, Aoife; Layte, Richard] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin 2, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"Brick, A (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Whitaker Sq, Dublin 2, Ireland.",aoife.brick@esri.ie,,"Brick, Aoife/0000-0002-5046-8336; Layte, Richard/0000-0002-3170-767X",,,,,47,14,14,0,11,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

S. Department of Justice over the period from 1958 to 2002. The key findings are: (1) a distinct regime shift in antitrust enforcement during the 1970s and, post-regime shift, there has been a marked compositional change with a quantitatively large increase (decrease) in criminal (civil) antitrust court cases initiated; (2) post-regime shift, there appears to be a change in the role played by politics with Republicans initiating more (less) criminal (civil) court cases than Democrats, and the estimated quantitative effects are large; (3) disaggregating the total number of court cases into the main categories under which they are initiated (price-fixing, mergers, monopolization, and restraints-of-trade) shows that individual types of cases have widely differing responses to changes in the driving forces; and (4) in a horserace between the regime-shift and political effects on one side and the remaining variables on the other, the former forces win hands-down in explaining broad shifts in enforcement. Modeling the longer-run shift and disaggregating the court cases emerge as crucial to gaining insights into the intertemporal shifts in enforcement. The article elaborates on the causes for the shift in enforcement and on the effectiveness of antitrust.","[Ghosal, Vivek] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Econ, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Ghosal, Vivek] CESifo, Munich, Germany",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Ifo Institut,"Ghosal, V (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Econ, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",vivek.ghosal@econ.gatech.edu,,,,,,,76,20,22,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

The results of a cross-sectional survey and structural equation modelling indicate that (a) transformational and transactional leadership had no direct effects on employees' creative behaviour (implying that the relationship between leadership and employee creativity should not be seen as straightforwardly causal); (b) transformational leadership worked through employees' work motivation to ultimately influence their creative behaviour; and (c) transformational and transactional leadership had indirect positive effects on employees' creative behaviour through job satisfaction.

Against the orthodox view, Donald Davidson (1986, 2004) argues that the interpersonal comparability of preferences is a necessary condition for the correct interpretation of other people's behaviour. In this paper I claim that, as originally stated, Davidson's argument does not succeed because it is vulnerable to several objections, including Barry Stroud's (1968) objection against all transcendental arguments of a 'strong' kind. However, I argue that Davidson's strategy can still achieve results of anti-sceptical significance. If we reformulate Davidson's argument as a 'modest' transcendental argument and if we embrace an 'internal' account of epistemic justification, it is in fact possible to have at least justified beliefs about how different people's preferences compare in terms of strength and about their interpersonal comparability.","Univ Quebec, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Rossi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",redsmau@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,5,5,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

Seventeen of the eighteen NRC panel members essentially concluded that the existing research was inadequate to conclude that RTC laws increased or decreased crime. The final member of the panel, though, concluded that the NRC's panel data regressions supported the conclusion that RTC laws decreased murder. We evaluate the NRC evidence and show that, unfortunately, the regression estimates presented in the report appear to be incorrect. We improve and expand on the report's county data analysis by analyzing an additional six years of county data as well as state panel data for the period 1977-2006. While we have considerable sympathy with the NRC's majority view about the difficulty of drawing conclusions from simple panel data models, we disagree with the NRC report's judgment that cluster adjustments to correct for serial correlation are not needed. Our randomization tests show that without such adjustments, the Type 1 error soars to 40-70%. In addition, the conclusion of the dissenting panel member that RTC laws reduce murder has no statistical support. Finally, our article highlights some important questions to consider when using panel data methods to resolve questions of law and policy effectiveness. Although we agree with the NRC's cautious conclusion regarding the effects of RTC laws, we buttress this conclusion by showing how sensitive the estimated impact of RTC laws is to different data periods, the use of state versus county data, particular specifications, and the decision to control for state trends. Overall, the most consistent, albeit not uniform, finding to emerge from both the state and the county panel data models conducted over the entire 1977-2006 period with and without state trends and using three different models is that aggravated assault rises when RTC laws are adopted. For every other crime category, there is little or no indication of any consistent RTC impact on crime. It will be worth exploring whether other methodological approaches and/or additional years of data will confirm the results of this panel data analysis.

Recent research in redefining the 'space' within which a choice model is estimated as WTP space, instead of preference-space, has offered encouraging evidence in reducing the range of behavioural implausibility. This paper develops models to compare the empirical evidence when a mixed logit model is estimated with unconstrained distributions on random parameters in WTP and preference space, taking into account scale and the correlation between the attributes. The findings suggest that the gap between the evidence in WTP and preference space narrows significantly when both scale and preference heterogeneity are identified.","[Hensher, David A.] Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Greene, William H.] NYU, Stern Sch Business, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA",University of Sydney; New York University,"Hensher, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",D.Hensher@itls.usyd.edu.au; wgreene@stern.nyu.edu,,"Hensher, David/0000-0003-0058-2242",,,,,18,64,69,0,10,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

The experiences in Stockholm, where a trial period with congestion charges changed the public opinion from negative to positive, support this hypothesis. Analysing acceptability and attitudes in Stockholm allows us to study a situation where the population is in fact familiar with congestion charges, and explore what the decisive factors for acceptability are in such a situation. By analysing a survey collected after the referendum and the subsequent reintroduction of the charges, we analyse the prerequisites to achieve acceptability given that the public is familiar with congestion charges. As expected, low car dependence and good transit supply are associated with high acceptability. But the two most important factors turn out to be beliefs about the charges' effectiveness, and general environmental attitudes. The importance of beliefs and perceptions of the effects of the charges underscores the importance of both careful system design and careful evaluation and results communication. The strong connection between environmental concerns and positive attitudes to congestion charges underscores the importance of considering and marketing the charges' environmental effects. In Stockholm, the politicians' decision to re-label the congestion charges to environmental charges and emphasising their positive effects on air quality may very well have had a positive impact on acceptability.

We investigate whether voluntary self-reporting can reliably indicate effective self-policing efforts that might provide opportunities for enforcement efficiencies. We find that regulators used self-reports of legal violations as a heuristic for identifying firms that are effectively policing their own operations, shifting enforcement resources away from those that voluntarily disclose. We also find that these firms that voluntarily disclosed regulatory violations and committed to self-policing improved their regulatory compliance and environmental performance, which suggests that the enforcement relief they received was warranted. Collectively, our results suggest that self-reporting can be a useful tool for reliably identifying and leveraging the voluntary self-policing efforts of regulated companies.","[Toffel, Michael W.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Short, Jodi L.] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Harvard University; Georgetown University,"Toffel, MW (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"; Toffel, Michael/G-2555-2011","Short, Jodi/0000-0002-0061-1966; Toffel, Michael/0000-0002-1224-9159",,,,,110,60,68,2,39,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Financial constraints should be more binding for cutting-edge R&D than for routine R&D. Using panel data we find that R&D spending of firms devoting a significant fraction of R&D to cutting-edge projects is curtailed by credit constraints while routine R&D investments are not.

Initially the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) is applied on the raw time series in order to estimate C.I of the forecasts. Then, the Bootstrap method is employed on the residuals generated by the preceded process. On the upper and lower limit of the estimated C.I., two new ANNs are employed in order to make point estimations (of the upper and lower limits) using of Object Oriented Programming. For the empirical analysis daily observations of the closing prices of Alpha Bank stocks have been used. The sample period is extended from 28/01/2004 until 30/11/2005. The nonstationarity of the time series employed in our study is not a forbidding condition for the estimation of the confidence intervals, in our case, since the level of bootstrap still provides a satisfactory approximation for the roots arbitrarily close to unity (Berkowitz, Kilian 1996).

Its recent, heavy colonization by the property paradigm has progressively elicited criticism from commentators who, for various reasons, believe that the market can play only a limited role in pursuing efficiency in the knowledge domain. The article agrees with the enounced thesis and tries to provide an explanation of it that relates to the fact that in specific circumstances property-rights can produce distinct market failures that affect the social cost and can consequently prevent attainment of social welfare. In particular, the arguments set forth here concern three distinct externalities that arise when enforcing a property rights system over knowledge. First, the existence of a property right may itself alter individual preferences and social norms, thus causing specific changes in individuals' behaviour. Second, the idiosyncratic nature of knowledge, as a collective and inherently indivisible entity, means that its full propertization can be expected to produce significant harm. Third, property rights can cause endogenous drifts in the market structure arising from the exclusive power granted to the right holder: though generally intended as a necessary mechanism for extracting a price from the consumer, in the knowledge domain property rights can become a device for extracting rents from the market.","Univ Piemonte Orientale, POLIS, Dept Publ Policy & Publ Choice, I-15100 Alessandria, Italy",University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro,"Ramello, GB (通讯作者)，Univ Piemonte Orientale, POLIS, Dept Publ Policy & Publ Choice, Via Cavour 84, I-15100 Alessandria, Italy.",giovanni.ramello@sp.unipmn.it,,,,,,,53,9,9,2,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

It also includes examples in order to better justify the ideas. The literature and the practice are very rich in examples of Decision Support Systems (DSS) and Business Intelligence products but they are rather considered complex applications made to interact over the Internet but not entirely running within the Internet. In order to arrive to this title we have also tested a few on-line products starting with simple office tools (Google docs - spreadsheets) or more specialized ones (Nesstar - analytics). And why this counts in this article? - Partially because when thinking of solvers and trend charts a spreadsheet may be considered a basic form of DSS. The main question is whether or not the on-line applications developers implement such functionalities in their products. Beyond the practical approach and the obvious criticism, the main idea of the paper is to make us realize the trend of many applications that serve decision making. The main implication of the trend-line mentioned in our article is related to the fact that in terms of technology any decision will become easier to be made when thinking of the mobile devices available nowadays. Thus the paper needs to be considered in relation with this topic. The main idea when speaking of originality is basically to show something previously not seen, not tested or not proved. In this case, the originality mostly consists in seeing beyond the traditional approaches of the decision support systems. The on-line category is one belonging to the places beyond these borders.","[Airinei, Dinu; Homocianu, Daniel; Necula, Sabina] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,,adinu@uaic.ro; dan.homocianu@gmail.com; sabina.mihalache@feaa.uaic.ro,"Homocianu, Daniel/S-2387-2019; Necula, Sabina/P-7113-2019","Necula, Sabina/0000-0001-6912-2450",,,,,3,0,0,0,13,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-2-3,,,,2011,,,,,,,249,252,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI18,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306939900063,0

Concurrently, organizations ought to improve their R&D capability for development and commercialization of new technologies, products and processes faster than their competitors. In a similar vein, in the contemporary management literature total quality management (TQM), emerges as a strategic weapon for the firms which has to be managed and implementation of which leads to a dynamic capability of the enterprises (Perdomo-Ortiz et al., 2009). Parallel to the calls made for organizations to become quality focused, organizations have also been urged by the researchers to become more innovative (Singh and Smith, 2004). Hence this study aims to develop a platform through which TQM and R&D capability complementarily influence innovation performance. Drawing on this framework the main purpose of this study is to evince the impact of R&D capability and TQM on innovation performance. Amid in this research agenda two partial gaps have been explored: First, although a robust relationship between TQM and innovation performance seems to be plausible in the literature, the gap embedded is the absence of a study examining the relationship of TQM and R&D capabilities. Second, little empirical evidence has so far been offered to support the positive relationship between these strategic weapons of the organization namely; TQM, R&D capability and innovation performance basing the argument on dynamic capabilities theory. In turn, this paper presents an empirical research which evaluates the co-alignment between TQM and R&D capability in enhancing the innovation performance of organizations. Consequently hypotheses are developed and tested via PLS analysis in which data are collected from 105 manufacturing firms in Turkey, and the findings are discussed.","[Akgun, Ali Ekber; Kocoglu, Ipek; Ince, Huseyin; Imamoglu, Salih Zeki; Keskin, Halit] Gebze Inst Technol, Kocaeli, Turkey",Gebze Technical University,,aakgun@gyte.edu.tr; ipekocoglu@su.sabanciuniv.edu; h.ince@gyte.edu.tr; imamoglu@gyte.edu.tr; keskin@gyte.edu.tr,"Akgün, Ali E./CAG-3791-2022; Ince, Huseyin/A-9132-2009; KESKIN, Halit/C-3103-2014","Akgün, Ali E./0000-0001-5922-3266; Ince, Huseyin/0000-0002-5953-6497; KESKIN, Halit/0000-0003-4432-3998",,,,,36,0,0,0,18,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,51,60,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800007,0

The recent development of the communication technology usage in the Middle East has lead to dramatic impact in tackling the challenges facing the entire region, especially amongst the growing young generations. The Sultanate of Oman, guided by a national plan with a long-term vision (i.e. Vision 2020), is aiming for capitalizing in ICT (Information Communication Technology) tools in order to foster research and innovation culture. Accordingly, the LINKING Oman Program (i.e. Linking International and National Knowledge for Innovation Generation in Oman) has been designed to encourage and facilitate the dialogue and collaboration between national and international stakeholders, fostering the innovation ecology in the country. Making use of the Communication for Mobilization theory (Bernardo Toro, 1996) and Information Communication Technologies, (in particular web 2.0 elements), the program was designed to promote an alliance between the technological and social efforts for innovation. What is more, it represents one of the key programs integrated within a governmental project (i.e The Innovation Hub) designed to provide a harmonized environment, with centrally shared resources for various innovation assistance programs in Oman. The importance of the program originates from the fact that all the minimum ingredients and requirements to initiate an innovation ecosystem in the country are in place, but a coherent national dialogue to make it happen is apparently missing. For instance, initial strategic studies showed that the proximity of the largest university to the largest Oman's Incubator, and industrial zones warrants the establishment of the best Science Park' in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, but the effective linkages for the necessary dialogue are not visible. In a nut-shell, the LINKING Oman program is capitalizing on the current available local infrastructure, the nationally approved innovation programs and a realistic organizational stakeholder's capacity, in order to make the most of the offered technological tools, which include collaborative platforms, virtual reality labs and mentoring facilities. It is expected that the social component of the dialogue will be activated by best practices in communication for mobilization plans.","[Al-Mukhaini, Abeer; Al-Mughairi, Mohammed] Res Council, Dev & Innovat Off, Muscat, Oman; [Sarayeddin, Luiza; Al-Farsi, Yaqoob] Informat & Technol Author, Muscat, Oman",,"Al-Mukhaini, A (通讯作者)，Res Council, Dev & Innovat Off, Muscat, Oman.",abeer.almukhaini@trc.gov.om; luiza.sarayeddin@trc.gov.om; yaqoob.alfarsi@ita.gov.om; mohammed.almughairi@trc.gov.om,"Farnese Sarayed-Din, Luiza/HNT-0219-2023",,,,,,4,0,0,0,14,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,61,67,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800008,0

A great deal of research also addressed work alienation in different research areas such as organizational leadership, organizational citizenship behavior, organizational commitment, and work experience and drinking behavior. However, any study couldn't be found examined the organizational injustice and work alienation relationship. This paper aims to measure the relationship between perceptions of organizational injustice and work alienation. Four dimensions of organizational injustice were examined: distributive, procedural, interpersonal, and informational injustice. For this study, two dimensions of work alienation namely powerlessness, and social isolation were addressed. Organizational injustice and work alienation relationship was examined among health care professions (doctors and nurses) in Turkey. Because health care sector has been one of the most important, and rapidly growing industry, and several complaints especially related with pay and working conditions have emerged in recent years among these professionals. It is hyphotesized that organizational injustice will cause work alienation and tested these relationships in a sample of 377 health care professionals from public and private hospitals in Istanbul. The results revealed that each of the organizational injustice dimensions were associated with work alienation dimensions. Distributive injustice had the weakest relationship with both powerlessness and social isolation. Procedural injustice was the strongest predictor of powerlessness, but the strongest predictor of social isolation was informational injustice. The theoretical and practical implications of this results were discussed below.","[Ceylan, Adnan] Gebze Inst High Technol GYTE, Dept Business Adm, Gebze, Kocaeli, Turkey; [Sulu, Seyfettin] Gebze Inst High Technol GYTE, Dept Business Adm, Pendik Istanbul, Turkey",Gebze Technical University,"Ceylan, A (通讯作者)，Gebze Inst High Technol GYTE, Dept Business Adm, POB 41400, Gebze, Kocaeli, Turkey.",aceylan@gyte.edu.tr; seyfettinsulu@hotmail.com,"ceylan, adnan/AAC-2969-2019",,,,,,60,22,28,3,72,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

This reflects on the contemporary living and building style by raising the level of comfort to a state in which human needs are perfectly satisfied, but with a very expensive cost. There is a vicious chain - work/time-money-comfort and a serious downside to it - nature's falling into constant degradation (global warming, high costs for natural materials, and little interest for nature maintenance). This article makes a parallel between what we already know about contemporary building/living style and the traditional way which implies great respect to nature and human basic qualities. Examples of traditional architecture have been preserved over time due to the natural qualities of the materials and ingenious fabrication methods that have been used. Studying vernacular morphology, structure, technique and materials, one can develop a new system, compatible with contemporary reality in many ways, but more human, by paying tribute to the principles and proportions of traditional buildings. The new constructions are intended to be technically more accessible, faster to build, cheaper, more ecological and strongly related to the existing environment.","[Cioca, Ciurileanu Gabriela Teodora; Horvath, Bucur Ildiko] Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania",Technical University of Cluj Napoca,,atelier_cadru@yahoo.com; ilbucurro@yahoo.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,3,TECHNICAL UNIV CLUJ-NAPOCA,CLUJ-NAPOCA,"28 MEMORANDUMULUI STREET, CLUJ-NAPOCA, 400114, ROMANIA",,,978-973-662-614-2,,,,2011,,,,,,,43,48,,,,,,6,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDA57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000312344600010,0

In spite of this, most maternity care is still organised through hospitals and obstetrician led teams. Some midwives and also some mothers have called for alternative models of care to be made available on the NHS. In an article in the British Medical Journal in 2009 (Symon et al, 2009), there is some evidence that holistic care led by an independent midwife can bring benefits to both mother and baby. On the other hand, some respondents to the article point to methodological flaws in the study. Others object to the whole process on the basis of increased risk if something should go wrong. Commissioners of health care services, shortly to change from the local Primary Care Trust to consortia of GPs are required to base decisions about which type of service to commission based upon the best possible evidence. However, all evidence comes with an associated degree of uncertainty. Therefore the authors set out to establish: center dot What is the most likely cost/benefit scenario for maternity services? center dot How can we model the uncertainty in the process? center dot How can we provide a tool to help commissioners arrive at the best possible evidence-based decision? This article provides an approach to supporting decision making about introducing an innovation based upon the best possible evidence which still contains significant uncertainty and a degree of risk to patients. It demonstrates how a decision support tool was developed to help commissioners decide whether to offer some mothers an alternative holistic service delivered by independent midwives, and to allow them to build in their own judgement as to the uncertainty associated with the evidence. It seeks to show that innovation in health care delivery, although it seeks to use the best possible evidence must acknowledge that the best possible evidence may not be decisive, and that decisions need to reflect that uncertainty.","[Gillies, Alan; Holbourn, Alison; Shawhan, Karen] Hope St Ctr, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",,,Alan.gillies@hopestreetcentre.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,3,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,362,367,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800045,0

This is the key to European Union economic competitiveness and is linked to its development of the Common Trade Policy. Given the fact that Romania is one of the newest EU Member States, and given its background, the object of this study is the competitive advantage of Romanian Entrepreneurs in the foreign trade sector. Romania did not hesitate to pursue European integration after the communist bloc collapsed and was determined to join the largest commercial union of the world (the EU) as soon as possible. The country did so in 2007 and began participating as member in the market with the largest free trade agreement portfolio in the world. The purpose of our research is to analyze economic growth effects in Romania as a result of EU integration, in the context of profound economic reforms that were required to do so (initiated in 1990), out of the need for the fastest integration in the EU, and the Romania's re-integration in the international trade. Our research involves determining and quantifying the strong and weak points of Romanian foreign trade in the context of European integration, and the challenges faced by Romanian entrepreneurs in the foreign trade sector. The foreign trade analysis attempted to in this paper is based on a unitary system of indexes - foreign trade volume, export volume, import volume, export volume per inhabitant and related, computed for the Romanian external trade compared with those of the EU, as a total, during the analyzed period. These have been carefully calculated and selected, pointing out advantages and disadvantages of each indicator from the perspective of country and region-specific characteristics over the study period. The main conclusions of the paper are that Romanian entrepreneurs register competitive advantages for some groups of products in the foreign trade sector, such as the agricultural bioproducts, the (balneo and extrem) tourism, high-tech products (machines and equipments, vehicles and associated transport equipments, machinery and mechanical appliances; electrical equipments; sound and image recorders and reproducers), informatics (soft and programming), foot wear products etc., but in order to acquire these competitive advantages, it is compulsory that the Romanian entrepreneurs to redirect their exports toward the ACP countries and other from Africa, and toward Middle East, and even toward Latin America. Imports should be orientated toward the acquisition of technological capabilities aimed at enhancing production capacities, in order to ensure export competitiveness in medium and long term, while maximizing the advantages offered by the EU Common Trade Policy.","[Giurgiu, Adriana; Berinde, Mihai; Negrea, Adrian] Univ Oradea, Fac Econ Sci, Res Ctr Competitiveness & Sustainable Dev CCCDD, Int Business Dept, Oradea, Romania",University of Oradea,,adrianagiurgiu@gmail.com; mihai.berinde@yahoo.com; ngr_adrian@yahoo.com,"GIURGIU, Adriana/AAL-1789-2021; Negrea, Adrian/U-7133-2017","Negrea, Adrian/0000-0001-9300-3099",,,,,21,0,0,0,9,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,368,377,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800046,0

The paper presents the research methodology for studying the degree of consumer satisfaction. This paper presents the concepts of satisfaction and perception, the content of consumer satisfaction, the interdependencies with the level of offered service quality and also the impact of satisfaction on the consumer behaviour. We will point out the holistic model presented by Kotler, and its importance to the consumer satisfaction concept. The marketing research is divided in: a qualitative marketing research, and a quantitative marketing research (a survey). The questionnaire was representatively distributed to effective clients of the main commercial banks in Romania. The research has shown that most of the clients are: very satisfied with the information received from the bank's personnel; are satisfied with the availability and the professionalism of the bank's employees. The interest level and the services offered are appreciated The respondents had a non-satisfactory attitude to the high commissions practice. The results of the research point out several characteristics of the consumer behaviour for the banking services in Romania. The results can be used by the managers of commercial banks to improve the quality of their services, to bring the consumers' perception of the services to their level of expectations. This paper explains certain consumer perceptions regarding the activity and the attitude of the commercial banks and, at the same time, it offers answers to questions like: why is there a restraint regarding the banking activity?, why do people save money?, what can we do to improve satisfaction?.","[Gorski, H.; Fuciu, M.] Romanian German Univ Sibiu, Sibiu, Romania",Romanian-German University of Sibiu,,tenzig11@yahoo.com; dumitresculuigi@yahoo.com; mirceafuciu@yahoo.com,"Fuciu, Mircea/Q-5112-2018; Gorski, Hortensia/AAO-4602-2020","Fuciu, Mircea/0000-0001-9811-1179;",,,,,13,0,0,0,2,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-2-3,,,,2011,,,,,,,145,148,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI18,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306939900037,0

In economic and social research, the two basic approaches are individualism and collectivism. The article emphasises that individualism is of great importance for market functioning and for an efficient economic system. It clarifies chosen market categories - optionality, reciprocity and solidarity, competition, which formed and confirmed personality traits of people, social rules and institutions - and relationship between economy and policy as important elements of formation of individualistic mentality. Relation between economy and policy becomes crucial and in principle contradictory one. Policy requires legalisation of means of power, coercion and force which brought permanent threat of their abuse. Despite of this threat collectivisation of economic activity and expansion of public needs changed state from inevitable evil to the creator of prosperity. Market economy changed to mixed economy and collectivistic concepts begin prevail in social mentality promising faster and more comfortable solutions to economic and social problems usually resulting in negative economic and social consequences in the long run. In spite of expansion of collectivistic mentality in transitive economies and also in advanced democracies (through the impact of integration trends) especially in the twentieth century, individualistic mentality is consideredby the authors as more adequate not only for efficient economic but also for optimal social development.

Contrary to the conventional notion that big stores drive small rivals out of the market, data from Tokyo in the 1990s show that large supermarkets' entry induces the exit of existing large and medium-size competitors, but improves the survival rate of small supermarkets. These findings highlight the role of store size as an important dimension of product differentiation.

Purchasing power decreased in the last years and consumers have to choose among different food products, under budget restrictions. Because food products demand responds differently to market changes, elasticity coefficients of food demand are estimated considering two variables: food prices and income of households. Series data have been collected from the Romanian Statistical Yearbook and were introduced in computer programs to determine correlation coefficients of variables. The main findings show that, when crisis occurs, consumers reduce the quantity of poultry meat, milk, meat products, fish and fish products, cheese and sour cream, and fruits, purchased from the market. The major impact of economic crisis is a diet shift from consumption of livestock based products to crop based products, which are cheaper.","[Ion, R. A.; Manole, V.; Istudor, N.; Ladaru, G.

Prior to the Bruns and Merchant (1990) study, the morality of short-term earnings management was of little concern to researchers and accounting practitioners. However, in the light of increased financial frauds and failures, new and increased emphasis has been placed on the importance of the concepts of earnings quality and earnings management practices. Despite increased research focusing on business ethics since 1990, there is little evidence that business schools and the profession are educating accountants about earnings management practices. Therefore, this study, similar to other studies, continues to use the Bruns and Merchant survey and compares the results of studies on students and business managers on earnings management practices. Students and business managers were surveyed at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University (NMMU) and these results were compared to four studies prior to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 in the US. The expectation will be of changes in attitudes towards earnings management since the financial scandals and passing the Act. Therefore, the aim of the study is to determine if there have been changes in attitudes towards earnings management practices.

The individuals have one of their own and the organizations gather up structured data. The challenge of the management is to know how to get both levels of knowledge to work together for the birth of a competitive advantage, mixing IT components and human capital. It is clear that a structured database is a powerful source of information but it is also true that a key factor is the individual and his own knowledge. As reminded by the supporters of the spontaneous order, the knowledge of one individual can be more important than the whole package of data organized by a superior in hierarchy group of people.

Improvement of OEE through a proper and adequate maintenance program for machinery and equipment should be reflected in higher quality of manufacturing processes.

This paper aims to provide additional information on the nature of the diversification-performance relationship in Spain during the period 1997-2001, which is characterized by important transformations in the competitive environment and hence in the strategic tendency of firms. After using Heckman's two-stage method on a sample of 236 large Spanish firms, results indicate that increasing diversification across the low to moderate levels had a positive and significant effect on firm growth and profitability over this period. By comparing these results with those previously obtained for Spanish firms, it may be concluded that the level of diversification and their consequences vary with time and contextual changes.","[Martinez Campillo, Almudena; Fernandez-Gago, Roberto] Univ Leon, Dept Business Adm, Fac Business & Econ, E-24071 Leon, Spain",Universidad de Leon,"Campillo, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Leon, Dept Business Adm, Fac Business & Econ, Campus Vegazana S-N, E-24071 Leon, Spain.",amarc@unileon.es; roberto.fernandez@unileon.es,"Fernández-Gago, Roberto/A-4316-2015; Martinez-Campillo, Almudena/G-8575-2015","Fernández-Gago, Roberto/0000-0003-2783-1026; Martinez-Campillo, Almudena/0000-0002-3313-529X",,,,,56,2,2,1,13,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The topic of why people contribute to online fora has been studied from economic, sociological and biological perspectives. One significant contribution derives from game theory which incorporates an individual's expected return from their contribution (Axelrod & Hamilton, 1981; Nowak et al., 2010; Nowak & Highfield, 2011). However, these theories take insufficient account of the scale of social networks relative to their population in influencing growth rates. Rewarding or punishing individuals according to game theoretic approaches can be inefficient for promoting cooperative behaviours because of incomplete information about cooperative and non-cooperative individuals (Oliver, 1980; Marwell et al., 1988). Critical mass theory encompasses incomplete information issues, and focuses on production function and network structure (Marwell et al., 1988; Westland, 2010). A series of hypotheses are tested within a conceptual framework linking individuals' motivations underpinned by altruism, reciprocity and desire for commitment as antecedents of contribution to a forum. It is these small segment of group of initial volunteers who contribute to the critical mass at which the forum becomes stable.","[Palmer, Adrian; Hudson, Sarah; Huo, Qunying] ESC Rennes, Rennes, France",Universite de Rennes; ESC Rennes School of Business,,mail@apalmer.com; sarah.Hudson@esc-rennes.fr; qunying.huo@esc-rennes.fr,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,4,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-77-5,,,,2011,,,,,,,464,480,,,,,,17,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDJ83,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000313565200046,0

We use the data on the All Share Price Index (ASPI) for the period from January 1990 to December 2009. We use an AR(1) model to estimate the residuals of the AR(1) equation, and then adjust the returns for thin trading. In addition to that an augmented logistic equation model is used as a basis for investigation to take into account the nonlinearity in the data. The study finds significant autocorrelations in the unadjusted daily market returns for thin trading for the period of 1990 to 2009. However, the above predictability is removed when we use thin trading adjusted returns to the model. After incorporating non- linear components into the model, we find that statistically significant non linearity in the CSE after and before adjusting returns for thin trading. Therefore, we can conclude that the inefficiency observed at CSE during the sample period is manifested through non-linear behaviour of stock returns. We further examine the models on annual sub-sets of the index data in order to investigate the effectiveness of market regulatory changes on market efficiency at CSE. Unlike the other emerging markets we do not see that regulatory changes have significantly encouraged investor participation, improved information quality and reflected new information more rapidly in share prices. Therefore, further measures are necessary to improve the informational efficiency of the CSE. In this regards allowing short sales and introducing risk hedging derivative securities to the market would be effective.","[Pathirawasam, Chandrapala] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Zlin, Czech Republic; [Idirisinghe, I.

Foreign literature offers four main approaches to the tourist destination attractiveness research. Geographical and presentational approaches are oriented towards supply side. The first offers objective, the second subjective regard. Economic and perceptive approaches are focused on the demand side. Economic one shows objective facts, perceptive approach offers subjective potential tourists assessment of the destination. None of the approaches is complex and therefore is necessary to accordingly interface them. The aim of the paper is to examine and assess the subjective attractiveness of Slovakia (which means the attractiveness evaluated from the presentation and perceptive approaches) for the selected segment of visitors. In our case it will be a European Francophone tourist market. It consists of four Western and Central Europe countries, where French language is official language. Belgium, France, Luxembourg and Switzerland are the outgoing tourist countries with high living standards and high intensity of travel that means markets with high potential. The article is based on secondary data sources (web pages, tourist guide books, Slovakia tourist board promotional materials) as well as on primary sources (interview with 40 tourist experts and information interveners from European franco phone countries). Regarding to the presentational approach, research discovers that Slovakia is on the European franco phone market presented like a few attractive tourist destination. Relatively the most favorable information about Slovakia tourist destination for potential French speaking visitors is diffused by web pages. As regards perceptive approach, European francophone market doesn't have enough information about Slovakia and apprehends it like barely few attractive. According to the investigation, Slovakia tourist destination attractiveness in terms of subjectively evaluated offer is higher than its attractiveness in terms of subjectively evaluated demand. The biggest deficiency is the low availability of information about Slovakia as a tourist destination for French-speaking countries, which is crucial in visitors deciding where to travel and stay.","Univ Mateja Bela, Ekon Fak, Katedra Cestovneho Ruchu Spoloaneho Stravovania, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Pompurová, K (通讯作者)，Univ Mateja Bela, Ekon Fak, Katedra Cestovneho Ruchu Spoloaneho Stravovania, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia.",kristina.pompurova@umb.sk,"Pompurová, Kristína/AAI-2074-2020","Pompurová, Kristína/0000-0003-4721-9379",,,,,20,4,4,0,7,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

J,"Price, C",,,,"Price, Colin",,,Optimal rotation with declining discount rate,JOURNAL OF FOREST ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Optimal rotation; Discounting; Dynamic inconsistency,INVESTMENT; FUTURE; PREFERENCES; ECONOMICS; TIME,"In recent years it has been argued, from many perspectives, that the further into the future a value flow occurs, the lower is the appropriate discount rate for it. National governments are now beginning to authorise such declining discount rates. This viewpoint can be, and has been, formalised in various ways, and has been applied to evaluating forestry investments of given durations. When the optimal duration of investment is itself the issue, new problems arise. Lower discount rates make subsequent rotations longer than earlier ones, and for a given length more valuable than they would otherwise be. This affects the optimal length of earlier rotations, which in turn may affect the discount rate profile applicable to later ones. In the absence of analytical solutions for the optimal sequence of rotations, numerical protocols are needed. The results arising are mostly in accord with expectations. If the change of discount rate is due to expected changes of circumstance that are actually realised, then the optimal sequence of rotations will remain as initially determined. If, however, it is due merely to the particular time perspective of the present generation, rotations will be revised by future generations. This will lead to a sequence of rotations similar to that deemed optimal at the current short-term discount rate. The most important reductions in profitability caused by choosing the wrong discounting protocol arise from the wrong rate, rather than by using declining rates as such.

The aim of this study is to determine the relation between economic growth, international trade and environmental regulations in Iran during the period 1990QI-2006Q4. Therefore, using the vector Autoregressive approach, the effects of each of these elements in relation to the others was systematically studied. Results showed that economic growth has enhanced carbon-dioxide diffusion, whereas export has not had any effect. It was also determined that environmental regulations induced a decrease in production, export and carbon-dioxide diffusion with the effect on Co2 diffusion being negligible.

A common homeownership strategy among nonprofits is to acquire boarded-up or deteriorated homes at a low price, rehabilitate them, and then sell them at an affordable price. As these programs continue, nonprofit organizations want to show quantitatively that neighborhood revitalization works-that the funds devoted to an area stabilize neighborhoods or, even more, that they initiate a surge of continued upward progress. But, unlike their larger counterparts, smaller community development organizations are usually at a disadvantage in undertaking such an evaluation. This study will help illustrate what might be done. It focuses on the case of St. Joseph's Carpenter Society (SJCS) in Camden, New Jersey and assesses the quantitative impact that SJCS has on its target neighborhoods. A three-tiered approach is adopted that ranges from a target and comparison area analysis, to regression analysis of SJCS's impact on local housing prices, and finally to an examination of the relative market performance of SJCS's houses. All told, the analysis suggests that SJCS's rehabilitation and homeownership education activities appear to have a positive influence on the neighborhoods in its target area.","[Smith, Marvin M.; Hevener, Christy Chung] Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19106 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Philadelphia,"Smith, MM (通讯作者)，10 Independence Mall, Philadelphia, PA 19106 USA.",marty.smith@phil.frb.org,,,,,,,22,8,10,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Particularly for SMEs, research cooperation and R&D outsourcing can offer possibilities to complement the often limited internal research resources. However, external knowledge relations potentially bring in their wake a loss of technology assets. his paper focuses on research cooperation and R&D outsourcing in SMEs. Two functions of research cooperation are envisaged: generating new knowledge and exchanging existing knowledge previously developed within the firm. The paper addresses two items that are underdeveloped in the current literature. First, attention is paid to the heterogeneity in terms of firm size of SMEs. A distinction is made between micro, small-sized, and medium-sized firms. Second, consideration is given to the formal management of R&D activities. This is related to the management of the potential risks inherently involved in external knowledge relations. It is measured by the presence of a formal R&D manager within the SME. A descriptive quantitative empirical analysis is presented based on firm-level data provided by the OECD business R&D survey for Belgium covering the period 2004-2005. The starting point is a representative sample of 140 (quasi-) permanent R&D active SMEs. The analysis reveals marked differences in R&D outsourcing behaviour according to the size of the SME. In this respect, medium-sized firms are found to be significantly less involved in R&D outsourcing (one out of four firms) compared to micro and small-sized firms (one out of two firms is engaged in R&D outsourcing). On average, two-thirds of the (quasi-) permanent R&D active firms have a formal R&D manager and there are no marked differences according to firm size. The presence of an R&D manager turns out to be significantly associated with the firm's engagement in R&D outsourcing and with knowledge exchange in research cooperation. There is no interaction effect between the presence of an R&D manager and firm size to explain firm engagement in research cooperation and R&D outsourcing.","[Teirlinck, Peter] Univ Brussel, Hogesch, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Teirlinck, Peter; Spithoven, Andre] Vrije Univ Brussel, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium; [Teirlinck, Peter; Spithoven, Andre] Belgian Sci Policy, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Teirlinck, P (通讯作者)，Univ Brussel, Hogesch, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",Peter.Teirlinck@hubrussel.be; Andre.Spithoven@belspo.be,"Spithoven, Andre/T-3669-2019",,FWO Vlaanderen [G.047.08N],FWO Vlaanderen(FWO),This study was supported financially by the FWO Vlaanderen (project G.047.08N).,,21,1,1,0,10,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,820,826,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800098,0

Organizations have in hand rich varieties of methods in their attempts to measure the performance of their own strategies and business, and their business health. There are good practices in developing strategies. There are also good practices of using and implementing forecasting tools. But which combination could lead to success is the biggest pain for the companies. Should the company exchange its strategic decision maker? Or should the company choose different strategic tools? Or how to reach future and see what will be the need then, so to start developing it now? What combination of tools and soft techniques should be implemented? Those are hard questions, and answers are even harder. This paper can't offer an answer of them, but an attempt to arrange the priorities. Design / methodology / approach: The design methodology used for the purpose of this paper is based on qualitative research, interviews, together with literature review. As a result comes powerful general and in the same time personally oriented approach. Findings: Developing a strategy is one of the milestones in business lifecycle. Balanced Scorecard methodology is proven powerful tool for developing of strategy. Combined with forecasting tools for visioning, it could come to the point need to an organization. Soft skills together with scientific tools form powerful instrument. Authors envision as good reason for measuring intangibles placing the Human Capital and its knowledge at the top of the evolution business tree. As a path to this is believe that intangibles could be monetized. This is valid especially at the time of current recession with all its varieties. It is a time for revolution and for a new jump. This might be based on patterns and mixed with advanced innovative analysis and solution. Inventing such methodology should involve changes in legislative systems incorporating financial and nonfinancial tools especially related to intangibles and its integration in balance sheets. Research limitations: One of the most sensitive, delicate and difficult issue is related to create right mission and vision, although only future could prove if the vision and mission are right or not. The outcome is normally clear only when the future comes, and with it the financial results of the strategy, developed on the basis of these vision and mission. For this purpose are used forecasting tools as scenarios, trends, picture of the future methods etc. There are well known methodologies for developing a strategy. There are also forecasting tools for defining and developing visions. Combining these two is limited by human decisions from one organization to the other. Limitation of the research is related to well-known published good practices as well as not so well known organizational practices and methods. There are additionally other strategic tools, not published and not known as good or any practices at all. It is usual practice, as many companies close innovations internally in the company. Originality / value: The paper discusses the need of creativeness and art work alongside technology based strategy development and organizational performance measurement. It presents analysed results of narrative research and interviews among executives and top and middle layer management in famous innovative organizations in business and academia in Germany and United Kingdom. The paper gives valuable insight for arisen need of development of new methodology, technology based and in the same time with futuristic elements.","[Todorova, Yanka; Birov, Dimitar; Gourova, Elissaveta] Univ Sofia, Fac Math & Informat, BU-1126 Sofia, Bulgaria",University of Sofia,,yanka@todoroff.co.uk; birov@fmi.uni-sofia.bg; elis@fmi.uni-sofia.bg,"Gourova, Elissaveta/S-1085-2016","Gourova, Elissaveta/0000-0003-0982-4156",,,,,22,0,0,0,15,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,832,836,,,,,,5,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800100,0

According to the theory of beneficial trade, trade facilitates commerce and technology transfer of environmental products so as to improve the environment. But the environmentalists argue that the trade promotes the unsustainable growth of production and consumption so that the trade expansion is harmful to the environment. Trade indirectly affects the environment through the production, circulation and price of products and there are externalities for the utilization of environmental resources. The externalities of environmental cost cause failures of both market and government intervention. Therefore, in order to change the growth mode of China's foreign trade, the environmental cost must be internalized. The environmental cost under internalization includes the value of environmental resources, the new value created from the investment of human labor and the value of environmental restoration.

The main objective of this paper is to establish if there has been a change in the nature of operational risk with regards to the number of operational losses as well as their impact pre and during the crisis. The way in which operational losses have been affected will be presented and a comparison will be made between operational loss characteristics pre and during the crisis. Some of the main findings of this paper were that operational losses showed little change in frequency, but showed a significant increase in severity, meaning that their financial impact has been more severe during the crisis. Therefore it is quite safe to say that the financial crisis most definitely had an impact on operational risk as the impact of operational losses became much more severe.","[Esterhuysen, Ja'nel] North West Univ, Absa Bank Econ, Mmabatho, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Esterhuysen, J (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Absa Bank Econ, Mmabatho, South Africa.",,"van Vuuren, Gary/B-5453-2019","van Vuuren, Gary/0000-0001-6811-0538",,,,,24,2,2,0,14,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

These flexibilities are designed to limit certain perverse effects of rights ill-adjusted to the characteristics of some economic sectors (agricultural biotechnologies, pharmacy, etc.).

However, it is far from clear that a consensus exists on which individuals or groups are to be included under this heading with a consequent lack of clarity for the policy implications of pursuing this goal. In this paper, operating with a conception of social exclusion that incorporates notions of dynamics and multidimensionality, we make use of EU-SILC 2008 data for Ireland to clarify the distinction between income poverty and economic vulnerability. We then proceed to consider the relationship between these outcomes and multiple deprivation, financial pressures and perceptions of recent and future economic prospects. Our analysis is then extended to compare patterns of risk for poverty and vulnerability in relation to key socio-economic groups. Finally, we will consider the relationship between poverty and vulnerability and the distribution of welfare dependence. Our analysis suggests that the vulnerable but non-poor group may need to be a key focus of policy attention in the future.","[Whelan, Christopher T.] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Maitre, Bertrand] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland",University College Dublin; Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"Whelan, CT (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",,,"Whelan, Christopher/0000-0002-3387-5036",,,,,39,11,11,0,21,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

President Franklin Roosevelt argued that the massive government relief efforts struck at the roots of crime by providing subsistence income to needy families. After constructing a panel data set for 81 large American cities for the years 1930-40, we estimate the effect of relief spending by all levels of government on crime rates. The analysis suggests that a 10 percent increase in relief spending during the 1930s reduced property crime by roughly 1.5 percent. By limiting the amount of relief recipients' free time, work relief may have been more effective than direct relief in reducing crime. More generally, our results indicate that social insurance, which tends to be understudied in economic analyses of crime, should be more explicitly and more carefully incorporated into the analysis of temporal and spatial variations in criminal activity.","[Fishback, Price V.] Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Johnson, Ryan S.] Brigham Young Univ Idaho, Rexburg, ID USA; [Kantor, Shawn] Univ Calif, Merced, CA USA",University of Arizona; Brigham Young University; University of California System; University of California Merced,"Fishback, PV (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",,"Johnson, Ryan/HPG-0764-2023",,,,,,71,42,49,1,22,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

Well-cited papers tend to be in areas of core concern in social economics (labor, health, social theory) and attract attention in related social sciences and policy fields. Yet about half the articles published in RoSE are not cited in another scholarly journal within three years of publication, suggesting that, as well done and interesting as these papers may be, problems like narrow focus seem to limit their influence on other people's work.

Our data-set consists of four separate periods, with 198 days in each period and 24 hourly observations in each day. We can detect both an intra-daily seasonality and a seasonality effect within each period. We take advantage of the functional nature of the data-set and propose a forecasting methodology based on functional statistics. In particular, we use a functional clustering procedure to classify the daily load curves. Then, on the basis of the groups obtained, we define a family of functional linear regression models. To make forecasts we assign new load curves to clusters, applying a functional discriminant analysis. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed approach in comparison with some classical models. (C) 2009 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Not always, however, is this tendency, or the underlying methods put to use, obvious. That states (provincial divisions in the US) were competing to attract incorporations by relaxing their regulatory standards, couldn't be seriously observed and highlighted until mid-1970s. Today, a few would doubt the existence of regulatory competition in corporate law in the US. In this paper, the author examines the issue whether the EU is (likely to be) engaged in regulatory competition in the area of company law. Answering the question in affirmative, the author proceeds to examine the strength of the race to the bottom and the race to the top theories, as developed and argued in the US, for the European setting. Since the legal systems of Member States of the EU have certain very disparate core values along which those systems have historically developed, relaxation of standards in the EU would take place against different variables. Because of the multitude of variables, comparable variables are unlikely to yield comparable results; either of the race theories is unlikely to satisfactorily predict the regulatory behaviour of EU Member States. Instead, since laxation in respect of one variable would be met by optimisation in respect of the other, there is likely to be simultaneous races to the top and to the bottom among the EU Member States.","[Sachdeva, Amit M.] Vaish Associates Advocates, New Delhi, India; [Sachdeva, Amit M.] NIT, Faridabad 121001, Hayrana, India",,"Sachdeva, AM (通讯作者)，Vaish Associates Advocates, New Delhi, India.",amitsachdeva@vaishlaw.com,"Singh, Pramod K./F-1379-2016","Singh, Pramod K./0000-0002-3155-6621",,,,,90,6,6,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

With good forecasts, bidders can make informed bidding decisions and sellers can select the right time and place to list their products. While information from other auctions can help forecast an ongoing auction, it should be weighted by its relevance to the auction of interest. We propose a novel functional K-nearest neighbor (fKNN) forecaster for real-time forecasting of online auctions. The forecaster uses information from other auctions and weights their contributions by their relevance in terms of auction, seller and product features, and by the similarity of the price paths. We capture an auction's price path by borrowing ideas from functional data analysis. We propose a novel Beta growth model, and then measure the distances between two price paths via the Kullback-Leibler distance. Our resulting fKNN forecaster incorporates a mixture of functional and non-functional distances. We apply the forecaster to several large datasets of eBay auctions, showing an improved predictive performance over several competing models. We also investigate the performance across various levels of data heterogeneity, and find that fKNN is particularly effective for forecasting heterogeneous auction populations.

The potential value of such models is emphasised by the extremely costly failure of high-profile companies in the recent past. Consequently, a significant interest has been generated in business failure prediction within academia as well as in the finance industry. Statistical business failure prediction models attempt to predict the failure or success of a business. Discriminant and logit analyses have traditionally been the most popular approaches, but there are also a range of promising non-parametric techniques that can alternatively be applied. In this paper, the relatively new technique of decision trees is applied to business failure prediction. The numerical results suggest that decision trees could be superior predictors of business failure as compared to discriminant analysis.

Using differences across states, we test whether the reduction in firearms availability affected homicide and suicide rates. We find that the buyback led to a drop in the firearm suicide rates of almost 80%, with no significant effect on non-firearm death rates. The effect on firearm homicides is of similar magnitude but is less precise. The results are robust to a variety of specification checks and to instrumenting the state-level buyback rate.

Estimates from random and fixed effects models highlight the deterrent effect of sanctions for rapes and minor sexual offences. The enforcement activity of rapes is the most deterrent factor both for rapes and other sexual offences, compared with the rapes- and minor sexual offences-reducing impact of an increase in the enforcement activity for minor sexual offences. Our results cast doubt on the broken windows theory. From a normative perspective, it would be more efficient to deter the authors of rapes rather than those of less severe sexual offences.","[Vaillant, Nicolas Gerard] CNRS, LEM, UMR 8179, F-59016 Lille, France; [Vaillant, Nicolas Gerard] Univ Catholic Lille FLSEG, F-59016 Lille, France; [Wolff, Francois-Charles] Univ Nantes, LEMNA, F-44322 Nantes, France",Universite de Lille - ISITE; Universite de Lille; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Catholique de Lille; Nantes Universite,"Vaillant, NG (通讯作者)，CNRS, LEM, UMR 8179, 60 Bd Vauban,BP109, F-59016 Lille, France.",nicolas.vaillant@icl-lille.fr; francois.wolff@univ-nantes.fr,,"Vaillant, Nicolas/0000-0002-0201-7426",,,,,24,2,2,2,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

The player performance data are derived from a simplistic linear model, such as the one seen in an AFL fantasy football league. A smoothing macro allows experimentation with various running median combinations which are designed to eliminate the noise from each player's season data. Performing optimizations on each player's running median sequence in conjunction with the exponential smoothing parameter results in a noticeably lower mean squared error per player than either mean projection or simple exponential smoothing. A Monte Carlo simulation of the median sequence and smoothing parameter combinations creates confidence intervals for assessing the forecasts. The results are demonstrated on both a season and a match-by-match basis. (C) 2009 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Growth in labour services is divided between the increase in hours and improvement in the productive quality of these hours. Improvement in labour quality, as proxied by education, age and gender, has added on average 0.7 percentage points per year to the growth rate in total labour input. Changes in education account for two-thirds of the improvement in labour quality, with gender and age distributions equally sharing the remaining third. Even in the face of declining total employment, growth in labour services remained positive in 2008 due to past investment in human capital. A key application of this quality-adjusted labour series is that a proportion of growth usually attributed to total factor productivity growth can now be accounted for as an improvement in the quality of labour input.",,,,Mary.Keeney@centralbank.ie,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,7,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

We particularly consider the impact of the classical transactional attributes, such as specificity and uncertainty, along with other governance mechanisms, such as contractual completeness and relational governance, on duration clauses. The results show that the probability of signing an indefinite-duration contract is related positively to the specificity of the activity and negatively to the degree of completeness of the contract and the uncertainty regarding future demand. Contrary to some classical arguments, these findings suggest that an explicitly long-term contract is not always needed to protect against contractual hazards. Indefinite-duration contracts may also provide protection while improving the flexibility to adjust the relationship to the changing environment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The models are developed within the framework of dynamic linear models, which provides a high level of flexibility and allows direct interpretation of the results. The problem of the collinearity of intraperiod observations is solved using model selection and model averaging approaches. Bayesian approaches to model selection automatically adjust for multiple comparisons, while predictions based on model averaging allow us to account for both model and parameter uncertainty when predicting future observations. A novel aspect of the models presented here is the introduction of new formulations for the prior distribution on the model space that allow us to favor sparse models where the significant coefficients cluster on adjacent lags of the high frequency predictor. We illustrate our approach by predicting the gross national product of the United States using the term structure of interest rates. (C) 2010 International Institute of Forecasters.

We analyze an agency relationship with moral hazard where a principal relies on a supervisor to obtain verifiable information about an agent's output. The supervisor's discretion allows him to engage in two types of individual opportunism, namely abuse of power and abuse of authority, as well as two types of group opportunism, namely collusion with the agent and collusion with the principal. Individual opportunism occurs when the supervisor asks a tribute to reveal information, whereas group opportunism occurs when the supervisor receives a bribe to conceal information. We find that the effective, and hence most noxious, form of opportunism is individual opportunism and derive the opportunism-proof contracts, that is, the optimal contracts that protect the organization against both individual and group opportunism.","[Vafai, Kouroche] Univ Paris 05, Dept GEA & LIRAES, IUT Paris, Paris, France; [Vafai, Kouroche] Univ Paris 01, CES, F-75231 Paris 05, France",Universite Paris Cite; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Vafaï, K (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 05, Dept GEA & LIRAES, IUT Paris, Paris, France.",kouroche.vafai@libertysurf.fr,,,,,,,27,22,23,3,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

Results for 84 countries over the 1980-2004 period indicate that bank concentration generally has a negative effect on economic growth, an effect that disappears in Countries with poorer-quality institutional environments. This result is consistent with the idea that bank concentration contributes more to the development of lending relationships with borrowers in countries where the poor quality of institutions impedes market development.

We used multiple regression models and unique individual level data from the Scottish Longitudinal Study. We found that high correlations between the percentage of social renting in a neighbourhood and labour market outcomes disappeared when controlling for neighbourhood deprivation, individual level education and tenure. The results show that living in a deprived neighbourhood is negatively correlated with labour market performance, but predominantly for homeowners and not for social renters.

The substance of the project Models of firms with mobile oriented architecture is creation and research of the comprehensive system of models of firms having mobile oriented architecture. This system includes mainly process models and service oriented models (SOA). The integral part of the solution will be also the proposal of transformation process leading towards mobile oriented architecture. The starting point of research will be analysis of present use of mobile attitudes in the area of m-commerce and m-business in the Czech republic and in the world from the point of view of ways, scopes, and effectiveness of using currently available mobile technologies as well as trends in this area. The models will describe possibility of using of mobile solution on different levels of management, for the support of business processes, processes of IT management and processes of providing IT services. Accessible mobile device offer already basic environment for creation mobile application, despite of the number of users and companies use only basic provided ICT services like voice, SMS sending, eventually access to e-mail boxes or connection to the internet. In the Czech market, there exist only very few companies, which are using mobile device for access to their company IT system. A lot of these companies has supranational character and their SW solutions are imported and adapted for Czech market. It is possible to claim, mobile technologies forerun the developement in area of implementation of new managing methods and process architectures with mobility elements. In consequence of implementing these technologies to the firm, there is comming necessary rebuilding of number of business processes.","[Kozel, Tomas; Mohelska, Hana] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fak Informat & Managementu, Katedra Informacnich Technol, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,"Kozel, T (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Fak Informat & Managementu, Katedra Informacnich Technol, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.",tomas.kozel@uhk.cz; hana.mohelska@uhk.cz,"Kozel, Tomas/R-3592-2019","Kozel, Tomas/0000-0002-7008-0523; Mohelska, Hana/0000-0003-0441-0712",,,,,13,11,11,0,12,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The article explores recent developments in political science, in which there have been active attempts to rethink the application of path dependence to the evolution of institutions so as to emphasize change rather than continuity.

In recent years, however, some prominent mistaken predictions have been made, undermining public confidence in the accuracy of both exit polls and survey methods. Nonresponse bias has been claimed as being one of the main reasons for inaccurate projections. Traditionally, the issue has been handled through an age-race-sex adjustment at the national and state levels. An alternative solution is suggested and detailed in this paper. A two-step strategy is proposed to reduce nonresponse bias and improve predictions. First, vote-remembering (vote recall) is used to correct party proportion estimates at polling locations; second, this is used to estimate party proportions at precinct level through a regression estimator. The method is gauged by forecasting the 2003 and 2007 Corts Valencianes elections using raw data from the exit polls conducted by SigmaDos for Generalitat Valenciana. In light of the results, this procedure considerably improves raw data projections and shows a substantial improvement over industry (SigmaDos) forecasts. It therefore represents an interesting alternative that could easily be adopted for exit polling in any country where precinct-level voting data exist.

We compare the economic costs when residential capital is durable with the costs when capital is perfectly malleable and those when population is also freely mobile. Our simulation, based on the stylized specification of an urban location model, suggests that in a more realistic setting with durable capital, the costs of regulation are substantially higher than they are when capital is assumed to be malleable or when households are assumed to be fully mobile. Importantly, the extent of wealth redistribution attributable to these regulations is much larger when these more realistic factors are recognized. When capital is durable, the results also imply that far more new development takes place on previously undeveloped land at the urban boundary, sometimes resulting in an increase in total land under development.","[Swoboda, Aaron M.] Carleton Coll, Northfield, MN 55057 USA; [Quigley, John M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Carleton College; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Swoboda, AM (通讯作者)，Carleton Coll, Northfield, MN 55057 USA.",aswoboda@carleton.edu,,,,,,,18,5,6,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Very robust, stylised facts from real-world business cycles are that real wages are procyclical. A variable is seen as procyclical if it moves the same direction as income during the ups and downs of the business cycles. This stylised fact is at odds with the AD-AS models and also the DAD-AS model. These models propose countercyclical real wages. The AD-AS models and the DAD-AS model can also generate procyclical real wages depending if it is the stickiness of prices rather than the stickiness of wages that is the cause of the slow adjustment to nominal shocks. New Keynesian macroeconomics adds nominal rigidities to AD-AS models and the DAD-AS model to explain deviations from potential product. New Keynesian macroeconomics strives to provide a microeconomic foundation for sticky wages and prices. Efficiency wage theory argues that raising the real wages may lower costs per unit of output by raising labour productivity. As a result, involuntary unemployment persists. New Keynesian macroeconomics challenges the classical labour market result on two fronts. First, real rigidities may give rise to labour market equilibrium with involuntary unemployment. Second, nominal wage rigidities may permit temporary displacements from equilibrium. Real rigidities prevent the real wage from moving down until the market clears. Sources of real rigidities are legislation, monopolistic trade unions, efficiency wages and insider-outsider effects. Nominal rigidities in the labour market prevent the nominal wage from bringing about real wage adjustment, which is necessary after prices change. One important institutional feature making nominal wages sticky is the existence of long-term contracts.","Tech Univ Liberci, Ekon Fak, Katedra Ekon, Liberec, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Skála, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberci, Ekon Fak, Katedra Ekon, Liberec, Czech Republic.",marek.skala@tul.cz,,,,,,,16,2,2,0,15,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

By considering a case of medical imaging technology in Europe and in Japan for over a decade, our empirical investigation shows that medical organizations clinically evaluate technological alternatives, from which emerge clinical innovations not captured in patents and licenses and more importantly diffused among a larger community of practice, beyond geographic boundaries. These findings direct our attention to propose a model that links technological change and lead users within a microstate innovation system with respect to clinical advances for patients. This model uses a dynamic and interpretative approach that allows variation and selection within and among heterogeneous agents for technological change. In turn, the clinical innovation system provides us with insights into how firms potentially benefit from these localized interactions through a transnational collaborative and collective learning process. This captures the unique and distinct knowledge accumulated by lead users for novel solutions, which is beyond sole product development.","[Galbrun, Jerome] Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Decis Sci & Technol, Dept Value & Decis Sci, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1528550, Japan",Tokyo Institute of Technology,"Galbrun, J (通讯作者)，Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Decis Sci & Technol, Dept Value & Decis Sci, Meguro Ku, 2-12-1 Ookayama, Tokyo 1528550, Japan.",jerome.galbrun@hotmail.fr,,,,,,,64,9,9,2,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

It summarizes the huge body of solid empirical evidence accumulated over the past several decades that proves the disastrous consequences of inaccurate forecasts in areas ranging from the economy and business to floods and medicine. The big problem is, however, that the Great majority of people, decision and policy makers alike, still believe not only that accurate forecasting is possible, but also that uncertainty can be reliably assessed. Reality, however, shows otherwise, as this special section proves. This paper discusses forecasting accuracy and uncertainty, and distinguishes three distinct types of predictions: those relying on patterns for forecasting, those utilizing relationships as their basis, and those for which human judgment is the major determinant of the forecast. In addition, the major problems and challenges facing forecasters and the reasons why uncertainty cannot be assessed reliably are discussed using four large data sets. There is also a summary of the eleven papers included in this special section, as well as some concluding remarks emphasizing the need to be rational and realistic about our expectations and avoid the common delusions related to forecasting.

The forecast performance of the Autoregressive Conditional Multinomial-Autoregressive Conditional Duration (ACM-ACD) model is better than the Asymmetric Autoregressive Conditional Duration (AACD) model. However, the ACM-ACD model is more complex in terms of the computational setting and is more sensitive to starting values. The second purpose is to examine the effects of market microstructure on the forecasting performance of the two models. The results indicate that the forecast performance of the models generally decreases as the liquidity of the stock increases, with the exception of the most liquid stocks. Furthermore, a simple filter of the raw data improves the performance of both models. Finally, the results suggest that both models capture the characteristics of the micro data very well with a minimum sample length of 20 days.

This paper will explore, analyze, and compare the ways in which knowledge-intensive activities occur in a small cluster of mature and low-tech industries: orange and lemon selection in Spain. The paper aims to assess the impact of KISA on the firm's innovation and performance, as well as to analyze whether KISA occurrence is correlated with certain characteristics of firms such as size, organizational profile, market focus, and other characteristics. A model correlating these variables will additionally be proposed and validated.","[Albors-Garrigos, Jose; Luis Hervas-Oliver, Jose] Univ Politecn Valencia, Camino Vera S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Hidalgo, Antonio] Univ Politecn Madrid, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Albors-Garrigos, J (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Valencia, Camino Vera S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",jalbors@doe.upv.es,"Hidalgo, Antonio/AAZ-5720-2020; albors-garrigos, jose/P-6837-2015; HERVAS, JOSE/ABA-7256-2021","Hidalgo, Antonio/0000-0002-3598-9862; albors-garrigos, jose/0000-0003-3669-879X;",,,,,57,2,2,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

We then demonstrate that variations in the populations and rankings stem mostly from differences in concepts and geographic definitions, and identify six different types of definition in the UN's list. We also offer a set of consistently defined metropolitan areas based on stated guidelines. Case studies for Tokyo, Mexico City, Los Angeles and Beijing include maps to elucidate the administrative areas and statistical definitions in use in each of these urban areas, and illustrate how the varying definitions yield different population totals.

We show that the responsiveness of the central bank's instrument to the underlying state of the economy is increasing in the duration of the long-term bond. On the other hand, an increase in duration will make long-term inflationary expectations - and therefore also the long-term nominal interest rate - less responsive to the state of the economy. The extent to which the central bank is concerned with output stabilisation will exert a moderating influence on the central bank's response to leading indicators of future inflation. However, the effect of an increase in this parameter on the long-term nominal interest rate turns out to be ambiguous. Next, we show that both the sensitivity of the nominal term spread to economic fundamentals and the extent to which the spread predicts future output, are increasing in the duration of the long bond and the degree of structural output persistence. However, if the central bank becomes relatively less concerned about inflation stabilisation the term spread will be less successful in predicting real economic activity.","[Schaling, Eric] Univ St Andrews, Univ Pretoria, Ctr Dynam Macroecon Anal, St Andrews KY16 9AJ, Fife, Scotland; [Verhagen, Willem] ING Investment Management, The Hague, Netherlands; [Eijffinger, Sylvester] RSM Erasmus Univ, CentER Tilburg Univ, CESifo & CEPR, Tilburg, Netherlands",University of St Andrews; Tilburg University,"Schaling, E (通讯作者)，Univ St Andrews, Univ Pretoria, Ctr Dynam Macroecon Anal, St Andrews KY16 9AJ, Fife, Scotland.",,,,,,,,25,1,1,0,8,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

A number of tests of nonlinearity have been developed in the literature. However, it has recently been shown that all these tests perform poorly for SETAR-type nonlinearity detection in the presence of additive outliers. In this paper, we develop an improved test for SETAR-type nonlinearity in time series. The test is an outlier-robust test based on the cumulative sums of ordered weighted residuals from generalized maximum likelihood fits. A Monte Carlo study confirms that the proposed test is competitive with existing tests for data from uncontaminated SETAR models and superior to them for SETAR data contaminated with additive outliers.

In practice, total spending on public order and safety is divided up into four categories (police force, fire service, law courts and prison service) so in the second part of the analysis we test for Granger causality between output, investment and each category of spending. But the division of aggregate spending may give rise to trade-offs/complementarities so in the final part of the analysis Granger causality tests are used to investigate this issue. Among other things, the results suggest that changes in output Granger cause changes in total spending on public order and safety. In particular, when total spending is disaggregated the findings suggest that changes in output Granger cause changes in spending on the police force and the law courts. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The effects of these different tax regimes - particularly, on crime deterrence - have not been fully explored. instead, legal intuitions in court decisions and legislative reforms are found. This paper explores the effects of these tax regimes. it shows that our common intuitions are sometimes misguided, since we tend to ignore cross-effects between crime and litigation. For example, contrary to commonly held views, it is shown that non-deductibility of monetary sanctions may increase the level of crime, if litigation expenses are deductible. In addition, if deductibility of legal expenses depends only on a successful trial outcome, this may also increase amounts spent on litigation and time allocated to crime. As this paper shows, however, a complete deductibility regime, under which both monetary sanctions and litigation expenditures are deductible, maintains the pre-tax levels of crime and litigation expenditures for risk-neutral offenders. The paper further explores the effects of different tax reforms. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Bidding rings develop in both auction environments. Three seller-active market structures are created in which sellers individually and repeatedly decide how many units to produce and bring to an auction. Auction designs have two or four sellers and two or four buyers. Bidding rings develop in two-buyer markets but falter because sellers reduce production sufficiently to destabilize the ring.

If owners are win-maximizing sportsmen instead, then revenue sharing can lead to increased competitive balance and higher payrolls. Evidence of the sportsman effect is provided by erosion of monopsonistic exploitation in the four major American sports leagues where players now share about 60% of revenues. Monopsony power erosion forces sports-league cartels to exploit statutory monopoly power in monster deals for media rights fees and public venue subsidies. New evidence on competitive balance suggests that revenue sharing leads to increased balance with or without team salary caps. Optimum competitive balance is an empirical question, and the answer lies between random competition of the NFL and deterministic dynasties of the NBA.","Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Econ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",Vanderbilt University,"Vrooman, J (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Econ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",john.vrooman@vanderbilt.edu,,,,,,,17,43,52,5,48,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

The analysis and control of these processes largely depend on precise determination of the level of market concentration. Additive measures, evaluating the whole concentration curve, assess market concentration most effectively. The analysis shows that all currently used measures, including the most widely used Herfindahl index, have some limitations and, therefore, cannot adequately describe the market state. This index is still widely used because it is easy to calculate. However, now, when calculation is computer-aided, this argument has hardly any sense. A possibility to assess the state of the market much more accurately, searching for new, more precise measures, has sense now. The accuracy of some particular measures may be defined by the total difference between the relative value of market criterion bearers in the market and their value calculated by the formula of a particular concentration measure.","[Ginevicius, Romualdas; Cirba, Stasys] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Ginevicius, R (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",romualdas.ginevicius@adm.vgtu.lt; jmmat@fm.vgtu.lt,,"Ginevicius, Romualdas/0000-0003-2067-4398",,,,,16,29,30,6,23,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

This paper focuses on the restructuring of urban society and the related neighbourhood changes in Vienna from 1971 to 2001. The study applies social area analysis and factorial ecology to identify the underlying dimensions in the formation of socio-spatial patterns and neighbourhood change through a cross-sectional analysis. The analysis does not directly reveal a trend towards spatial polarisation but rather supports the concept of emerging structural differentiations in a 'quartered city'. Social housing policies on entitlements and the city's withdrawal as a housing developer just as it was embarking on subsidised urban renewal have contributed to an accentuation of structural differences. Extending the analysis to the Vienna metropolitan region indicates that suburbanisation is reinforcing a socio-spatial polarisation within the city proper, exacerbated by the territorial fragmentation of social housing policies between the city and its suburban region.","Univ Vienna, Dept Geog & Reg Res, A-1010 Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Hatz, G (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Dept Geog & Reg Res, Univ Str 7, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",gerhard.hatz@univie.ac.at,,,,,,,30,22,22,1,36,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0040-747X,,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

The most recent manifestation is the 'Entrepreneurial University', which engages with industry through various knowledge transfer programs, and seeks to commercialise its research output. One of the consequences is increases in patenting of university research Output. However, both the number and proportion of exploited patents is small. The primary aim of this paper is to explain why some patents are exploited, through, spin-off formations and/or through licensing to established companies, while others are not. This involved exploring the factors and actors in the patenting and commercialising patents in a university in Scotland, to understand the different outcomes. In total, 22 patents from a portfolio of 82 were studied. The study employed qualitative methods incorporating a case study approach. Two samples of patents from the University patents portfolio, one comprising patents that were commercially exploited, and the other comprising unexploited patents, were examined. Exploited patents were those that were licensed to established companies, and those that were used to start new spin-off companies. This study was then supplemented with interviews with the TTO director of the University and seven other university TTO Directors. The study finds that, whether a patent is commercially exploited, and the way in which it is exploited is influenced by three main factors: (i) the entrepreneurs and the inventors, their characteristics and motivations; (ii) the characteristics and nature of the technologies; and (iii) the TTO's resources and lack of a due diligence system. The study finally suggests proposals for how TTOs can enhance their decision-making process, regarding which discoveries to patent in order to improve the overall effectiveness of commercialisation process in universities.",,,,m-maria@utm.my; Colin.mason@strath.ac.uk; Sarah@edin.ac.uk; wanzaidi@fkm.utm.my; izaidin@utem.edu.my,,,,,,,40,53,53,1,12,CHINA WATERPOWER PRESS-CWPP,BEIJING,"6 SANLIHELU, FUXINGMENWAI, BEIJING, 100044, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5084-6533-3,,,,2009,,,,,,,2,10,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BNO72,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275143800001,0

These studies typically identify multiple factors that are behind the emergence of large and successful firms in particular national clusters. However, there has been relatively little research identifying whether such factors are all collectively necessary to produce the outcome, or whether only a few of the factors in different combinations might be sufficient to generate the shift in competitive advantage manifested in the market power of large flagship firms. In this paper, we study the evolution of one industry across six countries in which the competitive position of national firms changed considerably during our 100-year analysis period. The results of our combined historical and fuzzy-set analyses show that an unequal distribution of resources may lead to alternative causal pathways to competitive advantage of the largest firms.","[Jarvinen, Joonas; Lamberg, Juha-Antti] Aalto Univ, Dept Ind Management, Helsinki, Finland; [Murmann, Johan-Peter] Univ New S Wales, AGSM Australian Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Ojala, Jari] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Hist & Ethnol, SF-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland",Aalto University; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Jyvaskyla,"Järvinen, J (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Dept Ind Management, Helsinki, Finland.",joonas.jarvinen@tkk.fi,"Ojala, Jari/HSF-0159-2023; Murmann, Johann Peter/B-7537-2009; Lamberg, Juha-Antti/E-4226-2013; Lamberg, Juha-Antti/P-4517-2019; Murmann, Johann Peter/AAM-5955-2020","Lamberg, Juha-Antti/0000-0003-3173-0199; Murmann, Johann Peter/0000-0003-1631-3012; Ojala, Jari/0000-0002-4348-8857",,,,,94,16,18,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Therefore, strong competitive position in the global market can be attained only by countries that are developing knowledge-based economy (KBE) the main element of which is high quality of human capital. The present paper is aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of human capital management in Polish economy in the period 1990-2007, i.e. from the beginning of systemic transformation to the world crisis. As the evaluation of the aforementioned capital is disputable, competitive position achieved by Polish economy in the European Union was adopted as a measure of management effectiveness. Because Poland's integration into the European Union in 2004 is tantamount to the implementation of EU strategy for creating knowledge-based economy, the evaluation of competitive position may be at the same time the evaluation of the extent to which Poland is becoming involved in the creation of the aforementioned economy.","Szczecin Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Microecon, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland",University of Szczecin,"Kopycinska, D (通讯作者)，Szczecin Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Microecon, 64 Mickiewicza Str, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland.",danutak@wneiz.pl,,,,,,,41,5,5,1,12,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Policies that promote early development of management plans and cooperation with neighbors are recommended because these activities appear to increase the likelihood that landowners will convey conservation easements. Education and a strong environmental ethic also improve the chances that respondents would sell conservation easements. A prediction-based contingent valuation format designed to reduce incentives for strategic behavior suggests that our results likely represent a lower bound estimate of landowner response to a large-scale conservation easement program.

Do the actions of multinationals create more diversity within national systems, do they reduce diversity or do they have relatively little impact on diversity within national systems? The article argues that there are distinctive structures of institutional diversity across different national systems. Therefore, the question is not how do MNCs impact on institutional diversity per se but how do they impact on these different structures of diversity? In order to develop this argument, the article also differentiates types of multinational. The article uses the distinction between market-seeking, resource-seeking, efficiency-seeking and strategic asset-seeking in order to identify a range of different MNC activity across manufacturing, professional and financial sectors. These different sorts of MNC activity vary across time and contexts in terms of their significance. The article looks in detail at four different models of capitalism and examines how the entry of different sorts of multinationals with distinctive objectives impacts on the relationships between key social actors which underpin and reinforce these models. In this way, it suggests how institutional diversity within different types of capitalism may evolve under the impact of MNCs and globalization.","Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Morgan, G (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",Glenn.Morgan@wbs.ac.uk,,,,,,,69,40,43,3,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The results of the assessment described in this paper show that entrepreneurship research in China's academic community has started to produce results, and a number of relatively influential scholars and institutions dedicated to entrepreneurship research have emerged; as a result, fostering ecosystems have been formed in the field of entrepreneurship research. Nevertheless, the standard and influence of Chinese scholars and entrepreneurship research remain highly uneven, and many higher-learning institutions have yet to start entrepreneurship education and research. Moreover, entrepreneurship research tends to be narrow in perspective and limited in scope, and scholars and institutions rarely collaborate with one another in entrepreneurship research.","[Mu, Zhirong; Li, Yinlu; Jin, Yu] Xiamen Univ, Sch Management, Xiamen, Peoples R China",Xiamen University,,muzhir@xmu.edu.cn; liyin@xmu.edu.cn,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,1,CHINA WATERPOWER PRESS-CWPP,BEIJING,"6 SANLIHELU, FUXINGMENWAI, BEIJING, 100044, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5084-6533-3,,,,2009,,,,,,,431,436,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BNO72,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275143800051,0

At the same time historical paths and traditions, embeddedness of local actors and institutional factors have all become significant in explaining different neighbourhood trajectories and, particularly, the patterns of urban segregation that emerge following economic restructuring. Given the unusual nature of the Spanish housing model and the massive arrival of immigrants since the end of the 1990s, this paper explores the urban effects of immigration settlement patterns in the context of a market dominated by owner-occupation and a unique framework of social housing policy. Purchase of permanent residences is an essential step in the housing careers of the Spanish population but also for immigrants to Spain. The paper analyses the extent to which this influences urban segregation patterns and neighbourhood characteristics in Spain. Barcelona is referred to as a case study, to illustrate the influence of the existing housing system in the process of the accommodation of newcomers.","Univ Barcelona, Dept Teoria Econ, Fac Econ Empresa, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Pareja-Eastaway, M (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Teoria Econ, Fac Econ Empresa, Avinguda Diagonal,696 3A Planta, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",mpareja@ub.edu,"PAREJA-EASTAWAY, MONTSERRAT/B-3815-2015","PAREJA-EASTAWAY, MONTSERRAT/0000-0002-4031-0949",,,,,46,23,24,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

This includes other issues relevant for the society as well. The achievement of these goals is feasible by scientific method of analysis incorporated by activities of economic policy based on fundaments of modern theory. This refers to its fiscal and monetary content in particular and their modern pragmatism. The results of the research show that the causes of recession and economic crisis in Croatia only partly refer to the external origin, and are dominated by internal factors. Among those factors the crucial one is the application of the so called stabilization program in 1993 and related policy of overvalued and stable exchange rate. The main conclusion of the research is that it is necessary to abandon the neoliberal concept of economic policy and its monetarist content (anchor policy). Without such an action it is not possible to stop recession and direct production towards recovery.","[Sever, Ivo] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka 51000, Croatia; [Sever, Ivo] Sci Soc Economists, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Rijeka,,sever@efri.hr,,,,,,,51,5,5,0,5,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

We present the results of an empirical Study that uses data from 678-837 games of three seasons of the German premier soccer league. Prediction markets and betting odds perform equally well in terms of forecasting accuracy, but both methods strongly outperform tipsters. A weighting-based combination of the forecasts of these methods leads to a slightly higher forecast accuracy, whereas a rule-based combination improves forecast accuracy substantially. However, none of the forecasts leads to systematic monetary gains in betting markets because of the high fees (25%) charged by the state-owned bookmaker in Germany.

This paper aims to help address the above research gap by examining the respective role of two aspects of national culture (i.e. collectivism and long-term orientation) and two aspects of firm culture (i.e. organisational diversity and shared vision) on firms' new product outcomes. Drawing on quantitative data collected from 150 UK and 250 Chinese high-tech firms, we find that shared vision significantly contributes to speed-to-market, radical and incremental innovation in both UK and Chinese firms. Furthermore, collectivism has a significant impact on radical and incremental innovation outcomes in UK firms, whilst long-term orientation and organisational diversity significantly influences radical and incremental innovation in Chinese firms, respectively. The findings have important theoretical and practical implications.","[Wang, Catherine L.] Univ London, Sch Management, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England",University of London; Royal Holloway University London,,catherine.wang@rhul.ac.uk; m.rafiq@lboro.ac.uk,,,,,,,52,0,0,0,7,CHINA WATERPOWER PRESS-CWPP,BEIJING,"6 SANLIHELU, FUXINGMENWAI, BEIJING, 100044, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5084-6533-3,,,,2009,,,,,,,254,262,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BNO72,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275143800031,0

Inevitably, as the inherent defect of non-government organizations, voluntary failure is featured by philanthropic insufficiency, amateurism, patriarchal style, particularity, etc. Those associated factors, if not well managed, will ultimately cause fund-raising bottleneck of non-government organizations. Therefore, the actions taken to resolve fund-raising bottleneck are what we should do to govern voluntary failure. The governance is in need of external supports, supports from government, in particular, which deal with lowering threshold for registration, raising funds, increasing tax preference, improving philanthropy and strengthening restraint mechanism on the development of non-government organizations. Moreover, it is necessary to introduce market mechanism and operating concepts, such as cooperation on funds and service between non-government organizations and government organizations by openly bidding, the encouragement of developing social businesses to increase their earnings, the introduction of market concepts of management and marketing, and the development and the improvement of service efficiency of all resources in a maximum manner.","[Yang Fang-fang] Xiamen Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China",Xiamen University,,yangfangfangany@yahoo.com.cn,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,WORLD ACAD UNION-WORLD ACAD PRESS,LIVERPOOL,"113, ACADEMIC HOUSE, MILL LANE, WAVERTREE TECHNOLOGY PARK, LIVERPOOL, L13 4 AH, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84626-072-8,,,,2009,,,,,,,121,124,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BQE61,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280792600027,0

It is the intention of this paper to identify what is the opinion of our academics about lite research activity in our university, how do they appreciate the evaluation system of the academic research and how do they consider that this system can be improved. A qualitative research (based on focus-group and in-depth interviews) was conducted in order to find out answers to these questions. The conclusions reveal a resistance that academics from Bucharest University of Economics have against academic research for many reasons. The evaluation system is considered to be too restrictive by academics from this university, however, academics from Bucharest University of Economics are in favor of an evaluation system of academic research which does not differ significantly from the systems used in other universities.

We show, first, that the types of scientific frauds that are observed are unlikely to be representative of the overall amount of malfeasance; also, star scientists are more likely to misbehave but less likely to be caught than average scientists. Second, a reduction in fraud verification costs may not lead to a reduction of misconduct episodes but rather to a change in the type of research that is performed. Third, a strong publish or perish pressure may reduce, and not increase, scientific misconduct because it motivates more scrutiny.

This research analyzes travel/activity patterns of 130 engineering freshman students at a rural university in Thailand. An analysis of travel/activity data shows that vehicle ownership seems to play an important role in university student's time utilization on various activities. It was found that those students who own a vehicle tend to spend less time for academic purposes, and more on leisure and social activities than non-owner students. Nevertheless, a further study using regression analysis on academic performance shows that the ownership of a vehicle does not seem to have a significant impact on the grade point average of students, once the cognitive ability and gender are accounted for. The findings imply that campus policies/measures that restrict the ownership or usage of a private vehicle in rural universities would improve the campus learning environment by influencing university students to put more attention on school-related activities, but such policies do not seem to impact on the academic performance of the college students.

The indicator is based on factors extracted from consumption-related search categories of the Google Trends application Insights for Search. The forecasting performance of the new indicator is assessed relative to the two most common survey-based indicators: the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index and the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index.

Financially distressed defendants suffer lower stock returns. We find that politically connected defendants are favored in the judicial process: they have higher stock returns and are more likely to appeal against adverse outcomes and to obtain a favorable appeal result.

Assuming that attitudes to cars develop in childhood, this article draws upon the writing assignments and interviews exploring the upper-elementary school children's attitudes to cars. The study was conducted in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, between January and December 2010. Briefly examining existing research on children's environmental attitudes in general, and in relation to cars in particular, the author argues that in-depth qualitative research is essential to the understanding of the factors that explain present attitudes and perhaps predicting the behavior of the future users of the means of transportation. In conclusion, the author makes a recommendation for the development of a curriculum addressing the development of children's awareness of sustainable transportation. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The shift from a 'locally originate and locally-hold' model of mortgage provision to a securitised 'locally originate and globally distribute' model meant that when local subprime mortgage markets collapsed in the USA, the repercussions were felt globally. At the same time, the global credit crunch and the deep recession the global financial crisis precipitated have had locally varying impacts and consequences.

The correlation, regression and multivariate factor analyses are applied to test the associations between the selected structural variables of energy intensity consumption, economic efficiency, and the main driving forces behind these developments. Economic efficiency is positively associated with expenditures on research and development (R&D) and a greater technological intensity of exports, while at the same time the economic efficiency of R&D expenditures and technological intensity of exports reduce the energy intensity consumption of the economy. The results suggest that management strategies and policies directed towards R&D expenditures, human capital investments, and technologically intensive export oriented products are improving economic efficiency performance and contributing to energy saving sustainable economic development. The technological intensity of products reduces energy consumption, which is related to restructuring of energy intensive industries into more advanced and energy saving ones with higher value added per unit of product, but with lower energy consumption per unit of product.","[Bojnec, Stefan] Univ Primorska, Fac Management Koper, SI-6104 Koper, Slovenia; [Papler, Drago] Electro Gorenjska, SI-4000 Kranj, Slovenia",University of Primorska,"Bojnec, S (通讯作者)，Univ Primorska, Fac Management Koper, Cankarjeva 5, SI-6104 Koper, Slovenia.",stefan.bojnec@fm-kp.si; drago.papler@gorenjske-elektrarne.si,"Bojnec, Stefan/AFG-8313-2022","Bojnec, Stefan/0000-0002-1270-6372",,,,,43,32,34,1,40,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Such prohibitions are usually based on the economic grounds that monopolistic pricing is likely to occur in the long run, causing harm to competition and consumers. The first assumption under scrutiny is that customers will accept monopolistic prices during the subsequent phase of recoupment, even though they have become accustomed to low prices during the price war. The second assumption is that no competitor will (re-)enter the market in this subsequent phase. Our two experiments indicate that both assumptions are not backed up by actual decision making by either consumers or competitors.

In the general population, the law did not affect moral attitudes toward prostitution. However, in the Norwegian capital, where prostitution was more visible before the reform, the law made people more negative toward buying sex. This supports the claim that proximity and visibility are important factors for the internalization of legal norms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Results were: 47%,predominantly females, showed evidence of depression whose intensity was distributed as light 73.1%, moderate 18%, moderate-to-serious 7.3% and severe, 1.6%, with a statistically significant tendency toward the initial semesters of medical studies in light depression/semester I (X-2=16.19, Co-Yt=15.07, P=0.0001); moderate depression/semester I (X-2=5.84, Co-Yt=4.80, P=0.01); light depression/semester II (X-2=16.79, Co-Yt=15.25, P=0.0000). Conclusions are that it would be important to design and apply a psychological intervention plan in order to safeguard the mental health of young university students.","[Tortolero Low, Leonardo Jose] Univ Nacl Expt Francisco de Miranda, Ctr Invest Biomed, Coro, Estado Falcon, Venezuela; [Tortolero Low, Leonardo Jose] Univ Nacl Expt Francisco de Miranda, Asesor Inst Unidad Desarrollo Estudiantil, Coro, Estado Falcon, Venezuela; [Calzolaio Cristofano, Antonina] Univ Nacl Expt Francisco De Miranda Coro Falcon, Dept Asesoramiento & Orientac, Coro, Venezuela; [Calzolaio Cristofano, Antonina] Univ Nacl Expt Francisco De Miranda Coro Falcon, Direcc Desarrollo Estudiantil, Coro, Venezuela",,"Low, LJT (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Expt Francisco de Miranda, Ctr Invest Biomed, Coro, Estado Falcon, Venezuela.",tortoleroleonardo@gmail.com; antoninacalzolaio@yahoo.es,,,,,,,54,1,1,0,5,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

Considering exceptional riskiness of marketing, the solution of marketing efficiency problems is not separable from identification of risks, influencing marketing, and their management strategies development. Integrated analysis of marketing efficiency and risk management problems is performed in two ways. First, a marketing risks portfolio management situation is analysed in such a way that resources, intended for risk management, are distributed among the means of decreasing value at risk in such a manner that the overall value of risk, i.e. the resultant of all risk values, would be minimal. Second, based on the expert efficiency estimates for a unit of costs in every element of marketing structure, a distribution of costs is pursued which would uphold the best increase of marketing-generated marginal utility. To find the solution, imitative modeling and stochastic optimization methods are used.","[Rutkauskas, Aleksandras Vytautas; Ginevicius, Adomas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Rutkauskas, AV (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",ar@vgtu.lt; adomas888@gmail.com,,,,,,,27,14,14,0,29,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The major distinction-which is not clearly stated in most research-is between the metaphorical description of some type of interaction across organizational boundaries, or whether the term refers to specific social structures between organizations. Whereas the metaphorical approach has previously dominated research, there has been a rise in the use of more structured and quantifiable research, most notably in the use of social network analysis. However, this has not been without serious theoretical and methodological issues. Most notably, a number of the concepts, methods and theories used within the field of inter-organizational networks originate from research in interpersonal and intra-organizational networks where some of the methodological issues (e. g. unit of analysis and boundary specification) are more easily addressed. In order to map the different methodological approaches in the field of inter-organizational networks, this paper presents a large-scale systematic literature review of the last 12 years' research on inter-organizational networks, with a focus on the methodological features. Some of the main variables relate to the unit of analysis, whether social network analysis is applied and what concept of a network is involved. The main findings of this paper are that few of the previous studies have used the full methodological (and thus theoretical) scope of the available data, the most cited papers and those appearing in top-ranked journals are more prone to using social network analysis than papers in general and there is a recent tendency among influential papers to go beyond a narrow application of social network analysis, and rely on multiplex relational data and whole networks.","[Bergenholtz, Carsten; Waldstrom, Christian] Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Adm Business & Social Sci, DK-8210 Aarhus, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Bergenholtz, C (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Adm Business & Social Sci, Haslegaardsvej 10, DK-8210 Aarhus, Denmark.",cabe@asb.dk,,"Waldstrom, Christian/0000-0003-2719-010X; Bergenholtz, Carsten/0000-0002-6020-561X",,,,,90,80,100,5,160,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

This study was undertaken to examine the feasibility of recycling coloured wastewater from polyamide dyeing with acid dyes in new preparation phases, after removing colour using hydrogen peroxide activated with catalysts from resins functionalized with amines and saturated with Fe (III). Analysing the wastewater colour removal process, it has been found that the efficiency of the discolouration is high. Subsequently, wastewater from real dyeing and after dyeing rinsing processes have been discoloured using the tested technology, and the treated water has been recycled as it is or mixed with fresh water (1:1) in new degreasing/washing (scouring) phases of polyamide fabric preparation. High degrees of whiteness and small colour differences have been obtained, especially for one of the studied dyes. For the second dye, although the obtained degree of whiteness was high, the calculated colour difference was higher then 1 unit in most cases. Better results were obtained using treated wastewater mixed with fresh water. It was concluded that hydrogen peroxide catalysed oxidation process can remove efficiently the colour from polyamide dyeing wastewater, obtaining improved water quality that is suitable for reuse in textile preparation stages such as scouring.","[Bertea, A-F.; Butnariu, A.; Bertea, A.] Gheorghe Asachi Tech Univ Iasi, Iasi, Romania",GH Asachi Technical University,,afbertea@tex.tuiasi.ro; anca_butnariu2001@yahoo.com; ani_bertea@yahoo.co.uk,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,3,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-3-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,17,20,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI19,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306940000005,0

Six hypotheses are tested. The focus is on possible non-linear effect of R&D on trade flows and whether R&D helps overcome the distance and the role of level of economic development on manufacturing trade. The panel unit root test and panel econometric methods are employed on the adapted gravity trade model using the panel data for Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries during the period 1995-2003. The results of the research indicate that R&D is positively associated with manufacturing trade for exporting countries, while results are mixed for importing countries. The results reject the non-linear relationship between R&D and manufacturing exports. Estimations suggest that R&D may contribute to overcoming the effects of distance on manufacturing exports and may strengthen import specialization.

As around the globe, the opening up to the global market and the construction of a modern legal system led in China to a new identity politics and a foregrounding of cultural citizenship as an arena of governance and a political struggle for rights. My interest is here the interrelation between a 'civilizing' project of the neosocialist state to create law-abiding, formally equal citizens, and a new, self-propelled law activism among Chinese 'peasants' who seek to appropriate the law not just to defend themselves against the infringements of local governments on their 'civil rights' or even 'human rights', but to recreate themselves as peasants, citizens and political subjects, as new subjects for rights. I will argue that such citizenship struggles can be explored only with reference to the historical formation of governance in a given place; in this case with reference to Maoism, its political split between peasants and urbanites, and a particular formulation of citizenship that I call 'transcendental'.","Univ Oslo, Dept Social Anthropol, N-0317 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Brandtstädter, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Social Anthropol, Postbox 1091 Blindern, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.",susanne.brandtstadter@sai.uio.no,,"Brandtstadter, Susanne/0000-0002-4458-9289",,,,,25,21,22,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The authors are deeply involved in the study of the entrepreneurship phenomenon as a factor of economic and social development, a lot of works and researches have been done for past five years dedicated to the concept of entrepreneurship. Most of the studies rely on the psychological dimension of the entrepreneur, since there is a lack of information regarding the factors related to business friendly environment. Especially in Romania there is a strong need of good practice in the case of supportive factors for entrepreneurship, a change of patterns regarding the sources of sustainable development, and tools for the management of change. The paper underlines the principles of intrapreneurship community and assesses the impact on a particular project, involving stakeholders related to business development. The material support was provided by a study on the field, in France - region Alsace, where communities strive to change the former behavior towards small businesses. The case study will allow us to draw a map of influences and to evaluate the impact of the supportive initiatives, useful to conceive a know-how transfer platform, emphasizing the pro-change factors versus resistance to change. The present paper is a part of a research project, started with the entrepreneurship competences and features, and will contribute to refine a complex work regarding entrepreneurship as a key factor for the development of a nation. Compared to other studies, rather journalistic, we are proposing a scientific approach to define an algorithm capable to be applied within the Romanian economic environment. Moreover, we intend to launch a debate about the management of change in public policies regarding the intrapreneurship community.","[Ciucan-Rusu, Liviu] Petru Maior Univ Tirgu Mures, Targu Mures, Romania","George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science, & Technology of Targu Mures",,liviu@liviuciucan.ro; gheorghezaman@ien.ro,"CIUCAN-RUSU, LIVIU/HKO-5187-2023; Pereira, Fernanda/AID-4926-2022","CIUCAN-RUSU, LIVIU/0000-0003-2566-2644;",,,,,29,0,0,0,9,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-2-3,,,,2011,,,,,,,125,128,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI18,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306939900032,0

The research literature has suggested that trip-making behaviour has grown increasingly complex as modern life has become busier and people grow time-poor. Complex trip chains have been said to require flexible travel modes, and for this reason some research has suggested that public transport is limited in this regard compared to the private car. Results of this study show that between 1994 and 1999 the complexity of trip chains was relatively stable and the complexity of chains was found to be larger for rail and tram than for car-based trips. Disaggregate analyses compare the complexity of chains based on work versus non-work chains, the purpose of stops on the chain, and whether the chain entered the central city of Melbourne or not. Overall these findings suggest a less bleak outlook for public transport ridership in a travel future which is said to be becoming more complex. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

It is built up as an economic theory as late as the end of thirties of the last century. The notion that the Englis teleological school was formed in Czechoslovakia already in the twentieth of the 20th century is not entirely exact. Karel Englis grouped together his adherents just in the second half of the thirties of the 20th century. These adherents developed his teaching. They were the direct followers of his work. A range of significant personalities belonged to the Englis teleology school: Jan Loevenstein, Alois Kral, Vaclav Chytil, Milos Horna, Frantisek Zeman, Jan Siblik, Vladimir Vybral and others. The teaching of Englis teleology school penetrated meantime to most of the Czech universities in the second half of the thirties of the 20th century.

We operationalize absorptive capacity as a multi-item construct which considers social capital and some organizational features. Open-approach to innovation is interpreted as an approach achievable in continuum in terms of intensity of collaboration with partners. Innovative performance considers several factors: the enlargement of the company's competence base and the improvement of the time to market. On the basis of data collected from 106 Italian companies, we find that a low level of absorptive capacity impacts negatively on the firm orientation in adopting a more open approach. We also study the relationship between openness and firm innovative performance: this relation is positively moderated by absorptive capacity. This suggests that openness is not critical per se to enhance innovative performance and that a favourable social-organizational context is needed to make collaboration a success.","[Lazzarotti, Valentina; Manzini, Raffaella] Carlo Cattaneo Univ LIUC, Management Engn, Castellanza, Italy; [Pellegrini, Luisa] Univ Pisa, Dept Engn Energy & Syst, Pisa, Italy",Universita Carlo Cattaneo - Liuc; University of Pisa,"Lazzarotti, V (通讯作者)，Carlo Cattaneo Univ LIUC, Management Engn, Castellanza, Italy.",vlazzarotti@liuc.it; rmanzini@liuc.it; Luisa.Pellegrini@dsea.unipi.it,"Lazzarotti, Valentina/AAA-2956-2022; Lazzarotti, Valentina/JED-3346-2023",,,,,,30,0,0,0,10,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,559,569,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800068,0

We also underline unique Chinese features, including forward engineering (i.e. the role of university spin-off firms) in contrast to reverse engineering, acquisition of technology and brands through international mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and parallel learning from foreign direct investment (FDI) to promote indigenous companies. These features comprise the Beijing model because they were not explicitly adopted by either Korea or Taiwan. At the macro and aggregate levels, we find that China follows the East Asian sequencing rather than the Washington Consensus. We also discuss several challenges facing China, such as design capabilities and localization of intermediate parts.

In particular, due to cost reasons, they may not be fully informed of their oindirect tieso, that is, of the ties between their partners and other firms. To investigate this issue, the paper uses a survey inquiring about whether firms are aware of the ties that their main direct RD partners may (or may not) have between themselves. Our results show that responding firms are more informed about their partners' other collaboration projects when the partnership is more directly linked to intangible RD capital, when at least one partner is a public research organization or when the partnership is needed to access a new market. Network awareness is also higher when both RD partners are from the same type (e.g. public research organization, companies, technical centers). Firms with a high RD intensity or with a large size, as well as those affiliated to a group, are less likely to know their indirect ties. Finally, network awareness is lower in high-technology industries.","[Lhuillery, Stephane] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Coll Management Technol, MTEI CEMI, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Pfister, Etienne] BETA Univ Nancy, Nancy, France; [Pfister, Etienne] CNRS, Nancy, France; [Pfister, Etienne] Minist Enseignement Super & Rech DGESIP DGRI SIES, Paris, France; [Pfister, Etienne] Autor Concurrence, Paris, France",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Universite de Lorraine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Lhuillery, S (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Coll Management Technol, MTEI CEMI, Odyssea 1-18,Stn 5, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",stephane.lhuillery@epfl.ch,,,,,,,67,9,9,0,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

It is natural to assume that technological processes have appeared as a result of research. In changing of production function only those technological processes are of importance which are better than their predecessors, so one can use a special branch of Probability Theory Statistics of Extremes. In the ideas model proposed by Jones (2005) ideas are coefficients of labor efficiency and capital efficiency of a Leontieff production function. The coefficients are drawn from Pareto distribution, moreover, the distributions describing the efficiencies of labor and capital are independent. Jones receives in asymptotics a Cobb-Douglas production function. A non-asymptotic result is received under an assumption that arrival of ideas is drawn from Poisson distribution. In the present paper a non-asymptotic result is received without any assumptions of poissonity. Also it is demonstrated that the type of production function depends on probability distribution in the ideas model. Assuming that in the Jones' ideas model efficiencies of labor and capital are drawn from exponential distribution we come to a different type of production function - the CES function.","[Matveenko, Andrei] St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Probabil Theory & Stat, Fac Math & Mech, St Petersburg, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University,,andrei.v.matve@gmail.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-77-5,,,,2011,,,,,,,368,380,,,,,,13,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDJ83,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000313565200037,0

The purpose of this paper is to contribute to this debate and broaden understanding about what the term might actually mean. To do so we consider what goes on between entrepreneurial firms and their environments so that service innovations are brought about. We argue that through environmental enactment and organisational learning, entrepreneurial firms actively 'generate' service innovations and turn ideas into purposeful changes in the way services are delivered. They do this by developing and acting upon a deep and interactive understanding of their customers as well as their wider environments. We therefore propose that service innovation is best understood as a highly social process whereby firms seek to improve their performance based on interactive knowledge acquisition, reflective interpretation and learning.","[McKeever, Edward; Jack, Sarah; Soetanto, Danny] Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England",Lancaster University,,e.mckeever@lancaster.ac.uk; s.l.jack@lancaster.ac.uk; d.soetanto@lancaster.ac.uk,"Soetanto, Danny/ABF-2842-2022; jack, sarah l/S-6710-2017","Soetanto, Danny/0000-0002-9168-5118;",,,,,52,0,0,0,5,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,637,645,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800077,0

We relate NTBF creation to the local availability of human capital (local competences) and to the local accessibility of distant competences through communication infrastructures. We argue that local competences and communication infrastructures have a differential impact on NTBF creation in manufacturing and service industries due to the diverse productive characteristics of the sectors. In particular, we claim that local competences have a more positive effect on manufacturing, whereas communication infrastructures affect services more. Findings from the estimations of econometric models on the Italian provinces are in line with these predictions. The moderating effects of local economic and technological development on the inquired relationships are also considered. Whereas economic development seems to weaken the effect of local competences in manufacturing and reinforce that of communication infrastructures in services, technological development has no moderating effects.","[Piva, Evila; Grilli, Luca; Rossi-Lamastra, Cristina] Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, I-20156 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Piva, E (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, Via Lambruschini 4-B, I-20156 Milan, Italy.",evila.piva@polimi.it,"Grilli, Luca/K-6348-2017","Grilli, Luca/0000-0003-4550-9276",,,,,62,18,19,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1366-2716,,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Survival for a single-branch family is approximated by a Pareto distribution and consumption policies exhibit decreasing discount rates, but multiple-branch families use non-monotonic discount rates. When trust distributions depend on the number of beneficiaries rather than the survival of the whole family unit, spending paths depend on expected membership and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution.

An analysis of resulting income elasticity estimates revealed that households consider religious giving a necessity good at all levels of income, while other categories of giving are generally found to be luxury goods. Further, those who gave to religion were found to give more to education and charity then those not giving to religion, and higher education households were more likely to give to religion than households with less education. This analysis suggests that there may be more to religious giving behavior than has been assumed in prior studies and underscores the need for further research into the motivation for religious giving.

We focus on the relative merits of different methods of aggregating individual forecasts, the advantages of heterogeneity in group memberships, the impact of others' opinions on group members, and the importance of perceptions of trust. We conclude that a change of opinion following group-based deliberation is most likely to be appropriate where the group membership is heterogeneous, the minority opinion is protected from pressure to conform, information exchange between group members has been facilitated, and the recipient of the advice is able by reasoning processes to evaluate the reasoning justifying the proffered advice. Proffered advice is least likely to be accepted where the advisor is not trusted an evaluation which is based on the advisor having different perceived values to the recipient and being thought to be self-interested. In contrast, the outcome of a group-based deliberation is most likely to be accepted when there is perceived to be procedural fairness and the participants in the process are perceived to be trustworthy. Finally, we broaden our discussion of group-based forecasting to include a consideration of other group-based methodologies which are aimed at enhancing judgment and decision making. In particular, we discuss the relevance of research on small-group decision making, the nature and quality of the advice, group-based scenario planning, and public engagement processes. From this analysis, we conclude that, for medium- to long-term judgemental forecasting, a variety of non-outcome criteria need to be considered in the evaluation of alternative group-based methods.

We show that this pattern can prevail for two reasons: regulatory capture and consumer co-optation. We consider a decision-theoretic model of dynamic product approval by an uncertain regulator. The model predicts early entrant protection even when later entrants offer quality improvements over market incumbents. We then test the model using duration analyses of New Drug Application approval times for 1080 new molecular entities submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from 1950 to 2006 and later approved. FDA approval times are shown to be increasing in order of market entry for the entire period studied and across numerous subsamples. A standard deviation rise in the log of order of entry is associated with a 3.6-month increase in expected FDA approval time. The entry-order gradient appears to be heavily influenced by disease-level variables but not by firm-level effects, supporting a consumer co-optation explanation and disfavoring capture and producer rent-seeking accounts. The gradient appears heightened by the 1962 Kefauver-Harris Amendments but unaffected by the 1992 Prescription Drug User Fee Act; the influence of some disease-level factors upon the gradient may have been reduced by the 1992 statute.","[Carpenter, Daniel] Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rynbrandt, Ryan T.] Collin Cty Community Coll, Collin Cty, TX USA; [Ting, Michael M.] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Zucker, Evan James] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; Columbia University; Harvard University,"Carpenter, D (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",dcarpenter@gov.harvard.edu,"Ting, Michael M/IYT-3438-2023",,,,,,44,12,15,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

The traffic analysis made a comparison of traffic characteristics during an off-peak day time at a selected intersection when the countdown timer was in operation against when it was switched off. A public opinion survey was conducted on more than 300 local regular drivers who are familiar with the technology. It was found that the presence of the countdown timers at the intersection would help to reduce the start-up lost time at the beginning of the green phase by 22%, and reduce the number of red-light violations during the beginning of the red phase by 50%. Furthermore, more than half of the local drivers reported that the timers help to relieve the frustration caused by stopping for uncertain amounts of time during the red phase. However, the timer was also found to slightly reduce the saturation flow rate during the green phase. The public opinion survey showed that the majority of the local drivers were favorable towards the system, and would support the municipality installing such devices on the street network.

I find that a more active court system is associated with more investment, more adoption of technology, more innovation, and more complex transactions. Specifically, when a higher percentage of business disputes are resolved through the court system, firms tend to have higher investment rates, higher propensities to adopt new automated technology, and higher probabilities of developing new products. In addition, they tend to have more nonlocal sales. These findings are consistent with a sophisticated version of the rights hypothesis, in which the rule of law eventually replaces relation-based governance as a superior governance mechanism. I find two limitations of China's legal system. The court system does a better job facilitating the growth of state-owned enterprises than of private firms, and it protects local firms better than nonlocal firms.","Colgate Univ, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA",Colgate University,"Long, CX (通讯作者)，Colgate Univ, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA.",,,,,,,,20,26,26,1,26,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

It asks if it is accurate to describe independent Ireland as poor before 1950, arguing that Ireland became poor in comparative terms only during the 1950s. While agreeing with the view that Ireland changed during the 1960s, the main contention of this article is that modernisation was severely constrained between 1959 and 1989 by the continuing dominance of traditional interests and attitudes. It also argues that Ireland's poor economic performance was a consequence of this continuity as successive governments, privileged property owners and rural interests dominated other sectors of society.

Business failure prediction (BFP) is a forecasting tool that helps people make more precise decisions. CBR-based BFP is a hot topic in today's global financial crisis. Case representation is critical when forecasting business failure with CBR. This research describes a pioneer investigation on hybrid case representation by employing principal component analysis (PCA), a feature extraction method, along with stepwise multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA), a feature selection approach. In this process, sample cases are represented with all available financial ratios, i.e., features. Next, the stepwise MDA is used to select optimal features to produce a reduced-case representation. Finally. PCA is employed to extract the final information representing the sample cases. All data signified by hybrid case representation are recorded in a case library, and the k-nearest-neighbor algorithm is used to make the forecasting. Thus we constructed a hybrid CBR (HCBR) by integrating hybrid case representation into the forecasting tool. We empirically tested the performance of HCBR with data collected for short-term BFP of Chinese listed companies. Empirical results indicated that HCBR can produce more promising prediction performance than MDA, logistic regression, classical CBR, and support vector machine.

Problems exist both with the evidence cited as supporting these accounts and with the relevance of the accounts to what is being explained. Based on the empathy-altruism hypothesis, a more plausible account is proposed: generalized parental nurturance. It is suggested that four evolutionary developments combined to provide a genetic basis for psychological altruism. First is the evolution in mammals of parental nurturance. Second is the evolution in humans (and possibly a few other species) of the ability to see others as sentient, intentional agents and, thereby, to recognize other's needs, even subtle ones. Third is the evolution in humans of tender, empathic emotions as an important component of parental nurturance. Fourth is the evolution in humans of cognitive capacities that make it possible to generalize tender, empathic feelings and, thereby, altruism beyond offspring.","Univ Kansas, Dept Psychol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",University of Kansas,"Batson, CD (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, Dept Psychol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",,,,,,,,49,25,31,1,31,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

Both health plans compete to attract policyholders on one side and providers on the other. The PPO, which is characterized by a higher diversity of providers, attracts riskier policyholders. Our two-sided framework allows us to examine the consequences of this risk segmentation on the providers' side, especially in terms of remuneration. The outcome of the competition depends mainly on two effects: a demand effect, influenced by the value put by policyholders on the providers access and an adverse selection effect, captured by the characteristics of the health risk distribution. If the adverse selection effect is too strong, the HMO receives a higher profit in equilibrium. On the contrary, if the demand effect dominates, the PPO profit is higher in spite of the unfavorable risk segmentation. We believe that by highlighting the two-sided market structure of the health plans' competition, our model provides a new insight to understand the increase in the PPOs' market share as observed in the USA during the last decade.","[Bardey, David] Univ Rosario Bogota, Bogota, Colombia; [Bardey, David; Rochet, Jean-Charles] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",Universidad del Rosario; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Bardey, D (通讯作者)，Univ Rosario Bogota, Bogota, Colombia.",david.bardey@urosario.edu.co; rochet@cict.fr,,,,,,,28,20,28,1,32,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1058-6407,,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Lottery-type questions elicited risk attitudes and time preferences from respondents in a street survey. Admitted violent behaviour was predictable on the basis of some of these responses. Consistent with the rational model, less risk averse and more impatient individuals were more liable to violence. Such people were also more likely to be victims of violence.

Prior innovation capability, the dominant functional career of the CEO, and the centralization and integration of the organizational structure during the t(1) period (1990-1992) are found to have a positive impact on innovation activities during the t(2) period (1993-1995), including research and development (R&D) intensity, technical manpower ratio, and the number of collaborative R&D projects. Innovation activities during the t2 period, in turn, increase the innovation performances during the same period, such as the number of patents, number of new products, and gain in labor productivity. This study also finds that the negative interaction of the centralization of organizational structure during the t1 period and the innovation activities during the t2 period affects innovation performances during the t2 period.

Where employment protection legislation allows dismissals only for good cause and imposes social criteria upon the employer's selection process in the event of redundancies, the average productivity of hireable workers is shown to improve. However, we find that the employers' reduced freedom of choice more than offsets the productivity increase of newly hired workers and job creation is deterred by employment protection legislation.

The Case of a Network in the Berlin-Brandenburg Optics Cluster,ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,cluster; network; optical technologies; path dependence; structuration theory,ECONOMIC-GEOGRAPHY; INNOVATION SYSTEMS; INCREASING RETURNS; EVOLUTION; CHALLENGES; KNOWLEDGE,"Much research on regional business clusters refers to path dependence as a central feature in the evolution of cluster structures. In many cases, however, little is known about the agentic processes and mechanisms that underlie path dependence. In this article, we explore changes in a specific network in the optics cluster in the German region of Berlin-Brandenburg to show that development of clusters can be driven by elements of both emergence and planning. In particular, we argue that current actors actively and purposively draw upon rules and resources that were shaped not only in the long and discontinuous history of the cluster but also in the recent process of network development that involves careful planning and well-structured planning tools. Using central concepts from structuration theory, we show how agency is implicated in the coordination of the network and how agency turns coordination into a self-reinforcing mechanism. The findings suggest that purposive planning involves a fundamental ambivalence in the processes and outcomes of path dependence, at the level of both the cluster and its constituent networks.","[Sydow, Joerg; Lerch, Frank] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Management, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Staber, Udo] Univ Canterbury, Dept Management, Christchurch 1, New Zealand",Free University of Berlin; University of Canterbury,"Sydow, J (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Dept Management, Boltzmannstr 20, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",joerg.sydow@fu-berlin.de; frank.lerch@fu-berlin.de; udo.staber@canterbury.ac.nz,"Sydow, Jörg/I-8194-2019","Sydow, Jörg/0000-0002-9359-7242",,,,,52,66,75,1,75,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Suppose, for instance, that you are considering getting married, and that you know that if you get married, you will prefer being unmarried, and that if you stay unmarried, you will prefer being married. The general problem is to find a stable standard of well-being when the standard is set by preferences that are not stable. In this paper, I shall show that the problem is even worse: inconsistency threatens if we accept both that your desires determine what is good for you and that you must prefer what is better for you. After I have introduced a useful toy model and stated the inconsistency argument, I will go on to discuss a couple of unsuccessful theories and see what we can learn from their mistakes. One important lesson is that how you would have felt about a life had you never led it is irrelevant to the question of how good that life is for you. What counts is how you feel about your life when you are actually leading it. Another lesson is that a life can be better for you even if you would not rank it higher, if you were to lead it.","Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford,"Bykvist, K (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",,,,,,,,18,15,17,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

The primary results are as follows. First, a higher benefit replacement rate reduces criminal activities. Second. with the exception of assault, active labor market policy has no significant effect on the criminal offenses considered. Third, an increase in the average educational level of the working age population reduces the propensity to commit crime; however, more often than not. the significance level is insufficient. The results suggest that the combination of a high replacement rate with short duration, which mitigates the effects of unemployment in the Nordic countries, is not contradictory to a crime reduction policy.

Nevertheless, it expressed the kind of antitrust thinking that led the Antitrust Division of the U. S. Department of Justice, around the same time, to shift its resources to cartel prosecutions and away from big monopolization cases. The Microsoft case, filed in 1998, broke this pattern. I argue that the Division made this exception, and ultimately achieved a partial victory in the courts, because the relatively new economic theory of network effects seemed to make the filters Easterbrook proposed in 1984 less applicable in high technology markets like the ones in which Microsoft competed. In this article, I return to Easterbrook's filters and consider whether they offer a different perspective on the Division's decision to sue and the courts' eventual resolution of the case.","Univ Florida, Levin Coll Law, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Page, WH (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Levin Coll Law, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",page@law.ufl.edu,,,,,,,59,5,7,1,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

We distinguish between the effects on gross and net fertility, take into account the dynamic nature of the relationship, and control for alternative explanatory factors and for endogeneity. Our results show that mortality plays a large role in fertility reductions, that the change in fertility behavior comes with a lag of about 10 years and that both net and gross fertility are affected.

Acknowledging that the IT industry in Taiwan has become very competitive and has demonstrated outstanding performance in the world since the 1990s, this study calculates the persistence in the incremental components of the effects on profitability, and tests hypotheses that conform to the above mainstream views of relative rates of persistence. A persistence partitioning model is fitted to a new data set, and the results show that the incremental effects of firms on profitability persist longer than the incremental effects of industry. In other words, the long-term competitive advantages of IT firms in Taiwan are more predictable and sustainable in regards to firm factors than for industry influences.

After a survey of the theoretical and empirical literature on the great transformation. the empirical results on some regional features (convergence, concentration and specialisation) of the 8-CEECs are discussed. The consideration of a rather fine territorial disaggregation at NUTS-3 Eurostat level distinguishes this paper from previous studies This allows for the investigation of some important tendencies such as the concentration of production around the capital cities. The main empirical finding of the paper is that, while transition countries in particular the eight CEECs are converging, with a reduction of disparities in per capita incomes across countries, within each single country divergence is prevailing, with leading regions (mainly the capital city areas) growing much faster than the rest of the country. The final econometric investigations - on the determinants of regional income convergence, GDP growth and employment dynamics on one hand confirm this result and on the other hand highlight the role of institutional change. The latter, which is always positive for real output growth, in the long run also becomes functional to employment growth, once the short-term effects of rationalisations and restructuring are vanished. The main policy implications, concerning both European and national economic policies. are presented in the conclusive section.","[Marelli, Enrico] Univ Brescia, Dept Econ, Via San Faustino 74-B, I-25122 Brescia, Italy",University of Brescia,"Marelli, E (通讯作者)，Univ Brescia, Dept Econ, Via San Faustino 74-B, I-25122 Brescia, Italy.",emarelli@eco.unibs.it,,"SIGNORELLI, Marcello/0000-0002-7820-7090; MARELLI, Enrico/0000-0001-9690-188X",,,,,97,14,14,0,1,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTR 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-916X,,978-3-7908-2163-5,AIEL SER LABOUR ECON,,,2010,,,,,,,99,+,,10.1007/978-3-7908-2164-2_5,0.0,,,5,Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Geography,BOM48,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277011100005,0

Based on 876 offshoring projects from 226 companies obtained by means of surveys conducted in the USA and Europe, we examine the effect of offshoring strategy on factors influencing firms' views of offshoring, and the effect of offshoring strategy on offshoring performance. Separate analyses were conducted for US and European companies in order to explore any regional heterogeneity in offshoring. A comparative analysis between companies with and without an offshoring strategy reveals that when making offshoring decisions, the former consider a broader range of factors (drivers, risks and locations) as important compared to companies without an offshoring strategy, suggesting association between offshoring strategy and managerial attention. The results also indicate that the adoption of a corporate offshoring strategy has a significant positive effect on cost savings achieved from offshore implementations, and that innovation activities have a significant negative impact on cost savings, but only for European companies.","[Massini, Silvia] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester Inst Innovat Res, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England; [Perm-Ajchariyawong, Nidthida; Lewin, Arie Y.] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, CIBER, Durham, NC 27706 USA",University of Manchester; Duke University,"Massini, S (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester Inst Innovat Res, Booth St W, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England.",silvia.massini@mbs.ac.uk,,,,,,,81,58,62,7,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Our grounded model shows that acceptance of virtual work is facilitated when the perception of different professional identities across sites is moderated by a shared organizational identity; when managerial support promotes cultural integration and diffused knowledge about the strategic objectives of virtual work; and when glocalized work practices are promoted and sustained over time.

Internal labour mobility is often seen as a potentially important instrument to reducing adjustment costs when other mechanisms fail Drawing from 2004 LFS data and utilizing a common empirical framework and estimation strategy, this paper identifies patterns and statistical profiles of geographical mobility. It finds internal migration to be generally low and highly concentrated amongst better-educated, young and single workers This suggests that migration is more likely to reinforce existing inequalities rather than act as an equalizing phenomenon. By way of contrast. commuting flows have crown over time and are more responsive to regional economic differentials The findings suggest the need for appropriate and country-tailored policy measures designed to increase the responsiveness of labour flows to market conditions.","[Paci, Pierella] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Paci, P (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",ppaci@worldbank.org,"Liwiński, Jacek/H-3350-2018","Liwiński, Jacek/0000-0002-3572-2973",,,,,29,12,12,2,10,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTR 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-916X,,978-3-7908-2163-5,AIEL SER LABOUR ECON,,,2010,,,,,,,197,+,,10.1007/978-3-7908-2164-2_8,0.0,,,3,Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Geography,BOM48,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277011100008,0

The Irish housing market experienced particularly strong rates of price increases and heightened activity levels by OECD standards. One reason cited for such large price increases has been the significant degree of financial liberalisation experienced by Irish credit institutions. The culmination of much of this liberalisation resulted in large increases in the availability of mortgage credit. In this paper we apply a recently developed model of mortgage credit and examine the implications for Irish house prices of changes in lending patterns. Our results suggest that post 2003, a significant amount of the increase in Irish prices was determined by innovative developments in international finance, which enabled Irish institutions, in particular, to secure alternative sources of lending funds.","[Addison-Smyth, Diarmaid; McQuinn, Kieran; O'Reilly, Gerard] Cent Bank & Financial Serv Author Ireland, Dublin, Ireland",,"Addison-Smyth, D (通讯作者)，Cent Bank & Financial Serv Author Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.",diarmaid.smyth@centralbank.ie; kmcquinn@centralbank.ie; gerard.oreilly@centralbank.ie,"McQuinn, Kieran/JCE-1122-2023","McQuinn, Kieran/0000-0003-0246-8179",,,,,37,14,15,0,7,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

Four main propositions summarize my argument made in this paper. First, when one takes the competition versus property rights dichotomy into account, it becomes evident that the economists' contribution to the historical evolution of U.S. antitrust law has been smaller than usually believed. Second, the American antitrust tradition has had less influence than is commonly claimed over the foundations of European Economic Community (EEC) competition policy. Third, a law and economics argument based on the constitutional standing of competition rules, an argument initially put forward by the highly influential Freiburg School of Ordoliberalism, played a crucial role in the birth of EEC antitrust policy. Fourth, the ordoliberal origin of EEC competition rules, when combined with the Community's integration goal, helps explain why the impact of the competition versus property rights dichotomy on European antitrust law has been limited and, contrary to the U.S. example, solved more favorably to competition than to property rights.","Univ Pisa, Dept Econ, I-56100 Pisa, Italy",University of Pisa,"Giocoli, N (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dept Econ, I-56100 Pisa, Italy.",giocoli@mail.jus.unipi.it,"Giocoli, Nicola/ABB-5506-2020","Giocoli, Nicola/0000-0002-0655-7884",,,,,52,21,22,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

These so-called 'soft' measures have challenged the assumption that modal shift is only possible through 'hard' system-based measures, or through regulation. Among the most high-profile VTBC initiatives is a household-based behaviour change technique known as Individualised Travel Marketing. This dialogue marketing approach was developed by Socialdata (under the brand name IndiMark (R)) in response to its own research suggesting that a lack of information and motivation, and incorrect perceptions of the alternatives to the car, were significant barriers to modal shift. IndiMark has been applied in more than 100 pilot and nearly 150 large-scale projects, targeting a total of more than three million people on three continents. A key factor in this widespread take up has been the consistent use of a detailed evaluation design, employing travel behaviour surveys before and after the IndiMark intervention, using Socialdata's KONTIV (R) survey method. This well-established design uses a self-administered, mail-back questionnaire, coupled with motivation by post and telephone to encourage high response rates (typically between 60% and 80%) helping to provide reliable data on mobility behaviour. This paper reviews the development of the IndiMark technique and the key features of its evaluation using the KONTIV (R) survey method. It draws on this experience to address key challenges in the evaluation of VTBC initiatives, and to identify the common threads of an integrated approach which might strengthen the case for all soft measures.

Most states have passed legislation making it easier to transfer juveniles to the criminal courts. Supporters of this get tough movement argue, in part, that juvenile courts are ineffective in deterring young offenders. This claim, however, is based primarily on poorly designed evaluations that do not account for the nonrandom nature of sentencing. This paper demonstrates how the institutional features of the justice system can be exploited to identify causality when true random assignment is not feasible. In particular, I capitalize on discontinuities in punishment that arise in Washington State's juvenile sentencing guidelines to identify the effect of incarceration on the postrelease criminal behavior of juveniles. The results indicate that incarcerated individuals have lower propensities to be reconvicted of a crime. This deterrent effect is also observed for older, criminally experienced, and/or violent youths.","Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Hjalmarsson, R (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,,,,,,,58,50,65,0,25,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

The high welfare participation rates among refugee immigrants may be due to the existence of a welfare trap, while participation among natives and non-refugee immigrants is largely due to permanent unobserved characteristics.

However, few prognostic factors or systems are robustly validated, and still fewer have made a convincing difference in health outcomes or in prolonging life expectancy. For most diseases and outcomes, a considerable component of the prognostic variance remains unknown, and may remain so for the foreseeable future. I discuss here some of the main problems in medical forecasting that pose obstacles to personalized medicine. Their recognition may help identify solutions to improve personalized prognosis, or at least understand and cope with the component of the future that we cannot predict. Much prognostic research is stuck at generating publishable units, without any interest in conclusively proving their worth, let alone moving them into real life applications. Information is reported selectively and reporting is deficient. The replication record of prognostic claims is poor. Even among replicated prognostic effects, few are convincingly shown to add much information besides what is already known through more simple, traditional measurements. There are few efforts to systematize prognostic knowledge. Most prognostic effects are subtle when traced to the molecular level, where most current research operates. Many researchers, clinicians, and the public are not appropriately educated to interpret prognostic information. We still have not even agreed on what the important health outcomes are that we want to predict and intervene for, and some subjectivity may be unavoidable. Finally, without concomitant effective, affordable, and non-harmful interventions, prognosis alone is of questionable value, and wrong prognosis or a wrong interpretation thereof can be harmful. The identification of these problems also suggests a roadmap on what could be done to amend them. Solutions include a systematic approach to the design, conduct, reporting, replication, and clinical translation of prognostic research; as well as the education of researchers, clinicians, and the general public. Finally, we need to recognize that perfect individualized health forecasting is not a realistic target in the foreseeable future, and we have to live with considerable residual uncertainty.

The objective of this essay is to analyze the premises of endogenous development from the postulates and programmatic policies undertaken in Venezuela and framed in the social action systems of the structural functionalist theory, in order to achieve a perspective about the sociological construction of the phenomenon. The methodology used was documentary review with a hermeneutic approach. The conclusions note an incipient process of endogenous development, oriented toward formulas of population de-concentration and territorial reordering, with a prevalence of social economy mechanisms, endorsed legally by the constitutional framework and sustained by values of cooperation, equity, solidarity, inclusion and participation. Likewise, in the sociological framework referring to the economic system, a public prevalence is noted with the absence of the private sector.","[Rodriguez P, Maria C.] Univ Carabobo, Escuela Relac Ind, Valencia, Venezuela; [Vivas, Arelis] Univ Carabobo, Escuela Econ, Valencia, Venezuela",,"Rodríguez, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Carabobo, Escuela Relac Ind, Valencia, Venezuela.",marycande65@hot-mail.com; hermel@cantv.net; arelisvivas@hotmail.com,,,,,,,25,2,2,0,1,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

We examine how successful the method is in mitigating issues to do with inappropriate framing, cognitive and motivational bias, and inappropriate attributions of causality. Although we demonstrate that the scenario method contains weaknesses, we identify a potential for improvement. Four general principles that should help to enhance the role of scenario planning when predictability is low are discussed: (i) challenging mental frames, (ii) understanding human motivations, (iii) augmenting scenario planning through adopting the approach of crisis management, and (iv) assessing the flexibility, diversity, and insurability of strategic options in a structured option-against-scenario evaluation.

In response, in this article, we adopt a cultural economy approach to report on the use of business education by investment banks operating in London's; financial district. Whilst business education in general and MBA degrees in particular are often claimed to facilitate globally mobile economic elites, we argue that the assembling of financial expertise through business education also serves to territorially and societally embed financiers into particular regulatory regimes and organizational cultures. As a result, we suggest that business education represents an important, yet hitherto neglected, set of activities in understanding the continued geographical and organizational heterogeneity of elite financial labour markets. In so doing, we argue that a focus on financial business education demonstrates the value of cultural economy approaches to financial geography and research into the variegated nature of finance capitalism more generally.","[Hall, Sarah] Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Hall, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",sarah.hall@nottingham.ac.uk,"Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022; Hall, Sarah/F-5655-2010","Hall, sarah/0000-0001-5563-5909; appleyard, lindsey/0000-0003-1087-8450",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F001053/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/F001053/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,63,56,59,0,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Due to regulatory errors. measured emissions are uncertain and some firms are unjustly penalized. Warnings can then be used as a means to reduce the consequences of these errors. Even though the presence of warnings creates some underdeterrence of medium-cost firms, Such a system reduces the overcompliance of low-cost firms caused by the uncertainty surrounding measured emissions. Further. warnings reduce the number of incorrect prosecutions in the case of measurement errors, which is also welfare enhancing, albeit at the cost of increasing the number of violators that go unpunished. For small error sizes, the use of warnings is shown to be welfare improving compared to only using fines. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

S. Congress established the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) as the sole appellate court for patent cases. This court was created ostensibly to eliminate inconsistencies in the application and interpretation of patent law across federal courts and thereby mitigate the incentives of patentees and alleged infringers to forum shop for a preferred venue. We perform the first econometric study of the extent of nonuniformity and forum shopping in the pre-CAFC era and of the CAFC's impact on these phenomena. We find that in patentee-plaintiff cases the pre-CAFC era was indeed characterized by significant nonuniformity in patent validity rates across circuits and by forum shopping on the basis of validity rates. We find weak evidence that the CAFC has increased uniformity of validity rates and strong evidence that forum shopping on the basis of validity rates ceased several years prior to the CAFC's establishment.","[Atkinson, Scott E.; Turner, John L.] Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Marco, Alan C.] Washington & Lee Univ, Lexington, VA 24450 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Washington & Lee University,"Atkinson, SE (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",,,"Marco, Alan/0000-0001-8882-6453",,,,,32,22,26,0,9,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

The paper focuses on France, and makes some comparisons with North America and Germany. It is organized in two parts. The first part analyses the notion of short line freight railways in the European context. We observe that to date, unlike short lines in North America, which have mostly sought cooperation with major railways, the new rail operators in Europe are competing with the majors. The second part discusses regional policies on rail freight transport. We observe that for some time, local governments in France have been afraid that the on-going reduction of regional rail freight services will increase truck traffic and environmental impacts. Today, however, these governments appear to be more reluctant to promote rail freight activities than they were a few years ago. The current conditions under which local lines operate in Europe and especially in France, including small capacity on the infrastructure and high cost of labor and low productivity, may explain this reluctance.

To this end we first study how aggregation over time affects both the dynamic components of a time series and their observability, in a multivariate linear framework. We find that the basic dynamic components remain unchanged but some of them, mainly those related to the seasonal structure, become unobservable. Building on these results, we propose a structured specification method built on the idea that the models relating the variables in high and low sampling frequencies should be mutually consistent. After specifying a consistent and observable high-frequency model, standard state-space techniques provide an adequate framework for estimation, diagnostic checking, data interpolation and forecasting. An example using national accounting data illustrates the practical application of this method.

Commonly used liability rules have discontinuous liability shares. We develop a liability rule, which we call the super-symmetric rule, that is both efficient and continuous, that is based on comparative negligence when both parties are negligent and on comparative vigilance when both parties are vigilant, and that is always responsive to increased care.

The claim of this paper is that, in at least some developing countries, not only does this theory (and practice) fail to bring down inflation but that it slows down the economy and increases inflation.

It claims that the concept of border can contribute to the theoretical growth to maturity of the relatively young field of transmigration studies, and especially to a deeper understanding of the in-between lifeworlds of transmigrants (migrant transnationalism). In transmigration studies, borders are usually considered as boundaries, the physical lines on the ground, and therefore are seen as beginnings and endings of migrant transnationalism. In this paper, it is argued that borders can also have a constitutive role in migrant transnationalism. This constitutive function of borders has been thoroughly theorised in border studies in the last two decades. Contemporary border scholars regard borders not as passive lines, but as active and polymorphous social constructions which are the outcome of people's need to make differences. By bringing this broader notion of borders to the transmigration debate, it is argued that migrant transnationalism is about experiencing the border, or experiencing the difference. This broader sense of borders might help to bare the soul of migrant transnationalism, namely the condition of being continuously between here and there.","Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen Ctr Border Res, Dept Human Geog, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen,"Gielis, R (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen Ctr Border Res, Dept Human Geog, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands.",r.gielis@fm.ru.nl,,,,,,,48,20,21,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

This study analyses the factors determining this kind of mismatch with the aim of identifying appropriate policy suggestions to improve the strategies to attract foreign investors to Italy and, particularly, to its southern regions.","[Pazienza, Pasquale; Vecchione, Vincenzo] Univ Foggia, Dept Econ Math & Stat, I-71100 Foggia, Italy",University of Foggia,"Pazienza, P (通讯作者)，Univ Foggia, Dept Econ Math & Stat, Largo Papa Giovanni Paolo II 1, I-71100 Foggia, Italy.",p.pazienza@unifg.it; v.vecchione@unifg.it,"Koçer, Abdulkadir/I-5287-2013","Koçer, Abdulkadir/0000-0003-2866-555X; Pazienza, Pasquale/0000-0003-0318-9163",,,,,24,10,10,1,6,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The first part will intend to provide a orientation on the present situation and the objectives of health insurance in the Slovak republic. List the main conceptions used in sickness and health insurance: the fundamental qualifying condition for the allocation and payment of benefits, retention of claims for a specified period of time based on a protection period, basic indicators for health care. In part two - a basic probabilistic multistate structure is defined, which provides the possibility of a systematic modeling for sickness insurance (disability annuities and lump sum). There are some specific applications of the actuarial theory in the solution of problems relating to critical illness. Some of the many approaches that can be used for calculations in this paper are multiple-state and decrement models. Their advantage is that they make use of stochastic approach for the transitions between the states. This brings with it a more faithful modeling of the real world than does the deterministic model. In the various chapters of this paper attention is directed not only towards the analysis of the existing theory, but also in particular to extending these models so that they can be used more widely in actuarial work in life, sickness and health insurance. Of course, natural developments lead to recurrent premiums, mathematical reserves, expense loadings and profit testing.","[Skrovankova, Lea] Ekon Univ Bratislave, Fak Hospodarskej Informat, Katedra Matemat, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Soltes, Michal] Tech Univ Kosiciach, Ekon Fak, Katedra Bankovnictva & Investovania, Kosice, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava; University of Economics Bratislava; Technical University Kosice,"Skrovánková, L (通讯作者)，Ekon Univ Bratislave, Fak Hospodarskej Informat, Katedra Matemat, Bratislava, Slovakia.",leaskrov@post.sk; Michal.Soltes@tuke.sk,"Šoltés, Michal/AAA-5822-2020","Šoltés, Michal/0000-0002-1421-7177",,,,,9,1,1,0,10,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

In essence, the new convergence theory, like the old convergence theory, is another theory devoid of space and time. Research on China has unfolded a complex landscape of regional development, the existence of distinct models of regional development, and the significant role of institutions. This paper examines regional inequality in China, especially Zhejiang Province, and attempts to uncover the trend and driving forces of regional inequality. It adopts a top-down and bottom-up strategy and employs recent developments in exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) and geographically weighted regression (GWR). We have found that regional inequality is sensitive to geographic scales and spatial organisation, and that conventional approaches mask spatial agglomeration and the significance of regions in shaping trends of regional inequality. Overall, regional inequality in Zhejiang rose during the reform period and a division between coastal and interior Zhejiang formed, additionally sustained by weak linkages between the two regions and the significance of location and nonstate enterprises in development. This paper further reveals the emergence of Wenzhou, and discusses its effect on regional inequality.","[Wei, Y. H.

Internal communication and coordination may therefore be crucial in reducing information asymmetry and achieving efficient resource allocation. We examine the relationship between corporate capital budgeting decisions and the degree of internal information sharing using a dataset of 342 U.S. firms from 1993 to 2002. Information sharing is measured by the internal linkages observed in firms' research and development activities worldwide. The efficiency of a firm's capital budgeting decisions is measured by the deviation of the firm's estimated marginal q from the theoretical tax-adjusted benchmark. We observe a significant relationship between value-enhancing capital budgeting decisions and stronger internal linkages. Specifically, corporate overinvestment is significantly reduced with better information sharing across units. All results are robust to firm-and industry-level controls.","[Hornstein, Abigail S.] Wesleyan Univ, Middletown, CT 06459 USA; [Zhao, Minyuan] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Wesleyan University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Hornstein, AS (通讯作者)，Wesleyan Univ, 238 Church St, Middletown, CT 06459 USA.",ahornstein@wesleyan.edu; myzhao@umich.edu,"Zhao, Minyuan/GZL-3641-2022","Hornstein, Abigail/0000-0002-9172-0411",,,,,47,13,17,2,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

We do so using panel data for the U.S. states between 2002 and 2008. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find little evidence that hate groups are associated with hate crime in the United States. We find somewhat stronger evidence that economic hardship may be related to hate crime. However, evidence for the potential importance of economic factors remains weak. Further, we find that demographic variables are not significantly related to hate crime in the United States. Our results leave the question of what factors may drive hate crime in America unresolved. But they cast doubt on the popular perception that hate groups are among them. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

It supports decision-making by maximizing bidders' surpluses and their chances of winning an auction. One key element of the system is a dynamic forecasting model, which incorporates information about the speed of an auction's price movement, as well as the level of competition both within and across auctions. Other elements include a wallet estimator, which gauges the bidders' willingness to pay, and a bid strategizer, which embeds the forecasting model into a fully automated decision system. We illustrate the performance of our intelligent bidding system on an authentic dataset of online art auctions for Indian contemporary art. We compare our system with several simpler ad-hoc approaches, and find it to be more effective in terms of both the extracted surplus and the resulting winning percentage.

Most of our attention centers on efficiencies in production, but we also address merger-specific efficiencies that may lead to improved product quality, enhanced services, or even to the introduction of entirely new products. We begin with the analytically clean case of merger-specific efficiencies that are accompanied by monopoly power. From the perspective of either consumer welfare or social welfare, this presents the welfare analysis that should guide merger policy. We, then, examine the errors that may arise due to the restricted role that efficiencies play in Section 7 enforcement.

We find that stores in the social network are significantly less likely to vertically integrate than nonmember stores. This has three primary implications. First, the social network may be lowering the costs of using the market more than facilitating in-house production. This implies better outsourcing opportunities in a social network and may explain a documented relationship between social networks and firm economic performance. Second, institutional details of our example and the estimated relationship suggest a role for opportunism and reputation as determinants of the boundaries of the firm in a setting without asset specificity. Finally, although we provide evidence that better access to credit can increase the likelihood of vertical integration, we show that better outsourcing opportunities have a dominant effect of the social network in this particular setting.","[Gil, Ricard] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Econ, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Hartmann, Wesley R.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; Stanford University,"Gil, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Econ, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",rgil@ucsc.edu,,"Gil, Ricard/0000-0003-3627-0988",,,,,31,10,11,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

In this article, we try to extend Ashley's work by providing three testing procedures, including a ratio-based test, a difference-based test, and the Bayesian approach. The Bayesian approach has the advantage of allowing the flexibility of adapting all possible information content within a decision-making environment such as the change of variable's definition due to the evolving system of national accounts. We demonstrate the proposed methods by applying six macroeconomic forecasts in the Survey of Professional Forecasters.

Conventional global learning computational intelligence (CI) models, with their generalized learning behaviors, may not capture the complex dynamics and time-varying characteristics of such real-life time series data efficiently. In this paper, we propose to use a novel local learning model of the pseudo self-evolving cerebellar model articulation controller (PSECMAC) associative memory network to produce accurate forecasts of ATM cash demands. As a computational model of the human cerebellum, our model can incorporate local learning to effectively model the complex dynamics of heteroskedastic time series. We evaluated the forecasting performance of our PSECMAC model against the performances of current established CI and regression models using the NN5 competition dataset of 111 empirical daily ATM cash withdrawal series. The evaluation results show that the forecasting capability of our PSECMAC model exceeds that of the benchmark local and global-learning based models. (C) 2010 International Institute of Forecasters.

The paper describes how the use of special general clauses in Danish law regulates director's liability. It is shown how risk and return combinations may assist in determining whether management has violated the business judgment rule. The analysis shows that this legal doctrine is optimal from an economic perspective. The article introduces the concept of temporal relatively of the shareholder equality principle which can be used to determine whether the interests of minority shareholders have been set aside. It is shown that the principle of shareholder equality must be subjected to both an ex ante, as well as an ex post assessment. Moreover, courts should be reluctant to interfere in situations where there has been an unequal distribution of gain (or loss) ex post. The theoretical arguments are illustrated by analyzing a leading Danish court case that involved the squeeze out of minority shareholders in the Danish telecom company. The paper also analyzes the incentive effects of derivate suits and suits commenced by individual shareholders. It is shown that the former creates a free rider problem whereas in the latter situation, shareholders are not fully able to internalize their externalities.","[Rose, Caspar] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Int Econ & Management, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Rose, C (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Int Econ & Management, Porcelaenshaven 24 A, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",car.int@cbs.dk,,,,,,,20,2,2,2,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

The research presented here finds that the assumption of general equilibrium present in the original model is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for systems to adjust to stable Nash Equilibria. This article introduces the idea of leakage to describe the minute inaccuracies in optimization that can cascade into major shifts in outcomes. This leakage plays an increasingly important role when the population is evenly spread among cities. Furthermore, as other assumptions are relaxed the effects of leakage on model stability are multiplied. This finding is of particular interest as the equilibrium-based results of geographical economics are increasingly being applied in policy settings where moderate concentrations of population and heterogeneity are the norm rather than the exception.","Univ Washington, Dept Geog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Fowler, CS (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Geog, Box 353550,Smith Hall 408, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",csfowler@u.washington.edu,"Fowler, Christopher S/H-3017-2012; Dao, Rock/E-5736-2014","Fowler, Christopher/0000-0001-8415-0441",,,,,36,7,8,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

The objective of the paper is to analyse how, and how far, policies in this field of action can transfer from one member state to another, and to compare this to the theory of policy transfer put forward by Dolowitz and Marsh (2000), using their theory as an analytical framework, but also informing that theory. After providing a definition of this form of integration, the paper explains how far MM and land use planning are currently integrated in the EU member and other states covered in the research (Sweden, Germany, Spain, Lithuania, Poland, Slovenia, Switzerland, the UK, as well as Ireland and the Netherlands). It then presents the results of planning simulation workshops in five of these countries, where a group of planning professionals from each state considered real development sites and how MM could be integrated with the development. It shows that there is scope for transfer but concludes that barriers such as language, differing planning traditions, and the problem of transferring a new policy idea within a country will limit the scope of policy transfer significantly. Nonetheless, it sees a role for EU projects of this nature in encouraging initial consideration of new policy ideas. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis was at the spatial level of West German planning regions for the period 1984-2002. We found pronounced differences for the employment contribution of new businesses across regions. Regression analyses of these differences show that the regional level of new business formation explains only a part of the employment effect. More important than the mere presence of startups is their quality in terms of their survival rate and growth rates. A large share of innovation activity in small businesses in a region, a high educational level of the regional workforce, and the wide availability of labor have a significantly positive impact. Our results suggest that the success of newcomers is not necessarily at the expense of incumbents but that the development of both kinds of businesses may be positively interlinked.","[Fritsch, Michael; Schindele, Yvonne] Univ Jena, Sch Econ & Business Adm, D-07743 Jena, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Fritsch, M (通讯作者)，Univ Jena, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Carl Zeiss Str 3, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",m.fritsch@uni-jena.de; yvonne.schindele@gmail.com,"Fritsch, Michael/E-9321-2011; Fritsch, Michael/ABB-7526-2021","Fritsch, Michael/0000-0003-0337-4182",,,,,52,42,43,1,30,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Consistent with the notion of market mispricing, most of Taiwan's IPOs were with consecutive up-limit hits followed by substantial price reversals. In this study, we decompose IPO underpricing into two components: pure underpricing and subsequent reversal, exploring the impact of the 1991 mandate that IPO firms should include their management forecasts in the prospectuses on these two anomaly measures. Our results support the notion that disclosure regulations ameliorate investors' mispricing the stocks. First, pure underpricing and reversal are significantly less (more) pronounced for post-mandate (pre-mandate) IPO stocks. In contrast, consistent with the cheap talk hypothesis, the pre-mandate voluntary forecasters (non-forecasters) appear to be more (less) underpriced. Second, the duration of underpricing for the post-mandate (pre-mandate) IPOs appears to be shorter (longer). Nevertheless, underpricing lasted relatively longer (shorter) for the pre-mandate IPOs with (with no) voluntary disclosures.

This phenomenon is generally referred to as privatization, but not all the cases consist of, in fact, a full divestiture of assets. Although infrastructure management is undertaken by the private sector during a pre-defined period, usually 30 years or more, the property remains public or is transferred to the public domain after that period. This is a form of Public-Private Partnership (PPP) where two different models can be found: institutionalized PPP or a typical contractual regime, such as the concession arrangements. PPP options have been a hot topic over the last decade. but few studies can be found in the literature on the PPP projects development in airport systems, for example, as far as risk sharing is concerned. This paper looks at recent developments in airport privatization, distinguishing privatizations from PPP arrangements, through a case study approach, and establishing a comparative analysis of different PPP models used for airport management. Some comments are made about the Portuguese model and the announcement of future privatization. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The project was developed from a constructivist learning perspective, where activities are connected to the state of the learner and every year it develops twenty to twenty-four different entrepreneurial projects. The program uses self-directed and small group learning activities to teach students basic concepts in entrepreneurship. The primary learning activity is a business plan project which uses an authentic, local setting and draws upon business owners and other individuals embedded in the setting to contribute to student learning. Each of these have values in terms of providing an opportunity for the students to learn important concepts and practice important activities related to entrepreneurship, learning experience and their eventual entrepreneurial behaviour. Through this program the students develop the knowledge and experience on how to handle the business plan in their businesses, which is an encouraging component of their future career or life and marks the success of this program.

Flow rate can be measured invasively during interventional procedures. To predict the flow rate and the pressure of the coronary arterial system of a patient, computational simulations can be used as an alternative approach. Computational simulations have been proven useful in studying blood flow in the cardiovascular system. Some of the investigations include the study of the hemodynamics of healthy and diseased blood vessels, the design and evaluation of vascular medical devices, planning of vascular surgeries, and the prediction of the outcomes of interventions. In simulations, we studied coronary flow and pressure of normal coronary arteries. Blood flow can be approximated as a Newtonian fluid. We can solve the problem of the incompressible blood flow using the Navier-Stokes equations and the motion of the vessel wall using the dynamics equations. We built a model and studied temporal changes in the heart rate, contractility of the left and right ventricle and the venous compliance. The simulation results could provide valuable data that may affect the process of selecting clinical interventions and may replace certain invasive procedures that are painful, expensive and sometimes unnecessary.","[Corciova, C.; Turnea, M.] Gr T Popa Univ Med & Pharm, Iasi, Romania",Grigore T Popa University of Medicine & Pharmacy,,corciova_calin@yahoo.com,,,,,,,19,1,1,0,2,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-2-3,,,,2011,,,,,,,365,368,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI18,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306939900092,0

This perspective is used to explore the innovative practices in small agro-processing enterprises in Ghana and how these innovative practices relate to their success. The innovative practices explored are the introduction of new products and processes, identification of new sources of raw materials and new markets. So far, little research has analyzed innovative practices in small agro-processing enterprises in Ghana. This study aims at filling this gap by testing hypotheses between the independent and dependent variables (innovative practices and success). Proportional stratified sampling is used to select 715 out of 835 small agro-processing enterprises (palm fruit, cassava, fish and fruit) in the Eastern Region of Ghana. Quantitative and qualitative approaches are combined in data collection and analysis. Questionnaires are used to collect data from all respondents and 50 of them are selected purposively for interviews and observations. The findings show that the small agro-processing enterprises engage in various types of innovative practices, which have contributed to success and growth. Some of the new practices include the adoption of fuel efficient processing methods, diversification of product line, improved packaging and opening of new market outlets. Their success factors include self-fulfillment, wealth creation and positive impact on the Ghanaian economy. The Chi-square outcome of the testing of the hypotheses confirms that the innovations have statistically significant influences on their business success. It is important for governments and policy institutes in developing economies, especially in Ghana to support agro-processors with improved technology and marketing strategies to increase their capabilities, productivity and competitiveness. Also, since the majority of agro-processors are women, there is the need for innovative organizational strategies to address women's gender roles such as training the women in the use of modern technologies to enhance their production capacity.","[Dzisi, Smile; Otsyina, Faustina Aku] Koforidua Polytech, Sch Business & Management Studies, Koforidua, Ghana",,"Dzisi, S (通讯作者)，Koforidua Polytech, Sch Business & Management Studies, Koforidua, Ghana.",afuasmile@yahoo.com; lentegh2005@yahoo.com,,,,,,,15,0,0,1,6,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,242,249,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800031,0

We obtained 101 role-thinking forecasts of the decisions that would be made in nine diverse conflicts from 27 Naval postgraduate students (experts) and 107 role-thinking forecasts from 103 second-year organizational behavior students (novices). The accuracy of the novices' forecasts was 33% and that of the experts' was 31%; both were little different from chance (guessing), which was 28%. The small improvement in accuracy from role-thinking strengthens the finding from earlier research that it is not sufficient to think hard about a situation in order to predict the decisions which groups of people will make when they are in conflict. Instead, it is useful to ask groups of role players to simulate the situation. When groups of novice participants adopted the roles of protagonists in the aforementioned nine conflicts and interacted with each other, their group decisions predicted the actual decisions with an accuracy of 60%.

Paradoxically, among the most daunting obstacles is not repression or denial of rights, but, rather, partial recognition and the bureaucratic-political entanglements that follow. Another major challenge is the declining viability of agrarian development in the globalized Central American political economy. The second part of the paper reflects critically on recent attempts to understand these problems, through the practice of politically engaged anthropological scholarship. Activist research, I argue, draws the anthropologist into some of the same contradictions and predicaments that the actors themselves confront.

The results of the panel data analysis show that the industrial sector was the only one with statistically significant price elasticity over the study period. Further, economic output was a positive contributing factor to the industrial and commercial sectors (having high and significant coefficients). This is in contrast with the other three sectors, agriculture, transport and mining, whose electricity consumption was affected neither by price nor by their production. This anomaly is the result of both the relatively low and declining (in real terms) electricity prices over the study period, and the fact that the proportion of electricity cost to total cost is relatively small for the majority of sectors. There was therefore no major incentive to reduce electricity consumption and/or to be efficient. While these results explain, at least in part, the historical increases in electricity consumption, they may not hold for the period since 2008 (for which adequate data is not yet available), given the sharp increases in electricity prices recently experienced by the country.","[Inglesi-Lotz, Roula; Blignaut, James N.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Inglesi-Lotz, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",,"Blignaut, James N/U-1755-2017; Inglesi-Lotz, Roula/I-6910-2012","Inglesi-Lotz, Roula/0000-0001-7509-4687; Blignaut, James/0000-0001-7059-9010",,,,,37,30,35,0,12,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

It argues that recent economic growth and transnational connections follow new forms of entrepreneurial development that aggravate social and spatial inequalities. The analysis shows that these forms of urban and regional management are embedded in the neoliberalised, yet monarch-centric Moroccan state. Analysis of local governance arrangements demonstrates the pivotal importance of an elite cadre of urban managers within the monarchic power structure. Fieldwork evidence documents the emergence of megaprojects as preferred vehicles for entrepreneurial development through site observations, indepth interviews and archival research. The Tanger City Center project presents a case that illustrates the social and spatial implications of a restructuring territorial economy and the effects of new polarities being overlaid on existing urban and regional geographies.

Entrepreneurial intention is influenced by several factors including entrepreneurial characteristics. Several studies have examined the relationship between entrepreneurial characteristics and success entrepreneurs. However, there is very little research available on personality factors that drive students' intentions to start a new business. This study investigates the effect of entrepreneurial characteristics of students at Iranian universities on their entrepreneurial intentions. A survey instrument was designed to measure entrepreneurial intentions as dependent variable as well as entrepreneurial characteristics including need for achievement, risk-taking propensity, innovativeness, self-efficacy and need for independence as independent variables. The sample of 347 students included students studying business, agriculture, and engineering at seven established universities at both graduate and undergraduate levels. Structural Equation modelling (SEM) was employed to test causal relationships among independent and dependent variables. The results indicate that entrepreneurial intention is significantly influenced by entrepreneurial self-efficacy and need for achievement. However, risk taking propensity and need for independence. do not have a direct significant impact on students' entrepreneurial intentions. Furthermore, the results show that the effect innovativeness is mediated by entrepreneurial self-efficacy. The results of the study provide educators, administrators and policy makers inside and outside universities valuable insights with respect to entrepreneurship education.

One can define group cohesion as the level of commitment members feel toward the group and the group's tasks. This phenomenon of is usually examined from the perspective on how it adds to, or detracts from, group and organizational performance. Some scholars maintain that a high level of group cohesion leads to enhanced performance through better communication, reduced conflict, more empathy, and greater organizational citizenship. On the other hand, group cohesion has sometimes been associated with negative performance, as sometimes a highly cohesive group may shun outsiders and new ideas, or even exhibit groupthink in some contexts. However, uncovering the conditions that promote the formation of group cohesion is a much understudied aspect of this construct. In light of this condition, we employ a structural equation modeling approach to examine a number of possible antecedents to group cohesion. The sample is comprised of fourth year university students who answered a questionnaire developed for this study. The antecedents employed in the model include the construct of collective self-esteem, which is composed of membership, private collective self-esteem, and importance to identify of the group, and one's past experience with groups. Specifically, the results indicate that the individual-level trait of collective self-esteem is a personal disposition that managers should consider when making decisions on group composition.","Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Business, Mersin, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University,"Kaymak, T (通讯作者)，Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Business, Mersin, Turkey.",,,,,,,,30,0,2,2,91,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

This paper focuses on the geography of certified geographical indications in Greece. We focus on a number of key characteristics of the products (e.g. area of production, production in less favoured areas) and analyse specific case studies of products, in order to understand their importance and impact (e.g. volume of production, number of businesses that produce them) and investigate the choices of this geography. Evidence suggests that some Greek geographical indications (GIs) exist only 'on paper' and therefore have zero impact on their delimited areas. Furthermore, the impact of GIs depends not only on the characteristics of the product but on the characteristics of the enterprises that produce them as well.

This study was performed on the university community of the Basque Country, prior to the enactment of the Act which was to organise the Basque university system. Its results, which were accepted as being representative of the real dissensus existing in the community, constituted a valuable input for the final drawing up of the Act, and for its acceptance without conflict.

The WTO system has been substantially positive in response to the concerns about human health, particularly, through the judicially proper application and interpretation of the SPS provisions concerned. Judicial interpretations made by the Appellate Body stand mostly for the proposition that sanitary measures must be based on scientific evidence and risk analysis. Such interpretations imply that judicial interpretation and application can substantially function to protect the health-related interests of WTO member countries. Despite such positive achievements of the WTO dispute settlement body to judicially treat the public health under the SPS Agreement, however, member countries representing free trade supporters and environmentalists do not currently seem satisfied with such performance. Considering the serious criticism against the dispute settlement body's interpretation of the scientific principles and risk analysis so far and the well-recognized assumption in WTO societies that the WTO is the best tool to treat both free trade and the environment, a more flexible and reasonable attitude of the dispute settlement body to treat the scientific issues is required.","[Lee, Eun Sup; Zhu, Zhu] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Int Trade & Studies, Pusan, South Korea; [Kim, Sun Ok] Changwon Natl Univ, Dept Int Trade, Pusan, Turkey",Pusan National University,"Lee, ES (通讯作者)，Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Int Trade & Studies, Pusan, South Korea.",lieunsup@pusan.ac.kr; ksok@pusan.ac.kr; zhuzhu@pusan.ac.kr,,,,,,,16,0,0,1,2,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8719-3,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,3.0,,,,,,148,+,,,,,,2,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX67,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303218200031,0

There are a number of empirical valuation methods that may contribute to that assessment. These methods involve several steps: data acquisition, model specification and estimation. In this paper, this approach is illustrated in the context of a survey regarding alternative management strategies for a forest area in Central Portugal by implementing a contingent valuation experiment where an advanced landscape visualisation technique is employed to generate the visual information conveyed in the valuation scenarios. Several econometric model specifications are considered as well as alternative approaches to handle zero willingness to pay values and protest responses. The results obtained suggest the potential of the proposed approach for an effective comparison of alternative forest management strategies. (C) 2011 Department of Forest Economics, SLU lima Sweden.

Considering the high cost involved, it is particularly important that their performance justifies this high cost and that expectations from these investments are met. Therefore, in the world, it has become an important field of research to study the gap between the expectations from and outcomes of these investments in order to assess the performances. In Turkey, there is a growing interest in constructing rail transit systems in the cities. However, there has been a limited number of studies on the performance of these investments. It is not clear with what expectations these systems are built or whether these expectations are met. There seems to be an urgent need to study these rail investments, with a particular focus on their planning/investment objectives and outcomes. This paper compares the expectations with the actual outcomes. A sample group was selected among the cities currently operating rail transit systems: Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir and Bursa. Semi-structured interviews were made with the officers and planners that have involved in the planning or implementation phase of the systems. As the primary indicators of performance, cost and ridership forecast and outcome data are collected and considered in the comparison. It is found that systems performed rather poor in terms of expectations, such as attaining ridership forecasts, being built within budget etc. Hence there is a gap between expectations and outcomes.

Information systems are a significant means of support which are used by company in order to meet business objectives. Information systems are fully intended to support business processes. In order to gain this functionality, there are two aspects monitored, which are content and safety of the information system. Failure or shut-down of information system has an important influence on business processes realization or, in other words, has influence on business continuity. Existence of business continuity is important for every organization. It consists of planning failure recovery when the cause can be even the failure of computer network. Even though information system belongs to supporting tools from the view of main business processes, IT failure usually means stopping the whole operations. Therefore, the availability or unavailability has the main influence on business continuity. IT service continuity occurs when services are prepared, customized and robust, in order to be able to quickly react against possible failures by minimizing effects followed by rapid recovering of IT services. Therefore, it is required to identify threats of information system failures before it is too late. In order to detect abnormal statuses of information systems it is needed to perform appropriate measures in time. One of the possibilities to avoid failures of IT services in time is proactive monitoring. The text deals with the process of creating and verification of a model enabling creation of monitors according to customer requirements.","[Simonova, Stanislava] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Syst Engn & Informat, Pardubice, Czech Republic; [Sprync, Ondrej] Pike Elect Sro, Prague 13000 3, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Simonová, S (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Syst Engn & Informat, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",Stanislava.Simonova@upce.cz; OSprync@pikeelectronic.com,,,,,,,23,3,3,0,15,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Policy makers rely on economic and biological models to inform them of the impacts and risks associated with both anticipated and unforeseen policies or shocks to the system. Assumptions about agents' knowledge of future events are fundamental in all forms of models suggesting that the degree of information of future events may have large behavioral impacts. Despite the importance of this assumption, few studies have looked into what this difference in information may imply, and few studies have analyzed the importance of varying the degree of a priori information on the impacts of policy measures. This paper attempts to elucidate some of these impacts by comparing how an exogenous shock affects the Norwegian forest sector if the agents are assumed to have: (i) perfect information, (ii) information about the market shift only a limited time before its implementation or (iii) no a priori information. The shock analyzed is an import ban on all coniferous wood into Norway, which is possible if the Pinewood nematode (PWN) becomes more widespread in Europe. To examine this question, we adapt the Norwegian forest sector model NorFor to reflect perfect, limited and no prior information. The results indicate that if the agents anticipate the shock, they will begin to adjust harvest and production levels before it occurs. Due to high opportunity costs, harvest is reduced in the first periods to allow increases later. Bioenergy, with much lower profit than pulp and paper on the margin, is the hardest hit by the ban, while paper production is little affected. This may also be due to high capital costs in the paper industry and a perfectly elastic wood demand curve for bioenergy use. Substantial price increases for both raw materials and final products are suggested under either limited or perfect foresight. The analysis may provide useful insight about how agents react to sudden changes depending on their a priori information. (C) 2011 Department of Forest Economics, SLU Umea Sweden.

Moreover, they appear to have good reasons for behaving better: client-owned horses that underperform are more likely to be transferred to another stable, thereby causing a loss of income for the original trainer.","[Boyle, Glenn] Univ Canterbury, Canterbury, New Zealand; [Guthrie, Graeme] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand",University of Canterbury; Victoria University Wellington,"Boyle, G (通讯作者)，Univ Canterbury, Canterbury, New Zealand.",,,"Guthrie, Graeme/0000-0002-8497-0148",,,,,31,2,2,0,8,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

I focus on the notion of epistemic support for such intentions. Using tools from epistemic game theory and epistemic logic, I cast doubt on whether such support guarantees the other agents' conditional mediation in the achievement of such intentions, something that appears important if intentions with a we-content are to count as genuine intentions. I then formulate a stronger version of epistemic support, one that does indeed ensure the required mediation, but I then argue that it rests on excessively strong informational conditions. In view of this I provide an alternative set of conditions that are jointly sufficient for coordination in games, and I argue that these conditions constitute a plausible alternative to the proposed notion of epistemic support.","Univ Groningen, Fac Philosophy, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Roy, O (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Philosophy, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands.",,,"Roy, Olivier/0000-0002-9085-5701",,,,,41,3,3,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

If harder working agents respond less to intensified effort incentives, we find that the principal puts less emphasis on individual performance pay when selection becomes more important.

Although many of the banned practices have since been posited to have increased efficiency, evidence of an efficiency-enhancing rationale for theater ownership has not been presented. This paper explores the hypothesis that theater chain ownership promoted efficient ex post adjustment in the length of film runs-specifically, abbreviation of unexpectedly unpopular films. Extracontractual run-length adjustments are desirable because demand for a film is not revealed until the film is actually exhibited. The paper employs a unique data set of cinema booking sheets. It finds that run lengths for releases by vertically integrated film producers were significantly-economically and statistically-more likely to be altered ex post. The paper documents and discusses additional practices intended to promote flexibility.","Clemson Univ, Clemson, SC 29631 USA",Clemson University,"Hanssen, FA (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, Clemson, SC 29631 USA.",,,,,,,,54,22,22,0,19,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

Donors have assigned a significant amount of time and financial resources to TA to raise the capacity and effectiveness of younger agencies. However, quantitative analysis of the impact of this TA remains limited at best. In this article, we focus on what appears to be a particularly important part of TA and capacity building-the use of long-term advisors (LTAs) and short-term interventions (STIs). In a yearlong project, the International Competition Network surveyed its member antitrust agencies on antitrust TA. The questionnaire contained over 1,000 questions on various aspects of TA. We provide an analysis of the data using formal modeling. The most important findings from the model relate to two structural features of recipient antitrust agencies. First, recipient agencies absorb LTA and STI services best when the agency head has a rank of minister or higher and when agencies have prosecutorial discretion. At the heart of this agency feature is the relative power position of the agency in the recipient country's domestic political and economic structure. Those agencies with a strong power base seem well positioned to receive the current formatted TA involving LTAs and STIs. Second, bilateral donor relationships did remarkably better than multilateral relationships in helping the agencies with their strategic mission.","[Sokol, D.

He applies the model to a panel of sixty-four countries and explains past variations in their ownership rates. Then, projections are performed to the year 2030.

Negative equity occurs if house price falls result in the house value being lower than the outstanding debt. Many in negative equity will be unaffected and will continue to pay their mortgage without difficulty. Negative equity can increase the probability of defaulting if it occurs at the same time as cash-flow problems, possibly caused by illness or job loss. This paper estimates that 116,000 borrowers were in negative equity at the end of 2009, rising to 196,000 borrowers by end-2010. Borrowing at, or close to the price peak, high loan-to-value ratios, interest only mortgages and longer mortgage terms have contributed to higher numbers in negative equity. First-time buyers are more likely to be experiencing negative equity. The research shows that many of those who have mortgages are employed in sectors where employment prospects, to date, remain relatively robust. Policies that assist households overcome a loss in income may help lower the default rate.","Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin 2, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"Duffy, D (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin 2, Ireland.",,,,,,,,27,14,14,0,6,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

These prices serve as the high and low bounds, respectively, for the ask and bid prices of middlemen, when capacity cost is sufficiently large. Second, more efficient intermediaries choose to become market makers, whereas less efficient intermediaries choose to become middlemen. Third, if the fixed cost of capacity installation for market makers increases, the number of market makers declines, whereas the number of middlemen increases.

A conceptual framework is adopted where the degree of agency and the possibility to influence the terms of sex-based transactions are seen as conditional on the enforcement of some basic rights. Using data collected by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) on women assisted by the organization after having been trafficked for sexual exploitation, we investigate the enforcement (violation) of five uncompromisable rights, namely the right to physical integrity, to move freely, to have access to medical care, to use condoms, and to exercise choice over sexual services. By combining classification tree analysis and ordered probit estimation we find that working location and country of work are the main determinants of rights enforcement, while individual and family characteristics play a marginal role. Specifically, we find that (1) in lower market segments working on the street is comparatively less 'at risk' of rights violation; (2) there is no consistently 'good' or 'bad' country of work, but public awareness on trafficking within the country is important; (3) the strength of organised crime in the country of work matters only in conjunction with other local factors, and (4) being trafficked within one's country, as opposed to being trafficked internationally, is associated with higher risk of rights violation.","[Bettio, Francesca; Nandi, Tushar K.] Univ Siena, Dept Econ, I-53100 Siena, Italy",University of Siena,"Bettio, F (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, Dept Econ, Via Laterina 8, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",bettio@unisi.it,,"BETTIO, Francesca/0000-0002-7106-156X",,,,,22,16,23,0,37,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

For married couples, gains need not occur for both spouses, and 'tied movers' may on average see their relative earnings fall as a result of internal migration. Previous research suggesting that wives appear on average to be tied movers primarily dates back to the 1970s. Examining data from the 1990s, I find a result similar to this earlier research, with wives losing on average about 20% of their pre-migration earnings. Much of this decline is associated with a decline in work hours for wives. The effect seems to be short-lived, not clearly persisting into the second year following migration.","Univ S Carolina, Dept Econ, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Blackburn, ML (通讯作者)，Univ S Carolina, Dept Econ, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",blackbrn@moore.sc.edu,,,,,,,30,24,24,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

The school management is in the Czech Republic a new discipline in a progress. Our faculty has been offering special courses for headmasters since 1997. We began to create an application of marketing and management to education in co-operation with colleagues abroad and with other institutions which are focused on school management in the Czech Republic. We find the topic school culture highly important especially in the period of the education change. The paper presents a survey of school culture. Identification and evaluation of culture gap between existing culture and desired culture is a very important part of school self-evaluation process. The headmasters are key actors and responsible persons to culture change according to the Educational Act. Concept of organisational culture helps them to see the managed school in holistic approach. The survey of the school culture is focused on headmaster 's view of managed school. We show results of questioning groups of headmasters in 2002, 2007 and 2009. We can see changes in their evaluation of culture gap. Actually headmasters underline problems in: Control in school, Shared goals and Relationships among staff, Motivation of staff and Communication with community and parents, Organisational structure and routine of school and Relationships between teachers and students. Very small difference is between existing culture and desired culture in Expectation of education results. The similar applications and surveys are needed for development of special disciplines of the management and marketing especially for non-profit sphere.","Univ W Bohemia, Fak Ekon, Katedra Mkt Obchodu & Sluzeb, Cheb 35002, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Eger, L (通讯作者)，Univ W Bohemia, Fak Ekon, Katedra Mkt Obchodu & Sluzeb, Hradebni 22, Cheb 35002, Czech Republic.",leger@kmo.zcu.cz,"Eger, Ludvik/C-1330-2016","Eger, Ludvik/0000-0002-5437-3297",,,,,25,4,4,1,14,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

A stochastic cost frontier model is employed to estimate and decompose the total factor productivity (TFP) growth of water distribution utilities in the 1997-2003 period. The main goal is to find out whether the lack of proper incentives to improve performance has resulted in the low TFP growth of Slovenian water distribution utilities. The evidence suggests that cost inefficiencies are present in water utilities, which indicates considerable cost saving potential in the analysed industry. Technical change is found to have positively affected the TFP growth over time, while cost inefficiency levels remained essentially unchanged. Overall, the average annual TFP growth in the analysed period is estimated to be only slightly above zero, which is a relatively poor result. This can largely be contributed to the present institutional and regulatory setting that does not stimulate utilities to improve productivity. Therefore, the introduction of an independent regulatory agency and an incentive-based price regulation scheme should be seriously considered in order to enhance the performance of Slovenian water distribution utilities.","[Filippini, Massimo] ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich, CEPE, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Filippini, Massimo] Univ Lugano, Fac Econ, CH-6904 Lugano, Switzerland; [Hrovatin, Nevenka; Zoric, Jelena] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Universita della Svizzera Italiana; University of Ljubljana,"Filippini, M (通讯作者)，ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich, CEPE, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",massimo.filippini@usi.ch; nevenka.hrovatin@ef.uni-lj.si; jelena.zoric@ef.uni-lj.si,"Filippini, Massimo/K-8155-2013","Filippini, Massimo/0000-0002-5972-4439",,,,,39,3,3,0,9,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

This method of forecasting the outcome of presidential elections departs from the standard approach that uses regression models of the popular vote based on a reward-punishment analysis for citizens, as well as other methods like Delphi experts surveys or futures markets for election and probability methods based on opinion polls. Anthony Downs discusses at some length the crucial role of the form of the distribution of preferences along the political left-fight scale (unimodal, bimodal or multimodal) and the key role of the location of the overall median voter on this distribution in selecting the winner. The median voter theorem says the winner of the election will be the leader of the camp whose own median voter is closest to the overall median voter. We test the accuracy of this argument a la Downs, both on a small sample of eight French presidential elections and on a large sample consisting of the 577 constituencies of the French parliamentary election of 2007.

Joseph Schumpeter, who struggled with Whatley's elusive greatness, saw a systematic core in Whately: the force behind Nassau Senior's axiomatics. Whately's contemporaries did not talk of axiomatics, but they did point out that his work depended upon an unusually small number of authorities, that is, Aristotle, Bacon, and Smith. In our interpretation, these foundational sources gave Whately three guiding principles to characterize all human activity: innate sociability, innate self-love, and costly mental activity. Self-love includes a desire to know and a desire to share knowledge. These principles, coupled with a normative principle of fairness, constitute the basis for his science of reciprocal exchange, or catallactics. Violations of fairness motivate his multidimensional reform proposals. For Whately, fairness requires transparency, and the demands of transparency for tractions is literally Gospel.","[Levy, David] George Mason Univ, Ctr Study Publ Study, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Peart, Sandra J.] Univ Richmond, Jepson Sch Leadership Studies, Richmond, VA 23173 USA",George Mason University; University of Richmond,"Levy, D (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Ctr Study Publ Study, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",,"Levy, David/GPS-4945-2022",,,,,,46,3,5,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

In this paper, the financial crisis was divided into three stages and a varying parameter model of foreign trade was constructed to quantitatively analyze the elasticities of foreign and domestic income and the real effective exchange rate under the attack of the financial crisis. The results show that the elasticity of income in the export equation became smaller and the elasticity of price became larger when the structure of economic variables changed than those in the previous stages. At the same time, the elasticity in the import equation became larger. The results demonstrate that the scale of foreign trade in China is significantly sensitive to foreign income and the exchange rate, so the mode of economic growth should be shifted and the exchange rate of RMB should be devaluated appropriately to maintain a stable economic growth.","[Liu, Lin] China Jiliang Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China",China Jiliang University,,jiaoheliulin@yahoo.com.cn,,,,,,,13,1,2,0,1,AMERICAN SCHOLARS PRESS,MARIETTA,"3238 HARVEST WAY, MARIETTA, GA 30062 USA",,,978-0-9845209-1-6,,,,2010,,,,,,,223,227,,,,,,5,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTV50,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288188100044,0

An adopted model of the Heckscher-Ohlin theory, suggesting a direct relationship between a country's trade, forest endowments and income (HOV model), has been empirically estimated for three forest products (roundwood, chips & particles and wood fuel), 19 European countries and for the period 1994-2006. Both net export and an index of revealed comparative advantages was constructed and used as dependent variables. Moreover, different model specification was estimated using different measures of forest endowments. The results suggest that forest endowments are an important determinant for explaining differences in net trade of the included forest commodities. However, domestic demand, measured by income level, is not. Thus, the results provide mixed support for the HOV model. (c) 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

In our model, variety expansion reduces the relative price of a composite of differentiated goods compared to child-rearing costs. Thus, parents raise the expenditure share for differentiated goods and lower the number of children. We show that this model can be applied to a growth model in which economic growth progresses with variety expansion of consumption goods and fertility rates decrease with economic growth.

The potential advantage of this organisational system is that the vertical separation of port authority and service provision allows for competition between different service Suppliers in a port. This paper analyses such competition in a horizontal product differentiation model in which two ports compete for cargo trans-shipments. The model shows that the Landlord Port model is Nash equilibrium, and that this organisational form yields the highest profits for the port industry, and the highest prices for its Customers. Introduction of intra-port competition into the Landlord model decreases industry profits and prices, which makes the port industry reluctant to open itself to such competition. A market organisation with vertically integrated ports, that is, Service Ports, realises even lower prices and profits. However, this organisational form is not sustainable without regulation because every individual port can realise a higher profit by separating service provision from port authority in order to become a Landlord Port.","Erasmus Univ, Dept Appl Econ, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"van Reeven, P (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands.",vanreeven@ese.eur.nl,,,,,,,17,27,31,1,9,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

We use non-parametric directional analysis to assess the subjective forecasts which are based on qualitative judgments. Using the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) we are able to analyse a large number of individuals over a number of years. We also take into account individual characteristics Such as gender, age, education and employment status when assessing their subjective forecasts. The paper extends the existing literature in two ways: the accuracy and usefulness of subjective forecasts, based on directional analysis, are assessed at the household level for the first time. Secondly, we adapt and extend the methods of directional analysis, which ire applied to the household panel or longitudinal Survey.

I examine the endogenous creation of property rights, focusing on the incentives that resource quality provides to close the commons. Analytical examples explore the incentives of locals to increase or decrease the strength of property rights conditional on how locals and nonlocals value the quality of the resource. The empirical analysis looks at a unique resource-surf breaks-and estimates the relationship between the exogenous quality of the resource (waves at the surf break) and local attempts to seize the common surf break. Using cross-sectional data on 86 surf breaks along the southern California coast, this paper finds that a 10 percent increase in quality leads to a 7-17 percent increase in the strength of property rights.","Colorado Sch Mines, Golden, CO 80401 USA",Colorado School of Mines,"Kaffine, DT (通讯作者)，Colorado Sch Mines, Golden, CO 80401 USA.",,"Kaffine, Daniel/V-9996-2019",,,,,,18,23,28,0,8,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

The contracts also imposed quantity floors, a practice already in use before the regulatory change. The introduction of standards suggests that, consistent with a view of vertical restraints as coordination mechanisms, manufacturers used exclusive territories to induce desired dealer services, and, once the use of exclusive territories was prohibited, they switched to alternative contractual devices to achieve this goal. The introduction of price ceilings despite free intrabrand competition also suggests that car manufacturers tried to prevent some dealers from gaming the quantity floors by selling to other dealers' customers while charging monopolistic prices at their own locations.",,,,,"Zanarone, Giorgio/K-4513-2014","Zanarone, Giorgio/0000-0003-0226-9188",,,,,30,22,22,0,20,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

This concept's theoretical purport, empirical applicability, and relevance for the research area are considered through an analysis of an empirical case. An explanatory model is then developed, focusing on the concrete social relations in which hiding behavior originates and in which it remains embedded. From case studies we see how hiding behavior is situated in social relations characterized by a specific form of uncertainty arising from engulfment and isolation. In these relations money plays a central role, providing a medium for action-coordination essential in the incidence of economic crime. Finally, the explanatory power of the proposed conceptual model is discussed, with several possible refinements suggested for it.","Gothenburg Univ, Dept Sociol, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Engdahl, O (通讯作者)，Gothenburg Univ, Dept Sociol, Gothenburg, Sweden.",oskar.engdahl@sociology.gu.se,,,,,,,48,0,3,1,11,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

We argue that most existing temporal detection methods for biosurveillance can be characterized as a forecasting component coupled with a monitoring/detection component. In this paper, we describe the effect of forecast accuracy on detection performance. Quantifying this effect allows one to measure the benefits of improved forecasting and determine when it is worth improving a forecast method's precision at the cost of robustness or simplicity. We quantify the effect of forecast accuracy on detection metrics under different scenarios and investigate the effect when standard assumptions are violated. We illustrate our results by examining performance on authentic biosurveillance data. (C) 2008 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Theory suggests a trade-off between child quantity and quality and that siblings are unlikely to receive equal shares of parental resources devoted to children's education. We construct a new birth order index that effectively purges family size from birth order and use this to test if siblings are assigned equal shares in the family's educational resources. We find that the shares are decreasing with birth order.

Taiwan's national health insurance is financed by premiums, which are proportional to an employee's salary. These premiums may introduce distortions to the labor market. Based on repeated cross-sections of individual data we find that, on average, private sector employees' work hours declined relative to their public sector counterparts, whereas their relative wage rates were almost unchanged with the introduction of national health insurance. The results suggest that neither private sector employers nor their employees were able to shift their premium burden to each other.","[Kan, Kamhon] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 11529, Taiwan; [Lin, Yen-Ling] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 11605, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Chengchi University,"Kan, K (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.",kk@sinica.edu.tw; n2793gua@gmail.com,,,,,,,29,7,10,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

More recently, a network approach to learning and innovation emerged, which emphasizes strategic, preferential, repeated and at the same time temporary knowledge exchange (i.e. dynamic cooperation) between firms and other organizations. This may, however, go at the expense of the attention for the important, different and complementary learning effects of the mainly spatial process of concentration and clustering of related firms, industries and institutions. This paper argues that clusters and networks are two separate concepts that both merit attention, especially-albeit not exclusively-with a view to learning, knowledge development and innovation. A first argument is that spatial clustering has quite different effects for the development of knowledge, learning and innovation in and by firms, as compared with network settings. A second point is that in some cases, clustering yields a governance advantage over networks. Taking into account the risks of cognitive, technological, organizational and institutional lock-in associated with both processes, this paper concludes that both clustering and networking have advantages and disadvantages for the firms involved. The two concepts are potential dynamic complements, as clustering and networking have different but complementary effects for learning, although they are also static substitutes, as firms may opt to switch between the two processes, for example, leaving a local or regional cluster to engage in a network endeavor at a higher spatial scale.","Univ Utrecht, Sect Econ Geog, Fac Geosci, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Visser, EJ (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Sect Econ Geog, Fac Geosci, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.",e.visser@geo.uu.nl,,,,,,,109,30,36,1,52,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

This finding is derived from the interaction of binding budgetary constraints and plea bargaining. In an environment with these institutional features, higher sanctions are not always optimal when resources are limited, even if such sanctions are costless. Such potential phenomena may be useful in explaining the fact that many states have introduced limitations on plea bargaining.

First, what is the economic rationale for having a bankruptcy procedure at all and what defines an economically efficient bankruptcy procedure? Second, why did the number of U.S. bankruptcy filings increase so dramatically between 1980 and 2005? Third, a major bankruptcy reform went into effect in the United States in 2005-what did it do and how did it affect credit and mortgage markets? Finally, the paper discusses the mortgage crisis, the high social cost of foreclosures, and the difficulty of avoiding foreclosure by voluntarily renegotiation of mortgage contracts, even when such renegotiations are in the joint interest of debtors and creditors. I also discuss the pros and cons of government programs to refinance mortgages and the argument for giving bankruptcy judges new power to change the terms of residential mortgage contracts in bankruptcy.

We applied some measures of structural convergence and business cycles synchronicity to verify this hypothesis based on Eurostat data of 1995-2008 and we found that the structure of the Polish economy in comparison to the structures of the economies of the euro-zone exhibits substantial differences. The differences pertain to both the structure of production and the structure of the demand and can be a source of asymmetry of macroeconomic shocks. This conjecture is not undermined by the lack of a conclusive empirical verification of the hypothesis on the existence of a positive relation between the strength of synchronisation of business cycles and the degree of similarity of the structures of the economies.

Sustaining the organizational effectiveness is an important factor for organizational development and, the managerial level employees may utilize from the results of this study when constructing their strategy maps. To perform the study, we made a research analysis and applied a survey instrument on a number of 578 employees in metalworking industry. We constructed an original model to fulfill the gap between the organizational culture and organizational effectiveness. We measured the organizational culture in dimensions of 'involvement', 'collaboration', 'transmission of information, 'learning', 'care about clients', 'strategic direction', 'reward and incentive system', 'system of control', 'communication' and 'coordination and integration'. Additionally, we measured the organizational effectiveness in terms of 'customer orientation', 'employee satisfaction', 'organizational commitment' and 'financial & growth performance'. The methodology was carried out as researching for the survey questions on the literature, constructing the best fitting survey from the alternatives, reaching the participants and informing them for the survey, gathering the data, and measuring & analyzing these data. The gathered data were entered in SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 11.5. By the results of the SPSS analyses, we determined that the constructed model is significant (at the 0.000 level) and all organizational culture dimensions have significant correlations with organizational effectiveness (at the 0.000 level). Furthermore, the total explained variance of organizational effectiveness depending on -organizational culture dimensions- has come out as the value of 0.60. Therefore, we may conclude that; the academic researchers as well as managerial level employees should investigate other factors to reach a high level of effectiveness.","[Aydin, Bulent] Gebze Inst Technol GYTE, Dept Business Adm, Gebze, Turkey; [Ceylan, Adnan] Gebze Inst High Technol GYTE, Dept Business Adm, Gebze, Turkey",Gebze Technical University; Gebze Technical University,"Aydin, B (通讯作者)，Gebze Inst Technol GYTE, Dept Business Adm, Gebze, Turkey.",bulentaydin@kibarholding.com,"Blewett, Verna L/A-5270-2012; ceylan, adnan/AAC-2969-2019",,,,,,45,19,33,5,50,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

It reports on the findings of research based on detailed case histories of local economies in four different types of production: modernized craft manufacturing (furniture), mass production (motor vehicles), high-technology production (biopharmaceuticals) and high-tech services (television film-making). In each case a local economy in Germany (usually seen counter-factually as an example of a particularly national system) was compared with one elsewhere in Europe: respectively, southern Sweden, Hungary (compared with eastern Germany) and the UK (for two studies). In the analysis, companies act rationally in response to sector-specific challenges, being partly bound by the existing institutional framework that they encounter, but partly acting to alter it. Two possibilities are distinguished and found in the cases. In the first (structurally conservative) case, arrangements of governance in the national innovation and production system prove to be beneficial for the companies and their aim to stand up to international competition. Insofar as national institutions help companies to deal with competition on their markets, they will probably try to preserve these arrangements. In the second (innovative) case, companies turn away from the national context and develop their own local governance structure. If the national institutional structure is seen as not adequate or 'non-fitting' to deal with sectorally specific terms of competition, then the internal and external coordination of companies - in reaction to challenges posed by the market - is likely to deviate from the national structure. In some instances evidence of 'creative incoherence', where local deviation from the national model provides a creative impulse, is found.","[Crouch, Colin] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Schroeder, Martin] Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Cologne, Germany; [Voelzkow, Helmut] Univ Osnabruck, D-4500 Osnabruck, Germany",University of Warwick; Max Planck Society; University Osnabruck,"Crouch, C (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",Colin.crouch@wbs.ac.uk,"Schröder, Martin/K-7544-2012",,,,,,48,94,101,0,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

A large population of French households were surveyed nationwide by phone. The sample of respondents was later divided into two subsamples: people who have recreational activities in forests and those who do not. This dichotomy potentially biases WTP as the decision to have recreational activities in forests is endogenous. We estimate a Probit model with sample selection to correct this bias in the DC question. With the OE question, a second source of selection bias related to non-random censoring is present: some respondents are unwilling to pay. We use an extension of Heckman's approach to the double selection problem. The empirical application shows that ignoring these sample selection problems leads to biased estimates of mean WTP for biodiversity in a national Survey for France. (c) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

Industries buy and sell all over the world. Supply chains today are complex networks where members are heterogeneous (companies of several industrial sectors such as manufacturing, finance and logistics). These complex networks have to perform as a unique body; therefore, they need to be perfectly synchronised. In order to ensure continuous process monitoring and transparency, as well as accurate information flows, it is necessary to extend the electronic business relationship between manufacturers and their suppliers (B2B applications) towards those service providers, whose activities affect the quality of cooperation between business partners. [1]. The FLUID-WIN research project targets business-to-business (B2B) manufacturing networks and their interactions with the logistics and financial service providers (FSP). The FLUID-WIN platform ensures the seamless integration of 3rd party service providers with their manufacturing networks, based on easy-to-use electronic services, with the innovative B2(B2B) approach. FLUID-WIN research project aims to develop a platform which can seamlessly integrate and transfer data among all the various partners in order to enhance the competitiveness of the whole business sector in Europe and to make the business processes as efficient as possible. The European market is becoming more and more agile regarding trade finance services used by the SMEs operating in Europe. However, only a small percentage of companies use factoring and invoice discounting in order to alleviate their cash-flow difficulties. In recent years, the factoring as the alternative form of business financing becomes more and more popular, The aim of the paper is to give some information about the FLUID-WIN research project in relation to factoring and invoice discounting. These services are offered mainly by banks or by subsidiary corporations of banks, perhaps even by specialized companies called factoring houses. Factoring and invoice discounting utilization bring many advantages to entrepreneurs. Primarily, it is the possibility to obtain the financial resources before maturity of a claim.","[Giuliano, Angela] AcrossLimits Ltd, Gateway Ctr, Hamrun Hmr 1856, Malta; [Mihok, Peter; Vejacka, Martin] Tech Univ Kosiciach, Ekon Fak, Katedra Aplikovanej Matemat Hospodarskej Informat, Kosice, Slovakia; [Vincova, Kristina] Tech Univ Kosiciach, Ekon Fak, Katedra Bankovinictva Invest, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice; Technical University Kosice,"Giuliano, A (通讯作者)，AcrossLimits Ltd, Gateway Ctr, Kappillan Mifsud St, Hamrun Hmr 1856, Malta.",angele@acrosslimits.com; peter.mihok@tuke.sk; reka.moksony@regenseurope.com; martin.vejacka@tuke.sk; kristina.vincova@tuke.sk,"Kocisova, Kristina/AAA-5401-2020; N'Dri, Amoin Bernadine/IWD-7811-2023; Vejačka, Martin/P-2998-2016; Balod, Peter/B-2150-2012","Kocisova, Kristina/0000-0003-0784-441X; Vejačka, Martin/0000-0002-9761-7597; Giuliano, Angele/0000-0002-2281-6970",,,,,14,1,1,0,27,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The article builds on previous empirical results to propose an empirical mapping of corporate governance practices in Japan using a cluster analysis of a large sample of Japanese firms in 2002. Alongside the traditional Japanese pattern, the empirical results show that two new 'hybrid' models of corporate governance have emerged characterized by different linkages between corporate ownership and finance, board practices, and employment patterns. These changes reflect both a loosening of past institutional constraints related to main bank finance and growing responsiveness to diverse organizational and sector-level contingencies.","Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",University of Bath,"Jackson, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",g.s.jackson@bath.ac.uk,"Jackson, Gregory/E-3178-2010","Jackson, Gregory/0000-0002-1593-8988",,,,,61,14,14,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The knowledge of the leadership and workers in OH&S is not sufficient at present in Estonia, particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises (the number is 60 000). The small (up to 50 workers) or medium-sized enterprises (up to 150 workers) have no possibility to hire the working environment specialist who would deal only with OH&S problems. Usually obligations in the field of OH&S in small and medium-sized enterprises are delegated to one employee in addition to other responsibilities related to personnel, security, fire protection and environmental problems. Therefore, the complex approach to management of OH&S issues is needed in order to create a good safety culture and to achieve positive results in company safety performance. The complex method consists of risk assessment and determination of safety level. The authors offer possible tools - simple computer applications which are available for managers, interviews with employers, employees and occupational health specialists for development and dissemination of safety culture. The opinion of workers and occupational health specialists has been taken into consideration in the planning of improvements of working conditions by the employers.

The analysis is based on two measures of wage inequality: the skill premium and the Gini coefficient and the relative distribution Handcock and Morris method. The findings reveal that technical change has not been large enough to guarantee a shift of skilled labor to high-tech sectors. Majority of tertiary-educated workers have been employed in lower technological sectors. Comparing 2006 and 2002 the skill premium declined in many sectors and in many occupations.

To measure the effect of the law on lending to targeted groups since 1994, I take advantage of discontinuous targeting rules and abrupt changes in target status. On average, the CRA appears to have had little impact on mortgage lending, even during the mid-2000s, when lending to lower income areas nevertheless soared. I do find a significant effect during the late 1990s and early 2000s in large metropolitan areas, when and where the CRA may have been most binding. I use this episode to test the effect of the CRA on overall mortgage availability-that is, lending by both regulated and unregulated institutions. The results are consistent with the notion that government intervention in credit markets may be justified on the grounds that information externalities exist and can depress credit supply.",,,,,,,,,,,38,28,38,0,7,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

In the past decade, efforts have intensified to establish collective litigation instruments in diverse legal terrains outside the United States-including Europe-often with the common goal of allowing some form of collective legal redress while avoiding perceived disadvantages of class actions in the American experience. Today more than ever, from legislators to litigants to scholars, European reformers face the challenge-and the opportunity-of making fundamental choices about the scope and shape of the collective legal remedies they wish to make available. Choices about the shape of the class action device reflect foundational judgments about the proper allocation of costs, and there is much from the US experience that can inform Europe's prospective reformers. This article describes the history and current status of class action rules in the US, and then compares class actions and another form of extra-compensatory damages-one type of punitive damages-as means of doing the same thing. Although neither punitive damages of this sort nor class actions generally have traditionally existed in civil law systems, they both-and especially this particular form of punitive damages-can, from an economic view, be made to vindicate the same kind of social cost accounting goals. By considering these legal devices together, we hope to shed light on crucial choices facing Europe as it grapples with how best to provide collective legal redress in light of the lessons of the US experience with class actions.",,,,Guido.Calabresi@yale.edu; Kevin.Schwartz@aya.yale.edu,,,,,,,32,7,7,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Due to the different nature of the criteria involved in the assessment activity, we chose to apply the Analytic Hierarchy Process methodology (Saaty, T.L. (2006). Fundamentals of Decision Making and Priority Theory with the Analytic Hierarchy Process, RWS Publications, Pittsburgh) that allows comparing and appraising quantitatively variables that are incommensurable and that may originate from distinct and separate areas. The paper identifies the hierarchic structure necessary to measure both the performance of the emergency response system for road tunnel accidents and the weights for assessing their relative importance. Finally, the methodology is applied to a case study on a transnational road tunnel between Italy and France to show a feasible evaluation of the sensitivity of the structure to the input variables in order to find the most valuable enhancing and improving actions.

Using a panel of European countries, this paper shows that national income and demography are strong drivers. Saturating car ownership and an ageing population hardly diminish their significance. Relative to these factors, pricing is a rather weak driver, so that the impact of pricing quickly cancels out against prospective population and income growth. In relation to income growth, prices need to increase at least three times faster in order to maintain their effectiveness. Its relatively low elasticity makes pricing a good instrument to raise money for more effective (physical and soft) measures.","Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"van Reeven, P (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Burg Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands.",vanreeven@ese.eur.nl,,,,,,,35,3,3,0,5,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

Stated choice models (SCMs) are often used for modeling complex transportation choices such as these in an effort to predict demand for these travel options. The design methods for SCMs have evolved from simple orthogonal designs to more sophisticated designs such as D-efficient design that can increase efficiency in estimation. We used three different survey design strategies to produce the stated preference portion of surveys, which were used to elicit travel choices for a sample of Houston travelers. Apart from the D-efficient design we also used random and adaptive random designs to generate attribute levels. There were observable differences in choice behavior depending on what design strategy was used. These differences appear to influence estimates of the value of travel time savings (VTTS) obtained from the random parameter logit (RPL) models estimated using these data. This, in turn, would greatly impact the percentage of travelers predicted to use the MLs. The adaptive random strategy was superior to the other design methods in several categories, and it had similar efficiency to the D-efficient design. However, the mean of VTTS estimate obtained from a D-efficient design was closer to what is typically found in the literature. The difference was considerable and could greatly influence traffic and revenue estimates for the MLs, illustrating the importance of the survey design strategy. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This research finds a significant cultural influence on earnings management. Specifically, the results show that countries scoring high on individualism tend to have lower levels of earnings management. Using the Schwartz (1994, 2004) framework, this study finds that egalitarianism is negatively related to earnings management. The analysis shows that, besides the formal investor protection, it is relevant to consider cultural differences to explain earnings management. This analysis also supports the idea that culture may be an important element in the discussion of global convergence towards a single corporate governance model, or the implementation of corporate governance codes inspired by codes from societies with different cultural values.","[Desender, Kurt A.] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Business Econ Dept, E-28903 Getafe, Spain; [Castro, Christian E.; Escamilla de Leon, Sergio A.] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Business Econ Dept, Barcelona, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Desender, KA (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Business Econ Dept, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",kdesende@emp.uc3m.es; Christian.Castro@uab.es; sergioantonio.escamilla@uab.es,"Desender, Kurt/I-4834-2015","Desender, Kurt/0000-0002-6528-8004",,,,,57,29,31,2,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

In Holt's method for interval-valued time series, the smoothing parameters are estimated by using techniques for non-linear optimization problems with bound constraints. The third approach is based on a hybrid methodology that combines the MLP and Holt models. The practicality of the methods is demonstrated through simulation studies and applications using real interval-valued stock market time series. (C) 2010 International Institute of Forecasters.

Using the 2004/2005 Household Budget Survey, we assess the amount of VAT that households pay as a proportion of weekly disposable income. We measure VAT payments by equivalised income decile, households of different composition and different household sizes. The current system is highly regressive. With the use of a micro-simulation model we also estimate the impact of changing the VAT rate on certain groups of items and the associated change in revenue. We also consider how the imposition of a flat rate across all goods and services would affect households in different categories. The Irish Government has recently announced that it proposes to increase the standard rate of VAT to 22 per cent in 2013 and to 23 per cent in 2014. We examine the distributional implications of such increases. The general pattern of results shows that those hardest hit are households in the first income decile, households in rural areas, 6 person households and households containing a single adult with children.","[Leahy, Eimear; Lyons, Sean; Tol, Richard S.

A wide range of evidence, from archeological to etymological, is utilized to demonstrate that relations between men and God, carried out through the intermediary of state-religious authorities, played a causal role in the genesis of the ox-unit of value and account, and, further, in the origins of money, and, subsequently, coinage. The substantive state-religious approach presented in this paper is also compared and contrasted to the Chartalist perspective on money's origins. It is concluded that the substantive approach presented in this paper differs from the more formal approaches (e.g., Metallism) because it does not rely upon a projection of modern institutions and habits of thought (e.g., a medium of exchange; monetary taxation) into ancient societies.","Dickinson Coll, Dept Econ, Carlisle, PA 17013 USA",Dickinson College,"Semenova, A (通讯作者)，Dickinson Coll, Dept Econ, POB 1773, Carlisle, PA 17013 USA.",semenova@dickinson.edu,,,,,,,33,13,17,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

This paper uses changes in compulsory schooling laws in Great Britain and Northern Ireland to purge schooling estimates of biases resulting from individual-specific error components correlated with education. The results suggest that increased schooling does appear to reduce the incidence of teenage childbearing. Moreover, the results serve to highlight an important change in the impact of schooling on teenage childbearing following the legislation on contraception in the late 1960s.","Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Econ, Galway, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"Silles, MA (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Econ, Univ Rd, Galway, Ireland.",mary.silles@nuigalway.ie,,,,,,,14,38,43,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Our contribution to the network research of SMEs is by increasing understanding with regard to the nature of networked business development and the role of formalisation of the inter-organisational business network development process. In addition, innovation requires the ability to merge various issues more effectively. Best practices of the case companies are proposed in order to share knowledge between and within the case networks. The study revealed that formalisation at the network level is still quite low and heavily managed by the main contractor in the case network. Although most of the practices identified supported continuous improvement, the cases with development-oriented focus and network development practices were also shown to have more practices in support of innovation and idea generation. The research revealed that the current development activities (continuous improvement) and the creation of new activities (innovation) complement each other and require a variety of development practices.","[Airola, Merja] VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland, Espoo, Finland; [Salmela, Erno; Happonen, Ari] LUT Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Lappeenranta, Finland",VTT Technical Research Center Finland,"Airola, M (通讯作者)，VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland, Espoo, Finland.",merja.airola@vtt.fi; erno.salmela@lut.fi; ari.happonen@lut.fi,"Happonen, Ari/H-2697-2018","Happonen, Ari/0000-0003-0744-1776",,,,,18,1,1,0,8,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,42,50,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800006,0

In the last fifteen years the small and medium-sized companies have been searched by qualitative research. There have been defined seven main competencies which are connected with using ICT. The ICT competencies refer to a firm capacity to deploy their material and intangible resources, usually in combination with skills, to reach desired goals. These competencies have been associated with economic results and also with the companies' web presentation. To solve this task, the authors used various data mining methods and web mining methods. The authors employed decision tree classifiers and association rules as well as class outlier detection methods and hierarchical cluster analysis. The main goal of this contribution is to explore the correspondence between ICT competencies of SME, their web presentation, long term growth and to characterize a successful company. This can help an organization to improve employee's education and to develop all the competencies which are necessary for the successful implementation of ICT. During the long term research the data have been collected within thirty enterprises using multiple interviews. Some companies had developed significantly more ICT competencies than the others and these competencies help them to be more successful and competitive.","[Antlova, Klara] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Informat, Liberec, Czech Republic; [Tandler, Jindrich] Masaryk Univ, Fac Informat, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec; Masaryk University Brno,"Antlová, K (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Informat, Liberec, Czech Republic.",klara.antlova@tul.cz; popel@fi.muni.cz; 173061@mail.muni.cz,"Antlova, Klara/O-6401-2016",,,,,,26,18,18,0,31,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

In this vein, lately, become important the so-called smart meter which through its functions of separation the consumption for each power consuming device, will enable identification of opportunities to reduce energy consumption. Currently, consumer identification methods can be classified into three categories: individual load monitoring, whole-house continuous monitoring and electrical signature detection. The last method, of the electrical signature, has the advantage of its non-intrusive nature and low implementation costs. The concept of electrical signature includes the consumption characteristics of electricity consumers, which differentiate them from each other. These characteristics may relate to the total consumption of real and reactive power, harmonics introduced in circuit or transient signals. Based on the analysis of these characteristics that define the electrical signature, each power consuming device is individualized. Knowing the power consumption of each device, users will find ways to reduce energy consumption, thus modifying their consumption behavior. These changes will have implications on energy suppliers who will change the management of power generation. This paper presents a concept of detecting electricity consumers based on their electrical signature. This concept can be used as a new method of identifying the energy consumption of each electrical device.","[Ardeleanu, A.

Therefore, we adopt Taiwan's electronics industry as our experiment dataset from Jan. 2000 to March 2010. We collect 40 non-bankruptcy companies and 40 bankruptcy companies as our experiment targets. Besides, the dataset is composed a total of 640 records for eight quarters prior to the occurrence of financial distress, in which each record including 13 financial ratios and non-financial indicators. The goals for this research is divided into three motivations: (1) forecasting the accuracy and identifying the best parameter settings for particle swarm optimization-support vector machine (PSO-SVM) and Grid-SVM model; (2) comparing the prediction accuracy for self organizing map (SOM), SVM, and other hybrid models; (3) using different data sorting methods and cross-validation times to investigate the prediction accuracy among these models. Finally, the experiments show that PSO-SN'M model can find a better parameter setting and obtain the high accuracy for 92.8571% than grid search, SVM, SOM, and other hybrid models. It proves that the PSO-SVM model for prediction of corporate financial crisis is a good solution and can also help investors to make the correct investment making.","[Chen, Chia-Yu] Natl Taichung Inst Technol, Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Taichung, Taiwan; [Chen, Mu-Yen; Hsieh, Chun-Hung] Natl Taichung Inst Technol, Dept Informat Management, Taichung, Taiwan",,"Chen, CY (通讯作者)，Natl Taichung Inst Technol, Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Taichung, Taiwan.",s18983109@ntit.edu.tw; mychen@ntit.edu.tw; guu@ntit.edu.tw,"Chen, Mu-Yen/AAO-6568-2021",,National Scientific Council(NSC) of the Republic of China (ROC) [NSC-98-2410-H-025-011],"National Scientific Council(NSC) of the Republic of China (ROC)(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",The authors thank the support of National Scientific Council(NSC) of the Republic of China (ROC) to this work under Grant No. NSC-98-2410-H-025-011.,,14,0,0,0,3,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8719-3,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,3.0,,,,,,165,+,,,,,,2,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX67,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303218200034,0

This electro-thermal process is progressive. Consequently, the crater resulted during the electro-thermal erosion has free boundary in time and space. The border form depends on the thermal field produced by the spark. In this case, during the experiments a thermal field was obtained, that produces a semi spherical crater. Starting from this point, a mathematical model was proposed based on Stephan's Problem with a Gaussian distribution of the heat flux. According to this hypothesis the jump condition drives to the fact that the crater radius increases directly proportional with the discharge time which means: R=mu center dot t(d), where R is the crater radius, mu - material constant and t(d) - electric discharge time. This theoretical result drives to the surface equation which approximates good enough the surface of the experimentally obtained crater.","[Contiu, Glad; Popa, Marcel] Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania",Technical University of Cluj Napoca,,glad.contiu@tcm.utcluj.ro; marcel.popa@tcm.utcluj.ro,,,,,,,9,2,2,0,9,TECHNICAL UNIV CLUJ-NAPOCA,CLUJ-NAPOCA,"28 MEMORANDUMULUI STREET, CLUJ-NAPOCA, 400114, ROMANIA",,,978-973-662-614-2,,,,2011,,,,,,,401,404,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDA57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000312344600087,0

Spatial representation is analysed on both the municipality and neighbourhood levels, and a pronounced suburbanisation of political representation is identified, although the poorest central city neighbourhoods have never been well represented. However, there are significant differences between the political parties; while suburbanisation has been evident for all political parties since the 1970s, in recent years a distinction is developing between suburban parties and re-urbanising parties which is consistent with the development of the respective party ideologies.","Cathol Univ Leuven KU Leuven, Inst Social & Econ Geog, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium",,"de Maesschalck, F (通讯作者)，Cathol Univ Leuven KU Leuven, Inst Social & Econ Geog, Celestijnenlaan 200E, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium.",Filip.DeMaesschalck@ees.kuleuven.be,,,,,,,45,5,5,1,24,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0040-747X,,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

This article introduces a new experimental design that is based on the trust game (Berg, Dickhaut, McCabe, 1995), but eliminates the problem of multiple virtual identities. One treatment of the experiment in the virtual world SL was conducted and the results compared to the First Life (FL) control treatment, which was conducted on a university campus. In SL, significantly lower investment levels were found, but significantly higher average returns were found than in the FL treatment or in the literature. It is conjectured that the disparity between trusting and trustworthy behavior is a sign that the social structure in SL is still evolving. It seems plausible that the trustors in a young and developing society cautiously test the extent of trustworthiness, whereas the trustees strategically invest in levels of trustworthiness that are higher than in settled societies to build up a trustworthy environment.","[Richwien, Katharina; Sadrieh, Abdolkarim] Univ Magdeburg, Dept Econ & Management, D-39016 Magdeburg, Germany; [Fuellbrunn, Sascha] Luxembourg Univ, Luxembourg Sch Finance, Dept Law Econ & Finance, Luxembourg, Luxembourg",Otto von Guericke University; University of Luxembourg,"Sadrieh, A (通讯作者)，Univ Magdeburg, Dept Econ & Management, Postbox 4120, D-39016 Magdeburg, Germany.",Sadrieh@ovgu.de,"Sadrieh, Abdolkarim/C-7858-2013; Fullbrunn, Sascha/H-5710-2012","Sadrieh, Abdolkarim/0000-0002-9322-4729; Fullbrunn, Sascha/0000-0002-3862-5722",,,,,32,17,19,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0899-7764,1532-7736,,J MEDIA ECON,J.

Individuals with certain personality traits may be more attracted to the entrepreneurial form of employment than others may be. Successful entrepreneurship requires a blend of analytical, creative, and practical aspects of intelligence, which, in combination, constitute successful intelligence. Successful intelligence is the ability to succeed in life, according to one's own conception of success, within one's environmental context. Thus, success is defined in terms of personal goals. People succeed by identifying their strengths and capitalizing on them and by identifying their weaknesses and either correcting or compensating for them. They do so by adapting to, shaping, and selecting environments. That is, sometimes they change themselves to fit the environment; other times, they change the environment to fit them; still other times, they find a different environment if the one they are in is not adequate for them. Indeed, many entrepreneurs become entrepreneurs because they have been dissatisfied with business environments in which they have worked. In the other hand Individuals with certain personality traits may find entrepreneurship activities more satisfying and thus may persist long enough to actually establish the new venture and become an entrepreneur. So it seems that Emotional intelligence that one of personality characteristics is related with entrepreneurial intention. The aim of this article understands the relation between emotional intelligence and entrepreneurial intention of university students. For this purpose we used sample of 300 students from Islamic Azad University South Tehran Branch. And we get benefit from regression analyze to reach results. The questionnaire of this study is consisting of 18 questions and the reliabilities of this questionnaire were tested by Cronbach's alpha.

Prior to the actual study, piloting was done to test the items in the questionnaire. The sample size for the pilot study was 40 residents living in Taman Klang Perdana and the response rate was 36 or 90%. The findings showed that 12.8% of the residents communicated with one another electronically through mobile phones or chance encounter, that is, the level of connectedness among citizens is still low. Consequently, this is reflected in the weak association between citizen engagement and community networking (r=.129, p=.456). However, there is a positive correlation between the two variables, that is, when citizen engagement increases, community networking also increases. Hence, active residents' participation between and among themselves can be achieved if the elected political leaders visit the constituents and interact with the grassroots regularly. As 58.3% of the residents are not highly educated, the need to believe and trust someone should come from the elected one.","[Hashim, Rugayah] Univ Teknol MARA UiTM, Fac Adm Sci & Policy Studies, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia; [Jahi, Tajuddin Md.] Univ Teknol MARA UiTM, Fac Mech Engn, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia; [Rahman, Norazah Abdul] Univ Teknol MARA UiTM, Fac Chem Engn, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia; [Mazuki, Mohd.

We ask: how does uncertainty manifest itself in the innovation process? The concept of innovation implies the idea that something new is added to something that already exists or that something that exists is given up. The argument is that adding and/or taking away are ways to improve the state of affairs. In this sense, it can be argued that innovation is heavily laden with positive values. Almost without doubt, innovations are considered good for modern society. A pro-innovation bias is also evident in innovation research. Successful innovations gain the lion's share of interest in research while unsuccessful innovations remain unknown. Therefore, we know much more about innovation successes than about innovation failures. However, the newness of the idea means that some degree of uncertainty is involved in the innovation process. The basic viewpoint of this paper is that the potential value contained in innovation becomes or does not become materialized in the future. Given that the future entails uncertainty, it is reasonable to argue that uncertainty is inherent in every innovation process. Uncertainty results from the fact that, on the one hand, events in the future do not follow the course of past events, and, on the other, knowing about the future is always incomplete. This conceptual paper presents a theoretically founded framework for understanding various aspects of the uncertainty in the innovation process. Based on the systematic literature review, we identified eight factors creating uncertainty in the innovation process: technological uncertainty, market uncertainty, regulatory uncertainty, social and political uncertainty, acceptance and legitimacy uncertainty, managerial uncertainty, timing uncertainty, and consequence uncertainty. The results of this paper can be used to identify and avoid possible bottlenecks in innovation processes. This paper also fills the gap in research concerning the issues that may relate to a failure in innovation -i. e. uncertainty.","[Jalonen, Harri] Turku Univ Appl Sci, Dept Business Adm, Loimaa, Finland; [Lehtonen, Annina] Turku Sch Econ & Business Adm, Turku, Finland",University of Turku; University of Turku,"Jalonen, H (通讯作者)，Turku Univ Appl Sci, Dept Business Adm, Loimaa, Finland.",harri.jalonen@turkuamk.fi; annina.lehtonen@tse.fi,"Jalonen, Harri/JXX-7102-2024","Jalonen, Harri/0000-0002-6941-7969",,,,,70,3,3,1,30,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,486,492,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800059,0

The first one attributes a considerable degree of rationality to the reform and sees its failure in the area of unfavourable external factors (particularly the falling out with China) as well as internal factors (such as the bureaucracy of the state apparatus and the behaviour of enterprises). The second one depicts the reform as a logical manifestation of the problems of centrally planned economies where economic misbalance and irrationality are their inherent attributes.

These visualisations utilise both activity-travel data and social network information. The data used were collected through a specially designed activity-travel diary survey with a sample of Koreans in the Columbus metropolitan area in Ohio (USA). The results show that these visualisations can considerably enhance our understanding of the relationships between people's activities in space-time and their social interactions.

The forecasting performance could also vary depending on the particular group structuring utilized in reaching a final prediction. The current study compares the forecasting performance of modified consensus groups with that of staticized groups using formal role-playing. It is found that, when undistorted model forecasts are given, group forecasts (whether they are arrived at through averaging or by a detailed discussion of the forecasts) contribute positively to the forecasting accuracy. However, providing distorted initial forecasts affects the final accuracy with varying degrees of improvement over the initial forecasts. The results show a strong tendency to favor optimistic forecasts for both the staticized and modified consensus group forecasts. Overall, the role modifications are found to be successful in eliciting a differential adjustment behavior, effectively mimicking the disparities between different organizational roles. Current research suggests that group discussions may be an efficient method of displaying and resolving differential motivational contingencies, potentially leading to group forecasts that perform quite well.

High proposed carbon prices may extend rotation indefinitely. Carbon storage in wood products reduces this tendency. Biomass as an energy source displacing fossil fuels favours rotations near those of maximum biomass productivity. Use of sawn timber to displace structural materials with high embodied carbon favours somewhat longer rotations. Effects of rotation on soil carbon, and fossil carbon volatilised in harvesting operations, are further complications. Including all carbon effects results in optimal rotations somewhat longer than those based only on timber value, but shorter than those based on timber plus forest carbon. To include all factors intuitively is not possible: balanced appraisal needs economic calculations. (C) 2011 Department of Forest Economics, SLU Umea, Sweden. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

Trains are suitable for transporting peoples and goods with a good trade-off between cost and rapidity. The increase of railway traffic efficiency and flexibility requires new methods for management. New charter trains have to be added continuously without disturbing the other periodic train moves or decreasing the safety conditions. A railway system consists of a network of tracks, list of stations, safety devices (signals, sensors, etc) and a set of trains. Each train has assigned a corresponding train agent. Distributed applications are applicable in case of large systems like railway network. This paper presents a model for railway network management that operates in dynamic environments. The paper also provides a distributed management algorithm based on train agent negotiation. Dynamic attributes of algorithm include those that are measured and evaluated online.","[Santa, Maria-Magdalena; Cuibus, Octavian; Letia, Tiberiu; Enache, Mirela] Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania",Technical University of Cluj Napoca,,Maria.SANTA@aut.utcluj.ro; Octavian.CUIBUS@aut.utcluj.ro; Tiberiu.LETIA@aut.utcluj.ro; mirela.enache@yahoo.com,"Santa, Maria Magdalena/GVS-7002-2022; Cuibus, Octavian/GSE-6480-2022",,,,,,15,0,0,0,5,TECHNICAL UNIV CLUJ-NAPOCA,CLUJ-NAPOCA,"28 MEMORANDUMULUI STREET, CLUJ-NAPOCA, 400114, ROMANIA",,,978-973-662-614-2,,,,2011,,,,,,,493,498,,,,,,6,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDA57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000312344600106,0

This study considered the relevance of the contents of the IFRS for SMEs in the South African environment based on user requirements. Since SMEs do not necessarily have functional accounting departments and because they rely on external accountants to compile financial statements, we included accounting practitioners and trainee accountants from the SME sector in our survey. As a result we classified the contents of the IFRS for SMEs, from a South African perspective, into different levels of importance or relevance.","[Schutte, Danie; Buys, Pieter] North West Univ, Sch Accounting Sci, Mmabatho, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Schutte, D (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Sch Accounting Sci, Mmabatho, South Africa.",,,"Schutte, Daniel/0000-0001-7283-247X",,,,,47,7,8,2,21,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"RM EMS 4-51, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The proposed strategy approach is: using the scoring method to define the technological systems presenting high risk as critical infrastructures; analyzing the critical infrastructures using a set of reliability organization indicators; formulating recommendations to the management of critical infrastructure toward a more reliable organization. The paper offers a management model to help executives and decision makers designing a strategy in which safety and reliability are primary dimensions. The managers of critical infrastructures may find the proposed strategy approach as a useful model toward achieving an exceptionally safe organization.","[Simion, C.

In addition, we examine this in a cross-national context that adds external validity to the findings. The research method involved the web questionnaire survey with collected data from 363 respondents coming from Lithuania, Poland and the United States. Across the pooled sample, Functional Success was highly correlated to Emotional Intelligence components of Self Awareness, Emotional Resilience, Intuitiveness, Motivation and Contentiousness but not related to Influence, or Interpersonal Sensitivity. However, these tended to be differential across countries. Several major implications are evident from these results. First, successful managerial styles are differential across countries. Thus a successful manager in one area may be less successful elsewhere. Second within each country/culture there are characteristics that can be identified that typically led to a more successful project outcome. We find that there are rather unique components that lead to success in different paths. Interestingly, motivation of the manager led to very limited success - and then only at a basic functional level (e.g., the project was done on time and at budget).","[Skudiene, Vida; Auruskeviciene, Vilte] ISM Univ Management & Econ, LT-44254 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Reardon, James] Univ No Colorado, Monfort Coll Business, Greeley, CO 80639 USA; [Stangej, Olga] ISM Univ Management & Econ, LT-01304 Vilnius, Lithuania",ISM University of Management & Economics; University of Northern Colorado; ISM University of Management & Economics,"Skudiene, V (通讯作者)，ISM Univ Management & Econ, Ozeskienes Str 18-220, LT-44254 Kaunas, Lithuania.",vida.skudiene@ism.lt; vilte.auruskeviciene@ism.lt; james.reardon@unco.edu; olga.stangej@gmail.com,,"Stangej, Olga/0000-0001-6224-6733",,,,,52,2,7,2,49,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.
