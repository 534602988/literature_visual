Although many studies have linked the quantity of education to health outcomes, the effect of school quality on health has yet to be examined. I construct synthetic birth cohorts and relate the quality of education they attained to their mortality rates. I find that there is a statistically significant relationship between the mortality-schooling gradients, which depict the return to a year of schooling, and the length of school term and relative teacher wage. For instance, increasing the relative teacher wage by one standard deviation results in about 1.9 less deaths per 1000 people per extra year of education. My results suggest that one way to improve the health of the population is to improve school quality. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Every service offering needs generic functionalities like security, billing and customer data management. Such functionalities used to be integrated in the mobile network infrastructure but are now offered by competing service platforms. Future service platforms might be offered by operators but can also be embedded in the mobile phone or at the systems of the service providers. Studying flexibility of service platforms requires technological as well as strategic analysis, and should take into account the perspective of multiple stakeholders. Where to locate service platforms is not just a technological matter as it greatly influences flexibility of both service providers and end-users. This paper analyzes how various service platform technologies that are located at operators, mobile phone and service providers influence flexibility. We find that no single service platform offers superior flexibility to both service providers and end-users. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The results show that adoption rates are low and declining over time, coinciding with a negative sentiment regarding the label in the popular media. Labels are clustered among smaller, post-war homes in neighborhoods with more difficult selling conditions. We also document that geographic variation in the adoption rate of energy labels is positively related to the fraction of green voters during the 2006 national elections. Within the sample of labeled homes, the energy label creates transparency in the energy efficiency of dwellings.

In the field, the deposit-refund (D-R) policy has been considered as an ideal policy for internalizing disposal costs, which can result in the realization of the first-best policy. However, the possibility of firms' illegal disposal has been neglected. We introduce a monitoring cost to prevent firms from disposing of collected residuals illegally and induce the second-best D-R policy. We find that the relation between the monitoring problem for firms and the price of the recycling market brings about a variation in the optimal level of the refunds (which is typically smaller than the first-best level). Further, we investigate an alternative policy that requires producers to take-back residuals and show how this policy works equivalently to the second-best D-R policy by applying the theory of the tradable rights market.

With public benefits such as environmental conservation, amenity and carbon sequestration being increasingly emphasised in forest policy agendas, there is a need to understand the willingness and ability of traditional and new owner groups to deliver such benefits. A quantitative typology of private woodland owners was developed through a self-completion postal survey administered in three study areas in England: the Lake District, Cornwall and the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Owners were classified using Factor, Cluster and Discriminant analysis into six owner types: the Individualist, the Multifunctional Owner, the Private Consumer, the Conservationist, the Investor and the Amenity Owner. Of all owner types, Multifunctional Owners are the most likely to deliver a range of public benefits, while Individualists are the least amenable to subsidies to encourage public good delivery. A range of policy options will be required to reflect to diverse range of objectives and goals of woodland owners, including advisory services, incentives and market mechanisms.

We propose to investigate how the allocation of indirect costs or overheads can affect the estimation of patient costs and lead to improvements in the analysis of patient cost estimates. Instead of focussing on the costing method, this paper will highlight observed changes in variation explained by a methodology choice. We compare four overhead allocation methods for a specific Spanish population adjusted using the Clinical Risk Groups model. Our main conclusion is that the amount of global variation explained by the risk adjustment model depends mainly on direct costs, regardless of the cost allocation methodology used. Furthermore, the variation explained can be slightly increased, depending on the cost allocation methodology, and is independent of the level of aggregation in the classification system.","[Carreras, M.; Coderch, J.; Vall-Llosera, L.; Inoriza, J.

In this paper, we use non-teaching wages of former teachers to estimate the determinants of teacher attrition, including the wage differential between teaching and non-teaching occupations, as well as the teacher work environment. The results suggest that the wage differential only matters for inexperienced teachers with less than 6 years of teaching experience, while the work environment affects both inexperienced and experienced teachers. The magnitude of the wage differential is small relative to the effect of the teaching work environment on teachers' exiting decisions. Furthermore, no compensating differentials of sufficient size are found. For inexperienced teachers, a teacher practicum, i.e., student teaching, is found to reduce attrition while certification and education degrees have no effect. Lastly, whether a teacher lives in households with income above $40,000 (excluding their own) significantly increases attrition.

However, greater levels of political risk, measured through scales of political discretion, corruption, and economic freedom, do also attract higher inflows.

Based on individual-level data, four hypotheses are examined: skill-biased technical change, routinization, skill supply evolution and wage-setting institutions. We find massive occupational upgrading which matches educational expansion: employment expanded most at the top of the occupational hierarchy, among managers and professionals. In parallel, intermediary occupations (clerks and production workers) declined relative to those at the bottom (interpersonal service workers). This U-shaped pattern of upgrading is consistent with the routinization hypothesis: technology seems a better substitute for average-paid clerical and manufacturing jobs than for low-end interpersonal service jobs. Yet country differences in low-paid services suggest that wage-setting institutions channel technological change into more or less polarized patterns of upgrading. Moreover, immigration surges in Britain and Spain seem decisive in having provided the low-skilled labour supply necessary to fill low-paid jobs.","[Oesch, Daniel] Univ Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Rodriguez Menes, Jorge] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain",University of Lausanne; Pompeu Fabra University,"Oesch, D (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",daniel.oesch@unil.ch,"Rodriguez-Menes, Jorge/D-6269-2013; Menes, Jorge Rodriguez/AAF-8301-2019; Daniel, Oesch/C-2243-2016","Menes, Jorge Rodriguez/0000-0001-5445-6319; Daniel, Oesch/0000-0003-1704-853X",,,,,32,133,133,1,111,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

After outlining the role of that concept in the context of economic integration agreements in general, this article surveys CATS exemptions and regulatory provisions and argues that the GATS has, in fill, failed to develop an autonomous notion of public services. Such an 'agnostic' approach is contrasted with the 'dialectic' chararterizing the European Union (EU), which, in constant dialogue with its Member States, has developed a sophisticated theoretical and regulatory framework for 'Services of General Interest (SGI)'. It is concluded that the institutional features that differentiate WTO intergovernmentalism from EU supranationalism largely account for such a conceptual cleavage.","Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Int & European Law, Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Arena, A (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Int & European Law, Naples, Italy.",amedeo.arena@unina.it,"Arena, Amedeo/AAI-4733-2020","Arena, Amedeo/0000-0002-9349-6142",,,,,156,6,6,0,4,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Aim of this study was to collect resource-use data related to IBD via a cross-sectional study, to quantify these from the perspective of the Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) and to identify cost-driving factors. Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) from 24 gastroenterological specialists' practices and two hospitals were enrolled in an internet-based database between March 2006 and July 2007. Outpatient services, inpatient visits as well as medication usage were recorded and evaluated from the perspective of the SHI for 2007. Disease severity was measured by the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and the Colitis Activity Index (CAI), respectively. Extensive statistical analyses including generalized linear modeling (gamma model with the log link) to identify cost-driving factors were performed. Data from 1,030 patients with IBD (CD: 511; UC: 519) were collected. On average a patient with CD incurs annual costs of EUR 3,767 (+/- 5,895 (SD)) (among those 68.5% medication; 20.5% inpatient) and an average patient with UC incurs EUR 2,478 (+/- 4,591) (74% medication; 10% inpatient), whereas 10% of the patient with IBD account for 49% (CD: 50%; UC: 46%) of the costs. The regression analysis showed that especially the use of TNF-alpha-inhibitors, inpatient stays, gender as well as the severity status has a significant influence on costs. Further disease-specific impact factors were identified. This is the first study to calculate costs due to CD and UC from the perspective of the SHI in Germany and to identify cost-driving factors. It confirms a high economic burden of IBD to payers and society.","[Prenzler, Anne; von der Schulenburg, J.

While most approaches stress technological solutions, scholars and policy-makers tend to overlook economics, labour market issues, and industrial relations. Applying agency theory from behavioural economics, this article analyses threats to the US supply chain and opportunities for efficient solutions. Using data from a sophisticated web-based survey of owner-operator cost-of-operations, it shows that drayage(1) drivers are among the lowest paid truck drivers and workers in the US. We provide evidence that low pay is associated with both safety and security risk. Low-wage labour and subcontracting present challenges to US and foreign supply-chain security because the market attracts workers who have few other employment options. In this environment, principals and agents currently make inefficient and inequitable contracts because markets do not reflect the complete costs associated with low-probability/high-impact events like cargo theft and transport security.","[Belzer, Michael H.] Wayne State Univ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Swan, Peter F.] Penn State Univ, Harrisburg, PA USA",Wayne State University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University,"Belzer, MH (通讯作者)，Wayne State Univ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA.",,"Belzer, Michael/N-5789-2019; Tong, Xun/A-9304-2015","Belzer, Michael/0000-0001-7069-5838;",,,,,74,15,24,3,40,UNIV NEW SOUTH WALES-CENTRE APPLIED ECONOMIC RESEARCH,SYDNEY,"ECONOMIC & LABOUR RELATIONS REVIEW, INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS RES CTR, SYDNEY, NSW 2052, AUSTRALIA",1035-3046,,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

J,"France, B",,,,"France, Bev",,,How Post Normal views of science have contributed to a model of communication about biotechnology,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SCHOOL SCIENCE,The political debate on genetic engineering in New Zealand during 2001-02 provided a focus for the development of a model for communication about biotechnology. Ravetz's challenge to develop a pedagogy to explore a Post Normal view of science was taken up by this author when she developed strategies for biology teachers to examine biotechnological processes and products from a Post Normal science viewpoint. This view of system uncertainties strongly influenced the inclusion of risk as an element that affected a person's 'view' of biotechnology within this communication model. Further development of this problem-solving spectrum of Post Normal science is possible if biotechnology is analysed from a technological epistemological perspective where a biotechnological outcome can be judged according to its fitness for purpose. If this occurs there are opportunities for biotechnology to be characterised as an example of Post Normal science from a scientific as well as an technological epistemology. Such analysis could provide opportunity for such an integrative perspective to be proposed and characterised. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In practice, policymakers use indicators, i.e., measurements based on the current economic state and decisions, representing given sustainability issues. In this paper, I introduce a criterion characterizing sustainability with indicators and thresholds acting as constraints. I interpret the thresholds as minimal rights to be guaranteed to all generations, and define sustainable trajectories as those satisfying all the constraints at all times. The new criterion is a generalized maximin criterion. The approach is applied to a simple production-consumption economy with non-renewable resources. To derive some policy recommendations on the use of indicators to deal with sustainability, I discuss the implications of such a criterion in terms of trade-off between sustainability thresholds, efficiency, and time-consistency. In particular, the resulting problem is time-inconsistent, and sustainability thresholds may be revised over time. Following the time-inconsistent policy based on indicators, with dynamic revision of the thresholds, may, however, result in a sustained utility path, and even in utility growth.

At the beginning of transition, the new opportunities to start own businesses were expected to release the entrepreneurship potential of the population and lead to fast convergence towards the successful market economies. At the same time, entrepreneurship was expected to alleviate the labour shedding from restructured inefficient industrial sector. The data seldom corroborates this successful transition scenario. This paper provides analysis of the regional differences in self-employment in Croatia during the mature transition 1998-2008 period. Although self-employment cannot be equalized with entrepreneurship, Labour Force Survey as relatively rich data source enables investigation of certain factors that might be partially related to the overall entrepreneurship propensity of the working population in Croatia. Furthermore, analysis of potential regional differences in Croatian labour force entrepreneurship propensity has not been previously quantitatively assessed in the literature. The regional perspective in the paper is used to investigate whether there is a link between the evolution of self-employment and overall unemployment rate in the region (does self-employment help to alleviate unemployment problems?), the share of public sector employment (do chances of finding a secure government job impede entrepreneurship?), economic structure of the region (which economic sectors are more likely to encourage self-employment?) through time. In addition, the characteristics of the self-employed - in terms of gender, age, occupation, education, wage, household characteristics - are compared to those in employment. With this segment of the analysis we try to reveal whether there is higher entrepreneurship propensity within certain population subgroups in Croatia.","[Botric, Valerija] Inst Econ, Trg JF Kennedy 7, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ); University of Zagreb,"Botric, V (通讯作者)，Inst Econ, Trg JF Kennedy 7, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",vbotric@eizg.hr,,,"Croatian Ministry of Science, Education and Sports under the project Socioeconomic dimensions of unemployment, poverty and social exclusion [002-0022469-2462]","Croatian Ministry of Science, Education and Sports under the project Socioeconomic dimensions of unemployment, poverty and social exclusion","The author would like to express her gratitude to the Central Bureau of Statistics for supplying detailed Labour Force Survey data.

Our project addresses wildland fire risk in this part of the U.S and its intersection with social vulnerability. We examine spatial association between high wildland fire prone areas which also rank high in social vulnerability (hot spots) for Alabama, Arkansas, Florida. Georgia, Mississippi, and South Carolina. We also look at the proximity of hot spots to wildland fire mitigation programs. We hypothesize that hot spots are less likely than high wildland fire risk/low social vulnerability communities to engage with mitigation programs (e.g., Community Wildfire Protection Plans or Firewise Communities). To assess our hypothesis, we examined mean distances between: 1) hot spots and mitigation programs and 2) high wildland fire risk/low social vulnerability communities and mitigation programs. Overall, results show longer mean distances from hot spots to mitigation programs, compared to distances for high wildland fire risk/low social vulnerability communities. This finding provides support for our hypothesis and suggests that poorer communities in the southeast with high wildland fire risk may be at a greater disadvantage than more affluent, high fire risk communities in these states.

Why is there no mass exodus at such junctures? Why do most small investors practice 'loyalty' instead of 'exit' (Hirschman)? Even more importantly, why do they enter the financial market at all since its 'hypercomplexity' exposes them to an experience of confusion and helplessness? Behavioural economics provides some partial answers, but they remain too abstract and ahistorical and give a very reductionist picture of decision-making. In reaction to this incomplete understanding of the 'loyalty' puzzle, I will present two important explanatory factors from sociological reasoning: collectively shared stories as reducers of 'hypercomplexity' in which small investors' decision-making is embedded, and the rebuilding of the welfare state, which forces more and more people to become small investors and stay in the market despite serious losses.","Univ Bremen, Inst Soziol, D-2800 Bremen 33, Germany",University of Bremen,"Schimank, U (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, Inst Soziol, D-2800 Bremen 33, Germany.",uwe.schimank@uni-bremen.de,,,,,,,72,14,16,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The results indicate that the signal approach can provide an effective warning system despite its nonparametric nature. The top three indicators that are useful in anticipating crises include international reserves, stock market indices, and gross domestic product (GDP), in that order. Excess money balances and the ratio of domestic credit to GDP are significant and have positive correlation with the probability of a crisis. The growth rate of exports and the stock indices are significant and have a negative relationship with a crisis probability. Overall, the results indicate that government policies, the macroeconomic environment, and investor panic/self-fulfilling expectations all play a role in the making of a crisis.","[Budsayaplakorn, Saksit] Kasetsart Univ, Dept Econ, Bangkok, Thailand; [Dibooglu, Sel] Univ Missouri, Dept Econ, St Louis, MO USA; [Mathur, Ike] So Illinois Univ, Dept Finance, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA",Kasetsart University; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Saint Louis; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University,"Budsayaplakorn, S (通讯作者)，Kasetsart Univ, Dept Econ, Bangkok, Thailand.",saksit.b@ku.ac.th; dibooglus@umsl.edu; imathur@business.siuc.edu,"Dibooglu, Sel/AAJ-4102-2020","Dibooglu, Sel/0000-0002-3865-5868",,,,,19,14,15,0,11,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The proposed approach models heterogeneity in preferences for recreational behavior, using a utility theoretical framework to simultaneously model participation and site selection decisions. Estimation of the latent segmentation KT model with standard maximum likelihood techniques is numerically difficult because of the large number of parameters in the segment membership functions and the utility function for each latent segment. To address this problem, we propose the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the model. In the empirical section, we implement the EM latent segmentation KT approach to analyze a Southern California beach recreation data set. Our empirical analysis suggests that three groups exist in the sample. Using the model to analyze two hypothetical beach management policy scenarios illustrates different welfare impacts across groups. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

There were hopes that its successor, the 2009 Fair Work Act, would usher in a new regime of good-faith workplace relations, support for collective bargaining and vulnerable workers' access to enforceable labour rights. Major gaps are the failure to address workplace power imbalance, especially in small workplaces, and lack of support for employee participation and voice mechanisms. A case is made for the inclusion of such mechanisms in legislative National Employment Standards. The article concludes by arguing that it is a mistake for unions to expect too much from legislation, rather than investing in the pursuit of the sort of community alliances which, after all, have made a restoration of Work Choices untenable.","[Barnes, Alison] Macquarie Univ, Dept Business, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Lafferty, George] Univ Western Sydney, Sch Management, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia",Macquarie University; Western Sydney University,"Barnes, A (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Business, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",alison.barnes@mq.edu.au; G.Lafferty@uws.edu.au,,"Barnes, Alison/0000-0002-0920-2990",,,,,22,4,4,0,12,UNIV NEW SOUTH WALES-CENTRE APPLIED ECONOMIC RESEARCH,SYDNEY,"ECONOMIC & LABOUR RELATIONS REVIEW, INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS RES CTR, SYDNEY, NSW 2052, AUSTRALIA",1035-3046,,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

It explores the limitations of the Fair Work Act's compliance-based approach to good faith, which consists mainly of the parties presenting a legally defensible appearance of not acting in bad faith. In contrast, the New Zealand legislation aims to suffuse good faith with considerable content and definition, enabling parties to the employment relationship to extend good faith well beyond bargaining. In contrast to the Employment Relations Act, the formalistic, procedural approach promoted by the Fair Work Act is unlikely to encourage a significant cultural change towards meaningful good faith principles and practices.","[Dorsett, Shaunnagh] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Law, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Lafferty, George] Univ Western Sydney, Sch Management, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia",University of Technology Sydney; Western Sydney University,"Dorsett, S (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Law, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",Shaunnagh.Dorsett@uts.edu.au; G.Lafferty@uws.edu.au,,"Dorsett, Shaunnagh/0000-0002-3541-5164",,,,,18,3,3,1,7,UNIV NEW SOUTH WALES-CENTRE APPLIED ECONOMIC RESEARCH,SYDNEY,"ECONOMIC & LABOUR RELATIONS REVIEW, INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS RES CTR, SYDNEY, NSW 2052, AUSTRALIA",1035-3046,,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Poignant examples include globalization, ageing and climate change, but also policy decisions taken by nation-states or the European Union. Scenarios are an appropriate method by which to explore possible future developmental pathways in a dynamic context. This contribution describes and discusses four economic policy scenarios produced by the ESPON 3.2 project and link these to the Lisbon Strategy and the European Social Model. In each scenario, a policy package is assembled from existing EU policy areas according to a particular ideological context. Afterwards, its territorial consequences are discussed in terms of socioeconomic disparities, migration and the environment. In so doing, some observations will be made regarding possible spin-offs, trade-offs and side effects of European policy when placed in a spatial context. These scenarios should hold interest for policy discussions on territorial cohesion, a concept which seeks to integrate economic development and spatial planning, as well as on European competitiveness and cohesion.

Although the Fair Work Act offers a simple alternative to dated and complicated anti-discrimination laws, its provisions are at times overly-simple, raising uncertainty about how they will operate. Our analysis leads us to conclude that the approach to discrimination protection in the Fair Work Act, while an important addition to the remedies available to Australian workers, is compromised by failing to take account of lessons learned in the long history of anti-discrimination law.","[Rice, Simon; Roles, Cameron] Australian Natl Univ, ANU Coll Law, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Rice, S (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, ANU Coll Law, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",simon.rice@anu.edu.au; cameron.roles@anu.edu.au,"Roles, Cameron L/V-1425-2018","RICE, SIMON/0000-0002-3932-4710",,,,,20,5,5,0,5,UNIV NEW SOUTH WALES-CENTRE APPLIED ECONOMIC RESEARCH,SYDNEY,"ECONOMIC & LABOUR RELATIONS REVIEW, INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS RES CTR, SYDNEY, NSW 2052, AUSTRALIA",1035-3046,,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

The data come from administrative records and a 2006 survey of teachers in Washington State. The results suggest that Washington's teachers are fairly knowledgeable about their pensions, although new entrants and mid-career teachers appear to be less knowledgeable than veterans. As for teachers' preferences for plan structure, the survey suggests that when it comes to investing additional retirement savings, a plurality of teachers favor defined contribution plans that offer more portability and choice but also more risk than traditional defined benefit plans.

This was achieved by performing stand-level simulations that took into account: i) input data errors (airborne laser-scanning data vs. ocular standwise field inventory data), ii) stochastic future development of timber assortment prices and iii) errors in stand-level growth projection models. The starting point of the study was a simulated forest estate comprising 40 stands of various types sufficiently represented (e.g. with respect to species composition, development class distribution, and site quality). Stochastic timber price models were formulated, employing geometric mean-reverting principles. The results showed that sources of uncertainty all had significant effects on the probability distribution of the net present value of the stand. The relative standard deviations of stand net present values averaged 8% for stochastic timber price, 29% for errors in standwise field inventory data. 26% for errors in airborne laser-scanning data and 33% for errors in growth projection models when applying a 3% discount rate. When all three sources of uncertainty were analysed simultaneously, the highest average standard deviation was 47.4%. Interestingly, errors in the growth projections and the quality of inventory data contributed more to the variation in stand net present value than fluctuation in timber price did, although this result was based on the assumption that the forestry industry maintains its competitiveness in the long run. Our modeling approach made it possible to compare various sources of uncertainty and to set confidence intervals for net present value estimates. This approach can also result in information on which sources of uncertainty are focused. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Two dimensions of heterogeneity, with respect to income and age, have recently received attention due to their policy relevance. We propose a quantile regression approach to simultaneously explore these two sources of heterogeneity and their interactions within the context of the hedonic wage model, the most common revealed preference approach for obtaining value of statistical life estimates. We illustrate the approach using data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). We find that the impact of age on the wage-risk tradeoff varies across the wage distribution. This result indicates important interactions between age and income heterogeneity. Thus, the conventional mean hedonic wage regression, even when the mean effect is allowed to vary with age, masks important heterogeneity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Available options such as biofuels, liquid hydrogen and electric propulsion will not only impact on the design and functionality of commercial airplanes, but also will affect the entire industry from supply through to operation and maintenance. However, on account of the global spread and international nature of aviation, in addition to the lock-in effect associated with existing fossil-fuel driven technology, the present aviation paradigm is not well equipped for a massive or rapid technological transition. This paper first provides an overview of selected available propulsion options, as well as their possible impact on the aviation infrastructure. It then sets out to identify the existing regime players in the aviation transition arena as a means to provide an overview of potential path trajectories, with a view to assessing how airport owners and other salient regime players can either facilitate or hinder the transition to alternative and less carbon-intensive technologies.

We use data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC), which follows an Australian cohort born in 1999/2000. Skills and computer usage information is collected when children are approximately 5 and 7 years old. For cognitive skills, our results indicate that computer time has a positive effect. For non-cognitive skills the evidence is mixed, the effect depending on the score and the age of the children. We test the robustness of our results by comparing OLS, IV and Value Added estimators.

There were also substantial increases in the proportion of women in Ohio's manufacturing workforce, and women's wage increases kept pace with those of men. After matching the employment and wage data to input and output data from Ohio's manufacturing census, the study estimates the parameters for industry group translog production functions. The estimates indicate that Ohio's manufacturers adopted new organizational structures and technologies that favored an increasingly intensive use of female clerical labor. The study performs a counterfactual exercise that illustrates the extent to which non-neutral technological and organizational changes over this period explain the observed increases in the employment and remuneration of female clerical workers.","[Adshade, Marina] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Econ, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada; [Keay, Ian] Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",Dalhousie University; Queens University - Canada,"Adshade, M (通讯作者)，Dalhousie Univ, Dept Econ, 6214 Univ Ave, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada.",marina.adshade@dal.ca; ikeay@qed.econ.queensu.ca,,,,,,,51,1,2,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,,,FEM ECON,Fem.

This paper, through the KK electricity consumption method, describes the dynamic evolution of the informal economy. The results show that the informal economic output is instable and severe amplitude than the formal economy, but under the impact of the financial crisis, there is no collapse phenomenon. Even more, the informal economy earlier perceived volatility of economic system, and the recovery phase of the growth rate was much higher than the growth of the informal economy, which means the flexibility of the informal economy is indeed higher than the formal economy. In conclusion, this paper pointed out that the informal economy and formal economy complement each other, although there are counter-balance in the relationship, but in a long-term perspective, informal employment's reservoir effect could well ease the employment pressure in China.","[Chen Min] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang Gongshang University,,chenmin2100@163.com,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,5,ST PLUM-BLOSSOM PRESS PTY LTD,MELBOURNE,"LEVEL 5-11 QUEENS RD,, MELBOURNE, VC 3004, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-646-54629-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,15,20,,,,,,6,Economics; Industrial Relations & Labor,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYS99,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300067800003,0

China, in particular, has been experiencing an acceleration in its R&D intensity, causing many to wonder whether China is undergoing an S&T takeoff. In this paper, we simulate the effects of an S&T takeoff using a model of China that incorporates econometric estimates from 1500 industrial enterprises in China. We find that an S&T takeoff will lead to lower goods prices overall, but a larger drop in energy prices due to the energy-saving bias of R&D. The outcome is higher capital investment and economic growth; a substitution of energy for other factors of production; and greater energy consumption by households. Our findings underscore the importance of considering the economy-wide implications of a technology policy, recognizing that better technology does not necessarily imply a cleaner environment.

Optimal selectivity switches when real effort cost goes beyond a certain level, and this switch induces a non-marginal reduction in the level of fishing effort. In the second part of this article, we shoot, that the current level of real effort cost in the Nephrops fishery of the Bay of Biscay is far below the switch point, which makes high selectivity optimal. The discrepancy between optimal and current selectivity may be explained by the state of the fishery management and also by the fact that selectivity is hardly observable with the type of gear presently used.","[Macher, Claire] IFREMER, UMR AMURE, Dept Econ Maritime, F-29280 Plouzane, France; [Boncoeur, Jean] Univ Brest, UEB, UMR AMURE, F-29238 Brest 3, France",Universite de Bretagne Occidentale; Ifremer; Universite de Bretagne Occidentale; Ifremer,"Macher, C (通讯作者)，IFREMER, UMR AMURE, Dept Econ Maritime, BP 70, F-29280 Plouzane, France.",claire.macher@infremer.fr; jean.boncoeur@univ-brest.fr,,"Macher, Claire/0000-0001-9307-6562",Brittany Region,Brittany Region(Region Bretagne),The authors thank members who attended the 2008 IIFET Conference for their valuable comments regarding this article and the Brittany Region for its financial support to attend this conference.

Given two age classes, knife-edge selectivity, and no stock-dependent harvesting cost, the steady state is a unique saddle point. Adding harvesting cost does not alter the uniqueness, given that the utility is linear. Under specific conditions such as nonselective gear, optimal harvesting is proved to be a stationary cycle that represents pulse fishing. Optimal steady states are different if age-structured information is ignored and optimization is based on traditional biomass variables. This implies that the existence of optimal sustainable harvesting depends on age-structured information. Given a specific set of conditions such as low interest rate and knife-edge selectivity, optimal harvesting converges toward a unique saddle point independently of the number of age classes.

AN EXAMINATION OF THE STATISTICAL PROPERTIES AND POLICY ALTERNATIVES,EDUCATION FINANCE AND POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ACHIEVEMENT; SCHOOLS; GAP,"Annual student testing may make it possible to measure the contributions to student achievement made by individual teachers. But would these teacher value-added measures help to improve student achievement? I consider the statistical validity, purposes, and costs of teacher value-added policies. Many of the key assumptions of teacher value added are rejected by empirical evidence. However, the assumption violations may not be severe, and value-added measures still seem to contain useful information. I also compare teacher value-added accountability with three main policy alternatives: teacher credentials, school value-added accountability, and formative uses of test data. I argue that using teacher value-added measures is likely to increase student achievement more efficiently than a teacher credentials-only strategy but may not be the most cost-effective policy overall. Resolving this issue will require a new research and policy agenda that goes beyond analysis of assumptions and statistical properties and focuses on the effects of actual policy alternatives.","Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Harris, DN (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, 1025 W Johnson St 575K, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",dnharris3@wisc.edu,,,,,,,57,30,73,2,13,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

What sort of mission should the head of an enforcement program be given? When there is more than one firm being regulated the firms' decision problems-otherwise completely separate-become linked in a way that depends on that mission. Under some sorts of missions firms compete to avoid the attention of the enforcer by competitive reductions in the extent of their noncompliance, in others the interaction encourages competitive expansions. We develop a general model that allows for the ordering of some typical classes of missions. We find that in plausible settings 'target-driven' missions (that set a hard target in terms of environmental outcome but flexible budget) achieve the same outcome at lower cost than 'budget-driven' ones (that fix the enforcement budget).

This paper starts with a presentation of a visionary methodology by which the environmental performance of present work profiles (taken from research reports and policy strategies by Finnish ministries) is assessed. Due to this all the work profiles presented in this paper are preliminary and only serve the purpose of illustrating the methodology. In a second step an extensive survey will be carried out in larger companies to create more detailed and empirical work profiles. At the same time, further effort has to be put into analysing alternative future work profiles and possibly to include economic and social aspects. In order to determine the environmental impact of office work, two normally independent methods are combined in this paper. A futures table is used to describe a number of alternative work profiles. This table matrix serves also as the basis to establish future scenarios of probable and possible working weeks. Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) is the tool used for figuring out the energy and material performance according to the modelled work profiles. When used together, the two methods comprise - as we call it with respect to future-oriented work scenarios - a Visionary Life Cycle Analysis (VLCA) of Office Work. The immediate results of this methodology demonstrate which working profiles are ecologically more sustainable than others. Weaknesses in behaviour patterns are detected and space for improvement is localised. In short: this methodology enables a company or single worker to analyse present work profiles and patterns and to create new visionary and sustainable work patterns. The final goal could be to provide a tool to document anybody's work profile and to show how - by changing certain habits - the individual's (environmental) performance could be improved.

In general, individual-specific covariates remain robust regardless of group structure specification in dropout models, but lose significance in models of drug-use. Estimates of correlated school effects depend on the specification of group structure. Contextual group effects have no influence on the probability that an individual uses drugs, but demonstrate some statistical significance, albeit ambiguous and strongly dependent on the specification of group structure. Endogenous peer effects do not influence the probability of dropping-out of school, but exhibit positive complementarities with respect to recent drug-use. Modeling the probabilities of leaving school and recent drug-use within a jointly distributed empirical framework indicates that unobserved attributes bridging the two types of behavior demonstrate positive correlation.

Some years ago, most forest enterprises exclusively focused on wood production, whereas today, forest management is expected to be multifunctional and economically as well as socially and ecologically sustainable [Harrison, S., Herbohn, J., Niskanen, A., 2002.

In this context. non-timber forest products (NTFPs) such as forest honey, mushrooms, or berries could gain importance as an additional source of income for the forestry sector. To assess the market potential of NTFPs in Switzerland, two corresponding surveys were conducted. A consumer survey (N = 897) conducted in six cities in Switzerland investigated the purchase of Swiss NTFPs, consumer preferences, and demand potentials. An additional survey of sellers of NTFPs (N = 105) looked at these aspects from a complementary perspective. The results showed that there is a high esteem and considerable demand potential for such products among urban consumers. Food products were mentioned most frequently. Both consumers and sellers considered quality and environmental friendliness the most important attributes of NTFPs. Structural and organizational innovations and considerable marketing efforts and sales promotion would be required to expand the market for Swiss NTFP, however. Our results indicate that certification of the products' origin, environmental performance. and quality could support such efforts and that recreational and ecological forest services have a synergetic potential for the marketing of NTFPs.

J,"Aligica, PD",,,,"Aligica, Paul Dragos",,,"Social predictions, institutional design and prestige loops: Richard Henshel's contribution to futures studies",FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY; CONSEQUENCES; FORECAST; SUBJECT,"The article is both a contribution to the intellectual history of the field and a reminder that future studies have always been concerned not only with the epistemics and the cognitive procedures regarding the future but also with the impact of ideas on the very unfolding of the future. Cases when social predictions, by the mere fact of being made public, change the situations they have predicted, are an important challenge for social theory and institutional design. Richard Henshel dedicated an important part of his work to their study. The paper starts by mapping the conceptual contours of the problem. Then it outlines the ways in which various authors have dealt with its challenge, thereby putting the distinctiveness of Henshel's unique contribution in a clearer perspective. The paper continues by presenting Henshel's main arguments as they were developed around the key concept of 'prestige loop' as well as some of the implications of the fact that social predictions and 'prestige loops' not only challenge the way we understand the relationship between social theory and its practical applications, but also the ways we understand the very nature of applied social science and its relationship with futures studies.

J,"Jansson, JO",,,,"Jansson, Jan Owen",,,The myth of the service economy-An update,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"In this journal the myth of the advancing service economy was exposed already in 1977 by Jonathan Gershuny, POST-INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY: The myth of the service economy, Futures, April 1977. However, that lesson seems to be forgotten, because with the traditional production sector division in the national accounts, based on the nature of the work, the statistics of relative value added and employment continue to support the old myth. In this paper it is shown that from the point of view of final output use, the ratio of the total value of the output of material goods to the total value of the output of immaterial services is 63:37 in Sweden, and has remained the same for 30 years. This is nearly the reverse of what is officially maintained based on the growing proportion of work in the economy which can be characterized as service work. It is argued here that the conventional view obscures a main issue for the future of the welfare states. Sweden and several other similar countries have got far behindhand as regards the proportion of resources going into the provision of income-elastic services like health and education, which is just the opposite of the original main idea of the welfare state.

The experiment illustrates shirking opportunities of the agent and the importance of work incentives. Furthermore, it can be used to introduce students to the concepts of contractual incompleteness, efficiency, incentive compatibility, outside options and participation constraints, the Coase theorem, and the potential roles of fairness and reciprocity in contracting.","[Gaechter, Simon] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Koenigstein, Manfred] Univ Erfurt, Erfurt, Germany",University of Nottingham; University of Erfurt,"Gächter, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",simon.gaechter@nottingham.ac.uk,"Gachter, Simon/C-9787-2009","Gachter, Simon/0000-0002-7182-8505",,,,,27,3,4,0,9,HELDREF PUBLICATIONS,WASHINGTON,"1319 EIGHTEENTH ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-1802 USA",0022-0485,,,J ECON EDUC,J.

This article analyses China's RTAs, identifies many reasons underlying them, and proposes a three-fold typology for China's RTAs: economic integration agreements, standard regional trade agreements with other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, and bilateral free trade agreements with non-Asian countries. It then compares rules of origin, safeguards, and dispute settlement mechanisms in selected RTAs and evaluates them from the standpoint of WTO law. The article concludes, first, that the basic three-fold typology helps us to understand the objectives, organisation, and operation of China's RTAs and their relations to China's domestic structures, policy processes, legal and political culture and international and regional policies. Second, China's RTAs are generally WTO-compatible since they are drafted in the shadow of WTO law, even though WTO law does not always provide a detailed normative template. Finally, China has the challenge and the opportunity of contributing to the development of a new role for the WTO in managing RTAs.","[Snyder, Francis] Univ Paul Cezanne Aix Marseille III, CERIC, CNRS, UMR 6201, Marseille, France; [Snyder, Francis] London Sch Econ, Dept Law, London, England; [Snyder, Francis] Coll Europe, Brugge, Belgium",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Snyder, F (通讯作者)，Univ Paul Cezanne Aix Marseille III, CERIC, CNRS, UMR 6201, Marseille, France.",,,"Snyder, Francis/0000-0002-0162-3571",,,,,124,12,14,0,15,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Market clearing with heterogeneous quality yields geographically varying teacher salary levels that confound scarcity with unobserved differences in quality. The paper discusses identification and estimation of a model of quality-adjusted teacher salaries in local markets with unobserved market-clearing prices. Exogenous variables in the model include community and district characteristics, job characteristics and working conditions, and individual characteristics. We apply the model to estimate the relative cost of providing comparably qualified teachers for urban and rural public schools in the state of Alaska, which has high geographic variation in amenities and local financial resources. The quality-adjusted geographic salary differentials implied by the results suggest much larger compensation differentials for isolated rural schools than most of these school districts can afford under current levels of state support.

Specialty crops are non-commodity crops which are not available in conventional stores, and have unique characteristics for which consumers are typically willing to pay a premium price. These crops are usually targeted toward a specific ethnic population, particularly those who consume ethnic origin produce. Since the Chinese population in the United States has been growing steadily in the past decade through birth and new immigration, producing and marketing Chinese fruits and vegetables could be a profitable business for local as well as global producers and marketers. The main objective of this study is to analyze the Chinese consumers of the U. S. east-coast region and assess their willingness to pay a premium price for ethnic produce. The results indicated 72% of the respondents were willing to pay a premium for ethnic produce and 28% of the respondents were not. The results also showed that those who spend more on ethnic produce, those who were influenced by out-of store advertisements, those who were self-employed and with income of between $ 20,000 and $ 39,999, were willing to pay a premium for ethnic produce.","[Govindasamy, R.; Puduri, V.

The retail sales shares of florists, which are the major conventional retail channel for flowers, have been decreasing, while the shares of mass retail channels, such as supermarkets and home improvement centers, have shown an increase. Therefore, in terms of demands for flowers by usage, household consumption demands have increased. However, in the 2000s, there is a significant retrenchment in the demand for cut flowers, particularly among households whose heads belonged to the 40 to 49 age group. Decreasing trends have also been observed in the percentage of households purchasing cut flowers, as well as potted plants and bedding plants. This situation could continue and can be exacerbated by other factors, unless the entire floral industry takes action to increase consumer demand.","Japan Res Inst Ltd, Res & Consulting Div, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1020082, Japan",,"Kohno, K (通讯作者)，Japan Res Inst Ltd, Res & Consulting Div, Chiyoda Ku, 16 Ichibancho, Tokyo 1020082, Japan.",,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-6605-429-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,831.0,,,,,,229,236,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2009.831.26,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAW33,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305708700026,0

Studies of the CAP by ESPON (2006) conclude that most CAP measures are non-territorial, with the exception of LEADER which was hailed as one of the more efficient and effective mechanisms under the CAP for addressing territorial development. Thus the focus of this study is on Axis 3 Measures and LEADER. This study was undertaken to analyse the measures programmed and expenditure planned under Axis 3 of the Lithuanian RDP. These measures are assessed in relation to the Government of Lithuania's set goal of more balanced territorial development in the National Rural Development Strategy 2007-2013 and Rural Development Plan for Lithuania 2007-2013.

However, the implementation and use of site-specific sensor technologies has not yet been adopted for horticultural purposes sufficiently in the context of nitrogen (N) fertilization. Suitable sensor technologies and especially crop specific calibrations to determine crop N status and to adapt N fertilization strategies are still missing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of a passive sensor technology and, thus, spectral feedback signals from tomato plants to determine the N status, and to adapt N fertilization rates throughout the cultivation period. A greenhouse study was conducted with tomato plants over three months (April-June). Three different N fertilization rates (30 kg ha(-1), 60 kg ha(-1), and 100 kg ha(-1)) were implemented. As soon as the first inflorescence of the tomato plant was visible, sensor measurements were carried out on the first expanded leaf above the inflorescence with a digital imager (Leica S1 Pro) and repeated once a week. Reflectance of tomato plants increased under sufficient N supply but decreased under N deficiency, which enabled the discrimination of N status of tomato plants and, thus, the adaptation of N fertilization rates. The results of the study indicated that the fine tuning of fertilizer operations using feedback signals from tomato plants based on sensor measurements may be a promising way for optimizing N fertilizer inputs in horticulture and, thus, also, for enhancing crop yield and quality.","[Pfenning, J.; Liebig, H. -P.] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Special Crop Cultivat & Crop Physiol 370, Stuttgart, Germany; [Graeff, S.; Claupein, W.] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Crop Prod & Grassland Res 340, Stuttgart, Turkey",University Hohenheim,"Pfenning, J (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Inst Special Crop Cultivat & Crop Physiol 370, Stuttgart, Germany.",,,,,,,,11,2,2,0,1,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-6605-370-0,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,824.0,,,,,,177,181,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAV48,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305621100020,0

The present exploratory study assessed the cost-effectiveness of ZOL in this population, adopting a French, German, and United Kingdom (UK) government payer perspective. Materials and methods This cost-effectiveness model was based on a post hoc retrospective analysis of a subset of patients with RCC who were included in a larger randomized clinical trial of patients with bone metastases secondary to a variety of cancers. In the trial, patients were randomized to receive ZOL (n = 27) or placebo (n = 19) with concomitant antineoplastic therapy every 3 weeks for 9 months (core study) plus 12 months during a study extension. Since the trial did not collect costs or data on the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of the patients, these outcomes had to be assumed via modeling exercises. The costs of SREs were estimated using hospital DRG tariffs. These estimates were supplemented with literature-based costs where possible. Drug, administration, and supply costs were obtained from published and internet sources. Consistent with similar economic analyses, patients were assumed to experience quality of life decrements lasting 1 month for each SRE. Uncertainty surrounding outcomes was addressed via multivariate sensitivity analyses. Results Patients receiving ZOL experienced 1.07 fewer SREs than patients on placebo. Patients on ZOL experienced a gain in discounted QALYs of approximately 0.1563 in France and Germany and 0.1575 in the UK. Discounted SRE-related costs were substantially lower among ZOL than placebo patients (-(sic) 4,196 in France,-(sic) 3,880 in Germany, and -(sic) 3,355 in the UK). After taking into consideration the drug therapy costs, ZOL saved (sic) 1,358, (sic) 1,223, and (sic) 719 in France, Germany, and the UK, respectively. In the multivariate sensitivity analyses, therapy with ZOL saved costs in 67-77% of simulations, depending on the country. The cost per QALY gained for ZOL versus placebo was below (sic) 30,000 per QALY gained threshold in approximately 93-94% of multivariate sensitivity analyses simulations. Conclusions The present analysis suggests that ZOL saves costs and increases QALYs compared to placebo in French, German, and UK RCC patients with bone metastases. Additional prospective research may be needed to confirm these results in a larger sample of patients.","[Botteman, M. F.; Foley, I.; Stephens, J.

The idea is that, by staying longer in school, more students eventually obtain a higher secondary diploma. This paper examines the impact of a one-year increase in compulsory school-age on dropping out of secondary education by a difference-in-differences analysis. For this, we exploit a recent compulsory education policy reform in the Netherlands. After controlling for confounding factors and observable covariates, we find that the one year increase in compulsory school-age reduces dropout by 2.5 percentage points. The effect, however, is entirely situated in the group non-liable to the policy reform. We observe that native Dutch vocational students, mostly without retention in grade, but also without a higher secondary diploma at hand, more often left school in the immediate period before the policy reform. Given the economic revival at that time, this may reflect anticipation of labor market opportunities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Some advocate the necessity of single renewable energy paradigm, but its realization is potentially fraught with difficulty owing to technological challenges, existing sunk costs, and path dependencies associated with existing and emerging options. It could also result in disadvantageous outcomes to emerging economies. Another school of thought proposes that future road transport, even within single nations, will require multiple energy types, mainly because a single source will be insufficient to meet projected needs. A multiple paradigm has the potential to be expensive because several infrastructures have to be implemented simultaneously. This paper aims to assess both concepts by considering the largely neglected dimensions of resource location and regional geophysical attributes, in addition to national technical expertise, industry capacity and modal factors. Case studies from both the developed world (the European Union and Australia) and the developing world (sub-Saharan Africa and China) will assess the possibility of implementing a single transport energy paradigm versus a more pluralistic regime. The results will help to inform policy making and enable greater foresight with regard to making long-term transport infrastructure investment decisions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Since nutrient-orientated EE measures are consistent with the materials balance principle, NTFP index is superior to other existing TFP indexes. An empirical study on the environmental performance of an agricultural sector in 30 OECD countries from 1990 to 2003 yielded several important findings. First, these countries should be able to produce current outputs with at least 50% less aggregate eutrophying power, implying that they should have been able to substantially reduce the potential for eutrophication. Second, traditional TFP has grown by 1.6% per annum due to technical progress; however, there are lags in the responses of several countries to this technical progress. Third, environmental TFP has grown at a slower rate than traditional TFP growth due to reductions in nutrient-orientated allocative efficiency. Finally, changes in input combinations could have significantly improved environmental efficiency and productivity. These findings favor policy interventions and faster technological transfer to improve environmental performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

A survey was conducted in five cities; and 223 household-heads were interviewed using systematic sampling, with a random start. Data were collected on socio-demographic characteristics, teak pole consumption forms, behaviour patterns, and motivations. Respondents also rated their expectations and perceptions for a set of nine attributes on a 7 points Likert scale. Hierarchical ascending cluster analysis was performed to identify consumer segments; and satisfaction level was analysed per segment, by determining the gap between expectations and perceptions, for all attributes. Four consumer segments were identified; and sociodemographic profiles differed across those segments. Competitive price was an important purchasing motivation across the identified segments. Consumers were dissatisfied with price, availability, knot frequency, bending, length, hardness, and durability of teak pole. The efforts to meet the consumer expectations should be concentrated on building farmers' capacity in silvicultural management, and ensuring the availability of good planting material. The issue of competitive price might be addressed, through the improvement of the overall efficiency in the value chain. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Aoudji, Augustin K.

We empirically address two important questions. First, if the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariff for a product is higher, does it lead to a higher or lower preferential tariff? Second, with the EU being a large trading partner in such agreements, does reciprocity matter for giving meaningful preferential access? For a given MFN tariff, we model the preferential tariff with a simple linear functional form. We draw three important conclusions. First, the products that are highly protected do not get high preferential access even at the regional level. Second, reciprocity plays only a limited role in granting better preferential access. Third, the generalized system of preference (GSP) preferences matters when the EU negotiates with the developed partners, but it does not matter when it negotiates with the developing partners.","Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, CH-1202 Geneva, Switzerland",,"Joshi, V (通讯作者)，Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Ave Paix 11A, CH-1202 Geneva, Switzerland.",vivek.joshi@graduateinstitute.ch,"Joshi, Vivek/A-7874-2013",,,,,,22,4,4,0,10,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Consequently, market deregulation for agriculture and other natural products has been advocated to improve market efficiencies, participation and returns for the producers and local traders. The study examines the impact of deregulation of state marketing controls on collection, sale and returns to extractors and traders from non-timber forest products. It assessed whether deregulation policy resulted in greater benefits to primary extractors and a win-win situation for both producers and traders? Mixed effects were found, with no significant changes in terms of trade, demand, or quantum of consumption: but there was an overall increase in the procurement price for several products following deregulation. The collection and farm gate price of tree based oilseeds and honey increased due to lower transaction costs, and ease of trading with a continued demand for these products. The impact on less valuable products was insignificant. Abolition of monopolistic trading increased competition and had a pull effect on the local market prices of several NTFPs. Although traders paid a higher price to procure products, overall they also benefited being able to sell the purchased products to merchants and manufacturers at a better margin than previously.

These are generally subsumed under the terms 'futures research', 'futures studies' and 'foresight'. Complexity science applications are outlined for each of the schools, and these provide evolving theories for futures thinking. (1) Environmental and geosciences treat the Earth and its various components as typical out-of-equilibrium systems with dissipative processes. (2) Infrastructure and socio-technological systems emerge through the diffusion of investment capital, with the endogenous transformation of the urban system. (3) Social, political and economic sciences are being reshaped away from the notion of economic equilibrium, and describe social emergence by means of agent-based models.

As analysed in this article, the current state of WTO law regarding the initiation of dispute settlement proceedings undermines the long-term objectives in pursuance of which states join trade agreements like the WTO Agreement in the first place. This article proposes the creation of an independent prosecution department within the WTO Secretariat, with an exclusive right to initiate dispute settlement proceedings. Without the existing discretionary filtering power, WTO membership would constitute a more credible commitment by governments that they wish to tie their hands in order to better resist domestic lobbying from powerful, import-competing, industries, giving in to which might maximize the government's short-term political welfare but would be contrary to society's long-term interest in free trade.","Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford,"Zimmermann, CD (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",,,,,,,,31,5,5,0,6,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Frequently, proxy variables are used to measure constituent interest. However, these measures do not adequately reflect true constituent interest, which is based upon the costs and benefits of the policies under consideration, incorporating the scope of the policies. Using Haiku, a detailed model of the US electricity sector, and TAF, an integrated assessment model of pollution pathways and valuation, I construct economic measures of constituent interest at the state level as well as for federal policy. I then use these measures to analyze state adoption of more stringent green electricity policies and congressional roll-call voting on federal environmental policy. Previous studies that use proxy measures of constituent interest typically find that the legislator ideology matters more, while my study shows that both ideology and constituent interest are significant factors.

The last two triggers could be linked to deep financial integration in Europe and the consequent large flow of capital toward European transition economies in the 2000s, a phenomenon not observed in any other part of the world.

We have to tell the story of our reality and future both to ourselves and to society with new concepts, words and metaphors. While the importance of instant experience and transience grows, our in-depth understanding of the logic of time gradually crumbles away. The fervency of action widens the limits of reality in a fundamental way, even though our personal human capacity to receive and handle information and experience emotions and events has not changed in the one million years of human history. The present is swelling over the past and the future. The social media transforms into one big global amplifier through which emotional experience is transmitted and strengthened. The asset of collective experiences is that they are universal, they are private and felt on an individual level, and yet they can simultaneously be shared by the others. However, one might also say that even though the growth of information produces more and more different value contents for us to choose from, this freedom of choice is still rather spurious. With the traditional norms, models of action, habits and attitudes we can no longer cope in this totally new reality. We live in an age of controversies which emphasizes emotions with public intimacy and privacy with a realtime audience. We are enchanted by creativity and innovativeness and our decisions have to be made quickly, efficiently and in a short-term basis. We cannot freely consider our values, but in order to cope, we have to try to behave in a way which is the most target-oriented, and at the same time, the tools and methods to cope in this rapidly changing reality are still scarce. Therefore we have to weigh the efficiency and suitability of the means in relation to the objective also in such situations where we cannot make proper value assessments. Emotional universality can become, or at least with the help of skilled media PR professionals, it can be used as a means to commercialize our emotions, or it can help us in the process of building universal values.

Moreover, why have egalitarian practices proven fragile in some countries with traditionally strong social democratic governments and powerful unions and yet have been sustained in countries with disjointed unions and right-wing parties in power? Italy and Sweden, the central cases examined in this paper, reflect these diverging trends. In view of understanding why certain countries better sustain egalitarian institutions and outcomes, the paper investigates how two inter-related institutional traits set countries apart in terms of how egalitarian institutions were constructed and dismantled and how these traits influenced the type of institutional remnants and bargaining dynamics maintained in the aftermath. The two traits in question are: (a) the type of confederal groupings and; (b) the range of wage scale coverage.","Miami Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Oxford, OH 45056 USA",University System of Ohio; Miami University,"Oliver, RJ (通讯作者)，Miami Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",r.oliver@muohio.edu,,,,,,,103,15,15,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Based on household-level primary data from twelve villages in five districts of Arunachal Pradesh, India, the study brings out the significance of forest resources as a source of livelihoods in the Eastern Himalayan region. The findings suggest that CPRs play a significant role in the livelihoods strategies of the rural poor. Household characteristics such as size of landholdings, education and distance from markets significantly affect forest dependency. Although the absolute amount of forest income derived by the rich is higher, in relative terms the poor depend more on CPRs like forest. It is not only that the extent of forest dependency varies across various income groups, with gradual commercialisation of the forest economy, the nature of dependency on forest across income groups has undergone significant changes as well.

The World Trade Organization (WTO) cannot be a bystander in this crusade: trade and the fight against drug trafficking and money laundering should not collide. Perhaps one of the most relevant means the WTO has at its disposal to make a contribution is through the interpretation of the WTO-covered agreements. Although trade disputes related to transnational crimes are not communion, a recent one, Colombia - Indicative Prices and Restrictions on Ports of Entry, had this dimension. The panel report on this case constitutes a starting point on which to draw on to ensure that WTO law aligns with general international law in the fight against transnational crime. To this end, the article suggests three main improvements to the report in Colombia - Ports if Entry. The first is to place the interpretation of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Article XX(d) under these circumstances in the context of public international law. The second improvement recommendation is that of aligning the current interpretation of the two-tier test of Article XX(d) with international law in disputes of this character. Die third suggestion is that of making cooperation between litigants - a widely recognized, suitable instrument in international law to address transnational offences - an attractive solution as part of the settlement of the case when the exception of GATT Article XX(d) is invoked.","Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Alvarez-Jiménez, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",aalvarez@uottawa.ca,,"Alvarez-Jimenez, Alberto/0000-0002-8313-405X",,,,,31,1,1,0,11,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The most frequent mark is the classification very good which was obtained by 50.7 % of bachelor students and 48.6 % of master students. Despite this fact there are students who failed completely, or who got an evaluation good. The reason of worse classification is a breach of formal or content requirements. The reason for the failure in examination in 81 % students of the total number of students, who did not passed the final examination, was a failure in thesis defence.

Term SMART is frequently used by managers for project quality or project goals evaluation. This approach should be used in various type of project or process based activities. Project based approaches should be used by students to evaluate learning processes from their specific point of views. Goals should be SMART - S - specific, significant, stretching, M - measurable, meaningful, motivational, A - agreed upon, attainable, achievable, acceptable, action-oriented, R - realistic, relevant, reasonable, rewarding, results-oriented, T - time-based, timely', tangible, tractable. SMARTI goals add I - Integrated criteria to SMART goals, SMARTER goals are moreover E - Ethical, Excitable, Enjoyable, Engaging, Ecological and R Rewarded, Reassess, Revisit, Recordable. These goals are hard to measure; they have no final quantitative features. That's why we tried to apply the Analytical Network Process (ANP) for evaluating the learning processes according to achieving general SMARTER goals as criteria and individual SMARTER specifications as subcriteria. These criteria and subcriteria are complexly linked one to another, so the ANP is the proper tool for their preferences evaluation, because it allows not only hierarchical but also network dependences. In our paper we make analysis of learning process quality - SMARTness goals based on the ANP method using SuperDecisions Software. As criteria we used general SMARTER model, as subcriteria we use SMART subgoals which were selected according to the student's prevailing preferences. We experiment with their mutually dependencies and we try to propose the best methodology for evaluating learning process.","[Subrt, Tomas; Brozova, Helena] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Syst Engn, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,,subrt@pef.czu.cz,"Brozova, Helena/K-2834-2017; Subrt, Tomas/H-8542-2018","Brozova, Helena/0000-0002-0322-251X; Subrt, Tomas/0000-0002-4437-1431",,,,,15,0,0,0,7,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-2183-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,287,295,,,,,,9,Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BYZ55,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300799300032,0

This paper presents an analysis of China's census data that indicates that the missing girls phenomenon is causally linked to enforcement of the One Child Policy. Fertility is lower and sex ratios are higher among those under stricter fertility control, and the overall increase in the sex ratio is driven by an increase in the prevalence of sex selection among first and second births. By exploiting regional and temporal variation in fines levied for unauthorized births, I find that higher fine regimes discourage fertility, but are associated with higher ratios of males to females.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Econ, Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Ebenstein, A (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Econ, Jerusalem, Israel.",ebenstein@mscc.huji.ac.il,"Ebenstein, Avraham/AAK-6482-2020","Ebenstein, Avraham/0000-0003-1276-4537",,,,,41,253,320,21,135,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0022-166X,1548-8004,,J HUM RESOUR,J.

J,"Lamba, HS",,,,"Lamba, Harinder S.",,,Understanding the ideological roots of our global crises: a pre-requisite for radical change,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Even though the unfolding global financial crisis has shaken the world, it has been accompanied in the background by slowly unfolding environment and development crises. While action is being taken to keep the financial crisis from getting worse, negotiations for next steps in the climate change treaty are ongoing, and efforts are being made to implement the millennium development goals to improve the lives of people globally. Herein, the author advocates the argument that the reason the solutions have not been very effective, and that the financial crises unfolded anyway, is because the roots of the crises have not been fully understood. In the absence of this understanding, the very mode of progress has ultimately worsened the problems. After a brief historical review, this paper puts forth and analyzes five major ideological root causes, and provides supporting arguments to show how these have led to a worsening situation for the long-term prospects for progress. Understanding the root causes better points to solutions and directions for progress that are for the long-term benefit of all. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Chapman, B; Lounkaew, K",,,,"Chapman, Bruce; Lounkaew, Kiatanantha",,,Income contingent student loans for Thailand: Alternatives compared,ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Educational finance; Student financial aid; State and federal aid,,"There is significant irresolution in many countries concerning the design of student loan schemes. In no country recently has there been more uncertainty as to the form that loans should take than Thailand. The Student Loans Fund (SLF), a conventional approach to financing, was introduced in 1996, discontinued at the end of 2005, and re-introduced in 2007. In its place an income contingent loan (ICL) was implemented for one year only, 2006. As part of this debate we contribute to an understanding of the repayment burdens associated with the SLF in Chapman, Lounkaew, Polsiri, Sarachitti and Sitthipongpanich (in this issue). There are important issues with all ICL, and in this paper we consider the critical matter of interest rate subsidies. These are calculated for four different possible ICL arrangements for Thailand: the Thai Income Contingent and Allowance Loan (TICAL), a variant of TICAL, and two alternatives. With a broad-brush approach the subsidies for TICAL-type arrangements and for current debt levels turn out to be between 25 and 40 per cent, but are about zero for our suggested alternative ICLs. Using a better, more disaggregated, approach, subsidies for TICAL-type schemes are estimated to be about 30-55, and 3 and 18 per cent for our alternative ICLs. But with very large debts, the subsidies of all schemes are very high, implying that ICL are likely to be expensive until Thai graduate incomes rise. Importantly for equity however, the interest rate subsidies are delivered to graduates with relatively low lifetime incomes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The article reflects briefly on Australia's international obligations to respect the right to strike under ILO and UN Conventions before outlining the main features of protected industrial action under the federal system from 1993 through to the passage of the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth). The discussion reveals that the right to strike in Australia is very limited, particularly with respect to the content and level of agreement making that may be supported by protected industrial action. Focusing on multi-enterprise agreement making in particular, the article concludes that the current legislative regime does not permit industrial parties to determine their own industrial agendas and support those agendas through protected industrial action.","Univ Sydney, Fac Law, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"McCrystal, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Fac Law, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",shae.mccrystal@sydney.edu.au,,"McCrystal, Shae/0000-0002-3305-6831",,,,,38,4,4,0,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

It suggests that no spontaneous competitive force exists within capitalism that would adjust labour demand to its supply, in contrast to the adaptation of supply to the demand for commodities in general. This result is argued without reference to assumptions about inflexibilities or impediments in labour or other markets, or institutional features peculiar to 'the labour market'. Its explanation of why labour markets do not clear is at odds with a core tenet underlying orthodox economic theory of the last century, which has acted as a fundamental benchmark for most theorising about labour to the present day. Rejection of this tenet is at the heart of a heterodox explanation of unemployment, the real wage and income distribution in capitalist economies.","Univ Sydney, Discipline Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"White, G (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Discipline Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",grahamw@econ.usyd.edu.au,,,,,,,18,0,1,0,5,UNIV NEW SOUTH WALES-CENTRE APPLIED ECONOMIC RESEARCH,SYDNEY,"ECONOMIC & LABOUR RELATIONS REVIEW, INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS RES CTR, SYDNEY, NSW 2052, AUSTRALIA",1035-3046,,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Policies that encourage or mandate use of alternative fuel vehicles in government fleets, thereby increasing demand for such fuels, are one popular approach to stimulating further development of the alternative fuel retail infrastructure. I focus specifically on flex-fuel vehicles (FFVs) that burn E85, a combination of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline, to study the impact of government fleet composition on retail alternative fuel infrastructure. Using data from six states in the Midwest that account for over 60% of US E85 stations, I show that government fleet adoption of FFVs leads to an increase in retail E85 stations. This finding persists when using instrumental variables techniques to address the endogeneity of government fleet FFV purchases. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

More specifically, the paper argues that a high degree of party polarization on a non-economic policy dimension modifies the political response to growing income inequalities. Data from the World Values Survey and the Comparative Manifesto Project are employed to show that party polarization on a traditional moral dimension of politics is associated with a weaker relationship between income and subjective position on the Left-Right scale. Because party polarization is associated with a weaker relationship between income and leftism, the paper claims that the political response to increases in inequality will be weaker in polarized countries. The empirical analysis using redistribution data from the Luxembourg Income Study demonstrates that the positive effect of increases in market inequality on redistribution is lower when party polarization on the non-economic dimension is high.","Norwegian Social Res NOVA, Oslo, Norway",,"Finseraas, H (通讯作者)，Norwegian Social Res NOVA, Oslo, Norway.",henning.finseraas@nova.no,,,,,,,45,20,23,0,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The first period began in the early 1970s when a conservative forest policy was adopted privileging commercial logging companies, and thus fueling land conflicts in particular with indigenous people, allowing a minority to accumulate considerable wealth, and marking the onset of forest degradation. From the mid-1990s, innovative policies were implemented to promote sustainable forest management, enhance the collection of forest royalties, improve the sector access to international timber markets, and include a wide range of social actors in the forest sector. While the adopted policy led to initial improvements in forest management practices, it failed to tackle inherent institutional weaknesses and increase the economic benefits from forest use to local forest users, which stimulated informal logging expansion. A third period emerged when the Morales administration came to office in 2006, questioning the underlying principles of the previous policy reform, and adopting a discourse in favor of a more equitable income distribution. Main answers to promote better income distribution are found in the distribution of public lands, but with a lack of actions to leveling the playing field among different forest users. Ironically, these policies could strengthen the bargaining position of timber companies, and foster short-term decision making in forest use, and thus illegal logging in a context of weak state control and persistence of elite capture.

We use data on 'triadic' patents (USA, Japan and Europe) to measure regional innovation, both per capita by region and categorized by firm size for regions in the USA.

The findings indicate that in cases of one and two structural breaks, for a U.S. dollar based real exchange rate series, there is little evidence supporting the validity of PPP. For a deutsche mark based real exchange rate series, for the cases of both one and two breaks, there is evidence of stationarity of real exchange rates for eight sample countries, which is consistent with PPP. The results also indicate that the estimated half-life of a shock to the real exchange rate ranges from 1.25 (15.05 months) to 2.72 (32.72 months) years across countries.

However. current management practices and work organization have usually not been explicitly addressed in these empirically based typologies. In a context of increasing outsourcing and decreasing family work in forests, it is important to know the forest practices, who carries them out, and with whose labour and equipment. The interrelated knowledge of these variables sheds light on the constraints faced by different forest owners and about the agents caring for their forests. Such knowledge can also improve the understanding of forest owners' behaviour and, therefore, be useful for the design and implementation of forest policies. The work models of Portuguese non-industrial private forest were identified with these goals in mind. A cluster analysis, using a representative nationwide sample and an empirically based set of variables, was instrumental in identifying six work models. The interrelation amongst these models and other variables such as landholding attributes (e.g. forest size and dominant species), owners' social profile, and their economic goals was also assessed. Finally, the main dynamics of private owners' forest management are outlined. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Many operators have equipped for the purpose, but the large variety of working conditions found in the European forests makes it difficult to correctly estimate the productivity of each specific operation, leading to uncertainty in crucial decisions. such as: operation scheduling, price setting. machinery selection and acquisition. In 2001, the Italian National Council for Research (CNR) and the University of California (UC) developed a spreadsheet freeware capable of returning reliable estimates of chipping productivity and cost, on the basis of user-defined input data. The model is still available from the CNR website and is the object of frequent downloading and inquiries. Such model contains a set of predictive equations derived from the results of 102 field trials, conducted with 30 different machines, under a range of working conditions. in order to facilitate comparison with other estimates and to achieve methodological transparency, the equations are assembled into a simple Microsoft Excel workbook, and the costs are calculated with standard costing methods currently used in Forest and Agricultural Engineering. Since then CNR has continued to work on the subject, with the goal of updating and refining the model. Such work has included 45 validation tests and a separate study on the delay (idle) time typical for different chipping operation layouts. The study was concluded in 2009 and confirms that the model developed by CNR can provide reliable estimates of chipper productivity under a range of operational conditions. Authors believe that such a model can assist European foresters in keeping ahead with the growing biomass sector, thus helping them to seize an important business opportunity. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Shared procurement areas and co-production further complicate the task, elements which typify the eastern Canadian forest industry. A procurement forester must routinely coordinate and synchronize forest operations with those of other companies over several procurement areas. In a multi-firm contexts collaboration cannot be taken for granted and decision-making power cannot be centralized. First, this paper presents a formalization of firms' procurement interdependence in a context of shared procurement areas and co-production. A planning and coordination approach is then presented for the context under study. Four different planning and coordination modes are tested, including a central planning mode used as a benchmark (i.e., upper bound). Statistics on profitability and timber license fulfillment are gathered. Pair wise comparisons among the different modes are performed and profitability gains from greater coordination within and among firms are quantified. The proposed collaborative planning and coordination mode results in local and global profitability increases, especially in difficult economic setting, when compared to the planning and inter-firm coordination approach currently in use.

These 'WTO-plus' provisions have already been involved in several WTO disputes. In the light of these disputes, the paper analyzes the interpretive challenge presented by rite Protocol and suggests that, to meet the challenge, WTO adjudicators need to embrace a more holistic and systemic interpretive approach. The paper then proposes three working principles that may help to interpret the WTO-plus provisions of the Protocol in a coherent and systematic manner.","Wayne State Univ, Sch Law, USA SJD Harvard Law School, Detroit, MI 48202 USA",Wayne State University,"Qin, JY (通讯作者)，Wayne State Univ, Sch Law, USA SJD Harvard Law School, Detroit, MI 48202 USA.",ya.qin@wayne.edu,,,,,,,49,27,29,0,6,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

This paper empirically tests whether lone mothers take more temporary parental leave to care for sick children than partnered mothers and whether parental leave is associated with a signaling cost. The results from this study of Swedish mothers show that lone mothers use more temporary parental leave than partnered mothers. Further, within the group of lone mothers, those with higher socioeconomic status take less temporary parental leave than those with lower socioeconomic status, whereas no such differences are found within the group of partnered mothers. One possible interpretation is that signaling costs negatively influence the utilization of temporary parental leave for lone mothers.","SFI Danish Natl Ctr Social Res, DK-1052 Copenhagen, Denmark",,"Amilon, A (通讯作者)，SFI Danish Natl Ctr Social Res, Herluf Trolles Gade 11, DK-1052 Copenhagen, Denmark.",ame@sfi.dk,,"Amilon, Anna/0000-0002-8433-5638",,,,,32,1,1,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The level of detail - including the number of courses taught, enrollment, grant dollars, and number and impact of publications - largely eliminates the problem of unmeasured productivity, and the restriction to one firm eliminates unmeasured work conditions that confound investigations of wider labor markets. The authors find that direct productivity measures reduce the gender wage penalty to about 3 percent, only 1 percentage point lower than estimates from national studies of many institutions and with fewer productivity controls. The wage structure for women faculty differs markedly from the wage structure for men. Interpreted against the institutional features of wage setting for this population, the paper concludes that penalties for women arise at the department level.","[Binder, Melissa; Krause, Kate; Chermak, Janie; Thacher, Jennifer] Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA",University of New Mexico,"Binder, M (通讯作者)，Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, MSC05-3060, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",mbinder@unm.edu; kkrause@unm.edu; jchermak@unm.edu; jthacher@unm.edu; julia.m.gilroy@gmail.com,"Chermak, Janie M/E-3842-2013; Thacher, Jennifer A/F-5035-2012",,,,,,37,15,18,1,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The study focuses on two groups of home-based workers: the self-employed, and those who work for a contractor. Using an individual-level well-being index that takes into account income, the capabilities related to education, and work intensity, the authors examine by OLS and GME techniques the varied factors that affect the well-being of home-based workers. The findings show that women workers experience a higher incidence of work intensity and hence lower quality of life compared with men.

In this paper, a hedging strategy is presented by shorting stock index futures. We investigate 5 different fund and compare the return and risk with our hedged portfolio. Both return and standard deviation of our hedged portfolio outperform that of the original portfolio. The return of the portfolio hedged with SFIF1012 is higher than that hedged with SFIF1009.

Also. increasing the absolute consumption of bioenergy seems to partly be an objective in itself But neither the costs of replacing fossil fuels with bioenergy in heating, nor the effects on the GHG emission account are clear. This study analyses first the avoided GHG emissions from substituting one energy unit of fossil fuel with forest based bioenergy (wood fuel) in several heating technologies. Secondly. the effects on bioenergy production of two policy measures in Norway - higher tax on domestic heating oil and paraffin and investment grants to district heating installations based on wood fuels - are investigated. Thereafter, the results are combined to display how the emissions from heating are affected. Finally, the achievements are compared to the costs. The analysis is done by using a partial, spatial equilibrium model of the Norwegian forest sector, wood fuels included. Based on model runs we conclude that a tax of 60(sic)/CO(2)eq on competing fossil fuels could increase the bioenergy use in district heating installations with almost 4000 GWh/year. The same amount of bioenergy could be used in pellet stoves and central heating systems, but a higher tax is then necessary. 50% investment grant to district heating installations may also have a large effect on the bioenergy use, but the effect of the subsidies decreases rapidly if applied together with a tax. Around 70% of the emissions from heating in Norway may potentially be avoided, but such achievements depend on very high taxes on fossil fuels. Both taxes and subsidies may greatly influence the energy market, but should be used with caution in order to obtain the preferred goals. Few similar studies are carried out in this field, and the results might be of interest for the bioenergy industry and the energy policy authorities. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

These perceptions are based on the interests, values and principles of those concerned. The resulting complexity makes resolution of the conflict extremely difficult. Ethical analysis (EA) is a tool that could lay the groundwork for resolution of complex natural resource conflicts. The fundamental task of EA is to map and understand the interests, values and principles of the conflicting parties, thereby presenting the conflict's core drivers. It attempts not to solve the problem but to help the parties to understand their own and other parties' values and interests; increasing awareness of the parties' principles, values and moral codes and of those of their opponents, which will make possible a shared perception of reality, vital for resolution. This self-reflection and improved mutual understanding encourages honesty in subsequent attempts at resolution; promoting trust in the other groups' commitment to resolving the conflict. In short, EA enables cutting through the myriad of perceptions to get to the heart of the conflict, and present it in a manner facilitating the next stage of the process, namely, resolution.

In P-star models, money determines the price gap, which is postulated to measure the pressure on prices in an economy. This pressure emerges when output is above the potential, the interest rate is lower than the natural rate, or there is pure excess money in the economy. The estimation results with the Turkish data show that the price gap contains considerable information for explaining inflation dynamics. Moreover, the model selection criterion that compares the empirical performance of the P-star model with the new classical Phillips curve relation favors the P-star model over the Phillips curve relationship.

For this purpose experts were mobilised to investigate the status and potentials of the areas in question. The national park process was extensive in scope and complex, and in theory such complexity is assumed to make it difficult for non-experts to understand all the relevant aspects of policy. This exclusion of non-experts may lead to scientification of politics. Furthermore politicisation of science might occur as experts might advocate political interests disguised as objective science, and policy-makers might select results that further their own interests. As a result policy-makers risk losing a source of legitimacy, scientists risk losing credibility and the citizens risk losing the possibility to hold policy-makers accountable for their decisions, which puts democracy at risk. This paper examines the accountability relationships that experts were a part of in the national park process. These include accountability towards the employer, towards the buyer and towards the general public. The purpose is to determine if these relationships were adequate to circumvent the problems associated with scientification of politics and to discuss how accountability relationships and thereby democracy could be strengthened. The empirical analysis shows that in the national park process experts were mainly accountable towards the National Forest and Nature Agency. There were formal accountability relationships between the experts and the local steering committees and the national advisory group, but these relationships were less significant. Moreover, despite the fact that the process was deemed unusually open to the public by the participants, the relationship between experts and the public cannot be characterised as an accountability relationship and could have been improved by including experts in the deliberative fora of the process.

To compare three HRQL measures: SF6D, HUI3 and EQ5D. Three questionnaires (SF36, HUI3, EQ5D) were administered to 1,011 patients attending 16 general practices in two Italian cities. Information about patients' gender, age, education, marital status, smoking, body mass index (BMI) and chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal diseases) were also collected. Questionnaires scores were calculated using the appropriate algorithms; in particular SF6D scores were obtained from SF36 items. Agreement and correlation between questionnaires scores were investigated using Bland and Altman method and Spearman coefficient. The influence of socio-demographic and morbidity indicators on scores was analysed using the nonparametric quantile regression. The Spearman coefficient was about 0.6 for all questionnaires. The 95% limits of agreement of the scores were approximately from -0.5 to 0.3 except for SF6D and EQ5D when they were from -0.4 to 0.2. The measures were influenced by socio-demographic and clinical variables in a similar way, especially SF6D (the index obtained from SF36) and EQ5D, which appeared to be influenced by the same pattern of factors, including gender, chronic diseases, smoking and BMI. Overall, the agreement between questionnaires scores was quite low, whilst the correlation level was good. Questionnaire scores were influenced by socio-demographic and clinical variables in a similar way, especially SF6D and EQ5D. Therefore, the descriptive capacity of SF6D and EQ5D was found to be similar.","[Quercioli, Cecilia; Messina, Gabriele; Barbini, Emanuela; Nante, Nicola] Univ Siena, Dept Publ Hlth, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Carriero, Giovanni] Local Hlth Author 7, Siena, Italy; [Fani, Mara] ASL TO 1, Local Hlth Author 2, Primary Hlth Care Unit, Turin, Italy",University of Siena,"Nante, N (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, Dept Publ Hlth, Via Aldo Moro, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",nante@unisi.it,"Messina, Gabriele/F-3554-2011","Messina, Gabriele/0000-0002-2409-4369; NANTE, NICOLA/0000-0002-2040-9562",,,,,43,41,43,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Rather than finding a coherent entity, one discovers a diversity of forest related processes on the international level. The paper examines central forest relevant processes on the international level, their effects on the policy field, and their repercussions for forestry science by using two different theoretical models of internationalized forest politics. It will be argued that an understanding in terms of 'govemance' that is based on a reflexive understanding of the policy field's set-up and emerging state- and non-state actors is better suited than a 'classical' conceptualization of interest-led intergovernmental politics. Drawing upon this diagnosis, the paper offers some propositions about the possible role(s) of forestry science within processes of 'forest governance'. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, we compare two-versus three-option choice sets and the effect of using alternative provision rules, including one where the outcome is influenced by both participant and regulator votes. We find the overall proportion of choices that are inconsistent with induced preferences is rather low. However, there are more deviations from induced preferences for two-option choice sets, and for alternatives to a simple plurality vote implementation rule. A multinomial probit analysis of choices in tandem with a mixed logit welfare analysis suggests there is a statistically significant but modest degree of bias towards selecting the status quo option.

Tourism, the world's largest industry, Must have a politics: its presence changes the distribution of power and wealth, and promotes some values and groups over others. Yet tourism is deeply depoliticized. A few key characteristics of tourism, combined with basic aspects of the international system, create tendencies and patterns at three levels: the local, the national, and the international. The industry's elasticity means that quantitative projections are less helpful in understanding what politics is, and for identifying prospective winners and losers, than are qualitative sketches outlining how power relationships are elided in different spheres. This essay considers the current state of international tourism, and the infrastructure, national and international, that support and guide it, emphasizing the ideas and practices that keep politics out, and arguing that tourism is to a considerable degree about elites justifying, or mystifying, the status quo, and destinations playing into those expectations.

Drawing on a unique data set of prize-winning innovations between 1971 and 2006, we document three key changes in the US economy. The first is an expanding role of inter-organizational collaborations in producing award-winning innovations. The second is the diminishing role of the largest corporations as sources of innovation. The third is the expanded role of public institutions and public funding in the innovation process.

Stock conditions, ecosystem interaction, technological specification, and relative prices under which at-sea discards are acute are identified. A dynamic model is developed to balance ecological interdependencies among multiple fish species, and scope economies implicit in a costly targeting technology. Three regulatory regimes, species-specific harvest quotas, landing taxes, and revenue quotas, are contrasted against a hypothetical sole-owner problem. An optimal plan under all regimes precludes discarding. For both very low and very high levels of targeting costs, first best welfare is close to that achieved through any of the regulatory regimes. In general, however, landing taxes welfare dominate species-specific quota regulation; a revenue quota fares the worst. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

(2) In order to make predictions, one need not appeal to a strict logical derivation, as the covering laws doctrine of logical-empiricism suggests. (3) Prediction and explanation are not logically symmetrical as positivists believe, thus the conditions needed for explanation are not those required for prediction. (4) Local, tacit, personal and expert knowledge are crucial in developing a foresight methodology.

Results that attempt to capture sorting across and within schools using school-level fixed effects specifications are qualitatively similar. The magnitude of the reduction in mathematics achievement is approximately 30-60 percent of the size of the adjusted black-white achievement gap.

Data from similar programmes in the USA have reported a reduction of pneumococcal diseases in both vaccinated and unvaccinated populations, suggesting herd immunity effects. This study analyses the cost-effectiveness of a general vaccination with PCV7 in Germany based on these findings. Methods A Markov model adapts efficacy and herd immunity data to the German population. Further main model inputs are incidence, vaccination uptake, serotype distribution, case fatality rates, and vaccination and healthcare costs. Results A general vaccination with PCV7 would avoid about 232,000 pneumococcal infections and 1,879 premature deaths per year in Germany. From the health-care payer's perspective, direct cost savings would outweigh vaccination expenditures by a ratio of 1:1.16. The sensitivity analysis shows that these estimates are quite conservative. Conclusion Based on the health-economic evaluation, the authors recommend the continuation of the general recommendation of PCV7 according to the 3 + 1 schedule within the German Statutory Health Insurance.","[Claes, Christa; von der Schulenburg, Johann-Matthias Graf] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Ctr Hlth Econ & Hlth Syst Res, Hannover, Germany; [Reinert, Ralf Rene] Univ Hosp RWTH Aachen, Natl Reference Ctr Streptococci, Inst Med Microbiol, Aachen, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover; RWTH Aachen University; RWTH Aachen University Hospital,"Claes, C (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Ctr Hlth Econ & Hlth Syst Res, Hannover, Germany.",cc@ivbl.uni-hannover.de,"Reinert, Ralf Rene/D-6897-2011",,,,,,78,27,28,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Tomato seedlings growing in 100% vermicompost had the lowest amount of chlorophyll, the lowest leaf diameter, lowest dry weight and were the shortest seedlings between all treatments. The application of 50% vermicompost increased the inter-node number, root dry weight and N content of tomato seedlings significantly compared to the control plants. Incorporation of 25% vermicompost increased significantly the shoot dry weight and leaf area of tomato seedlings compared to the control.","[Arouiee, H.; Dehdashtizade, B.; Azizi, M.; Davarinejad, G.

It upholds the salience not only of equality in opportunities but also equality in outcomes. The contribution argues that inequalities based on gender, race, ethnicity, and class undermine the ability to provision and expand capabilities, and it examines the macroeconomic policies that are likely to promote broadly shared development. It explores how the macroeconomy acts as a structure of constraint in achieving gender equality and in turn how gender relations in areas like education and wage gaps can have macro-level impacts. Further, it underscores that the interaction of the macroeconomy and gender relations depends on the structure of the economy, the nature of job segregation, the particular measure of gender inequality, and a country's international relations. Finally, it outlines policies for promoting gender equality as both an intrinsic goal and a step toward improving well-being.","[Berik, Guenseli] Univ Utah, Dept Econ, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Rodgers, Yana van der Meulen] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Womens & Gender Studies, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Seguino, Stephanie] Univ Vermont, Dept Econ, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; University of Vermont,"Berik, G (通讯作者)，Univ Utah, Dept Econ, 1645 Cent Campus Dr,Rm 308, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",berik@economics.utah.edu; yrodgers@rci.rutgers.edu; stephanie.seguino@uvm.edu,"Rodgers, Yana V/R-6207-2017","Rodgers, Yana V/0000-0001-7669-2857",,,,,103,80,91,2,66,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Previous research attributes much of the blame to unsophisticated Chinese logistics and distribution systems, or difficulties in implementing supply chain management (SCM) practices as defined by western literature. One suggestion is that Chinese firms have not yet realized the benefits of SCM, or are not yet at a stage where they can implement them. By comparison, in western countries SCM principles and practices are better understood, in particular the need for strong relationships among supply chain members. Thus as trade with China opens up under WTO agreements, it will become more important to understand the differences in how relationships with others in the supply chain are managed between Chinese and western firms. This research compared the management of business relationships among firms in supply chains between China and Australia. Data were gathered from detailed surveys of 84 food firms in China and 22 Australian food exporters. Most were involved in trade in horticultural produce. Results indicate that both Chinese and Australian firms clearly understand the benefits that can flow from good SCM practices. However Chinese firms essentially act in the belief that their key suppliers and customers are not honest, while Australian firms assume the opposite. As a result, Chinese firms show less trust and commitment to their key suppliers and key customers than Australian firms do. Australian firms therefore have a limited range of chain-building strategies open to them and should adopt a conservative approach. These lessons could apply equally well to horticultural exporters in any western country wishing to establish supply chains with Chinese importers.","[Collins, R.; Sun, X.] Univ Queensland, Sch Nat & Rural Syst Management, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Collins, R (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Nat & Rural Syst Management, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",,"Collins, Ray/B-3531-2010",,,,,,14,0,0,1,1,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-6605-429-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,831.0,,,,,,105,114,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2009.831.11,0.0,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAW33,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305708700011,0

Farmers who adopted these varieties increased their income levels by an average of 104% for eggplant and 30% for watermelon, and consequently were able to provide for their needs such as housing, to purchase farm tools and equipment and transport vehicles, to expand their farm operations by renting land, to educate their children, and to provide appropriate health care. Social benefits included employment, enhanced local business and tax collection. At present, farmers are encountering problems of pests and diseases and declining soil productivity due to continuous cultivation. The most important factors influencing the adoption of improved eggplant varieties were high yields and high market demand. The influence of seed company technicians was a major factor for both eggplant and watermelon. In addition, resistance to pest and diseases, the early maturing characteristics of the variety and high demand were identified as adoption factors for watermelon.","[Dagupen, M. K. T.; Pasalo, N.

The aim of this paper is to gauge the potential impact of risks induced by the likely worsening of the domestic economic environment on the Romanian banking sector stability as a result of the third wave of the global financial crisis. The analysis is centered upon an econometric model which quantifies the rating downgrade probability in respect of credit institutions. The results derived from the model pinpoint that, in 2009, even though the majority of Romanian banking system's assets is associated with a small rating downgrade probability, the expected dynamics of the weight of nonperforming banking assets slipped into positive territory towards the end of the period under review. Estimations for end-2010 prepared under a multifactor hypothetic scenario of a hard landing of the Romanian economy in 2009 show that the credit institutions' performance might turn bad enough so that approximately 12 percent of banking system assets could be subject to rating downgrades.","[Dardac, Nicolae; Moinescu, Bogdan] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dardac, N (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",,"Moinescu, Bogdan-Gabriel/C-4226-2012","Moinescu, Bogdan-Gabriel/0000-0003-2813-592X",,,,,16,3,3,1,10,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

This paper describes our experience under Prima Tani programs in linking small local specific banana (golden kirana) producers to PT Sewu Segar Nusantara, a private company specializing in various high value banana marketing in Java. In this activity, Prima Tani is the external catalyst which also provided some technological assistance (production aspects) in order to meet the company's product requirements and building infrastructure necessary to the farmers. As an illustration, under this new marketing pattern, the producers' income from banana has increased by 67.65%. Within the last 15 months, the banana producers in Prima Tani region have supplied 3,351 kg (Rp 7,037,600) of grade A banana and 316 kg (Rp 269,166) of grade B per month through this new marketing system. So far, however, only about 23% of banana produced from the region are sold in this pattern, while the rest are still sold traditionally. Therefore, some effort has to be made including intensive socialization of the marketing pattern to other farmers as well as making new marketing links with other private companies.","[Irianto, B.; Harwanto] Assessment Inst Agr Technol E Java, Malang, Indonesia",,"Irianto, B (通讯作者)，Assessment Inst Agr Technol E Java, Jl Raya Karangploso KM 4, Malang, Indonesia.",,"Guruh Irianto, Bambang/AGH-7341-2022",,,,,,9,1,1,0,1,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-6605-429-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,831.0,,,,,,115,122,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2009.831.12,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAW33,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305708700012,0

The paper concludes that mothers and fathers in India make different decisions for girls vis-a-vis boys and that the variables reflecting mothers' autonomy vary in their impact, so that mothers' level of education relative to fathers' is not often statistically significant, while mothers' increased contributions to household expenditure decrease the probability of schooling and girls' work.","[Kambhampati, Uma Sarada] Univ Reading, Sch Econ, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England; [Kambhampati, Uma Sarada] Univ Reading, Ctr Inst Performance, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England",University of Reading; University of Reading,"Kambhampati, US (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Sch Econ, POB 218, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England.",les98usk@rdg.ac.uk,,"Kambhampati, Uma/0000-0001-5906-2394",,,,,31,20,22,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The aim of the paper is an attempt to explain not only what economic culture of Polish rural inhabitants embraces, but also whether its characteristics are, on account of the present social-economic and political conditions, a progress-prone factor, or rather an obstructive one. It is also important what kind of changes occur in economic culture of rural inhabitants under the influence of economic transformations nationwide and, accordingly, what combination of economic culture characteristics becomes widespread in rural environment. It indicates the impact of culture on social development, as far as values, attitudes and opinions in a particular community are concerned. The aim is namely to demonstrate how culture influences the scope and implementation manner (or its lack) of the process of economic development by the society. Last but not least, it is important to investigate which political, social and other activities are capable of minimising or removing the cultural barriers standing in the way of economic development, and which of them will preserve the present state of affairs.",,,,,"Krzyminiewska, Grażyna/IQV-4512-2023","Krzyminiewska, Grażyna/0000-0002-1573-3771",,,,,19,1,1,0,2,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-9937-2-0,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2009,,19,,,,,255,262,,,,,,8,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BUR80,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290182700033,0

This paper explores the factors underlying the difference between the marital status of these wage workers and other rural women in Mozambique and establishes a strong relationship between labor-market participation and female divorce or widowhood. The association is likely to work in both directions. Moreover, contrastive exploration suggests that divorced and separated women differ from partnered women in many other important respects: they tend to have access to better jobs, and divorced and separated mothers are also remarkably good at investing in their daughters' education compared with other mothers and male respondents. This paper concludes by stressing the limits of regression techniques in teasing out causation and interactions between variables, and by suggesting that policies to increase women's access to decently paid wage employment could make a substantial difference to the welfare of very poor rural sub-Saharan African women and their children.","[Oya, Carlos] Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Dev Studies, London WC1H 0XG, England; [Sender, John] Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Econ, London WC1H 0XG, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Oya, C (通讯作者)，Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Dev Studies, Thornhaugh St, London WC1H 0XG, England.",co2@soas.ac.uk; john.sender@gmail.com,,"Oya, Carlos/0000-0003-0379-6377",,,,,62,25,28,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Econometric results indicate that for the Pre-Camille and Pre-1900 options, coastal residents and those citing storm protection, recreation impact, and environmental impact as primary decision factors, were more likely to support restoration, with marginal effects of these greater for the Pre-Camille option.

The focus is on the reduction of energy consumption and CO2 emission for the cultivation with and without supplementary lighting. The energy concepts differ in the way the heat and power are produced or supplied on business level. The results show that the energy concepts without supplementary lighting have a lower environmental impact and have a better energy efficiency than the energy concepts with lighting. The energy concepts without supplementary lighting show that simultaneous production of heat and power on business level and the delivery of electricity to the public grid is most favorable looking at the energy use and CO2 emission on a national level. Second best is the conditioned greenhouse. In this energy concept solar energy is collected in summertime, stored and re-used in wintertime.

In many countries, significant shares of the members of parliament are also members of a trade union. However, up to now little empirical evidence is available on the extent to which unionised members of parliament try to achieve union-specific goals and thereby influence the macroeconomic conditions of an economy. A recent study for Germany comes to the conclusion that union members in the Bundestag cannot be seen as the parliamentary arm of the trade unions. However, we present contradicting empirical results by showing that, in Germany at least, the degree of unionisation of parliamentary members has a negative impact on economic growth and increases inflation, while unemployment remains unaffected.","[Berlemann, Michael; Zimmermann, Klaus W.] Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Berlemann, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.",Michael.Berlemann@hsu-hh.de; kwzi@hsu-hh.de,,,,,,,44,0,0,0,12,UNIV NEW SOUTH WALES-CENTRE APPLIED ECONOMIC RESEARCH,SYDNEY,"ECONOMIC & LABOUR RELATIONS REVIEW, INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS RES CTR, SYDNEY, NSW 2052, AUSTRALIA",1035-3046,,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

The aim is to provide new understandings and remapping of futures studies by capturing how gender is created and understood in this field. The gender/feminist criticism of futures studies mainly relates to the field being male-dominated and male biased, which means that the future is seen as already colonised by men. When synthesising the insights from all 78 papers focusing on futures studies and feminism, gender or women, four conclusions are especially striking: (1) Women and non-Westerners are generally excluded from professional futures studies activities and so are feminist issues or issues of particular relevance for women. (2) Futures studies usually make no attempts to reveal underlying assumptions, i.e. often lack a critical and reflexive perspective, which is needed in order to add a critical feminist perspective and envision feminist futures. (3) Feminist futures are needed as a contrast to hegemonic male and Western technology-orientated futures. Feminist futures are diverse, but focus the well-being of all humans. (4) Futures studies often view women as victims, rather than as drivers for change, which means that their alternative futures are often ignored. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Results for a sample of 2983 economics Ph.D. recipients suggest that: (1) the estimated marginal effects of relative dissertation advisor prominence do not vary systematically within top Ph.D. programs and (2) students graduating from a program-switching advisor's higher-ranked program publish significantly more than those graduating from his or her lower-ranked program. Combined, these results might suggest that the observed correlation between dissertation advisor prominence and early-career publishing results more from students working with prominent advisors possessing the higher innate potential required to gain admission to top programs rather than strictly because they work with the more prominent advisor.

The present region-specific study is thus undertaken in Odisha, one of the forested states of India. Applying panel data model over a cross-section of 30 districts since early 1990s, the study examines the effects of the underlying factors on total, open and dense forests in the state. The study proves the existence of EKC indicating thereby need for concerted efforts to improve GDP per capita of the state. Further damage to the forests can be curtailed if forests are spared as the sites for industrialization besides encouraging service-sector industries. Further, industries, being a source of forest loss, need to undertake forest protection and restoration measures. Rising population density remains yet another challenge. Rural poverty, cropping intensity, and forest roads also exert negative effects on open and total forests. The factors that may need attention are reduction in rural poverty and inequalities, increase in GDP per capita, creation of alternative rural livelihood sources, proper mechanisms for forest-friendly industrialization and agricultural expansion.

As of Autumn 2010, the Kemera incentive system provides subsidies for wood chips derived from small-sized stems of young stands, 16-19(sic)/m(3) (8.0-9.5(sic)/MWh) maximum in typical harvesting conditions (average stem size of removal 30-60 dm(3), and whole-tree chip removal 40-70 m(3)/ha). Total production costs of small-diameter thinning of wood chips with and without the Kemera subsidies were researched. The effects of the Kemera incentives on the profitability of whole-tree chip production were presented and discussed. Results gave a clear indication that wood chips from small-diameter stems cannot currently be produced without the Kemera subsidies from young stands with typical harvesting conditions at the current price level of small-diameter wood chips (17-18(sic)/MWh). If operating without the Kemera subsidies at a higher price level of small-diameter wood chips, such as 20(sic)/MWh, the average stem size of whole trees harvested must be greater than 60-70 dm(3) with short road transportation distances between 20 and 40 km to be economically profitable in Finland.

We use a simple general growth model to analyze four cases that involve combinations of stock collapse versus changes in system dynamics, and exogenous versus endogenous probabilities of regime shift. Prior work in economics has focused on stock collapse with endogenous probabilities and reaches ambiguous conclusions on whether the potential for regime shift will increase or decrease intensity of resource use and level of resource stock. We show that all other cases yield unambiguous results. In particular, with endogenous probability of regime shift that affects system dynamics the potential for regime shift causes optimal management to become precautionary in the sense of maintaining higher resource stock levels.

As his concept of image of the future is an effort to counter the positivist intellectual constraints on futurology, so his support of critical realism is part of an effort to counter the equally questionable move towards the nihilism and relativism of postmodernist post-positivism. Both theoretically and philosophically, Bell aims to create and keep a balance, a middle ground between extremes, trying to stabilize the still volatile foundations of futures studies. His effort is one of a founder in the most robust sense of the term. In his endeavor, Bell went beyond the rhetoric of asserting the promise of a new discipline and advertising its merits. He invested into the less glamorous but crucial effort of building the epistemological and conceptual bases able to sustain an entire intellectual edifice. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast, when the legislature and university interact in their subsidy and tuition decisions, the public subsidy becomes endogenous. With an endogenous public subsidy, support by legislatures is affected by the same factors that influence tuition: this leads to a situation where higher tuition revenue is accompanied by a lower public subsidy. The welfare of students declines when this low-subsidy case develops. The university's ability to address this issue depends on its being able to commit to a tuition policy, and credible commitment appears consistent with existing institutional conditions.

This paper addresses the importance of specification with a special emphasis on the effects of mistaken assumptions about the marginal utility of income. Monte Carlo experiments were conducted using different functional forms of utility to generate simulated choices. Multi-Nomial Logit and Mixed Logit models were then estimated on these choices under correct and incorrect assumptions about the true, underlying utility function. Estimated willingness to pay measures from these choice modeling results are then compared with the equivalent measures directly calculated from the true utility specifications. Results show that for the parameter values and functional forms considered, a continuous-quadratic or a discrete-linear attribute specification is a good option regardless of the true effects the attribute has on utility. We also find that mistaken assumptions about preferences over costs magnify attribute mis-specification effects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Three criteria are used, including forest structure, economic value, and regeneration status. Each criterion is further composed of multiple concrete indicators. Pair-wise comparisons are used to obtain the contribution weights of the criteria as well as those of the indicators. A quality index is then computed based on the criteria and indicators' values and contribution weights. A case study of a forest farm on Loess Plateau in China is further used to illustrate the model. Results indicate that for the stand level forest quality on Loess Plateau, forest structure is the most important, followed by regeneration status and economic value. Among the concrete indicators, litter depth is the most important while the number of seedlings and saplings is the least important. The resultant forest quality index varies from 1.6 to 3.3 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent). The model is practical and easy to use.

These initiatives include local deliberative processes of low-carbon futures as well as local-global interactions in 'eco-innovation jam' dialogues carried out in a virtual space, but founded on communicating with local stakeholder groups. Experiences from national processes and international examples of these structured dialogues of community engagement raise important questions of environmental justice and deliberative processes that facilitate participation by some groups, but perhaps also neglect others. This is particularly relevant since the environmental justice discourse traditionally frames environmental concerns in a place-bound manner that includes local responses to environmental questions. In this paper we argue the importance of local and global forums and deliberative processes for community engagement in order to incorporate stakeholders' perceptions of future options for low-carbon living, travelling and consuming services and products. Important policy transformations in planning for low-carbon societies are outlined and results from cases are discussed.

In this paper I use nanotechnology as a case to examine how uncertain technoscientific futures are represented in lay talk. I engage with this question through a close analysis of focus group discussion around nanotechnology, describing the cultural and linguistic resources that participants draw upon in doing this, including personal experience and expertise, analogies and comparisons, and fiction and popular culture. These are, I suggest, the key discursive tools with which laypeople can weigh up and evaluate emerging technologies. However, I also argue that these are used flexibly to create different kinds of arguments in different conversational contexts, and use the example of nanotechnology as 'the same'/'different' to illustrate this. In concluding I reflect on the implications of these findings for scholars of public opinion and attitude and for those who frame policy on emerging and uncertain science and technology.

Using a national sample of the 2000 PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) database, we first analyze the impact of immigrant status on pupils' achievement. We find a negative and significant impact of immigrant status on test scores in reading, mathematics and science literacy, even after controlling for a set of characteristics. We then decompose the observed reading score gap between Swiss and immigrant students to identify whether gaps in endowments explain test score differences along the distribution. Lower endowments explain most of the achievement gap in reading between Swiss and second-generation immigrants. However, lower returns explain around one quarter of the achievement gap between Swiss and first-generation immigrants for the weakest pupils. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper aims to study the level of regional convergence through analyzing chosen socio-economic variables in the Republic of Croatia. It is hard to conduct more complex analysis because of the lack of data but it was possible to analyze sigma-convergence and (in some examples) beta-convergence of GDP per capita, labor productivity and administrative unemployment rate which are the most used variables in the growth theory literature. Other socioeconomic variables of Croatia counties are described in descriptive part of the research analysis. Trends among regions are assessed throughout clusters of regions: all regions, developed regions and developing regions. A regional convergence conceptual framework includes 21 Croatian counties in a given time period, depending on data availability. The tendency toward convergence and/or divergence is analyzed in the context of public policy efficiency, which is the main purpose of the research. According to the results the authors give the public policy recommendations which can be used in the decision making process regarding the regional development disparities' mitigations.","[Blazevic, Sanja; Lacmanovic, Sabina; Tijanic, Lela] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Dept Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Preradovieeva 1-1, Pula 52100, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Blazevic, S (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Dept Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Preradovieeva 1-1, Pula 52100, Croatia.",sblazev@unipu.hr; sgrgor@unipu.hr; letijan@unipu.hr,,,,,,,60,0,0,0,1,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

Yet, financial valuation techniques have only slowly percolated into disciplines concerned with the management of ecosystems. Particularly in forest management, decision-makers often find themselves confronted with extremely long time horizons and severely uncertain information. This requires careful valuation approaches, which are often underrepresented or even completely lacking in forest management. This paper gives a comprehensive overview on techniques for financial decision-making under uncertainty and develops future research needs. First, we analyse different approaches from the expected utility framework as well as option pricing models and robust optimisation techniques as possible approaches to make decisions on forest investments and giving a short review regarding forestry-related applications. Afterwards we discuss the suitability of the presented approaches to support decisions in forestry and conclude that robust optimisation techniques should be developed further, especially since erroneous financial data is likely to occur, as well as deviations from the assumption of normality. Currently, the maximization of financial robustness is probably the most adequate approach for many long-term decisions in forestry, such as selecting the optimum tree species composition. Further development of this approach appears possible and necessary. Finally, we come to the conclusion that even though it is intuitively clear that many long-term decisions should consider uncertainty, adequate financial valuation is not sufficiently developed within forest science. In the case of Central Europe, this may be an effect of ecological research dominating in forest science. Consequently, an intensification of the analysis of uncertainty in forest decision-making is necessary. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Significant amount of researches aimed to analyze the use of self assessed life satisfaction levels for individual and public welfare served as the basis of this paper. It is concluded that individuals consciously or unconsciously tend to include in their rating both short-term and long-term factors which represent such life values that cannot be measured otherwise. Paper investigates theoretical aspects of the link between material and social wellbeing. Easterlin paradox is analyzed to understand the relationship between income and life satisfaction scores within one society and amongst countries with a conclusion that there is significant positive correlation in the first but none in the latter. Theoretical analysis is supplemented by an empirical findings from Latvian data obtained in the 4th wave of European Value Survey. Results show that there is a significant increase of life satisfaction levels in higher income groups. Upward trends are present also in cross sectional data by gender however there is a slight fluctuation in the slope representing differences of male and female life satisfaction at the same income level. Comparison is made between other Baltic countries - Lithuania and Estonia - results show that similar correlation is in place but the same income level is associated with dfferent life satisfaction level depending on country indicating other than income factors to be significant in overall satisfaction rating. Results in line with Easterlin paradox are found from regional analysis representing that there is positive correlation of income and life satisfaction in the whole country dataset but this correlation is not in force comparing local regions: Riga with the highest average income per household does not represent the highest life satisfaction scores.,"[Reizins, Klavs; Balina, Signe] Univ Latvia, Fac Econ & Management, Aspazij Blvd 5, LV-1050 Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Reizins, K (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Fac Econ & Management, Aspazij Blvd 5, LV-1050 Riga, Latvia.",klavs.reizins@inbox.lv; signe.balina@lu.lv,,,,,,,38,1,1,0,3,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

This frame negatively influences the information sharing not in the decision-making processes, but in the education process too. This paper deals with the quantification of the framing effect using the Analytic Network Process. The result of this approach will be the set of weights of all viewpoints included into the frames. Practical application of these weights can serve to reduce the framing effect, because all subjects in the decision-making process will receive the information about the importance of different viewpoints and then they can rearrange their opinions and expectations.

Social science institutionalism considers social systems to be structured by sanctioned rules of obligatory behaviour. Its perspective is one of collective ordering, or governance, through regularization and normalization of social action, either by public authority or by private contract. Political economy looks at the interrelations between collective action in general, and collective rule-making in particular, and the economy; it extends from economic and social policy-making to the way in which economic interests and constraints influence policy, politics and social life as a whole. The approach proposed in this article looks at society and economy as densely intertwined and closely interdependent, which is exactly what traditional concepts of capitalism stood for. Proceeding from an institutionalist perspective, it elaborates a concept of capitalism not as a self-driven mechanism of surplus extraction and accumulation governed by objective laws, but as a set of interrelated social institutions, and as a historically specific system of structured as well as structuring social interaction within and in relation to an institutionalized social order.","Max Planck Inst Study Societies, Cologne, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Streeck, W (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Study Societies, Cologne, Germany.",ws@mpifg.de,,,,,,,58,111,118,0,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

In the Consentsus project a scenario method was developed and tested by the research team to assess scenarios both as learning and participation tools for sustainable consumption. By using a decomposition analysis a solid ground was laid to adequately summarize three guiding principles on how to reach a (more) sustainable consumption: eco-efficiency, de-commodification and sufficiency. These 'pure' strategies - showing significant similarities with concrete discourses - were then translated into a participative process: two expert-driven workshops and interim research yielded three future images of food consumption as well as indications on their boundary conditions. These three images reflect significantly diverging approaches on how to organize practices related to food consumption. This structural diversity allowed us to address an archetypical consumer, i.e. a generalized consumer based on the specificities of the scenarios. These consumer perspectives do not aim at indicating real (even potential) groups, but aim at illustrating how the environment of interactions around the consumer fundamentally changes throughout the three sustainability discourses. It is argued that thinking through alternative modes of consumption is of importance to support and elucidate debate in governance arenas that address transitions towards a more sustainable consumption.

This study examines the factors that influence a district's decision to offer incentive pay using districts from the 1999 to 2000 Schools and Staffing Survey. The results suggest that school districts that face barriers to recruitment or retention and districts that face competition from non-sectarian private schools are more likely to offer incentive pay.

Our analysis suggests that the RIP process has brought together a significant cross-section of actors who meet on a regular basis. Hence, it has become an institutionalised cooperation between key stakeholder organisations. It has facilitated information exchange and learning about issues pertaining to forest management practices, timber markets, and protection of biodiversity. Engaging the general public in the RIP process has, however, been mostly ineffectual. The process has also fallen short of the expectations to reconcile different perspectives and produce jointly accepted strategies.

The research was aimed at exploring the potential role of foresight in the development of the Brussels Capital Region and the identification of tools, capabilities and conditions for an improved application of foresight in Brussels. An overview was created of the characteristics of 60 future oriented activities and 120 organisations involved in such activities At the outset questions on organisational or institutional fragmentation and collaboration were not intended to be in the foreground of the research but over the course of the research this issue was observed to have a significant adverse impact on foresight capacity in Brussels. The case of the Brussels Capital Region demonstrates that institutional and organisational fragmentation need to be overcome for a futures oriented practice to have opportunity. De-fragmentation, bottom-up and institutionally, is both a condition for and an effect of the futures oriented practice underlying the foresight capacity of organisations.

We assess potential outcome of the Doha Round as well as four protectionist scenarios using the MIRAGE Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. In a scenario where applied tariffs of World Trade Organization (WTO) economies would go up to currently bound tariff rates, world trade would decrease by 9.9% and world welfare by US$353 billion. The economic cost of a failed DDA is here evaluated by the difference between a cooperative scenario (DDA) and a protectionist one (US$412 billion in terms of welfare). Another point of view is to compare a resort to protectionism when the DDA is implemented with a resort to protectionism when the DDA is not implemented. The findings show that this trade agreement could prevent the potential reduction of US$809 billion of trade and, therefore, acts as an efficient multilateral 'preventive' scheme against the adverse consequences of trade 'beggar-thy-neighbor' policies.","[Bouet, Antoine; Laborde, David] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Bouet, Antoine] Ctr Anal Theor & Traitement Donnees Econ, Pau, France",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Bouet, A (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",a.bouet@cgiar.org; d.laborde@cgiar.org,"Laborde, David/D-6408-2015","Laborde, David/0000-0003-3644-3498",,,,,31,25,25,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2010,9.0,2,,,,,319,351,,10.1017/S1474745609990267,0.0,,,33,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,592DJ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277355300002,0

For commercial thinnings the supply systems with manual felling are the most cost effective. In final fellings bigger average stem volume allows more productive use of harvesters that provides lower costs than systems with manual cutting. The total supply cost of energy wood from thinnings is higher compared to final fellings. Costs of energy wood cannot compete with the local price of coal and natural gas. However, energy wood is cheaper than heavy oil if transporting distances are shorter than 50 km. Main reasons for high supply costs of energy wood are low productivity of felling, hauling and transportation.

In a multivariable analysis, mortality was lower for patients taking simvastatin [HR = 0.62 (0.50-0.76)] and clopidogrel [HR = 0.58 (0.46-0.74)]. Costs for out-patient care accounted for 25% and drugs for 5% of total costs. If patients not treated with simvastatin or clopidogrel had received these drugs, an additional 154-306 lives might have been saved. Drug costs would be higher, but total costs lower. Thus, even expensive drugs may reduce overall costs.","[Wilhelmsen, Lars] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Welin, Lennart] Lidkoping Hosp, Lidkoping, Sweden; [Oden, Anders] Chalmers Univ Technol, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Bjornberg, Arne] Pollex Retro Res, Stockholm, Sweden",University of Gothenburg; Chalmers University of Technology,"Wilhelmsen, L (通讯作者)，Fregattgatan 16, S-42674 Vastra Frolunda, Sweden.",lars.wilhelmsen@gu.se,,,,,,,26,3,3,1,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Moreover, many actors advocate the construction industry moves towards a lean production, process-based way of working for quality and cost reasons. Here, Timber Framed Engineering approaches are considered to have a competitive and environmental advantage. There is however underlying concerns that conservatism in the construction industry, and lack of timber engineering skills, may be obstacles to change. This paper therefore assesses whether EU construction policy innovation contributed to innovation at the firm level. Timber framed innovators in six European countries were identified, and their sources of innovation assessed. The results indicate that timber framed firms have become actors in the construction industry. Firms have made product, process and organisation innovations. All case firms have similar sources for innovation. The common factor that triggers the firms to innovate is business opportunities that arise from demographic changes in the environment outside the firm, such as environmental sustainability and affordable housing for lower income groups. To address these opportunities, the case firms implicitly recognised that traditional project and site-based construction approaches are an incongruity. The firms have consequently established in-house prefabrication, including developed of lean production processes to ensure quality as well as effectiveness. The firms have all recognised that a fundamental barrier to their business was the lack of timber framed engineering competencies in their customers' organisations. Accordingly, a business necessity for the case firms was developing construction design competencies. Firms benefited from governmental policy instruments that support timber framed R&D and knowledge transfer. However, firms also gained new knowledge from their own experiences, which they also use in their operations.

This paper utilizes a regression discontinuity design to evaluate the impact of Florida's high-stakes testing policy on student proficiency in the low-stakes subject of science. We confirm prior results that students in schools facing more immediate sanctions under the policy made substantial gains in the high-stakes subjects of math and reading. Contrary to the crowding-out hypothesis, we find that students in these schools made substantial achievement gains in the low-stakes subject of science as well. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The main focus is to test the relevance of three mechanisms-market, learning, and signaling-suggested by Overdevest and Rickenbach (2006), to explain forest certification adoption by Brazilian companies. Furthermore, companies' familiarity with certification systems, external influences on pursuing forest certification. and companies' intention to recertify their forests are investigated. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) suggests that signaling and learning mechanisms lead to better and more transparent forest management, explaining the movement towards certification, but market incentives do not play an important role in the adoption of forest certification. An importance and performance analysis (IPA) demonstrates that companies do not see any return in terms of a better price for certified products; however, certificate holders indicated overall high satisfaction with market access. Interestingly, a high performance was found for non-economic benefits such as public confidence, improvement of forest management and practices, improvement of management systems and performance, self-discovery of non-conformance, and better public, landowner, and supplier communication. International consumers and shareholders were considered the most important groups influencing companies to seek certification and FSC was reported to be the most familiar scheme. Generally, companies were pleased with certification and indicated their intention to recertify. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Goux-Baudiment, F",,,,"Goux-Baudiment, Fabienne",,,Tomorrow will die,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Human beings' resilience to extinction is much higher than what is usually imagined. Almost no single event, except a sudden burst of the planet, seems able to drive the species to death. However a chain of events such as those created by climate change or the intertwined threads of current trends. amplified by some inadequacy of human beings to cope with reality (inefficiency, apathy, underestimation, politician considerations, etc.), could challenge our survival. This paper aims to provide such a set of multiple events, interconnected or independent, evolving over a rather short period of time, 150 years. This period can seem unrealistic to drive to a plausible extinction. Yet this was a condition to set up a situation as realistic as possible, based on current facts and extrapolations.

They find that the two groups of students are significantly different in age, gender composition, marital status and number of children, GPA, previous economics exposure, planned major, and other important characteristics. The raw data suggested a higher mean score for the online class sections. But after considering course selection bias, the findings indicated that age and GPA positively affect students' performance in the course, whereas the online teaching mode has a narrowly insignificant, or even negative, effect.

This has led to an array of local-level policies designed to encourage homeowners to create fire-safe landscapes. This qualitative study collected data from focus group interviews with homeowners in three diverse communities and used the theory of reasoned action to interpret dimensions of local-level wildland fire policies that are associated with homeowner acceptance of or compliance with defensible space guidelines or regulations. Common factors emerged in two policy evaluation categories: acceptance and compliance. WUI homeowners are more accepting of policies that are seen as fair and part of a more comprehensive risk reduction strategy. Topics that shaped acceptance of voluntary versus mandatory approaches included perceived risk severity, views about the proper roles of government, and beliefs about alternatives to regulatory approaches (e.g. private insurance, education, ignition source reduction). Program characteristics that were found to be related to beliefs about defensible space and acceptance included provision of one-on-one expert consultation, direct mail communication modes, needs-based financial assistance, and enhanced yard waste disposal options. Homeowner compliance is related to the feasibility in terms of household costs and yard waste disposal options, neighborhood norms, competing land use objectives, insurance considerations. and whether or not the policy is mandatory. These findings led to a proposed conceptual model of vegetation management policy acceptance and compliance that local governments can use to develop or amend defensible space vegetation management policies to increase policy acceptance and compliance.

It is seen as a tool to improve regulatory quality and to promote cross-cutting objectives such as sustainable development. Often conceived as an economic analysis of costs and benefits, RIA tends to be depicted as a 'neutral' assessment process that informs decision-makers about 'facts'. This does not explain, of course, why RIA often becomes an arena for political conflict involving both government departments and stakeholders. Based on empirical research on the design and practical application of RIA across the European Union. this paper explores the relationship between RIA, policy-making and politics. The aim is to shed light on what knowledge is produced, how it is used by different actors and what role it plays in decision-making. Based on this analysis, we explore to what extent and under what conditions RIA can serve as a tool for more evidence-based and sustainability oriented policy-making processes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, empirical studies have revealed that this method is often in contradiction with the attitudes of ordinary citizens towards inequality. It is thus a relevant question why the axiomatic approach still commands support in academic applications. This article adopts a historical perspective and presents evidence for our main hypothesis: the axiomatic approach can be interpreted as a result of conventions that allowed specialists to overcome the indeterminacy of the concept 'inequality'. An unintended consequence of today's measurement conventions appears to be the crowding out of non-scientific representations.","Univ Lille 1, CLERSE, Fac Econ & Social Sci, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France",Universite de Lille - ISITE; Universite de Lille,"Kampelmann, S (通讯作者)，Univ Lille 1, CLERSE, Fac Econ & Social Sci, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France.",stephan@internationalistfoundation.com,,,,,,,31,4,4,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

J,"Wolfe, R",,,,"Wolfe, Robert",,,The special safeguard fiasco in the WTO: the perils of inadequate analysis and negotiation,WORLD TRADE REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The July 2008 attempt by a group of ministers to agree on modalities for the WTO's Doha Round broke down in part because they could not agree on a proposed 'Special Safeguard Mechanism' (SSM) for developing countries in agriculture. This paper offers a corrective to the conventional story that the breakdown was due to a simple conflict of interests over the SSM between the United States and India. The term SSM was first used in a Doha Round text in 2004, but neither the principles nor the commercial implications had ever been discussed by ministers before July 2008. The conceptual origins of the SSM go back to proposals in the late 1990s for a 'Development Box', but by the time of the ministerial, negotiators had been unable to agree on the purpose of the safeguard, or how it would work, including the agricultural products it would cover, how it would be triggered, the remedies (additional tariffs) allowed, or the transparency requirements for its operation. The SSM was therefore one of the least 'stabilized' parts of the text placed before ministers in July 2008. Members were far from reaching a consensual understanding of the SSM, which resulted in a fiasco that might have been avoided. Ministers should not have been asked to engage in a poorly prepared discussion of a sensitive issue, because inevitably they staked out incompatible positions. Members may Subsequently find it difficult to back down.","Queens Univ, Sch Policy Studies, Kingston, ON, Canada",Queens University - Canada,"Wolfe, R (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Sch Policy Studies, Kingston, ON, Canada.",robert.wolfe@queensu.ca,,,,,,,64,30,31,1,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2009,8.0,4,,,,,517,544,,10.1017/S1474745609990048,0.0,,,28,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,507TG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000270877200002,0

The publication bias problem is given special emphasis in the meta-analysis. Our statistical synthesis confirms that education is a strong and robust correlate of individual social capital. The meta-analysis provides support for the existence of a relative effect of education on social participation, and of a reciprocity mechanism between the dimensions of social capital. The analysis also suggests that the erosion of social participation during the past decades has coincided with a decrease of the marginal return to education on social capital.

Using Pacific Basin stock market indexes, we show that the dynamic process of daily index returns is better characterized by nonlinearity arising from an asymmetric reverting property, and that the asymmetric reverting property of stock returns is exploitable in generating profitable buy and sell signals for technical trading rules. We show that the positive (negative) returns from buy (sell) signals are a consequence of trading rules that exploit the asymmetric dynamics of stock returns that revolve around positive (negative) unconditional mean returns under prior positive (negative) return patterns. Our results corroborate the arguments for the usefulness of technical analysis.","[Krausz, Joshua; Nam, Kiseok] Yeshiva Univ, Sy Syms Sch Business, New York, NY 10033 USA; [Lee, Sa-Young] Chungbuk Natl Univ, Coll Commerce & Business Adm, Cheongju, South Korea",Yeshiva University; Chungbuk National University,"Krausz, J (通讯作者)，Yeshiva Univ, Sy Syms Sch Business, New York, NY 10033 USA.",krausz@yu.edu; leesy@chungbuk.ac.kr; knam@yu.edu,,,,,,,23,8,8,0,6,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Invasive upland plants (IPs) threaten to dramatically reduce the flow of goods and services from these lands. In the late 1990s, a Florida (USA) state program began combating IPs on public conservation lands. By 2007, the program had controlled roughly 1/3 of the 1.5 million IP-infested acres, primarily due to a surge in expenditures that began in 2001 and peaked in 2005. This study evaluates the effectiveness and efficiency of the program by simulating the costs and benefits of IP control through 2016 under five feasible policy alternatives: (I) Do nothing, (II) Maintenance control, (III) 2001-2004 level (of program spending), (IV) 2005 level, and (V) Maximum net present value. To evaluate the policies, we construct a bio-economic model that is parameterized using observations of IP coverage and data from 11 state regions. Given the uncertain nature of IP spread, we simulate the policies' economic impacts under two plausible spread rates. Simulation results indicate that the program's recent efforts are highly effective generating up to $865.1 million in present value net benefits through 2016 - but less efficient than more costly, front-loaded spending that can generate up to 4.37 times more net benefits.

New evidence from High School and Beyond,ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,School choice; Privatization; Demand for schooling,PUBLIC-SCHOOLS; CHOICE,"In the U.S., white parents may choose to send their children to private schools in response to the local concentration of minority schoolchildren, commonly referred to as white flight. This paper contributes to the existing literature by providing new evidence on white flight from the data set High School and Beyond (HSB). I find that a one-percentage-point increase in the county (metropolitan area, or MA) level minority share of school-age population increases the private schooling probability of white students by 0.2 (0.27) percentage points. White flight appears to be more sensitive to the concentration of black schoolchildren than to any other minority concentration. White families also appear to respond more strongly to the concentration of poor minorities than to non-poor minorities. Results also suggest substantial variation in the rate of white flight across different areas of the country. Finally, when minority shares are measured at the county level, there is some evidence of increasing rate of white flight from the local concentration of black schoolchildren as the black share increases.

Secondly, I will briefly explore of the contemporary politics of sustainable development with the focus on its utopian dimensions, and thirdly, I will also comment on the different kinds and forms of utopian thought that should be relevant for sutainability projects on different levels. My conclusions are that the utopian language is flourishing in many of the discourses on sustainable development, especially in comparison to other fields of politics, but that the role of utopian thought in this area needs to be reflected on and more thoroughly recognized in the practical endeavors taken in this area.

Since NIPF landowners are so diverse, there is a need to better understand the determinants of their decisions so that policies could be in place to motivate them. A survey was carried out in 2005 to the nonindustrial private forest landowners of West Virginia to examine the factors affecting their forest management decisions. The study looked at four categories of decisions related to forest management: timber harvest, silvicultural activities (i.e., tree planting, herbicide application, fertilization, thinning, grapevine control, and timber stand improvement), property management activities (i.e., road construction, road maintenance, surveying/boundary maintenance, and access control), and wildlife habitat management and recreation improvement activities. Four models were developed to examine factors affecting each category of forest management activity. The results showed that landowner, ownership, and management characteristics of NIPF landowners are associated with their forest management decisions. Specifically, age, education, profession, income, ownership size, period of forestland acquisition, distance of the forestland to the place of residence, whether the forestland was purchased or acquired through inheritance or as a gift, primary objective of forestland ownership, and presence of a written forest management plan were found to be significant determinants for at least one of the categories of forest management activities. The models explained 25%, 27%, 31%, and 24% of the variation in timber harvesting, silvicultural activities, property management activities, and wildlife habitat management and recreation improvement activities, respectively. Understanding the underlying factors influencing forest management decisions of this diverse group of forest landowners could form the basis for developing, modifying and targeting policy instruments to motivate NIPF landowners in forest management.

On the one hand, we can have our own vision, and we also expect certain people (mostly leaders) to have vision. On the other hand, most futures practitioners confirm that a (shared) vision is needed for successful action, and the active development of vision is therefore to be encouraged. However, theory development has been limited and many authors do not go beyond the confirmation that it is important to have or develop (a) vision, mostly in relation to a specific desire for action. Vision appears to be much more a phenomenon (in its original sense as 'appearance') than a theory. Hence, what we should expect from a vision theory is a deeper understanding of what vision is, what the added value of the process of visioning could be, and how we have to appreciate and assess (explicit) vision statements. In this contribution, we propose a basic theoretical framework in order to move towards the underpinning of 'visionary' approaches. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods Using data for all short-stay community hospitals in the country, we compared LOS for Medicare patients before and after the BBA/BBRA relative to known determinants of LOS, e.g., hospital ownership, region, beds, financial performance, and conversion/change in ownership type. Results Hospital LOS was reduced as a result of the acts. Reductions were more apparent for larger urban hospitals that provided safety-net services. LOS varied slightly by hospital ownership. Conclusion This study is among the first to evaluate the impact of BBA and BBRA on hospital services.

Among blacks, speech patterns are highly correlated with measures of skill such as schooling and AFQT scores. They are also highly correlated with the wages of young workers. Even after controlling for measures of skill and family background, black speakers whose voices were distinctly identified as black by anonymous listeners earn about 12 percent less than whites with similar observable skills. Indistinctly identified blacks earn essentially the same as comparable whites.

We show that the benefit of the introduction of an activity-based system depends on the type of interaction between managers and physicians (simultaneous or sequential decision-making games). It is shown that, under the activity-based system, a sequential interaction with physician leader could be beneficial for both agents in the private sector. We further model an endogenous timing game A la Hamilton and Slutsky (Games Econ Behav 2: 29-46, 1990) in which the type of interaction is determined endogenously.

To gauge the extent of interdisciplinarity of EP, the departmental affiliation of first-authors from 1000 journal articles evenly distributed across ten leading peer-reviewed psychology journals was assessed. Findings show that journals that are evolutionary-based have more first-authors from outside of psychology, and also include a wider variety of represented disciplines. These findings are discussed in terms of their influence on the future of EP, as a model for interdisciplinary research. EP's future will be successful if it continues to promote interdisciplinarity as well as recognize the epistemological worth of multiple evolutionary paradigms and frameworks.

Reflecting on more than a dozen recent city futures exercises, three overriding themes emerge: changing values systems will be the single biggest driver over the next thirty years; the forging of shared visions is a prerequisite to strategic city planning; and the nature, force and direction of the various vectors of collaborative leadership by constituent stakeholders will determine the future success or otherwise of city stewardship. The article concludes by calling for the formulation of a Unified Theory for Sustainable Cities by reference to Gaia and the application of a futures oriented approach such as Prospective Through Scenarios.

In this setting, a crucial role is played by educational quality since it determines the signaling mechanisms in the labor market. We report some empirical evidence on the impact of mismatch, individual ability, family background, and university features on wages of Italian graduates and we suggest the importance of considering education quality as a policy instrument for reducing educational mismatch and wage inequality.

We test the support for taxation within a single-price market experiment, in which purchases by some buyers impose external costs on others. Observing behavior consistent with tax-aversion, we also find that recycling the revenues to more narrowly targeted groups seems to increase support for taxation.

Prior work has shown that principals can differentiate between more and less effective teachers, especially at the tails of the quality distribution, and that subjective evaluations of teachers are strongly correlated with subsequent student achievement. However, whereas prior work has relied on survey data, we consider formal ratings from a setting in which the stakes are reasonably high. We find that the ratings are correlated with an array of teacher qualities including experience for young teachers, education credentials, and teacher absenteeism. Our finding that principals reward qualities of teachers known to be related to student productivity provides reason to be optimistic about policies that would assign more weight to principal evaluations of teachers in career decisions and compensation.

The Swedish environmental policy is based on 16 environmental quality objectives (EQOs) that national authorities are obliged to observe. These objectives are reviewed annually and evaluated in depth every four years. Here we describe and explore a futures study project for introducing more long-term thinking into work on the EQOs, which we tested in the in-depth evaluation in 2008. We found it difficult to design a collective scenario for a case with a wide variety of objectives and individuals with different backgrounds. However, this difficulty makes it even more important to incorporate futures studies into the work of the relevant authorities. Scenario work is often subcontracted, leading to a constant lack of futures studies expertise and thinking within authorities. Despite the difficulties, we found that experts within the authorities did begin to recognise the opportunities provided by futures studies. The project revealed an interest and need for futures studies within the authorities in charge of Swedish environmental quality objectives and our findings show that the authorities need to build up their own skills in futures studies.

It asks three basic questions: What is a collaborative competition? In what sense are collaborative competitions collaborative? And in view of the social and environmental goals of the competitions, are they a contribution to sustainability practice? Prepared by a conceptual analysis, partly drawing on the arguments for extended peer review in post-normal science, and based on the in-depth analysis of one collaborative competition, it is argued that the idea of a collaborative competition is innovative and suggestive; however, in practice there is only weak evidence for collaboration - the competitive element clearly prevails. The innovation, in practice, is a new way of making visible and thereby promoting social and environmental ideas. There is some evidence for collaborative spirit, but there is only limited evidence that arguments for extended peer review apply. The design of the online collaborative competition might not promote collaboration as well as it could. Therefore, the paper ends with a discussion of possibilities for changing the design of the competition. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Unless women in all socio-economic circumstances sought abortions to the same extent, increased use of abortion must have changed the distribution of child development inputs. I find that higher abortion ratios are associated with higher graduation rates for black males, but not other demographic groups. In a pooled analysis, I find that abortion has a significant negative impact on graduation rates. The effect disappears when I control for ethnicity. The cohorts born between 1965 and 1979 contained falling shares of whites, who have relatively high graduation rates. Regression results indicate abortion ratios are linked with the fertility differences between ethnicities which suggests this is a channel of influence.

It presents the original characteristics of neo-liberal ideology by emphasizing how it differs from classical liberalism. Although pressures and contradictions are inherent in neo-liberalism, it is possible to single out some of its most original characteristics which are far more vital to the analysis of capitalism than vague and commonplace notions such as market fundamentalism. It also describes those moral aspects of neo-liberalism which differ from traditional morals and place the ethos of competitiveness at the centre of social life. It shows how the morals of neo-liberalism are linked to neo-liberal politics and policies. Freed in part from public sovereignty, neo-liberal politics must be guided by a moral imperative linked to competition. This paper reveals the consequences of these morals and politics for the definition of social policy. A contract based on reciprocity between the individual and society is substituted for collective rights to social protection and redistribution. This change in perspective is particularly important for the social policy advocated by the modern left.","[Amable, Bruno] Univ Paris 01, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Amable, Bruno] CEPREMAP, Paris, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Amable, B (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",bruno.amable@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,52,198,237,2,60,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

It introduces the idea of a protected area for recreational fisheries as a way to reduce conflicts between the two sectors and to preserve the natural resources. It is demonstrated that without a protected area for recreational fisheries, open access may imply that only one sector survives. A protected area can assure the operation of both sectors, even under open access. This will also enhance the aggregate fish stock and the aggregate harvest, both in open access and in the optimal management of recreational fisheries, even if commercial fisheries operate under an open-access regime.","[Ngoc, Quach Thi Kkhanh] Nha Trang Univ, Fac Econ, 02 Nguyen Dinh Chieu, Nha Trang, Vietnam; [Flaaten, Ola] Univ Tromso, Norwegian Coll Fishery Sci, N-9037 Tromso, Norway",Nha Trang University; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Ngoc, QTK (通讯作者)，Nha Trang Univ, Fac Econ, 02 Nguyen Dinh Chieu, Nha Trang, Vietnam.",quachngoc@gmail.com; ola.flaaten@uit.no,,"Thi Khanh Ngoc, Quach/0000-0003-0167-5299",Norwegian Agency for International Development Cooperation (NORAD) [SRV2701]; Norwegian Research Council [185150]; European Commission [36992]; Policy Integration for Coastal System Assessment (SPICOSA),Norwegian Agency for International Development Cooperation (NORAD)(Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD); Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Policy Integration for Coastal System Assessment (SPICOSA),"The authors are grateful to two reviewers and the editor for helpful comments.

First, the analytical framework is set up following Goldberg and Knetter (1997) and Campa and Goldberg (2005). Next, the period-by-period and the multiple-period cumulative effects of monetary policy on the degree of exchange rate pass-through can be traced out. The dynamic panel data model is then estimated by Bun and Carree's (2005) bias-corrected approach, which enjoys easy calculation and robust testing performances, leading to more reliable empirical results. Our cross-commodity evidence strongly supports the partial pass-through in the short run and the complete pass-through in the long run. Moreover, following a change in monetary policy, this pass-through effect increases during several initial periods and declines to zero over time.","[Chang, Jui-Chuan] Natl Chia Yi Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Chiayi, Taiwan; [Tsong, Ching-Chuan] Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Econ, Puli, Taiwan",National Chiayi University; National Chi Nan University,"Chang, JC (通讯作者)，Natl Chia Yi Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Chiayi, Taiwan.",jccdella@mail.ncyu.edu.tw; tcc126@ncnu.edu.tw,,,,,,,17,6,6,0,6,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The construction of spatial plans is more and more intended as a socio/political activity producing highly cognitive visions able to guide collective action and make a common good of it. In accordance with the view that a relevant portion of such knowledge is revealed only through action, the paper proposes the idea of structuring-scenarios as open entities able to structure action and, consequently, to bridge participatory knowledge to the impetuous practice of action. The paper first presents and discusses the role of structuring-scenarios in the work carried out while developing an environmental plan for the delta area of the Po River in Italy. Then it reflects on the main features of content and structure of such scenarios. Finally, the paper analyses the 'structuring properties' of these scenarios and their role in structuring action.

It brings out three scenarios: (1) a Eurocentric future; (2) a pragmatically multi-civilizational European Union; and (3) a multi-civilizational European Union. Normatively, the third scenario, a genuinely multi-civilizational future appears the most preferred alternative for the rise of European Union as a respected and credible global actor, which plays a significant role in the stabilization and development of its neighbourhood regions and in the resolution of global level issues. Along with incentives, barriers, as discussed in relevant sections, are also explicit which might lead to two other scenarios if not eliminated. Practically, the article concludes that the coexistence of European and other civilizations within the European Union is more likely to lead to a multi-civilizational future than any attempt to integrate those civilizations within the dominant European tradition.

We investigate the determinants of attending university and explore the reasons for the increasing gender gap. As in the US literature, we find that conventional decompositions, averaging over the whole sample, attribute most of the gender gap to differences in variables, notably the University Premium. The average sample approach in these decompositions abstracts from the evolution over time of the participation rates by gender and from important detail at specific points in time, features that we try to overcome. We find that the rising level of the university participation rate for both women and men can be explained by changing societal norms, the dynamic influence of parental education, the University Premium, tuition fees and real income. The 2005 gap between the female and male participation rates can be accounted mostly (9 percentage points) by the gender differences in the University Premium and, to a lesser extent (6 percentage points), by differences in the coefficients in the female and male participation equations.

It utilizes the statewide administrative data set on public school teachers in Florida during the period 1997-2003 in conjunction with the 1999-2000 Schools and Staffing Survey and its Teacher Follow-Up Survey (SASS-TFS) data set. The SASS-TFS illustrates the possible misclassification of teachers in certain state administrative databases. Results suggest that new teachers in Florida and elsewhere usually teach in more challenging schools and have more disadvantaged children in their classrooms than teachers with more years of experience. Within-school classroom assignments play an important role in teacher mobility decisions. Specifically, school-specific policies on reducing disciplinary problems and possible strategic deployment of teachers in different classrooms may be effective in increasing school-level teacher retention rates.","Texas State Univ San Marcos, Dept Finance & Econ, McCoy Coll Business Adm, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA",Texas State University System; Texas State University San Marcos,"Feng, L (通讯作者)，Texas State Univ San Marcos, Dept Finance & Econ, McCoy Coll Business Adm, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA.",LF20@txstate.edu,"Feng, Li/D-7155-2014",,,,,,53,57,117,1,26,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

This paper presents the first regression testing for the existence of price competition in a credit card market to be estimated free of dynamic panel bias using recent quarterly data from Turkey. The estimation reveals that even though the effect of the cost of funds on credit card rates is statistically significant, it is very weak.

We first concentrate on the income-expense balance of households to highlight those that are eligible for consumer credit. We reinforce our results by further analyzing the expenditure behaviors of households to find those that should be either primarily eliminated or targeted for consumer credit by financial institutions.

The philosophy of FSSF is based on the principles of environmental scanning and pattern management, which state that if there is a grand transformation process on the way or if there is a new emerging pattern or phenomenon, such a process will certainly be reflected in many different ways. Therefore, in this philosophy, futures knowledge is believed to be fragmented between various simultaneous and overlapping sources. Here, a researcher's task is to carry out a sufficient environmental scanning process and to cluster and sense how to create the emerging future through a pattern management process where FSSF plays a role as the first start-up tool. Alternatively, FSSF can also be used as a general knowledge management and sense-making tool for any kind of analyses. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper empirically examines the intentions of foresters to conserve habitats beyond what is the minimum legally defined requirement when planning forestry operations: either by delineating particular habitats defined in the Finnish Forest Act completely outside the operation, despite this not being the obligation, or by delineating other valuable habitats that are not defined in the law. This type of voluntary exceeding of minimum conservation requirements is dependent on professional judgment, which is the focus of this article. The analysis applies the theory of planned behaviour, according to which intentions to behave in a particular fashion are influenced by attitudes, subjective norm, and perceived control over the behaviour. The investigation pays attention to behavioural and normative beliefs as well as other contextual factors influencing habitat delineation practice. The data consist of 311 survey responses (response rate 58%) of Finnish foresters planning forestry operations in non-industrial private forests, employed by public, private and associational organisations. The model is rather powerful in explaining intentions to exceed the minimum requirements. We find social norms to have a strong influence on delineation intentions. This effect is stronger in the case of delineation of other valuable habitats than in the more standardised delineation of legally defined habitats where the foresters have broader experience and consider themselves more autonomous. Normative beliefs relative to other foresters' expectations dominate the general subjective norm, signalling a primacy of a professional norm and the importance of peer networks. Also the general attitude has a strong influence on intentions, whereas the effect of perception of control is low. Past behaviour predicts intentions, which implies tradition and habit to have an important role in defining the way biodiversity conservation is integrated into forest management. In other words, abrupt changes are unlikely to occur in an institutionalized practice. Our analysis contributes to the understanding of policy implementation as well as governance of multiple functions of forests more generally. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The research demonstrates that expertise is derived from individuals' direct experience with disputing. Trade delegations employ or acquire expertise through the development of in-house experts, contracting private legal representation and seeking legal assistance. Institutionalizing expertise acquired by individuals is a primary challenge for building legal capacity and is linked to serial participation, building informal professional relationships and creating economies of scale in expert practitioners. Nonetheless, challenges remain, particularly related to the cost and difficulty of maintaining expertise over time and the role of market power in retaliation. How countries are able to gain expertise underwrites the legitimacy perceptions of practitioners, which emphasizes opportunities to acquire expertise over the persistence of inequalities in legal capacity.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Sociol, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Conti, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Sociol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jconti@ssc.wisc.edu,,,,,,,32,15,17,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

In this paper, we first built up a risk control evaluation index system, in which the risk was divided into 4 categories, namely, supplier strength risk, supplier implementation ability risk, software quality risk and Fee risk. Based on the analysis of the index system, a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model was then constructed. To verify the effectiveness of both the index system and the evaluation model, an empirical study was conducted. According to the evaluation results, people can easily get the optimal ERP system supplier in view of risk control.","[Deng Jiangao; Bian Yijie; Xu Xukan] Hohai Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing 213022, Peoples R China",Hohai University,,djgwmdkx@163.com; byj@hhu.edu.cn; xuxk@hhuc.edu.cn,"Xie, Xiangsheng/Z-1506-2018",,,,,,9,1,1,0,6,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-1-921712-08-1,,,,2010,,,,,,,1,5,,10.1109/AOM.2010.5713580,0.0,,,5,"Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering,BVE87,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291328700001,0

The estimates show that Chinese women confront competing demands for care, not only among elderly parents but also between older parents and their own young children. Moreover, the estimates unveil striking differences in labor market outcomes between caring for parents and caring for parents-in-law: caring for parents does not affect the caregiver's employment status and work hours, whereas caring for parents-in-law has a statistically significant, sizable, negative effect on the caregiver's probability of employment and hours of paid work.","[Liu, Lan; Zheng, Xiaoying] Peking Univ, Inst Populat Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Dong, Xiao-yuan] Univ Winnipeg, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada",Peking University; University of Winnipeg,"Liu, L (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Inst Populat Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",liulan@pku.edu.cn; x.dong@uwinnipeg.ca; xzheng@pku.edu.cn,,,,,,,51,54,65,7,72,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Still only his/hers income and the commodities' prices drive their demand, or the knowledge starts already to become a new criterion that determines the demand's volume and structure?

Can we define a quantitative approach for this somehow qualitative factor of influence? Presenting potential answers to these questions represents the aim of this paper. We start by introducing the Knowledge Elasticity of Demand as being a new possible way of measuring the role of knowledge in demand's change, and we continue the paper by portraying some steps in using this indicator in the analysis of the consumption of healthcare services.

The result shows that credit risk management performance of commercial banks is positively correlated with hoard size and independent director ratio; and it's negatively related to the number of directors holding posts in manager tier. However, the shareholding ratio of major shareholders, foreign strategic investor shareholding and senior management compensation have no explanatory power on credit risk management performance. Therefore, increasing independent director ratio is an effective way to improve credit risk management performance of China's commercial banks. Also, board size should be enlarged properly and the number of directors holding posts in manager tier should be reduced. However, raising senior management compensation or introducing foreign strategic investors lack positive meanings to credit risk management.","[Yao Zheng; Huang Qiongsi; Cao Guangfeng] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,,z.yao@cma.zju.edu.cn; joneszju@gmail.com; huocgf@126.com,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,6,UNIVERSE ACADEMIC PRESS TORONTO,TORONTO,"1 SPADINA CRESCENT, ROOM 205, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 3G3, CANADA",,,978-1-926642-05-5,,,,2010,,,,,,,217,225,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BUE43,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000289010900033,0

While STAR led to large test score benefits during the intervention, these benefits quickly faded at its conclusion. However, research has recently shown that the STAR experiment led to long term benefits, including increases in college entrance exams participation (ACT/SAT), especially for minority students. We collect new follow up data on high school participation in extracurricular activities to examine whether (I) STAR increased participation in high school activities and (2) whether this increase in participation in high school is the explanation behind the long term benefits of the intervention. We find suggestive evidence that STAR did indeed increase some aspects of high school participation, including scholastic honors and participation in sports, especially for minority students. In contrast, we find little evidence that this increase in participation is the mechanism that has conferred higher rates of college-going to the STAR students. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper draws together all major research comprising eight studies that have used scenarios to describe possible futures for UK uplands. The paper evaluates which scenarios are perceived by stakeholders to be most likely and desirable, and assesses the benefits and drawbacks of the scenario methods used in UK uplands to date. Stakeholders agreed that the most desirable and likely scenario would be a continuation of hill farming (albeit at reduced levels) based on cross-compliance with environmental measures. The least desirable scenario is a withdrawal of government financial support for hill farming. Although this was deemed by stakeholders to be the least likely scenario, the loss of government support warrants close attention due to its potential implications for the local economy. Stakeholders noted that the environmental implications of this scenario are much less clear-cut. As such, there is an urgent need to understand the full implications of this scenario, so that upland stakeholders can adequately prepare, and policy-makers can better evaluate the likely implications of different policy options. The paper concludes that in future, upland scenario research needs to: (1) better integrate in-depth and representative participation from stakeholders during both scenario development and evaluation; and (2) make more effective use of visualisation techniques and simulation models.

It was hypothesised that employees with a higher perceived job security take more frequent sickness absence. Perceived higher job security is indicated by three variables, namely a permanent job contract, no unemployment history, and native ethnicity. The effect of perceived job security is expected to be stronger on short-term than on long-term sickness absence, since a medical certificate is required for the latter. Public health survey data from Stockholm County, Sweden, covering the year 2002 was used. Using logistic regression analyses separately for short- and long-term sickness absence and for females and males, we found that short-term sickness absence is more strongly influenced by perceived job security than long-term sickness absence. We observe indications of moral hazard in both female and male employees.

Rescue packages have been provided to sustain the significant market branch and asserted key driver of growth, export, innovation, and jobs particularly in the EU and the United States and to avoid further downward spirals, which risk affecting the national economies on a wider scale. Since such tendencies can have trade distorting effects, however, the question arises whether the increased governmental interventions are compatible with the World Trade Organization (WTO) legal framework, which arguably enshrines free trade theory in international law.

The exact nature of this institutional character, however, is generally not discussed in great detail. Our contribution draws on W. Richard Scott's synthetic reconstruction of the many approaches to institutional analysis, aiming to elucidate what an institutional perspective on interdisciplinarity would entail. Without knowledge from several academic disciplines, important problems in contemporary society cannot be solved. Consequently, the quest for interdisciplinary is gaining support among many scientists and funding agencies. In this article,we argue that even if we can understand the ambitions of interdisciplinarity, we also need to be aware of the barriers involved. Interdisciplinary approaches to framing and solving problems will almost inevitably stumble into barriers that are of a structural, cultural and a cognitive nature and problems related to disciplines as social institutions. The question to be discussed is if and how these barriers can be overcome. We claim that it is the structural barriers that are the easiest ones to address, whereas the cultural barriers are more difficult to overcome because they require more than a regulatory fix.

The sample covers 26,000 observations of Estonian companies from 1995 to 2004. The results show that the DPT system has led companies to pay less in dividends and retain more profits. Simultaneously, the importance of external financing in companies' total capital has decreased. The undistributed profits appear to be partially retained as surplus cash, instead of being reinvested into long-term productive assets. DPT seems to support companies' liquidity and sustainability; however, the allocation of funds is potentially inefficient.","Tallinn Univ Technol, Dept Econ, Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,"Hazak, A (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, Dept Econ, Tallinn, Estonia.",aaro.hazak@ee.pwc.com,"Hazak, Aaro/AAA-9502-2020","Hazak, Aaro/0000-0003-2897-0554",,,,,18,8,8,2,9,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Extending the existing model of the life expectancy production function, and correcting for spatial dependence, we evaluated the determinants of life expectancy using county level data. Results indicate that after controlling for socio-demographic and economic factors, medical facilities and risk factors, counties with natural amenities such as high proportion of land in forests, farmland, rangeland and water bodies, as well as mild climate such as longer sunlight hours during winter and cooler year around temperature exhibited longer life expectancies at birth. In addition, counties containing state parks and outdoor recreation facilities, and those located near federal wilderness parks were associated with the longer expectancies at birth. Findings from this study have several implications for natural resource economics and management, public health, and human development. An important message of our findings is that the traditional approach of public health should be extended beyond just controlling diseases or treating patients to a more comprehensive approach that also acknowledges the preservation and utilization of natural resources, environmental amenities. and outdoor recreation opportunities in maintaining public health, quality of life, and overall human development.

After confirming the skill complementarity of technology and the predominantly skill-replacing character of investment, the analysis turns to sectoral changes in skilled-labour demand as a possible determinant of income inequality. It finds a non-linear relationship between SB TC and inequality in five of the eight sectors considered, suggesting an inverted U-shaped pattern that can be explained by stages in labour demand and supply adjustments over time.","[Perugini, Cristiano; Pompei, Fabrizio] Univ Perugia, Dept Econ Finance & Stat, I-06100 Perugia, Italy",University of Perugia,"Perugini, C (通讯作者)，Univ Perugia, Dept Econ Finance & Stat, I-06100 Perugia, Italy.",perugini@unipg.it; fpompei@unipg.it,"Pompei, Fabrizio/AAM-2441-2020; Perugini, Cristiano/AAH-5782-2021","Pompei, Fabrizio/0000-0002-3867-8904;",,,,,68,8,8,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-7780,1564-913X,,INT LABOUR REV,Int.

While the market equilibrium depends only on current levels of antibiotic efficacy and infection of the epidemiological system, the social optimum accounts for the dynamic externalities which relate those levels to the intertemporal use being made of the antibiotic. We show that depending on the parameters of the model, in particular the cost of production and the improvement in the recovery rate that results from antibiotic treatment, the positive steady-state level of antibiotic efficacy to which the system tends under open access can be lower or higher than the level which should prevail in the socially optimal steady state. In fact there are parameter configurations for which the steady states can be exactly the same. However, the paths leading to the steady state always differ. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Arguing that multiculturalist approaches to knowledge are inadequate because knowledge cannot be based solely on consensus within a community, the article explores ways in which indigenous knowledges might be evaluated in relation to science. Using the example of a Palikur(Amapa, Brazil) narrative of an astronomical seasonal cycle, the author draws on current thinking in the field of epistemology to describe ways in which these specific cognitive practices are compatible with those in the sciences, while the moral economy in terms of which the narrative makes sense offers a way of understanding an alternative socio-cultural basis for framing rationality. One of the futures of indigenous knowledge', it is argued, is that in breaking down the duality in which it is strong in relation to the sciences, there is the possibility of broadening the range of acceptable epistemic practices, and admitting alternative moral economies into the sciences.

This paper argues that there is another facet to linking farmers to markets which is just as important in explaining the outcome of a trading relationship: the nature of the business-to-business relationship between stakeholders in the supply chain created. This paper synthesizes research findings on supply chain arrangements and mechanisms in business-to-business relationships encountered in supply chains distributing fresh vegetables to Ho Chi Minh City. Eleven months were spent in the field from July 2003 to May 2004 to conduct in-depth interviews with stakeholders in the chain. The links between important elements of good supply chain management practice and performance are illustrated by concrete examples from in-depth case studies. The positive impacts on performance of the following elements of business-to-business relationships are reviewed: commitment, coordination and joint planning, market orientation and information sharing, frequency of communication, and innovation. The results show that parallel vegetable supply chains differ in their structure and in the existence or lack of formal links (contracts) between business partners. However, the five elements of good supply chain management practice which are reviewed can be identified to varying degrees in all supply chains as strategies to achieve higher levels of performance. This research uncovers the existence of several hybrid forms of economic organization in the vegetable industry, thus highlighting the importance of characterizing the type of business-to-business relationship which evolves between supply chain stakeholders when attempting to link farmers to markets.","[Cadilhon, J. -J.] FAO Reg Off Asia & Pacific, Bangkok, Thailand",Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),"Cadilhon, JJ (通讯作者)，FAO Reg Off Asia & Pacific, Bangkok, Thailand.",,,"Poole, Nigel/0000-0002-2157-7883; Moustier, Paule/0000-0003-2916-6496",,,,,36,1,1,0,9,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-6605-721-0,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,809.0,,,,,,135,146,,,,,,12,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAR76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305323300011,0

The legal analysis comments on the analysis of evidence, the lack of remand authority in the WTO system, and the meaning of a 'direct transfer of funds'. The economic analysis discusses several issues related to determining the magnitude of the benefit to a firm of a financial bailout and the appropriate duration of a countervailing duty to offset the injury caused by a non-recurrent subsidy. We offer legal and economic criticisms of the Appellate Body's conclusion regarding the relationship between subsidies and injury to the domestic import-competing industry. We conclude that the Appellate Body's decision weakens the requirement of a causal link between subsidies and injury and, consequently, may open the door to protectionist abuse of the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Agreement.","[Crowley, Meredith A.] Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL 60604 USA; [Palmeter, David] Sidley Austin LLP, Washington, DC USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago,"Crowley, MA (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, 230 S LaSalle St, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",Crowley.meredith@gmail.com,,"Crowley, Meredith A./0000-0003-2864-4580",,,,,8,8,8,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JAN,2009,8.0,1,,,,,259,272,,10.1017/S1474745608004175,0.0,,,14,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,426GN,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000264696100015,0

Initial efforts to study the effect of different nitrogen levels and crop geometry on growth, yield and quality of baby corn have been undertaken at Deemed University, Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, India. Plant spacings of 50x15 cm and 120 kg N/ha were found to give the highest yield (51.48 q/ha). The maximum net profit of Rs 144,900 with a B: C ratio of 11.32 was also obtained from this treatment. As much of the Indian population are vegetarian, baby corn provides more nutrition per 100 g compared to other vegetable crops such as cauliflower, cabbage and tomato. It was found to contain 89.1% moisture, 0.20 g fat, 1.9 g protein, 8.2 mg carbohydrate, 0.06 g ash, 28.0 mg calcium, 86.0 mg phosphorus and 11.0 mg of ascorbic acid. It is concluded that this crop can provide more nutrition per unit area for marginal and small farmers at a more affordable cost compared to other conventional long duration crops.

Although some information is available, a phytosanitary evaluation method taking into account the different biotic and abiotic factors affecting yield and fruit quality within a citrus grove has not been developed yet. The method (MEF) presented here is based on field surveys of citrus commercial plots performed close to harvest time. Diagnosis and quantification of yield losses are obtained through field inspection and estimation of the productive units assigned to each sampled tree. Trees are also surveyed for fruit quality by sampling from the 12 different sections that the tree canopy is divided into. Every sampled fruit is categorized according to Commercial Grading Standards and identifying the main causal agent affecting its grade. Data obtained from both yield and fruit quality samplings together with updated market prices for the different Commercial grades are then processed through algorithms and using Excel from Microsoft. In this way, relative incidences of both physical and economic losses due to main biotic and abiotic factors found to be affecting fruit yield and quality were able to be estimated. Since the method also provides information about the spatial distribution of different pests and diseases within the plot, it can be considered suitable to be used as a basic tool in precision fruit production.","[Garran, S.

Decreasing harvest cost by implementing mechanical harvest with increased fruit removal efficiency without bruising the fruits is a promising way to increase the profit margin in olive production. However, to improve an available canopy shake-and-catch harvester to mitigate fruit injury, we first evaluated and quantified the contribution of individual machine components, such as the shaker head, the catching frame, conveyors and the bin, in causing fruit injury. In October 2006, experimental data were acquired with the harvester provided by Dave Smith Enterprises (DSE) while working on 21 Manzanillo cultivars at the University of California Davis experimental station in Lindcove, CA. Dynamic measurements of displacement, velocity and acceleration were obtained for fruit, branches and shaker rods by applying available three-dimensional video analysis software to the stereo high speed video images recorded at 500 fps in the field. Several design improvement suggestions were created based on the results of the analysis and the improved understanding of fruit detachment and injury causes. These suggestions were implemented by DSE during the 2006-2007 off season, which included appropriate angle of attack of the shaker drums to produce vertical force components to facilitate fruit detachment and padding of head rods and catching frame. Trials were conducted during the 2007 season in approximately two hectares of three different orchards to evaluate the prescribed design modifications and machine performance. Complete analysis of fruit injury, machine performance and component contributions to fruit injury are available and will be reported.

In the case where the two time series are cointegrated, classical Granger causality test could reveal distorted results. Consequently, it can be used an adjusted Granger test based on cointegration equation between the two variables. The aim of this paper is to investigate the causal relationship between exports and imports of Romanian current account, according to the methodology of Engle and Granger.

J,"de Almeida, P; Silva, PD",,,,"de Almeida, Pedro; Silva, Pedro D.",,,Timing and future consequences of the peak of oil production,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Energy is fundamental for present societies. In particular, transportation systems depend on petroleum-based fuels whose production levels are unsustainable. The inevitability of a peak of oil production (Peak Oil) is a now an accepted concept, although its date is still not consensual. In this work we discuss the peak of oil production and analyze the problems it will create. As much as can be inferred at this moment, the impact of the Peak Oil will certainly be significant but can still range from relatively benign to almost catastrophic scenarios. As a direct effect of Peak Oil, the increase in energy prices will be concentrated on the liquid fuels and the transportation sector will be specially affected. We believe that the cheap, wide-scale air transport that our present societies take for granted will revert to a more expensive and restrictive model closer to the selective commercial air transport of the early jet age. In our opinion the present road transportation systems will suffer an important transition that includes a reduced incidence of long distance road cargo movements, partially replaced by increased railway transportation, and, in terms of people commuting, a significant increase of mass transit and electrical vehicles. During this phase of forced adaptation, some countries will face greater challenges than others. However, the future of overall mankind and of particular countries, regions, or any groupings of people, is not yet fixed: it depends on decisions that are being taken at the present moment and on decisions that will still be taken in the future. As such, predicting the impact of the Peak Oil is something that must be done through a continuously refined process of information collection and analysis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It contrasts a varieties of capitalism perspective, which views business as a protagonist, or at the very least a consenter, in the development of job security regulations, with a conflict-oriented perspective, which has the labour movement as the protagonist and business as an antagonist in the development of job security regulations. The empirical analysis is based on primary and secondary sources and shows that German employers have never favoured strict over flexible job security regulations. Quite the contrary, high levels of job security regulations were forced upon employers during periods of business weakness by a radicalized labour movement in the aftermath of both World Wars.","[Emmenegger, Patrick] Univ So Denmark, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Management, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark; [Marx, Paul] Univ Cologne, D-53072 Bonn, Germany; [Marx, Paul] Inst Study Labor IZA, D-53072 Bonn, Germany",University of Southern Denmark; University of Cologne; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Emmenegger, P (通讯作者)，Univ So Denmark, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Management, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark.",emm@sam.sdu.dk,,"Marx, Paul/0000-0003-4310-9228",,,,,94,29,31,1,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Such an adjustment might be permissible if energy taxes as indirect taxes are applied on inputs during the production process. Compliance with the Most Favoured Nation principle has less practical importance than the not-yet settled likeness discussion under the National Treatment principle. Consequently, since the compatibility of carbon-related border tax adjustment measures is partly contested, potential justifications such as the conservation of exhaustible national resources or the protection of health (Art. XX GATT) become relevant. The application of the necessity and proportionality test requires that carbon measures are tailored so as to substantially contribute to the achievement of environmental objectives and do not create any arbitrary or unjustified discrimination.","[Kaufmann, Christine; Weber, Rolf H.] Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Kaufmann, C (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",christine.kaufmann@rwi.uzh.ch; rolf.weber@rwi.uzh.ch,,,,,,,76,28,29,0,26,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2011,10.0,4,,,,,497,525,,10.1017/S1474745611000292,0.0,,,29,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,848DD,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000297028300004,0

Why this is the case was unclear. This paper focuses on one important potential explanation: I examine whether ethnic majority teachers grade minority and majority students differently for the same work. Using an experiment, I show that such a direct grading bias does not occur. I do find indirect evidence for alternative explanations: teachers report lower expectations and unfavorable attitudes that both likely affect their behavior towards minority students, potentially inducing them to perform below their ability level. Effects of having ethnic majority teachers on minority students' grades hence seem more likely to be indirect than direct. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Bell, it is argued, uses theoretical paradigms of the social sciences to analyze how ideas from the enlightenment of the eighteenth century, to wit the process of spreading equality (writ large), and egalitarianism, can be effectuated in the new and small nation-states of the West Indies. It is argued, that this mode of inquiry was indeed the early beginning of, and laid the foundations for, Bell's futurist studies and pursuits currently, and, that by examining the findings, it can be seen if they are now borne out for these countries and, if not, the prospects for any recovery in the future. Finally, the author contends that, although the Democratic Revolution has been somewhat stymied, the earlier thrust for, and focus on, increased education has had the unintended effect of motivating fleeing migratory nationals and their progeny, to seek and demonstrate their equality through education in the core host democracies.

Our aim is to estimate the economic burden to the health service of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in patients with hypertension and its consequences, in three European countries in 2008, and to forecast future economic burden in 2020 using projected demographic estimates and assumptions around the growth of MetS. An age-, sex- and risk group-structured prevalence-based cost of illness model was developed using the United States Adult Treatment Panel III of the National Cholesterol Education Program criteria to define MetS. Data sources included published information and public use databases on disease prevalence, incidence of cardiovascular events, prevalence of type 2 diabetes, treatment patterns and cost of management in Germany, Spain and Italy. The economic burden to the health service of MetS in patients with hypertension has been estimated at 24,427 a,not sign, 1,900 a,not sign and 4,877 a,not sign million in Germany, Spain and Italy, and is forecast to rise by 59, 179 and 157%, respectively, by 2020. The largest components of costs included the management of prevalent type 2 diabetes and incident cardiovascular events. Mean annual costs per hypertensive patient were around three-fold higher in subjects with MetS compared to those without and rose incrementally with the additional number of MetS components present.

In addition, we control for a wide set of covariates including student ant family characteristics and entrance exam scores.

However, the standard working assumption in the economics of education is that parents choose schools on the basis of test-score performance, and concerns about child happiness are largely ignored. In this paper, we address this omission and investigate to what extent parents' and children's views of their school are linked to test-score based performance, and to what extent parents' judgements of school quality are linked to their child's happiness. To do so, we use information on stated attitudes from the Longitudinal Survey of Young People in England (LSYPE) matched to administrative records on pupil achievements in England. Our results suggest that test-score based measures of school quality tend to dominate parental satisfaction with the learning environment. However, school quality along this dimension is not strongly associated with pupil happiness and wellbeing at school. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Our assessment is built on the analysis of three different data sets, namely: 1) the Swedish National Forest Inventory (NFI), 2) the Swedish Database for Forest Owner Analysis, presenting data on small-scale forestry practices and certification, and 3) a follow-up mail survey addressed to private small-scale forest owners with certified forest properties. Our NFI analysis indicated some minor improvements in forest conditions, corresponding with the interim target for enhanced biological diversity (dead wood, broad-leaved trees and old forests). The improvements were less evident on large-scale forest properties (certified in accordance with the Forest Stewardship Council scheme) than on small-scale private forest properties (mainly certified in accordance with the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes). This contradicts a common assumption that a much higher degree of certification with stricter environmental standards will give more evident positive impacts on environmental conditions. However, results from the follow-up survey showed that more harvesting activity had taken place on certified small-scale forest properties than on non-certified properties. This could mean more negative effects on biodiversity. We conclude by stressing the importance of improving quantitative methods for determining a cause-and-effect relationship between certification and nature protection: previous research tends to report rather far-reaching conclusions based on limited data sets.

As such markets increase in scope, potential market participants might sell multiple environmental services. The question we consider here is whether participants in such markets should be allowed to sell credits in more than one market simultaneously. Some have argued in favor of such double-dipping, because it would make the provision of environmental services more profitable. In practice however, most programs do not allow double-dipping. We show that if the optimal level of pollution abatement is sought, then double-dipping maximizes societal net benefits. However, if pollution policies are set in a piecemeal fashion, then the caps for each market are unlikely to be optimal and, in this second-best setting, a policy prohibiting double-dipping can lead to greater social net benefits. We explore conditions under which a single-market policy is preferred, or equivalently, where piecemeal policies are likely to yield particularly inefficient outcomes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Addressing potential biases by using a difference-in-difference approach, I find that the test score gap is larger in classes where everybody gets homework than in classes where nobody gets homework. More precisely pupils belonging to the upper part of the socioeconomic scale perform better when homework is given, whereas pupils from the lowest part are unaffected. At the same time more disadvantaged children get less help from their parents with their homework. Homework can therefore amplify existing inequalities through complementarities with home inputs.

We consider that the outcomes of different studies are influenced by the fact that the periods when the currencies were overvalued or undervalued alternated. Therefore, the level of the constructed equilibrium exchange rate might be biased by the choice of the base period. To demonstrate this, we have calculated the real exchange rate based on the PPP thew), and we have applied a rolling window approach. Afterwards, we have used a behavioral equilibrium exchange rate (BEER) for a panel of data corresponding to the eight CEECs, candidates to EMU. Our results show that in Latvia and Romania, the nominal exchange rate seems undervalued in comparison with the equilibrium exchange rate, while for the Czech Republic the exchange rate appears as overvalued.","[Albulescu, Claudiu Tiberiu] Politehn Univ Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania; [Goyeau, Daniel] Univ Poitiers, Poitiers, France",Polytechnic University of Timisoara; Universite de Poitiers,"Albulescu, CT (通讯作者)，Politehn Univ Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania.",,"ALBULESCU, Claudiu Tiberiu/AAI-7850-2020","ALBULESCU, Claudiu Tiberiu/0000-0003-2875-1749",,,,,24,0,0,0,0,"ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA UNIV IASI, FACULTY ECONOMICS & BUSINESS ADMINSTRATION",IASI,"22 CAROL 1ST BLVD, IASI, 700505, ROMANIA",,,978-973-640-658-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,271,+,,,,,,3,Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BZM22,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000302002900043,0

The Appellate Body found that the United States had not brought its anti-dumping measures into compliance with the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement as it continued to use zeroing in annual reviews of anti-dumping orders. We argue that this conclusion based on a complicated discussion of what constitutes a 'measure taken to comply' - could have been reached through a much simpler and direct argument. Continued noncompliance by the United States generates costs to traders targeting the United States and the trading system more generally. We argue that from a broader WTO compliance perspective consideration should be given to stronger multilateral surveillance of anti-dumping practice by all WTO members and to more analysis and effective communication by economists regarding the costs of zeroing and anti-dumping practices more generally.","[Hoekman, Bernard] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Hoekman, Bernard] CEPR, Washington, DC USA",The World Bank; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Hoekman, B (通讯作者)，World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",Bhoekman@worldbank.org; jaspermartijnwauters325@gmail.com,,,,,,,14,10,10,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JAN,2011,10.0,1,,,SI,,5,43,,10.1017/S1474745610000467,0.0,,,39,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,759XU,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290283700003,0

But, the existing model of fiscal decentralisation in Croatia is not effective because is still facing numerous problems in carrying out the decentralisation process, that are visible in too many local units, non-existing measures for fortifying its fiscal capacities, relatively low autonomy in local units decision making process, etc. This paper focuses on problems of fiscal federalism and decentralisation in Croatia. Authors explore the possibility of implementing a new model of fiscal decentralisation which would ensure more efficiency, higher level of decentralisation, geographical division designed according to citizens' needs, better fiscal independence of local units, and higher level of public officials' competence. All of that would surely improve the quality of public goods' provision and would additionally increase the responsibility level of local deputies and citizens' participation.","[Krtalic, Sandra] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Dept Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula 52100, Croatia; [Borovcak, Barbara Skreblin] Istria Region, Adm Depai went Budget & Finances, PL-52100 Pula, Poland",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,,skrtalic@efpu.hr; barbara.skreblin-borovcak@istra-istria.hr,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,0,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

However, for this potential to be realised, these growers need ready and efficient access to markets. In the case of small-scale growers, this is particularly difficult. Barriers include size and scale of operation, as well as insufficient knowledge of grades and standards and related technical skills. Appropriate procurement and business models need to evolve to improve smallholder growers' access to markets. Within domestic markets in Zambia, initiatives have been developed to market agricultural products via producer marketing organisations (PMO) such as farmer cooperatives. The co-owned PMO model proposed in this study operates as a company limited by guarantee and has been extended to allow for co-ownership by actors closer to the end market as well as by smallholder growers. Such a PMO was established in 2007 with the aim of initially developing the Zambian export market for baby corn. The export crop was changed to avocados and potentially melons due to changes in global markets. The institutional arrangements for this PMO are intended to ensure that product and production process quality standards are met through the required certification, extension, finance and the provision of transparent market information. This paper discusses the evolution and implementation of this model from initial concept to current activities.","[Munyeche, N.; Story, S.; Baines, R. N.; Davies, W.

Specifically, the authors analyzed students' risk preferences associated with taking exams and earning a risky unknown grade versus not taking exams and instead obtaining a sure grade. Students have grade-choice decisions in nonhypothetical situations that impact their actual exam grades. Estimates indicate that the more risk-averse a student is, the more willing he or she is to accept a lower certain grade and not take an exam than to run the risk of actually taking it.

It will present results from an empirical study of innovation activity carried out during the spring/summer 2010 in the hotel sector in Croatia. Due to the problem of empirical measurement of innovation and the specific characteristics of hotel sector, the CIS IV39 questionnaire design was used and adapted for this purpose. CIS questionnaire has been criticized by scholars for its deficiencies in measuring innovation in services. Still, after an extensive literature and research review, it has been concluded that with the adaptations made, it is the best available tool for this purpose. The research preliminary results suggest that Croatian hotels can be portrayed as only moderately innovative and with different innovation activity according to innovation type and newness. Furthermore, parallels, where possible, are drawn to other similar research carried out in other countries (Spain and Austria) as to be able to benchmark the innovation activity of Croatian hotels.

Weak signals are identified from the early 20th century indicating the emergence of new knowledge patterns. These signals have strengthened in the last 40 years. The paper first identifies new ways of thinking within several disciplines such as science, philosophy, religion and education. New knowledge patterns are then identified in discourses that traverse disciplinary boundaries through transdisciplinary approaches such as futures studies and planetary/global studies. The paper then discusses evolution of consciousness, identifying research that theorises new ways of thinking as being related to individual psychological development and/or socio-cultural evolution. Finally, evolutionary concepts are discussed that attempt to meta-cohere the new knowledge patterns via the terms postforrnal, integral and planetary. Notably, academic research on futures of thinking, evolution of consciousness and/or global mindset change has been, until now, largely ignored by mainstream academic discourse on evolution, consciousness and futures studies.

J,"Robert, J; Lennert, M",,,,"Robert, Jacques; Lennert, Moritz",,,Two scenarios for Europe: Europe confronted with high energy prices or Europe after oil peaking,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"A significant change in trends regarding energy prices (in particular oil) has taken place in 2003 at the beginning of the Iraq War. It has revealed a very strong tension between oil prices on the one hand and the relationship between global oil supply and demand on the other. The strong growth rates of emerging economies up to 2008 have generated a very sharp increase in oil prices. The temporary economic recession of 2008-2009 has resulted in turn into a significant decrease of oil prices, down to a level which remained, however, twice as high as that of early 2003. With the economy recovering from the recession, it is highly probable that energy prices will continue to increase and that Europe will be confronted with high energy prices in the coming decades. Against this general background, two scenarios have been elaborated which differ mainly by the time of occurrence of oil peaking) The differences between the scenario hypotheses are therefore differences of context in relation to exogenous factors. Policies are also considered in the scenarios, but they are not at the forefront and their impact is considered as limited in relation to that of exogenous factors. The first scenario Europe in a context of high energy price assumes that the process of oil peaking will not take place before 2030, but that oil price increase will nevertheless be sustained and substantial until then. Numerous adjustments will have to be made in the economy and their territorial impacts will be significant (less polycentricity, more compact cities, decline of the importance of road and air transport). The second scenario Europe after oil production peaking assumes that oil production will peak around the mid-2010s (followed by gas production peaking around 2025), despite significant investments to increase production. In a context of steadily growing oil and gas demand, Europe will be confronted with serious economic difficulties. The territorial impacts will be different from those suggested by the first scenario, with stronger pressure put on rural areas and a loss of attractiveness of large cities related to increasing unemployment and social tensions. In both scenarios, the countries of central and eastern Europe will be more severely hit by the new energy context. The scenarios were elaborated in 2005 and slightly reviewed in 2009 in order to take account of the impacts of the economic recession in Europe and of the growing concerns about climate change.

Individuals work in the first period of life and live in retirement in old age. Health spending is an activity that increases quality of life and longevity. Empirical evidence shows that both health spending and saving behave as luxury goods but their behaviour differs markedly according to the level of per capita GDP. The share of saving on GDP has a concave shape with respect to per capita GDP, whereas the share of health spending on GDP increases more than proportionally with respect to per capita GDP. The ratio of saving to spending is nonlinear with respect to income, i.e. first increasing and then decreasing. This ratio, in the proposed model, is equal to the ratio between the elasticity of the utility function with respect to saving and the elasticity of the utility function with respect to health.","Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Studi Polit Diritto & Soc, Palermo, Italy",University of Palermo,"Fioroni, T (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Studi Polit Diritto & Soc, Palermo, Italy.",fioroni@ec.unipi.it,,"FIORONI, Tamara/0000-0003-4948-2517",,,,,26,7,8,1,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The consideration of complex sampling in the probit estimations led to empirical evidence that does not indicate the presence of adverse selection, but which highlighted some interesting features of the relationship between the selected variables.","[Resende, Marcelo] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, BR-22290240 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Zeidan, Rodrigo] UNIGRANRIO, Escola Ciencias Sociais Aplicadas, BR-20021180 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Universidade do Grande Rio,"Resende, M (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, Av Pasteur 250, BR-22290240 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",mresende@ie.ufrj.br,"Resende, Marcelo/AAF-6570-2020","Zeidan, Rodrigo/0000-0003-2980-3360",,,,,20,8,9,1,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Its conclusion would strengthen, symbolically and substantively, the WTO's valuable role in restraining protectionism. What is on the table would constrain the scope for tariff protection in all goods, ban agricultural export subsidies in the industrial countries and sharply reduce the scope for distorting domestic support - by 70% in the EU and 60% in the US. Average farm tariffs that exporters face would fall to 12% (from 14.5%) and the tariffs on exports of manufactures to less than 2.5% (from about 3%). There are also environmental benefits to be captured, in particular disciplining the use of subsidies that encourage over-fishing and lowering tariffs on technologies that can help mitigate global warming. An agreement to facilitate trade by cutting red tape will further expand trade opportunities. Greater market access for the least-developed countries will result from the 'duty free and quota free' proposal and their ability to take advantage of new opportunities will be enhanced by the Doha-related 'aid for trade' initiative. Finally, concluding Doha would create space for multilateral cooperation on critical policy matters that lie outside the Doha Agenda, most urgently the trade policy implications of climate change mitigation.","[Hoekman, Bernard; Martin, Will; Mattoo, Aaditya] World Bank, Washington, DC USA",The World Bank,"Hoekman, B (通讯作者)，World Bank, Washington, DC USA.",Bhoekman@worldbank.org; Wmartin1@worldbank.org; Amattoo@worldbank.org,,,,,,,60,15,15,0,24,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JUL,2010,9.0,3,,,,,505,530,,10.1017/S1474745610000297,0.0,,,26,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,629PC,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280211100004,0

Unfortunately, it is unclear how to discount distant-future events when the future discount rate itself is unknown. In previous work, an analytically-tractable approach called gamma discounting was proposed, which gave a declining discount rate schedule as a simple closed-form function of time. This paper extends the previous gamma approach by using a Ramsey optimal growth model, combined with uncertainty about future productivity, in order to risk adjust all probabilities by marginal utility weights. Some basic numerical examples are given, which suggest that the overall effect of risk-adjusted gamma discounting on lowering distant-future discount rates may be significant. The driving force is a fear factor from risk aversion to permanent productivity shocks representing catastrophic future states of the world. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Marketers are asked to develop scenarios about emerging technologies such as broadband wireless but more often than not have no education or training in scenario planning. Also marketers are often stuck in a strategic planning mindset based on successful replication of past marketing strategies. Strategic management and marketing learning has ventured into futures and foresight methodologies, but with strong focus on conventional macroscopic high-level scenario planning methods. This paper positions scenario planning as a method to express the future vision, both tacit and explicit, of business, products and services in a clear succinct story form, to underpin all elements of a marketing strategy (goals, position and execution). The scenario planning for marketing action (SPMA) model is introduced and discussed incorporating eight principles: moderation and time compression; storytelling led new product and service development; customer orientation; iterative dynamic scenarios; complexity science to foster non-linear thinking; risk weighted scenarios; participant hosted scenario workshops; springboard consolidation. The SPMA method was proven and evolved within postgraduate Executive education courses in Sydney and Bangkok from 2003 to 2007. This approach is fundamental for marketers to gain competences in learning the future faster, thus possessing capabilities to imagine and invent the future and deliver the future earlier.

While the reforms focussed heavily on increasing the inflow of private funds into the health care system, underlying inefficiencies contributing significantly to poor financial performance have been largely ignored. Furthermore, contrary to demographic trends and developments in social health insurance schemes in other countries, funding health care became even more dependent on its main collection mechanism-payroll tax-and consequently on the employment ratio and wage level. Little effort has been made to diversify the revenue base or to increase the efficiency of revenue collection. Like other countries, Croatia is facing difficulties in adjusting its 'Bismarck' system to its changing demographic and socioeconomic context. Instead of targetting a comprehensive effort at improving revenue collection and limitating unnecessary expenditure and system inefficiencies, simplified approaches to balance the budget have been implemented at a high price to users and with limited effect. As a result, the Croatian health insurance system now offers a lower level of financial protection, while still facing the problem of spending more than can be collected through the current mix of revenue collection mechanisms. The authors suggest that, in order to meet the sustainability requirement of the health financing system, measures affecting both revenue and expenditure should be considered and implemented. On the revenue collection side, the Croatian government must make further efforts to improve collection from the informally employed to broaden the base of contributing members; equally important is the diversification of revenue sources by increasing transfers from general taxation revenues. On the expenditure side, exploring inefficiencies of the delivery system can be delayed no longer, and the introduction of effective cost-control mechanisms and financial discipline would seem to be unavoidable.","[Voncina, Luka] Univ Maastricht, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Kehler, Jenni; Evetovits, Tamas] World Hlth Org, Div Country Hlth Syst, Reg Off Europe, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Bagat, Mario] Croatian Inst Hlth Insurance, Zagreb, Croatia",Maastricht University; World Health Organization,"Voncina, L (通讯作者)，Crvenog Kriza 9, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",lvoncina@gmail.com,,,,,,,20,7,7,1,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The multiresistant strains (MRSA) are resistant to most antibiotic prophylaxis regimens. Our aim was to explore whether there is a threshold of MRSA prevalence at which switching to routine glycopeptide-based antibiotic prophylaxis becomes cost-effective. Methods An indicative model was designed to explore the cost-effectiveness of vancomycin, cephalosporin or a combination, in patients undergoing primary hip arthroplasty. Results If the MRSA infection rate is equal to or above 0.25% and the rate of other infections with cephalosporin prophylaxis is equal to or above 0.2%, use of the combination antibiotic prophylaxis is optimal. Discussion Modelling the cost-effectiveness of interventions for MRSA prevention is complex due to uncertainty around resistance and effectiveness of glycopeptides. Conclusions The indicative model provides a framework for evaluation. More work is needed to understand the impact of antibiotic resistance over time in these currently effective antibiotics.","[Elliott, Rachel A.] Univ Nottingham, Div Social Res Med & Hlth, Sch Pharm, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Weatherly, Helen L.

Session Two at the 2005 WFSF World Conference in Budapest was titled 'Counting on Each Other', represented through the papers presented here and the group's discussion related by the author. The papers were grouped into four areas-Futures Studies and Methods; Values; Sustainable Development; and Rights and Ethics. After reading the issues which were raised, and the conclusions that were reached, the reader should appreciate the complexity of the topic. In particular, the difficulties faced by a group of people who wished to explore this topic, its related images of the future and the actions generated for the present is a microcosm of the difficulties faced in the wider world when trying to deal with these issues for the future.

This study aims to analyze the effects of export orientation and other characteristics that represent the industrial underpinnings of restructuring on gender wage inequality for 2001-5. There is consistent evidence of the negative impact of export orientation on men's and women's wages and the gender wage ratio, signifying that women lose in both absolute and relative terms. This result holds after controlling for women's share of employment and the skills of both genders, contrary to the expected effect from trade on equality. There is also a negative relation between a rise in the proportion of unskilled workers and the gender wage ratio, which suggests that the trade-induced skill hypothesis cannot be considered an adequate explanation for gender inequality.","[Dominguez-Villalobos, Lilia; Brown-Grossman, Flor] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Econ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Domínguez-Villalobos, L (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Econ, Ave Univ 3000, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",ldv@servidor.unam.mx; brown@servidor.unam.mx,,,,,,,42,12,21,1,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Our analysis demonstrated that optimum long-term profitability using a discount rate of 2% would be achieved at a biomass of 59% of initial biomass, which is higher than the target biomass of 50% incorporated into the current management strategy and at a reduction in effort of approximately 19%.

Along with administering such transfers, the IOs are considered to be important players who are able to affect national policy making. One of the key questions of the International Relations theory is how effective the IOs are in supporting the implementation of environmental policies through established environmental aid transfers. By applying a conceptual framework from International Relations theory, known as the '3C framework', the IOs effectiveness is evaluated by judging the extent to which institutions' performance boosts the 3Cs: (i) increase governmental concern; (ii) enhance contractual environment; and (iii) build national capacities.

That led to a significant percentage of indebted population that, in turn, had to resize and restructure consumption. This reduction in aggregate consumption that manifests both quantitatively and qualitatively is also reflected in fewer jobs, higher unemployment and reduced liquidity in the banking system. As a result, demand dynamics varies both quantitatively and structurally and companies are challenged to anticipate these changes. The main decision-making tools available to firms are: investments, prices of goods produced and output structure. By using these two categories of decision-making tools, companies can optimize various economic and financial objectives (firm's value maximization, profit maximization, market share maximization, etc). In order to model these aspects, a computer program was developed to test certain assumptions about different business decisions and their impact on firm's objectives. The simulation highlights the importance of decisions on company's business objectives on a discontinuous horizon held over several periods of time.","[Oprescu, Gheorghe; Paun, Mihai; Paun, Ramona] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Boscoianu, Mircea] Henry Coanda Acad, Brasov, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Henri Coanda Air Force Academy,"Oprescu, G (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",paun_miha@yahoo.com; msm2004m@yahoo.com,"Paun, Ramona/AAA-7889-2020; BOSCOIANU, Mircea/HKV-9799-2023; Boscoianu, Mircea/AAA-8654-2019; Paun, Ramona-Mihaela/K-6938-2014","BOSCOIANU, Mircea/0000-0003-2650-7144; Paun, Ramona/0000-0002-2731-665X",,,,,10,0,0,0,9,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

As the predator-prey modeling literature has shown, such linkages can substantially alter the outcomes of management strategies from those predicted by models naive to these linkages. In this article, we explore the implications of a linkage between fisheries due to an artificial predator-prey relationship: the use of one harvested species as an input to the harvest technology in another primary fishery whose biological productivity is also positively affected by ban consumption. These anthropogenic, technological, and biological linkages between the fisheries alter both the open-access and rent-maximizing equilibria of the primary. fishery. Furthermore, shifts in economic, technological, or biological parameters of either fishery can have significantly different impacts on the bioeconomic equilibria than those predicted by a traditional single-species model.","[Ryan, Richard W.] Fed Reserve Bank Boston, Boston, MA 02205 USA; [Holland, Daniel S.] Gulf Maine Res Inst, Portland, ME 04101 USA; [Herrera, Guillermo E.] Bowdoin Coll, Dept Econ, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Boston; Gulf of Maine Research Institute; Bowdoin College,"Ryan, RW (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Boston, POB 55882, Boston, MA 02205 USA.",richard.w.ryan@gmail.com; dan.holland@noaa.gov; gherrera@bowdoin.edu,,"Holland, Daniel/0000-0002-4493-859X",National Science Foundation [0709527]; Division Of Ocean Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences [1137367] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Ocean Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences [0709527] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Ocean Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Division Of Ocean Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"Funding for this research was provided by the National Science Foundation, Coupled Natural and Human Systems Program, Award #0709527.",,16,8,9,0,11,"MRE FOUNDATION, INC",KINGSTON,"PO BOX 1828, KINGSTON, RI 02881 USA",0738-1360,,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

The problem is complex and challenging for a number of reasons, including the high number and diversity of involved stakeholders as well as of roots causes, and the unclear trade-off among investments in lire prevention and fighting. Weak governance of these issues is a key driver of failures in forest fire management, with the related risks of social conflicts, economic losses and environmental damages. These topics are explored with reference to governance key-issues at national level in Italy, focusing on the problems related to the economic assessment of the costs of forest fire damage and the potential to carry out a stakeholder analysis based on the Advocacy Coalition Framework approach. The forest fires sector in Italy, as in other European countries, is characterized by groups of stakeholders with different attributes and utility functions. The expected coalitions and/or conflicts that might arise among these groups are briefly described. On the other side, the analysis of fire damage costs methodologies developed so far suggests that the most uncertain and debatable forest-related services to be evaluated in economic terms are biodiversity protection, soil erosion control and water cycle regulation.

The paper highlights, on the one hand, the difficulty experienced by the EU Member States in reaching agreement in both of these cases due to the very different national economic interests involved and, on the other, the impacts of these measures on the market. Both the textiles restrictions and the footwear anti-dumping actions were followed by reductions in the growth rates of China's exports to the EU. However, they were also followed by an increase in the exports of other low-cost developing country exporters. The key winners from these actions in trade terms seem to be other developing countries rather than EU domestic industry.","Toulouse Business Sch, Toulouse, France",Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; TBS Education,"Curran, L (通讯作者)，Toulouse Business Sch, Toulouse, France.",l.curran@esc-toulouse.fr,"邱, 延硕/IAR-7346-2023; Curran, Louise/AHE-2801-2022","curran, louise/0000-0001-9326-052X",,,,,38,10,10,0,23,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Most recreational fisheries are regulated with gear restrictions, bag limits, and time/area closures, but there is increasing interest in the market-based solutions employed in commercial fisheries - this despite the lack of an adequate bioeconomic theory of the joint commercial/recreational aspects of many recreational fisheries. This paper integrates a detailed production specification with traditional bioeconomic tools in order to better understand the implications of rationalization schemes targeted at the charter sector. While confirming some of the qualitative conclusions of the commercial fisheries literature on open access and regulated open access our model also generates rich and novel predictions with respect to input choices, the number of vessels and congestion externalities.

Emphasising both the characteristics that central and eastern European countries have in common, and ways in which they differ, the paper outlines broad changes in forestry policy and practice in the region. It then explores constructions of foresters' identity, role and legitimacy, and the influence of context on their status as experts. The paper focuses on Romania and Poland, drawing on extended interviews, field observation and documentary analysis. Because forestry is tied into histories of power and institutional culture as well as science and political rationalisation. the evolution of forestry knowledge offers insights for wider debates about 'expertise' as a socially constructed alternative to lay knowledge. Foresters acquire expertise, both as it is conferred upon them (by law and education), and through their own authority (gained through experience, and the acting out of an emotional commitment to the forest). Post-socialist forestry offers rich potential for extending our understanding of contingency and subjectivity within the wider projects of empire and modernity.

A prevalence-based approach was used to estimate direct medical costs, direct non-medical costs, and loss of labour productivity. The total costs of mental illness have been estimated at 7,019 million euros. Direct medical costs represented 39.6% of the total costs and 7.3% of total public healthcare expenditure in Spain. Informal care costs represented 17.7% of the total costs. Loss of labour productivity accounted for 42.7% of total costs.

In 1985, a typical international tourist to Scotland would have been be described as 'American, over-50 and interested in heritage', whereas today the typical tourist is 'European, under-35 and interested in culture'. The change can be explained within the context of global tourism trends, which provide an insightful explanation of this transformation. Looking to the future, the prospects up to 2025 are assessed in this paper, based upon future trends and UN WTO projections. Is that future to be based upon arrivals from North America, European or the Rest of the World? Whatever the scenario, a strategy is presented that captures the essence of Scotland's international tourism expectations based upon key drivers and market prospects. In a highly competitive market, Scotland should focus on markets that it can win and that can contribute towards the industry's ambition to grow the economic value of tourism by 50% by the year 2015 through strong branding and a focused marketing proposition.

The first topic is a Treasury bill auction experiment in which students have an opportunity to participate directly. The results from a class of 14 money and banking students are used to explain how an instructor might conduct such an experiment in the classroom. Relatively simple algebraic models are also developed for 2 types of stock market transactions: short selling and margin buying. Three analytical exercises are presented with complete solutions to demonstrate how an instructor might assign related problems for students. These experiments and models give students a lasting understanding of a number of rarely discussed topics in money and banking courses.,"[Saros, Daniel E.] Valparaiso Univ, Valparaiso, IN 46383 USA",Valparaiso University,"Saros, DE (通讯作者)，Valparaiso Univ, Valparaiso, IN 46383 USA.",dan.saros@valpo.edu,,,,,,,6,2,2,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0485,2152-4068,,J ECON EDUC,J.

The EU was unable to participate effectively in a succession of International Sugar Agreements but was able to shrug off criticisms in GATT Initially, the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture had little impact on EU sugar policy; but an adverse Dispute Settlement ruling, and the opening oldie EU market through the Everything but Arms initiative, changed the international policy context and led to policy reform.","Univ Reading, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Swinbank, A (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England.",A.Swinbank@reading.ac.uk,,,,,,,27,1,1,0,10,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

A tournament model is presented, where teachers compete for promotion to administrators. Districts can create incentives for teachers by offering either a higher pay premium for promotion or a larger probability of promotion. The model predicts an inverse relationship between these two values. Evidence supporting this prediction is found in the data, In contrast, an alternative model of incentive pay, where returns to seniority substitute for imperfect monitoring, is not supported empirically. This result is consistent with intuition that tenure protections make it hard for districts to fire shirking teachers, making returns to seniority a poor method of providing incentives.

A profound approach is given to the measurement of debts instruments and options, very important to a market risk manager. For debt instruments their main characteristics are detailed: maturity, issuer credit ratings, payment structure and currency. For options the evaluation concerns their type, examples of options, time of expiration and their risk measurement by Greeks methods.

The proposed model permits the determination of a relative evolution over time of the size of the shadow economy, which requires the calibration of the model with an exogenous estimation in order to obtain real values. The exogenous estimation is obtained by a monetary method based on a money demand function. The results show that the size of shadow economy measures between 8-11% of GDP in the period 1980-2008, and demonstrate that the shadow economy is significantly influenced by the tax burden and its components (direct tax, indirect tax and social contributions).","[Dobre, Ion; Alexandru, Adriana] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dobre, I (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",,"Alexandru, Adriana AnaMaria/D-2755-2015","Davidescu, Adriana AnaMaria/0000-0002-9847-1200",,,,,23,7,7,0,16,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Several years ago, the Philippine government established cold chain facilities and tramline systems for farmers who expressed the need for such technologies. Modern technologies have impacted both positively and negatively on the socio-economic conditions of farmers. The paper highlights the short-term effects and the possible long-term impacts arising from the introduction and adoption of the cold chain and agricultural tramline systems. The short-term effects of the tramline system on the Western Poblacion Farmers Association include: a) easing the drudgery of manually hauling vegetables to the roadside, b) more time to devote to other farm activities, c) faster delivery of produce to market, d) a more active social organization resulting in greater cohesiveness and camaraderie, and e) a lower hauling cost. A technical and socio-economic evaluation of the mono-cable tramline revealed a host of socio-economic variables were influenced by the use of the tramline including: a reduction in the number of haulers; lower cost of hauling production inputs, and increased use of fertilizer. On the other hand, the cold chain system required farmers to adopt new cropping patterns; more precise and systematic growing of vegetables to meet high-end market requirements; consolidation of produce to meet the quantity requirements of the market; and capacity building to cope with the nuances of using cold chain facilities.","CLSU, Bur Postharvest Res & Extens, Sci City Of Munoz, Nueva Ecija, Philippines",,"Estigoy, RP (通讯作者)，CLSU, Bur Postharvest Res & Extens, Sci City Of Munoz, Nueva Ecija, Philippines.",,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-6605-721-0,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,809.0,,,,,,167,170,,,,,,4,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAR76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305323300015,0

The description is followed by a discussion of the opportunities and constraints of improved non-seed vegetable production technologies. Sowing of seeds and seedling emergence, transplant production, irrigation, mulching, fertiliser use, crop protection and weed control methods, protected cultivation and harvest date planning are discussed in relation to their use and impact. Conditions for successful introduction of new technologies and the role of outside actors are discussed. It is argued that in order to increase the success of adoption of improved technologies, farmers and public and private institutions should work together. With increasing prosperity, the demand for vegetables, especially in the expanding urban areas, will increase, leading to the intensification of production and higher profitability. With better profitability, the application of mulch, drip irrigation, fertigation and protected cultivation will become more common. With increasing production, harvest date planning as related to year-round city market demand, will become essential to improve profitability. It is recommended that, next to the development and introduction of improved production technologies, research and extension on vegetables in tropical Asia, should also focus on methods to improve harvest date planning and year-round supply.","[Everaarts, A.

This paper quantifies four value chains of the highly valuable agarwood sourced in Lao People's Democratic Republic, by looking at the actors involved and the different stages from harvesting to retail, and incorporates both legal and illegal activities. Data were collected in a national harvest and trade study, an international market survey of Arab markets, and by interviews with key informants. The results show a huge global retail value estimated between USD 666 and 2300 million, of which Lao agarwood accounts for about 2%, i.e.. USD 33 million. The export value to Laos is estimated at approx. USD 14 million, with a quantity of wood and wood-equivalents of 931 t. Patterns and domains of value-addition and -appropriation are discussed along with responses in the value chain to over-harvesting and signs of resource scarcity. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

As part of this project a quantitative research study concerning the perception of health information has been carried out in households in Fulda-Sudend and Kohlhaus, Germany. Therefore a questionnaire with 40 questions was developed by the seven international partners. The national health system and the media for health information in each country had been analysed before. The survey was done in spring/summer of 2008. Thus 195 individuals were asked for sources of health information, health, attitudes and behaviour, competencies, consumption of food, living and wishes for health in the community - on the condition that about 50% had to be vulnerable groups like migrants, elder people and families with children. Especially, they were asked for the knowledge about the campaign 5 a day. 186 questionnaires could be analysed. The results show that the perception of health information was influenced by age, gender, migration background and the status of health. Doctors are the most important source for health information. The campaign 5 a day was rather unknown in the various groups. Health information in the media like internet or brochures do not reach most of the groups, except the younger people. The results will allow conclusions to the perception of official health information in these communities. On the basis of these results the hypothesis were generated, and proposals were suggested for interventions in these communities in winter and spring 2008/2009.","[Leyer, Freytag Barbara; Zimmerer, Silvia; Klotter, Christoph; Hampshire, Joerg] Univ Appl Sci Fulda, Dept Oecotrophol, Fulda, Germany",,,,,,,,,,3,1,1,0,1,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-9937-2-0,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2009,,19,,,,,91,96,,,,,,6,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BUR80,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290182700011,0

We can use portals in decision making in two ways. One way is by enabling managers to access the data they require by using the portal's interface.

Why exactly welfare states fit into this three-regime typology remains controversial, however. This article presents an argument which provides the three-regime heuristic with a historical foundation. The argument combines insights into the importance of electoral rules for the representation of socioeconomic interests (of the lower and middle classes) with insights about the different cleavage structures which left their imprint on the party systems of Western Europe. This article's central claim is that a majoritarian electoral system leads to a residual-liberal welfare state, whereas in countries with proportional representation, either a red-green coalition between Social Democracy and agrarian parties (Scandinavia) or a red-black coalition between Social Democracy and Christian Democracy (on the European continent) was responsible for the build-up of the Nordic and continental welfare state, respectively.","Univ Konstanz, Dept Polit & Adm, D-78464 Constance, Germany",University of Konstanz,"Manow, P (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Dept Polit & Adm, D-78464 Constance, Germany.",philip.manow@uni-konstanz.de,,"Manow, Philip/0000-0002-7154-7789",,,,,34,56,68,1,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

This study investigates the degree of market integration between fresh farmed tilapia fillets and fresh fillets of farmed catfish, wild sea dab, wild blackback flounder, and wild whole fresh red snapper in the US market. The literature suggests farmed and wild fish of alternative species do not compete. However this may be changing as new farmed species are introduced to new markets. The results indicate no relationship between prices of fresh tilapia and catfish. Hence, there is no evidence that fresh tilapia fillets compete in the same market as catfish fillets. Conversely, fresh farmed tilapia fillets compete with wild whole red snapper wild fresh fillets of sea dab, and blackback flounder. The implications are important for managing these overexploited wild fish species, as prices will most likely decline with increased imports of fresh tilapia fillets. This could lead to lower investments in fishing fleets and a reduction in fishing effort over time.","CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Climate Adaptat Natl Res Flagship, Cleveland, Qld 4163, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Norman-López, A (通讯作者)，CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Climate Adaptat Natl Res Flagship, 233 Middle St, Cleveland, Qld 4163, Australia.",ana.norman@csiro.au,"Norman, Ana/K-4501-2012","Norman, Ana/0000-0002-3193-0951",World Fish Centre; Norwegian Research Council,World Fish Centre; Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"The author acknowledges the financial support of the World Fish Centre and the Norwegian Research Council and also thanks an anonymous reviewer, Trend Bjomdal, Rachel Harm, and James Innes for their helpful comments.

Physiologically related morphological and spectral responses of Valencia citrus trees are simulated in a realistic virtual orchard with explicit canopy geometry. The modeling of plausible tree geometries, orchard layout and leaf, stem, and soil spectra (400-2500 nm) are outlined. A reference orchard was set up and calibrated using measurements of spectra and canopy structure and orchard layout. Physiological changes are simulated in scenarios and compared to a reference situation. These include the effects of citrus and weed leaf chlorosis, changes in leaf area, bending of leaves, leaf curl, and crop load.

In June 2006, the Turkish government, in an effort to curtail costs, removed many prescription drugs from the reimbursement list. This paper examines the effect of this policy on the expenditures for drugs that were removed from the reimbursement list and for their reimbursable alternatives that can be prescribed by physicians on patient request. To accomplish these goals, actual expenditures in four anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) groups were compared with expected expenditures in the absence of policy change for both removed and alternative drugs. The findings indicated that the expenditures on alternative drugs beyond expectations. In two of the four ATC groups involved in the study, the increase was large enough to wipe out the reduction in expenditures on the drugs removed from the reimbursement list.","[Ali, Ozden Gur; Topaler, Basak] Koc Univ Coll Adm Sci & Econ, Istanbul, Turkey",Koc University,"Ali, ÖG (通讯作者)，Koc Univ Coll Adm Sci & Econ, CAS 241, Istanbul, Turkey.",oali@ku.edu.tr,"Ali, Ozden F Gur/B-3364-2013; TOPALER, BAŞAK/AGT-7633-2022; Ali, Ozden F Gur/IZE-4415-2023; TOPALER, BAŞAK/O-7175-2017","Ali, Ozden F Gur/0000-0002-9409-4532; TOPALER, BAŞAK/0000-0002-4553-0131;",,,,,18,3,3,2,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We provide some compelling evidence on shareholder wealth effects of membership in voluntary environmental programs (VEPs). Companies announcing membership in EPA's Climate Leaders, a program targeting reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, experience significantly negative abnormal stock returns. The price decline is larger in firms with poor corporate governance structures, and for high market-to-book (i.e., high growth) firms. However, firms joining Ceres, a program involving more general environmental commitments, have insignificant announcement returns, as do portfolios of industry rivals. Overall, corporate commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions appear to conflict with firm value maximization. This has important implications for policies that rely on voluntary initiatives to address climate change. Further, we find that firms facing climate-related shareholder resolutions or firms with weak corporate governance standards - giving managers the discretion to make such voluntary environmentally responsible investment decisions - are more likely to join Climate Leaders; decisions that may result in lower firm value.

Frequently, energy futures such as predictions of the energy demand or energy scenarios are used for decision-support in this field. The diversity of energy futures, however, threatens any possibility for orientation, could lead to disorientation instead of helping more rational decision-making and could be used for ideological purpose. In this paper, we investigate concepts and approaches for scrutinizing, comparing and assessing the various energy futures from an epistemological point of view. Following the analysis of the structure of (energy) futures we will conclude that comparisons and assessments of energy futures should be made through processes of scrutiny and assessment, looking into the ingredients which have been used in constructing the respective futures, and into the process of their composition. Providing much more insight into the cognitive and normative structure of energy futures is required for allowing a more transparent and deliberative societal debate about future energy systems.

M.",,,Sustainability: The search for the integral worldview,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The sustainability problem is described as a process of recurrent destabilization of societal value orientations or worldviews. These worldviews represent both value orientations with respect to 'quality of life' and mental maps about the surrounding world. The many different worldviews which shape society appear to be part of an overall integral worldview which can be deduced from societal enquiries and from the experiences of history and philosophy over many centuries. This integral worldview is defined by the vertical contrast between idealism and materialism and the horizontal contrast between uniformity and diversity. Due to a number of societal and psychological centrifugal forces, worldviews become one-sided and finally end in fundamentalist value orientations which are synonym with overshoot, collapse and crisis. Examples are religious fundamentalism and related wars, communism, nazism, the ecological crisis as well as the recent financial crisis. The solution to these sustainability problems has to be found in the timely recognition and compensation of the destabilizing centrifugal forces. The resulting integral worldview is synonym with 'human dignity'. The thus defined time independent notion of human dignity defines a new ethical framework and solves the paradox between the needs of present and future generations in Brundtland's original definition of sustainable development.

This is probably a blessing for a number of reasons, including the success of the multilateral trading system in bringing tariffs down over the years (and the ensuing reduced trade diversion), the fact that modern PTAs deal with many non-trade issues as well (for which no WTO disciplines exist), and the recent empirical literature suggesting overall positive welfare implications for those participating in similar schemes. This paper discusses these and other reasons to support the view that the WTO should rather focus on the multilateral agenda instead of diverting its attention towards disciplining PTAs. In more concrete terms, this paper argues in support of the thesis that the Transparency Mechanism should not be simply a de facto substitute of the previous regime (where outlawing a PTA could not a priori be excluded), but the de jure new forum to discuss PTAs within the multilateral trading system, at least for the time being. A first do-no-harm-policy is one of the rationales for the thesis advocated here.","Columbia Law Sch, New York, NY USA",Columbia University,"Mavroidis, PC (通讯作者)，Columbia Law Sch, New York, NY USA.",pmavro@law.columbia.edu,,,,,,,37,23,24,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JUL,2011,10.0,3,,,,,375,387,,10.1017/S147474561100022X,0.0,,,13,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,783XB,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000292116700004,0

I address the question by examining the diffusion of modular production practices across 30 export processing zones in the Dominican Republic (DR) in the turbulent 1990s. I find that public officials responded to a series of external shocks by facilitating the transfer of modular methods to domestically owned factories in particular and conclude that organizational innovations are more likely to be co-produced by developing country firms and their governments in turbulent times than produced in isolation (or good times) by either. Finally, I corroborate my findings by exploring the negative case of Mexico, where the absence of government support has stymied the diffusion of modular manufacturing methods.","Univ New Mexico, Dept Polit Sci, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA",University of New Mexico,"Schrank, A (通讯作者)，Univ New Mexico, Dept Polit Sci, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",schrank@unm.edu,,,,,,,128,15,16,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Ideally, for use in health economics, QoL should be expressed in utilities. The aim of this study was to obtain reference values and utilities for QoL of GHD in adults in Belgium and the Netherlands. The study was conducted in three stages: (1) The Quality of Life-Assessment for Growth Hormone Deficiency in Adults (QoL-AGHDA) and the EQ-5D were administered in a representative sample of 6,875 individuals from the Belgian and 1,400 individuals from the general Dutch population. The EQ-5D(index) can be used to estimate utilities. Using a regression, utilities were predicted from the QoL-AGHDA. (2) QoL-AGHDA scores were obtained from 299 Belgian and 234 Dutch adult patients with GHD and no GH replacement. These scores were converted to utilities and compared the burden of disease with other patient groups. (3) To test the criterion validity, the 'standard' EQ-5D(index) was used in a subsample of 64 Dutch GHD patients and compared with the predicted utilities. We obtained data from 1,026 Belgian (response rate = 15%) and 1,038 Dutch respondents (response rate = 74%). The Belgian mean QoL-AGHDA value was 6.95 (90% range = 14.00), and the Dutch mean was 5.48 (range = 13.00). The R (2) of the regression model to predict the EQ-5D(index) was 0.360 (Belgium) and 0.482 (the Netherlands). We demonstrated a considerable burden of disease in GHD patients, comparable to patients with hypertension or with type II diabetes. The criterion validity was 0.407 (intraclass correlation, ICC). Interventions in GHD can now be evaluated more validly in Belgium and the Netherlands.","[Busschbach, J. J. V.] Erasmus MC, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Wolffenbuttel, B. H.

This paper combines information about teacher effectiveness with the economic impact of higher achievement. It begins with an overview of what is known about the relationship between teacher quality and student achievement. This provides the basis for consideration of the derived demand for teachers that comes from their impact on economic outcomes. Alternative valuation methods are based on the impact of increased achievement on individual earnings and on the impact of low teacher effectiveness on economic growth through aggregate achievement. A teacher one standard deviation above the mean effectiveness annually generates marginal gains of over $400,000 in present value of student future earnings with a class size of 20 and proportionately higher with larger class sizes. Alternatively, replacing the bottom 5-8 percent of teachers with average teachers could move the U.S. near the top of international math and science rankings with a present value of $100 trillion.

Some critical assumptions need to hold in order for this method to be valid. In this paper we analyse the assumption of vignette equivalence using data on health system responsiveness contained within the World Health Survey. We perform several tests to check the assumption of vignette equivalence. First, we use a test based on the global ordering of the vignettes. A minimal condition for the assumption of vignette equivalence to hold is that individual responses are consistent with the global ordering of vignettes. Secondly, using the hierarchical ordered probit model (HOPIT) model on the pool of countries, we undertake sensitivity analyses, stratifying countries according to the Inglehart-Welzel scale and the Human Development Index. The results of this analysis are robust, suggesting that the vignette equivalence assumption is not contradicted. Thirdly, we model the reporting behaviour of the respondents through a two-step regression procedure to evaluate whether the vignettes construct is perceived by respondents in different ways. Overall, across the analyses the results do not contradict the assumption of vignette equivalence and accordingly lend support to the use of the vignette methodology when analysing self-reported data and health system responsiveness.","[Rice, Nigel; Robone, Silvana; Smith, Peter] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Smith, Peter] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Business, London SW7 2AZ, England",University of York - UK; Imperial College London,"Robone, S (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Alcuin Block A, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",sr517@york.ac.uk,,"Smith, Peter/0000-0003-0058-7588",ESRC [ES/G020841/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G020841/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,31,41,48,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The paper addresses recent developments in Foresight theory and practice which allow for deploying a hybrid methodological framework where different approaches serve different purposes in specific phases in order to tailor Foresight to a wide range of different contexts and objectives. The paper can be characterised as empirically based theory building. The theoretical framework is elaborated by applying it in two R&I fields: (i) GM plants and (ii) Nanosciences and Nanotechnologies. Hence, this research is expected to contribute improving the strategic processes of priority setting in techno-institutional arenas both on the national and international level. In particular it is suggested that the capability of Foresight to function as a systemic innovation policy instrument for enhancing innovation and learning capability could be improved substantially by tailoring the Foresight approach to the targeted innovation arena.

In contrast to previous studies, we employ an integrated framework combining a multisector general equilibrium model with a stochastic dominance analysis using household-level data. We consider three policy instruments in a domestic emission trading system: (i) an output-based allocation (OBA) of permits; (ii) the use of the proceeds of permit sales to reduce payroll taxes (RPT); (iii) and the use of these proceeds to reduce consumption taxes instead (UCS). The general equilibrium results suggest that the return to capital is more negatively affected than the wage rate in all simulations, since polluting industries are capital intensive. Abstracting from pollution externalities, the dominance analysis suggests that all three policies have a normatively robust negative (positive) impact on welfare (poverty). Formal dominance tests indicate that RPT first-order welfare dominates OBA over all values of household incomes. UCS also first-order poverty dominates RPT for any choice of poverty line below $CAN 18,600, and poverty dominates for any poverty line (and thus welfare dominates) at the second order. Finally, while the three pollution control policies do not have a numerically large impact on inequality (in comparison to the base run), statistical tests indicate that inequality increases significantly more with OBA and RPT than with UCS.

The bounds testing approach of cointegration is employed to investigate this relation by using quarterly data for 1987-2008 period. The bounds F test for cointegration test yields evidence of a long-run relationship between stock market returns and inflation at 1% significance level. The study also explores the causal relationship between these variables in terms of the three error-correction based Granger causality models. The empirical results are as follows: i) The estimated long-run coefficient of the inflation is about unity and positive. ii) Any deviation from the long-run equilibrium between stock market returns and inflation is corrected about 32% for each period. There is a strong evidence of unidirectional causality running from inflation to stock market returns. The overall results support the generalized Fisher hypothesis which implies that stocks offer a hedge against inflation.,"[Acaravci, Songul Kakilli; Acaravci, Ali] Mustafa Kemal Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Antakya, Turkey; [Ozturk, Ilhan] Cag Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Mersin, Turkey",Mustafa Kemal University; Cag University - Turkey,"Acaravci, SK (通讯作者)，Mustafa Kemal Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Antakya, Turkey.",ilhanozturk@cag.edu.tr,"ACARAVCI, Ali/Q-5833-2019; Ozturk, Ilhan/B-9431-2009; Acaravci, Ali/G-2206-2016","Ozturk, Ilhan/0000-0002-6521-0901;",,,,,45,4,4,0,11,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Therefore, both the insured benefits for individuals as well as the policies for risk prevention are taken into account.

The classical mean-risk models are based on variance and other variance-related risk measures. Recently, risk measures concerned with the left tails of the distributions, that evaluate the extremely unfavourable outcomes, are used. The most important in this class of risk measure is Value-at-Risk (VaR). In this paper we develop a new integrated VaR estimation with risk optimization model. Three methods for estimating VaR are presented and used to estimate the risk corresponding to a set of assets from Bucharest Stock Exchange. We analyze the forecasting performances of these methods based on the computational results provided We present the mean-risk models and propose a new class of optimization problems, which can be solved using linear programming techniques.

Development agencies are registered in different legal form; they have different ownerships establisher and organizational structure. They also have different capacities and potential, and in front of them are placed different requests. Regardless of all these similarities and differences between agencies, each of them develops their area on their own specific way. But it is clearly that there is not only one perfect way, in which one agency can impact on development of certain area. Development agencies are subjects which provide services, and which dispose with certain limited resources and only in that frame can produce effects. It results with the fact that is impossible to fill the whole expectations of all stakeholders that have some requests for agencies services.

Taking a demand-side perspective, this paper investigates the causes of this rapid growth by decomposing China's trade growth into preference changes, income growth, and other factors. The results indicate that preference changes explain 35.8 percent of export growth and 41.9 percent of import growth over the period. Income growth (excluding convergence) explains a further 28.4 percent and 27.1 percent, respectively, of export and import growth, respectively. In addition, income convergence further contributed about 24 percent and 11.3 percent, respectively, of export and import growth, respectively. These results are generated using a multiregional numerical general equilibrium model of the global economy involving major trading blocs and are calibrated to both 1975 and 2004 data.","[Liu, Xiaoyun] China Agr Univ, Coll Humanities & Dev Studies, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiaoyun] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xin, Xian] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Xin, Xian] China Agr Univ, Ctr Rural Dev Policy, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University; Renmin University of China; China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University,"Liu, XY (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Humanities & Dev Studies, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.",liuxy@cau.edu.cn; xinxian@cau.edu.cn,"Yang, Tian/JFB-1008-2023",,,,,,35,12,12,1,17,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

While spruce weevil damages were found to be significant, only a relatively small percentage of losses can be avoided by planting resistant stock.

On the contrary, students have also many responsibilities, even more than the teachers or instructors.

Although fresh fruit and vegetables are examples of minimally processed foods there is often a high risk of contamination. SALM (Skim Amalan Ladang Baik Malaysia), the Malaysian Farm Certification Scheme, became a national program in 2002 to recognize and certify those farms which adopt good agricultural practices (GAP), while the development of Malaysia's Best has been implemented to encourage farmers to sign up for the scheme to meet defined grades and standards, especially in relation to export markets. This clearly identifies the farm as an integral part of the food safety management system. GAP is a good starting point to develop specific Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) plans, but currently, there is no known example of an actual on-farm HACCP plan for a farm in Malaysia. None of the major GlobalGAP certified farms are required to adopt HACCP. However, SQF (Safe Quality Food) 1000 does embed HACCP at the farm level. This leads to the question: could and should HACCP be extended back in supply chains to the farm? At the same time, as SALM and Malaysia's Best are promoted to underpin trade, how well do these systems compare to other international private standards used in the global fresh produce trade?","[Soon, J.

The 'silver century' scenario is based on the continuation of current demographic trends and policies. In this scenario. Europe's population will continue to age and immigration will be limited. As a result younger people will increasingly tend to concentrate in urban areas while the retirees, who are able, will settle in suburban and rural spaces. In the 'open borders' scenario, the EU and most of the member states will introduce an open and actively promoted immigration policy. Most immigrants will concentrate in large metropolitan areas. At the same time there will also be some countries and regions with very limited immigration from abroad. At the local scale immigration will contribute to social and spatial segregation. Hence, without the regulation or at least management of types and destinations of immigration, demographic imbalances will not be addressed at the regional level. Furthermore while the freedom of movement may have some macroeconomic benefits and address population imbalances in some (mainly metropolitan) areas, pre-existent trends undermining both socio-economic cohesion and sustainable patterns of development are unlikely to be resolved.

In this study the role of 3D visualization and the challenges in developing and communicating visible visions for our future landscapes is explored. While traditional visualization techniques have been well-known for several hundreds of years digital 3D visualizations are still not yet taken advantage of in long-term planning or in futures studies in general to their full potential. As part of an iterative consultation and participation process a long-term vision for the landscape and land management of the Alport Valley in the Peak District National Park, UK is developed in order to improve the valley's special landscape character, to enhance the valley's visual and recreational attractiveness, to regenerate the woodlands in ways that maximize the long-term benefit of ecology, wildlife and landscape and to get a good balance between wooded areas and open moorland. An early integration of 3D visualization in the planning process offers a wide range of opportunities for exploring alternative futures but it also poses challenges to the expert planners such as being able to react timely, with a high degree of realism and interactively to incorporate new inputs from participating stakeholders. Furthermore, the planner is forced to translate a vision into concrete geographically referenced data. Only then the vision can be visualized. The full potential of 3D visualizations in the planning disciplines and in futures studies is still to be explored. The visualizations could be the basis to communicate the vision - the views of the future - and to share the vision with others in order to influence future change. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The planners and policy-makers often approach the urban sprawl as problematic and unprecedented in the history in this part of Europe and take the current situation as a baseline or Ground Zero in developing future scenarios. The objective of our research is to demonstrate that rapid change and adaptation have been the rule rather than an exception in Estonia (as elsewhere in the Western world) in the last century. Adopting a longer time perspective and advocating a relational rather than oppositional approach to rural and urban, nature and culture, as well as the insider and outsider perspectives and public and private spheres may be useful for understanding the spatial frame and historical context in drafting scenarios. Sketching personal narratives of place that have a focus on the choices made in the past and their physical expressions as indicated on the maps, future options and visions are illustrated. We explore the domestic entanglements of rural and urban in two specific locations in Estonia to find ways to loosen the hold of dualisms and outsider-insider perspectives and to construct a more relational approach. Shifting perspectives may help to demonstrate that the urban sprawl with its cultural and ecological consequences is a part of a continuing process not something negative or new. Mapping the personal and place history illustrates the variety and contributes to ceasing the possibilities instead of tackling the uncertainties as sustainability problems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The best-known definition of anticipation is still Rosen's: An anticipatory system is a system containing a predictive model of itself and/or its environment, which allows it to change state at an instant in accord with the model's predictions pertaining to a later instant. The most obvious mistake committed by almost everyone when first confronted with the idea of anticipation is to think that anticipation is a feature that we possess because we are such highly complex and wonderfully sophisticated cognitive agents. This is not what the theory of anticipation claims. Indeed, the major surprise embedded in the theory of anticipation is that anticipation is a widespread phenomenon present in and characterizing all types of realities. The paper presents some of Rosen's early works on anticipation and spells out in some details a few of its subtleties. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Employment structures and practices in higher education institutions are determined by a variety of economic and institutional factors. For example, a 1% increase in the average salaries paid to professorial faculty increases the employment level of part-time faculty by 0.845%. A 1% increase in the average salaries paid to full-time teaching faculty reduces the employment level of full-time teaching faculty by 0.757%. Institutions located in large cities or suburban areas hire 31.3% more part-time faculty but 12.5% fewer full-time teaching faculty. Private institutions hire more part-time faculty than their public counterparts. A 10% increase in FTE student enrollment is associated with a 5.4% increase in the number of part-time faculty, a 10.1% increase in the number of full-time teaching faculty, and a 9.1% increase in professorial faculty. In addition, we find divergent patterns of temporal variability among these three types of faculty. While employment levels of full-time instructors and professorial faculty are rather consistent over time, there is a wide range of fluctuation in the employment of part-time faculty. Finally, the employment of part-time faculty is significantly affected by that of full-time teaching faculty. There is no substitution effect on the employment of professorial faculty.

The authors present a classroom exercise in which students assume the role of an innovator and their decisions at each stage have direct consequences on the profits they earn. Realistic probabilities are used to determine whether patents are infringed or court cases are won.

We reformulate the issue of international capital flows by taking into account their inherent volatility and disruptive effects. This article finds that capital freedom may benefit capital-exporting countries at the expense of capital-importing countries due to the financial risk of volatile capital flows. We prove that, as a Pareto improvement policy tool, capital controls, if carefully chosen and properly managed, can make both parties better off by reducing the instability of those flows. It is shown that the source of this Pareto improvement lies in the favourably changed composition of capital flows (more of foreign direct investment (FM) and less of speculative hot money) under interventions. Thus capital controls should be kept into perspective and cannot be weakened further in developing countries such as China.","[Sheng, Li] Gaming Teaching & Res Ctr, Macao Polytech Inst, Taipa, Peoples R China; [Gu, Xinhua] Univ Macao, Fac Business Adm, Taipa, Peoples R China",Macao Polytechnic University; University of Macau,"Gu, XH (通讯作者)，Gaming Teaching & Res Ctr, Macao Polytech Inst, Edif Kind Light Garden,Rua Chiu Chau 48-52, Taipa, Peoples R China.",xhgu@umac.mo; edmundsheng@ipm.edu.mo,"Sheng, Li/F-3586-2010",,,,,,41,9,9,0,13,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Postnormal times demands, this paper argues, that we abandon the ideas of 'control and management', and rethink the cherished notions of progress, modernisation and efficiency. The way forward must be based on virtues of humility, modesty and accountability, the indispensible requirement of living with uncertainty, complexity and ignorance. We will have to imagine ourselves out of postnormal times and into a new age of normalcy-with an ethical compass and a broad spectrum of imaginations from the rich diversity of human cultures.

As a result, public policies and programs implemented by governments or contract givers designed to provide assistance to Forest Harvesting Entrepreneurs (FHE) are usually conceived around these two parameters. Often perceived as forest machine owner-operators, or even company employees, the status of FHEs has yet to be clearly defined. While several studies have focused on forest entrepreneurs or contractors, few have specifically been aimed at defining their business status. It is hypothesized that the assumption of a business status as either owner-operator or owner-manager may influence the selection of criteria to measure their performance. This paper draws a parallel between characteristics of Small and Medium Business (SME) and FHE owner-managers in order to detect similarities shared by both groups. Based on results from a survey and a review of the research literature on organizational performance, a proposal is put forward that FHEs and their partners within the wood supply network reconsider the traditional logging performance paradigm to include factors such as entrepreneur motivation, management habits and aptitudes, business strategy and other non-financial dimensions. The introduction of a broader and more comprehensive definition of FHEs brings about a significant shift in perspective in forestry research, which can lead to innovative progress that will improve the performance of FHEs and, more generally, of the forest supply chain.

We argue that partisan effects are jointly conditioned by globalization and the mobilizational capacity of organized labour. We present three main empirical findings. First, we show that partisan effects increased from the mid-1970s to the late 1980s and then disappeared in the 1990s. Second, we show that partisan effects rose with globalization in the 1970s and early 1980s, a period characterized by rising labour strength in many OECD countries, but this is not true for the post-1990 period, characterized by declining labour strength. Third, we show that globalization was associated with declining partisan effects in countries that experienced union decline in the 1980s and 1990s, but it was associated with rising partisan effects in countries in which unions remained strong.","[Pontusson, Jonas] Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Kwon, Hyeok Yong] Korea Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Seoul, South Korea",Princeton University; Korea University,"Pontusson, J (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",jpontuss@princeton.edu,,"Pontusson, Jonas/0000-0001-8550-9022",,,,,47,76,81,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

We reject equilibrist versions of resilience and argue instead that we should seek an understanding of the concept from an evolutionary perspective. After discussing a number of such perspectives, we focus on the adaptive cycle model from panarchy theory to generate testable hypotheses concerning urban and regional resilience. Two case study city-regional economies are used to explore this model. We conclude that the evolutionary adaptive cycle model, though not without problems, warrants further study as a framework for analysing regional economic resilience.","[Simmie, James] Oxford Brookes Univ, Sch Built Environm, Oxford OX3 0BP, England; [Martin, Ron] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England",Oxford Brookes University; University of Cambridge,"Simmie, J (通讯作者)，Oxford Brookes Univ, Sch Built Environm, Oxford OX3 0BP, England.",jsimmie@brookes.ac.uk; rlm1@cam.ac.uk,"Martin, Ronald/JPW-9668-2023",,,,,,27,823,932,63,520,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

Overall, our results point to the presence of substantial educational mobility across generations over the last 30 years.

Numerous initiatives have taken place for the collection of data and the creation of cancer registries, however, they currently remain incomplete. Despite universal access of the Greek population to health services provision, structural problems of the national health system have imposed organisational barriers to the geographical distribution of health resources. National invitational CRC screening programmes focusing on early detection of the disease as well as guidelines for its management are missing. All novel cancer treatments are fully reimbursed. Post-treatment surveillance guidelines for high-risk patients are very limited and depend solely on health providers' decisions. A National Cancer Plan (NCP) had been announced during the 2008-2012, but is still in the planning phases. Under the proposed NCP, the longevity of cancer data collection seems to be the critical step in monitoring and improving the performance of the health system. Detailed epidemiological data will give the possibility of constructing an effective prevention policy, will reduce socio-economic inequalities in the access to CRC treatment and lighten the differences observed in health outcomes.

At the present time, cancer is the second cause of death in the country. Until recently, cervical carcinoma was the most frequent type of cancer in the country, however, the incidence of breast, prostate and colon cancers is growing. The demand for health care and health expenditure represented by cancer treatment challenges the limited resources the country has, particularly as patients seek treatment in advanced stages of the disease. Interestingly enough, these types of cancers could be detected in the early stages with rather simple screening procedures. The purpose of this paper is to describe the Mexican health system, and the impact of its fragmentation on access to medicines. Focusing on colorectal cancer (CRC), we describe its epidemiology, screening procedures and the inequities in health care access for these patients.","[Verastegui, Emma] Inst Nacl Cancerol, Unidad Et Clin, Mexico City 14080, DF, Mexico",Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia (INCAN),"Verastegui, E (通讯作者)，Inst Nacl Cancerol, Unidad Et Clin, Av San Fernando 22, Mexico City 14080, DF, Mexico.",unidadbioetica@incan.edu.mx; amohar@incan.edu.mx,"verastegui, emma/AAG-4514-2020","verastegui, emma/0000-0003-3396-1783",,,,,33,18,19,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

However, issues of equity between various forest users are becoming a major challenge to environmental development, forest management and poverty reduction. This paper presents an analysis of household representatives' socio-economic determinants and other constraints on accessing forest products, based on data collected through a questionnaire survey of 1865 respondents in seven districts of the Sissili province, southern Burkina Faso. Three logistic regression models were developed to examine determinants of access to the forest for collecting fuelwood, grazing livestock and collecting non-timber forest products (NTFPs). The results showed that access to forest products is associated with individual characteristics. Age, ethnicity, occupation and sources of income were significant determinants of access to all types of forest products. Access to the forest for grazing livestock was further influenced by gender and household size, while access to NTFPs was influenced by gender, household size and education level of the respondents. The formal forest law that precludes grazing in the forest, and customary rules and regulations pertaining to land tenure, were reported to be serious constraints to forest access for women and migrant people. Understanding the factors influencing access to products from commonly-owned forest resources could form the basis for developing, modifying and targeting policy instruments that promote equitable access. Policies should particularly encourage the direct involvement of vulnerable and marginalized groups (women and migrants) in forest management activities. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The globalist hypothesis postulates that a company's CSR efforts are a function of the dictates of the global market place: strong anti-globalization and anti-corporate sentiments generate a need for a positive reputation to obtain a 'social license to operate'. The institutionalist hypothesis postulates that a company's CSR efforts are a function of institutional factors in the national political-economic system: companies based in political-economic systems with strong institutions for social embedding of the economy have comparative institutional advantages for success in CSR. The hypotheses are examined quantitatively by testing an index of national CSR performance against well-established political-economic indicators.

Bush announced a major overhaul of U.S. space exploration strategy and infrastructure, stipulating that NASA complete the International Space Station (ISS) and retire the Space Shuttle fleet by 2010, develop a new suite of launch and exploration vehicles for deployment shortly thereafter, and embark on a program of human exploration of the solar system with crewed landings on the moon by 2020 and, eventually, Mars. The Vision for Space Exploration would be funded by resources liberated by the end of the International Space Station construction and the Shuttle program, assuming a very modestly increasing NASA budget. While this decision marks a decisive attempt to grapple with longstanding issues concerning the Space Shuttle and station, it has stimulated both optimism and fear within the space community. There is skepticism about its intent, its feasibility, and concern for the effects on various areas of space science and technology. This decision is similar to other, major such initiatives in the history of NASA and space flight, relies on longstanding scenarios and models, and much of its content has been proposed unsuccessfully in the past.

Using the data that is collected, a bid-rent function is derived, and the experimental treatment is altered over the course of three sessions to uncover core concepts in urban economics.

The discussion highlights the benefits of accounting for student and school differences through a value-added modeling approach that incorporates a student's history of family, school, and community influences. Unfortunately, the value-added framework does not address all potential impediments to the consistent estimation of teacher quality of instruction, even when focused solely on within-school differences. Of particular importance is the nonrandom assignment of students to classrooms on the basis of unobservable characteristics and parental and school responses to teacher quality. Evidence from studies that take extensive measures to mitigate the influence of purposeful classroom assignment nonetheless supports the existence of substantial within-school variation in the quality of instruction.","[Ishii, Jun; Rivkin, Steven G.] Amherst Coll, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01002 USA",Amherst College,"Rivkin, SG (通讯作者)，Amherst Coll, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01002 USA.",jishii@amherst.edu; sgrivkin@amherst.edu,,,,,,,19,22,45,0,6,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",1557-3060,,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

We also find that for goods with a normative dimension, a new method we refer to as inferred valuation has the potential to narrow the lab-field gap.

This paper challenges this notion by pointing out that our knowledge of the real shape of world travel and tourism is still quite limited and that the sketchy evidence we can gather with present-day tools thus presents a much more modest picture confronting the claim that tourism has reached a high level of globalization. While it is an activity practiced all over the world, it is scarcely global. In this sense, the perception that tourism is wholeheartedly global and that it mainly connects the richer parts of the world with the poorest pleasure peripheries is but a figment of the post-romantic collective imagination that dominates much tourism research.

Trendsetters for the tourism of the near future are likely to be well-educated elites who are familiar with travel and comfortable in culturally diverse situations. They will have an understanding of the consequences of global economic development, and will better realize that their participation in tourism comes with a cost to communities and environments through which they pass. They will see value in tourism experiences that support principles of environmental sustainability, heritage preservation and cultural diversity, and human equality. This generation of tourists will have greater choice of travel venues and access to considerably more information on which to base their travel plans, and they will be more likely to expect travel experiences that have breadth as well as depth and that provide opportunities for self-improvement as well as leisure and entertainment.

The evidence Suggests that the gains for African exporters from Cutting trade costs half-way to the level Of Mauritius has a greater effect on trade flows than a Substantial Cut in tariff barriers.

Drawing on documents produced by the Japanese development bureaucracy, this paper analyses the origins of the Washington-Tokyo controversy, and suggests that it provides new insights into the nature of models of economic development. Such models are based on post hoc social constructs-interpretations of past events forged in part by development experts, but also by states, which can play a major role in selecting, interpreting and packaging development facts. Washington's 'Anglo-Saxon' model and Tokyo's 'East Asian' model were based on distinct interpretations of development facts, but were not as far apart as they seemed on the surface. We conclude that although development models may draw on local materials, they are also very much global products, constructed in the context of transnational networks and organizational fields.","[Taniguchi, Rie; Babb, Sarah] Boston Coll, Dept Sociol, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA",Boston College,"Taniguchi, R (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Dept Sociol, McGuinn Hall, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA.",tanigucr@mail.bc.edu,,,,,,,85,15,18,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

This article firstly reviews three existing approaches that highlight links between vertical and horizontal state transformation: multi-level governance, policy networks and sections of the rescaling literature. However, these approaches do not yet provide a framework sufficient to enable a more thorough and detailed examination of the relationship between these two dimensions. The article thus proceeds to develop a multifaceted framework in order to facilitate further research into this relationship, a necessity if we are to understand more fully whether vertical and horizontal authority shifts complement or contradict one another within the transformation of the state's role in governing society and economy.","Univ Southampton, Sch Social Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",University of Southampton,"Büchs, M (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Sch Social Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",m.buechs@soton.ac.uk,"Buchs, Milena/AAU-2581-2021","Buchs, Milena/0000-0001-6304-3196",,,,,53,21,25,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

Despite its peculiarity, this result has gained acceptance as a cornerstone for further developments of the rational tax evasion model. However, because of the mathematical format by which it is conveyed, this counterintuitive result has remained inaccessible to undergraduate students as well as to noneconomists. The author first introduces the rational tax evasion model in a nonmathematical style that is accessible to any reader. Second, he shows that the behavioral predictions of the rational tax evasion model can easily be obtained using a simple graphical representation of the optimum condition that involves the derivation of a demand curve for tax compliance.","Coll Managenment Acad Studies, Tel Aviv, Israel",College of Management Academic Studies,"Yaniv, G (通讯作者)，Coll Managenment Acad Studies, Tel Aviv, Israel.",gidyan@cohnan.ac.il,,,,,,,15,2,2,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0485,2152-4068,,J ECON EDUC,J.

Clinical probabilities were obtained from trial data, resource utilisation and MRSA prevalence rates were obtained through German physician interviews, and costs from published sources were applied to resource units. Outcomes included total cost/patient and cure. The estimated first-line cure rate for linezolid-treated patients was 90.1% versus 85.5% for vancomycin; total Cure rates after two lines of treatment were 98.4% and 98.1%, respectively. Average total cost/episode was 8,232 (sic) for linezolid versus 9,206 (sic) for vancomycin. The model outcomes were sensitive to changes in length of stay (LOS), isolation days, rate of confirmed MRSA and price of linezolid.

The question at the centre of this research is whether the correlation between health and education represents a causal relation.

The results provide evidence of a causal relation running from more schooling to better health which is much larger than standard regression estimates suggest. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

To detect the fruit, an image processing approach was developed that is robust to outdoor variable illumination and has the ability to detect fruits in cluster and partially occluded fruit. The fruit portion was enhanced by the red chromaticity coefficient and a circle detection method enabled the individual fruits to be classified. To improve fruit visibility, the fruit detection algorithm was combined with a multiple viewing technique that would acquire multiple views of a portion of a tree canopy from different viewing angles. Results showed that by acquiring multiple views, fruit visibility improved from 50% to about 90%. The outcome of this study will be useful for targeting fruits for robotic fruit harvesting.","[Bulanon, D. M.; Burks, T.

We find that teachers systematically try to move away from schools where teaching is likely to be more difficult because of the student mix or the social context of the school. Given the absence of any criteria other than seniority in regulating teachers' allocation across schools, disadvantaged students frequently end up with less experienced teachers who are often just waiting to move elsewhere.

We present new evidence using two data series from Australia, where comparable tests are available back to the 1960s. For young teenagers (aged 13-14), we find a small but statistically significant fall in numeracy over the period 1964-2003 and in both literacy and numeracy over the period 1975-98. The decline is in the order of one-tenth to one-fifth of a standard deviation. Adjusting this decline for changes in student demographics does not affect this conclusion; if anything, the decline appears to be more acute. The available evidence also suggests that any changes in student attitudes, school violence, and television viewing are unlikely to have had a major impact on test scores. Real per child school expenditure increased substantially over this period, implying a fall in school productivity. Although we cannot account for all the phenomena that might have affected school productivity, we identify a number of plausible explanations.","[Leigh, Andrew; Ryan, Chris] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Ryan, C (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",andrew.leigh@anu.edu.au; chris.ryan@anu.edu.au,"Leigh, Andrew/AAV-1366-2020","Leigh, Andrew/0000-0002-5639-0509",,,,,52,7,8,0,5,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

This requires that the developed countries' emissions are radically reduced during the next 40 years. Energy scenario studies provide insights on the societal transitions that might be implied by such low-carbon futures, and in this paper we discuss how a greater attention to different governance and institutional issues can complement future scenario exercises. The analysis is based on a critical review of 20 quantitative and qualitative scenario studies, all of relevance for meeting long-term climate policy objectives. The paper: (a) analyzes some key differences in energy technology mixes and primary energy use patterns across these studies; (b) briefly explores the extent and the nature of the societal challenges and policy responses implied; and (c) discusses a number of important implications for the design and scope of future scenario studies. Our review shows that in previous scenario studies the main attention is typically paid to analyzing the impact of well-defined and uniform policy instruments, while fewer studies factor in the role of institutional change in achieving different energy futures. We therefore point towards a number of strategies of integrating issues of transition governance into future scenario analyses, and argue for a closer synthesis of qualitative and quantitative scenario building.

Unlike other quantitative studies addressing this topic, I use conditional logistic regression with fixed effects for colleges to draw conclusions about the impact of legacy status on admissions odds. By doing so. I eliminate most sources of outcome bias by controlling for applicant characteristics that are constant across colleges and college characteristics that are constant across applicants. I estimate that the odds of admission are multiplied by a factor 3.13 due to legacy status. My results also suggest that the magnitude of this legacy admissions advantage depends greatly on the nature of the familial ties between the applicant and the outcome college, and, to a lesser extent, the selectivity of the outcome college and the applicant's academic strength.

This study evaluates irbesartan in relation to commonly used alternative hypertension therapies losartan and valsartan given in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in the general hypertensive population in Greece. A Markov model with eight states of health was constructed: hypertension, myocardial infarction (MI), post-MI, angina, stroke, poststroke, heart failure, and death. The model has an annual cycle and estimates mean quality-adjusted survival and treatment cost, which reflect the hypertension treatment and managing cardiovascular events. Risk functions were used to conduct extrapolations. Data on treatment effectiveness, quality of life (QOL) and epidemiology were obtained from published clinical trials and studies. The database of the main Greek National Social Insurance Institute (IKA) was analyzed to estimate the cost of events. The analysis was done from a payer perspective. All outcomes were discounted, and prices correspond to 2008. The estimated patient cost per annum was stable angina a,not sign2,252, unstable angina a,not sign2,572, myocardial infarction a,not sign2,473, post-MI a,not sign1,677, stroke a,not sign12,233, poststroke a,not sign1,240, heart failure a,not sign2,655, coronary angiography a,not sign1,544, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty a,not sign6,511, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery a,not sign11,514.

The short-term focus of foreign investors encourages managers to engage in conservative investment behavior. On the other hand, foreign investors encourage managers to focus on long-term value rather than short-term returns as active participants in corporate governance. These competing views are examined by testing for the association between foreign ownership and variations in corporate cash flow, a proxy for the risk of chosen investments. Furthermore, we examine whether risk taking is positively associated with firm growth, which is a primary concern in debates regarding the myopic behaviors of foreign investors. The results show that firms with high foreign ownership are less likely to avoid risk taking-and that risk taking is, in turn, positively associated with firm growth, implying that foreign investors perform a monitoring function in encouraging value-enhancing risk taking.","Dankook Univ, Sch Business Adm, Yongin, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Dankook University,"Kim, B (通讯作者)，Dankook Univ, Sch Business Adm, Yongin, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",bmkim@dankook.ac.kr,,,,,,,49,25,26,3,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The pattern observed is a logical outcome of the strategies embedded in World Bank policies that need to change if we are to counter the persistence of inequality and poverty on the continent. The paper outlines an alternative approach aimed at increasing rural incomes to reduce poverty and inequality.,"Univ Michigan, CAAS, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Stein, H (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, CAAS, 505 S State St,4700 Haven Hall, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",howstein@umich.edu,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0921757] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [0921757] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,47,19,21,1,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

In this article. I hypothesise that professionalism conditions nature perception and overrides gender effects among foresters. Professionalism here includes expertise and exercise of control. Cultural Theory, especially the four 'nature myths' that have been adapted to it, ground the study theoretically, and data from two surveys ground the study empirically (survey of the German population (Kuckartz et al. 2006) and my own survey of German state foresters (2008)). The empirical findings support the hypothesis. Differences between foresters and the general public are bigger than between female and male foresters. Foresters, whether male or female, perceive nature as less ephemeral and less capricious than does the general public. Besides, they have a distinct cultural bias towards nature as tolerant but vulnerable to surpassing ultimate limits. Female foresters therefore do not change the profession's nature perception, at least not because of their gender. Questions that remain are: why does the percentage of women in forestry nevertheless remain low and how could change happen then? (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Using causality analysis are identified a set of causal relationships between the variable measuring the size of the informal economy and other macroeconomic variables.

We conducted two consumer experiments to investigate spillover effects of negative publicity on consumer valuation of seafood products from unaffected countries and species, as well as a potential mitigating strategy that an affected industry might use. We find significant negative spillover effects on the same species produced in unaffected countries and on other fish species farmed within the affected country We also find that building a brand association with an upscale retailer does not improve the consumer valuation (i.e., no positive spillover effects) for products from directly and indirectly affected countries of the affected species.","[Hansen, Havard; Onozaka, Yuko] Univ Stavanger, UiS Business Sch, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway",Universitetet i Stavanger,"Hansen, H (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, UiS Business Sch, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.",havard.hansen@uis.no; yuko.onozaka@uis.no,"Onozaka, Yuko/AAU-9770-2020",,"Faculty of Social Sciences and the Food Market Research Program, University of Stavanger","Faculty of Social Sciences and the Food Market Research Program, University of Stavanger","Funding for the project was provided by the Faculty of Social Sciences and the Food Market Research Program, University of Stavanger.

The focus is on the government's Intertemporal Fiscal Constraint, according to which the current value of public debt is less than or equals the discounted sum of future government surpluses. Not respecting the constraint implies that the government is financing its activities through a Ponzi scheme, which means public finances are not sustainable in the long run. This would seriously deteriorate the country's rating and risk premium, along with investor confidence. The empirical approach uses econometric techniques to evaluate the constraint, specifically, we test for the existence of cointegration between government revenues and expenditures. Results indicate that the constraint is respected in Romania and the Czech Republic, while in Poland, the two series are not cointegrated.","Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Leonte, A (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",alexandruleonte@yahoo.com,,,European Social Fund,European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)),"This article is a result of the project POSDRU/6/1.5/S/11 Doctoral Program and PhD Students in the education research and innovation triangle.

In order to develop this model, first, a short revision of the OWA operators is introduced. Next, we briefly explain the general model for the selection of human resources and suggest three new indexes for the selection of human resources that use the OWA operator and the hybrid average in the Hamming distance, in the adequacy coefficient and in the index of maximum and minimum level. The main advantage of this method is that it is more complete than the previous ones so the decision maker gets a better understanding of the decision problem.

For this, an entry signaling game is considered. Large incumbents send a signal either 'enter' or not enter' to the startups' original markets, which will affect the relative innovation qualities of the startups. If a 'not enter' signal reaches to the startups' original markets, the market perceived innovation of the startups would increase and vice versa. Combined with a high or a low value of market shock, I construct four business scenarios: (high market perceived innovation, high market luck), (high market perceived innovation, low market luck), (low market perceived innovation, high market luck), and (low market perceived innovation, low market luck). The simulation is designed to test a necessary and a sufficient condition. A necessary condition is that rapid-growth startups must be able to grow to be market leaders and a sufficient condition is that rapid-growth startups must overcome hostile M&A threats by the large incumbents. Differently from a general presumption that startup companies lacking initial endowments are less likely to grow rapidly under the potential threat of entry, the model predicts two conflicting outcomes. First, rapid-growth startups are more likely to maintain their market leaderships when their original markets are expected to become more competitive. Therefore, crisis would visit, surprisingly, when they enjoy strong market position rather than when they are exposed to tense competition. Second, when their original markets become competitive, rapid-growth startups are able to acquire their early competitors. These simulation results suggest an important message to policy makers: competition is desirable to raise rapidly growing startups. A panel fixed effect model supports the simulation predictions.","Hanyang Univ, Sch Business, Seoul 133791, South Korea",Hanyang University,"Rok, YH (通讯作者)，Hanyang Univ, Sch Business, Seoul 133791, South Korea.",hryim@hanyang.ac.kr,,,Hanyang University [HY-2011-O],Hanyang University,This work was supported by the research fund of Hanyang University (HY-2011-O),,19,1,1,1,14,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

A European tax, set and charged uniformly to all and by all Member States, seems a good solution and it would be possible only if budgetary criteria, criteria of efficiency and equity are taken into consideration.

This extra maternal care primarily crowded out home-based care by unlicensed nonrelatives and replaced full-time work.

The primary focus in terms of the vocational workforce is on skilled production workers and, in particular, tradespersons and technicians. These occupations and the vocational training system are found to have a unique role and make a significant contribution to innovation in both production and Research and Development (R&D). The primary role of the VET system in innovation is technology diffusion. However, there are a number of impediments to achieving this role. These are sustained budget cuts and exclusion of the VET system from national innovation policy, programmes and advisory structures. The latter is attributed largely to the failure of the innovation studies discipline, which has strongly influenced government policy in this field, to study in detail the role of VET occupations and training system in the innovation process. This conclusion is paradoxical as the discipline's own analysis of innovation makes a compelling case that these occupations and training system should be central agents in this process.","Univ Western Sydney, Ctr Innovat & Ind Studies, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia",Western Sydney University,"Toner, P (通讯作者)，Univ Western Sydney, Ctr Innovat & Ind Studies, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia.",ph.toner@uws.edu.au,,,,,,,89,21,23,1,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

In an era of greater austerity, the 'value for money' segment is the one with global growth potential in emergent markets as well.

Fully funded by a set of anonymous donors, the Kalamazoo Promise is an urban revitalization program that offers up to four years of free tuition to any public college or university in the state of Michigan for graduates of the Kalamazoo Public School system who meet certain eligibility criteria. Using the subsidy as a source of exogenous variation in the price of college, we use quasi-experimental methods to evaluate the impact of the subsidy on college choice. We find that the Kalamazoo Promise increases the likelihood that students from Kalamazoo Public Schools consider public institutions in Michigan. In addition, we find that the Kalamazoo Promise especially impacts the college choice set of students from families who earn less than $50,000 in annual income. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Then, we use the same IV methods with the National Health and Nutrition Survey (ENSANUT 2006). We estimate na < ve models, assuming exogeneity, and contrast them with IV models that take advantage of the specific SP implementation mechanisms for identification. The IV models estimated included two-stage least squares (2SLS), bivariate probit, and two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI) models. Instrumental variables estimates resulted in comparable estimates against the gold standard. Instrumental variables estimates indicate a reduction of 54% in catastrophic expenditures at the national level. SP beneficiaries also had lower expenditures on outpatient and medicine expenditures.

In light of health care resource allocation problems, it is important to know the level of current use of home care on which future projections may be based. With the availability of SHARE (Survey of Health Ageing and Retirement in Europe) data, it is now possible to analyse this process and estimate the relationship between formal and informal care, and our econometric model tests for endogeneity of informal care. Previous research has not included Ireland into the analysis. Given that Ireland has a younger population base, lessons could be learned from countries with older populations, such as France. Results suggest informal care is endogenous and negatively linked with formal care in the pooled (France and Ireland) model. There is a higher unmet need for care in Ireland.

Building on Pollitt and Bouckaert's (2004) description of politico-administrative regimes, we compile a data set of cross-national public administration indicators to explore public employment and politico-administrative regulation. Our explorative statistical analysis identifies three distinct public administration regimes: an Anglo-American, a French/German and a Scandinavian regime. The Anglo-American and French/German regimes show, especially with regard to public employment regulation, a high degree of institutional coherence with the co-ordination rules applying to the market economy. Findings for the Scandinavian administration regime do not support the institutional coherence argument, which leads us to conclude that the legal origin of a country may play an important role in linking and synchronizing the mode of regulation in the public and private spheres of the political economy.","[Tepe, Markus; Kittel, Bernhard] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Ctr Social Sci Methodol, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Gottschall, Karin] Univ Bremen, Ctr Social Policy Res, Bremen, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; University of Bremen,"Tepe, M (通讯作者)，Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Ctr Social Sci Methodol, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.",markus.tepe@uni-oldenburg.de,"Tepe, Markus/AAJ-6558-2020","Tepe, Markus/0000-0002-6679-0346; Kittel, Bernhard/0000-0001-9799-8310",,,,,76,19,21,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The main objective of this article is to explore challenges in determining the national effects of three international forest policy processes, while building on earlier literature on the effects and effectiveness of international regimes. Our study focuses on one single substantive element (forest protection) in one country (Norway). We explore the challenges in verifying causal connections between national changes and the international recommendations for an element where a good deal of information is available. Quantitative data for protection status as well as qualitative data from an empirical study giving differing opinions on Norway's compliance with international recommendations are combined and discussed for two alternative concepts of effects: (i) relative improvement with the regimes compared to the situation with no regime, and (ii) the regime's contribution to solving the problem. The findings suggest that international processes can be attributed limited or comprehensive influence depending on the interpretation of the recommendations as well as on the analytical approach chosen in determining influences. Further analysis of the effects of international forest policy processes on forest management and across countries is recommended, and factors considered for such analysis to be informative and credible are proposed.

Completing the Analysis in Brazil-Tyres,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TRADE-AGREEMENTS; REGIONALISM; WILL,"The proliferation of preferential trade agreements (PTAs) has given rise to possible legal conflicts between PTAs and WTO rules. WTO jurisprudence on the PTA exception in GATT Article XXIV remains scant. A recent dispute concerning Brazilian measures on retreaded tyres in the context of MERCOSUR was the first WTO case in which an environmental and health measure was intertwined with an Article XXIV defence. While the Appellate Body resolved some important aspects of the relationship between PTAs and WTO rules in this case, the operation of Article XXIV itself was not clarified. This article seeks to complete the analysis on Article XXIV in Brazil Tyres. It considers whether Brazil's import ban could be justified under Article XXIV, addressing both whether MERCOSUR meets the procedural and substantive conditions laid out in the article and whether Article XXIV is an applicable defence to the measure at issue. Reconciling the panel's reasoning in US Line Pipe with the necessity test developed by the Appellate Body in Turkey Textiles, this article suggests that Article XXIV can be interpreted as excusing only those breaches of MFN that are necessary to establish a PTA under Article XXIV and not independently justifying other breaches. Brazil would therefore be unable to rely on Article XXIV to excuse its discriminatory import ban. In coming to this finding, this article seeks to draw some conclusions regarding the scope and applicability of the Article XXIV exception. In particular, it argues that the overly narrow focus on the definition of 'other regulations of commerce' and 'other restrictive regulations of commerce' has resulted in an inability to see the Article XXIV forest for the trees and a tendency to improperly invoke Article XXIV in regulatory contexts unrelated to the purpose for which it was provided.",,,,tegan.brink@gmail.com,,,,,,,32,1,1,0,5,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

There have been many studies in which cigarette and alcohol consumption have been considered separately but few to date for China on interactions between the consumption of these two products. Taxes are often recommended as a tool to reduce alcohol and cigarette consumption. If cigarettes and alcohol are complements, taxing one will reduce the consumption of both and thus achieve a double public health dividend. However, if they are substitutes, taxing one will induce consumers to increase consumption of the other, offsetting the public health benefits of the tax. Our results indicate that the demands for both cigarettes and alcohol are very sensitive to the price of alcohol, but not to the price of cigarettes or to income. This suggests that taxes on alcohol can have a double dividend. On the other hand, an increase in cigarette taxes may not be effective in curbing cigarette or alcohol consumption in rural China.","[Yu, Xiaohua] Univ Gottingen, Courant Res Ctr Poverty Equ & Growth, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Abler, David] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",University of Gottingen; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Yu, XH (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Courant Res Ctr Poverty Equ & Growth, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",xyu@uni-goettingen.de; d-abler@psu.edu,,"Abler, David/0000-0002-1305-6498; Yu, Xiaohua/0000-0003-4257-8081",,,,,49,22,28,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

However, in most developing nations local people who reside at the vicinity of the park expect that it should also contribute to the social and economic well-being of the people. This paper examines the contribution of the Okwangwo Division of the Cross River National Park, Nigeria, to the provision of various types of infrastructure and income from tourism. Personal interviews were conducted in 150 households in three villages around the park. The study showed that the park has contributed to the provision of infrastructure. Some of the projects, undertaken by the park management, appear to be capital intensive both in the short and long term, thus, risking to make them unsustainable. The results revealed that only one of the villages in the study area benefits from the income from tourism. We suggest that simple, non-capital intensive and sustainable developmental projects should be undertaken. The tourism sector of the local economy should be developed to make income from tourism attractive for more of the local people. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Methods An existing decision tree model, designed using data from a large international clinical trial of palivizumab versus no prophylaxis, was updated to include Spanish observational hospitalisation data. The analysis was performed for preterm children born at or before 32 weeks gestational age, who are at high risk of developing severe RSV disease requiring hospitalisation. Data sources included published literature, official price/tariff lists and national population statistics. The primary perspective of the study was that of the Spanish National Health Service in 2006. Results The base-case analysis included the direct medical costs associated with palivizumab prophylaxis and hospital care for RSV infections. Use of palivizumab produces an undiscounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of (sic)6,142 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), and a discounted ICER of (sic)12,814/QALY.

Aim To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of infliximab treatment in patients hospitalised with acute exacerbations of UC. Methods A decision analysis model was constructed to simulate the progression of acute UC patients treated with infliximab induction regimen over 1 year. Infliximab treatment was compared with standard care, ciclosporin and surgery using transitions derived from infliximab and ciclosporin randomised trials. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5%. Intermediate outcomes of colectomy and post-surgery complications were translated into the primary effectiveness measurement, which was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) estimated using EQ-5D. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to estimate the uncertainty around the results. Results The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) for infliximab was 19,545 pound per QALY compared to ciclosporin, which in turn dominated standard care. Sensitivity analysis indicated patient body weight, utility estimates and treatment effect of alternative treatment strategies to be the most important factors affecting cost-effectiveness. Conclusion Infliximab induction regimen appears to be a cost-effective treatment option for UC patients hospitalised with an acute exacerbation.","[Punekar, Yogesh Suresh] Schering Plough Ltd, Welwyn Garden City AL7 1TW, Herts, England; [Hawkins, Neil] Oxford Outcomes, Oxford, England",Merck & Company,"Punekar, YS (通讯作者)，Schering Plough Ltd, Welwyn Garden City AL7 1TW, Herts, England.",Yogesh.punekar@spcorp.com,,"Punekar, Yogesh/0000-0002-7531-1319; Hawkins, Neil/0000-0003-3199-221X",,,,,23,30,33,1,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

All that observers can know for certain is that the parties did not agree, but understanding the failure is an essential prelude to any attempt to relaunch the Round. This paper is a counterfactual analysis of the various explanations that have been offered for the failure.

Specifically, the paper proposes a re-engineered and robust approach to optimal economic capital allocation, in a Liquidity-Adjusted Value at Risk (L-VaR) framework, and particularly from the perspective of trading portfolios that have both long and short trading. This paper expands previous approaches by explicitly modeling the liquidation of trading portfolios, over the holding period, with the aid of an appropriate scaling of the multiple-assets' L-VaR matrix along with GARCH-M technique to forecast conditional volatility and expected return. Moreover, in this paper, the authors develop a dynamic nonlinear portfolio selection model and an optimization algorithm which allocates both economic capital and trading assets by minimizing L-VaR subject to the constraints that the expected return, trading volume and liquidation horizon should meet the budget limits set by the fund manager. The empirical results strongly confirm the importance of enforcing financially and operationally meaningful nonlinear and dynamic constraints, when they are available, on the L-VaR optimization procedure.","[Al Janabi, Mazin A.

Colon and rectal cancer are registered separately in Russia. When colon and rectal cancers are considered together, CRC is the second cause of cancer death for women (after breast cancer) and the third for men (after lung and stomach cancer), while both incidence and mortality have increased over the past decade. About a quarter of all new colon and rectal cancer cases are diagnosed at Stage IV and one-third of patients with newly diagnosed disease die in the first year after diagnosing, however, poor data collection and collation presents problems with reliability of cancer statistics. Screening for CRC is not included in the national programme of preventive medical examination. There are no data about treatment effectiveness and access to innovative drugs in common practice. New drugs for CRC are included in the documents that regulate access to care, notably, drug lists and standards of medical care. However, many cancer patients are not included in any reimbursement programme and have to pay for the drugs, and there are problems with drug supply even for patients who are entitled to reimbursement.

The analysis compares the difference in employment status between partnered mothers and nonmothers across the EU-15 using a wide range of self-constructed indicators of child policies such as childcare provision, parental leave, and tax-cash benefits. Using the recycled predictions method, it is possible to isolate the impact of the presence of a child from other characteristics likely to influence women's labor-market outcomes. Country-specific employment gaps among women are computed at different ages for the youngest child, for different outcomes (inactivity and part-time or full-time work), and for different levels of education. The main conclusion is that when it comes to securing equal labor-market access and conditions for mothers of young children and non-mothers, public childcare provision has the strongest impact. In the absence of public childcare, not even the most highly educated mothers can cope.","[De Henau, Jerome] Open Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Social Sci, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; [Meulders, Daniele; O'Dorchai, Sile] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Dept Econ Appl, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Open University - UK; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"De Henau, J (通讯作者)，Open Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Social Sci, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England.",j.de-henau@open.ac.uk; dmeulder@ulb.ac.be; sile.odorchai@ulb.ac.be,,"De Henau, Jerome/0000-0003-3422-3897",,,,,49,24,29,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Based on extensive research within regional and global IOs, we demonstrate four aspects of rhetorical legitimation. First, IO texts draw upon a finite repertoire of rhetorical devices (a) to propagate legitimation strengths of an IO, (b) to amplify or compensate for legitimation weaknesses and (c) to express rhetorical repertoires which convey their own intrinsic merits. Second, configurations of rhetorical devices in IO texts are affected by temporal contexts, such as exogenous shocks and the historical sequencing of IO norm production. Third, the negotiation of relations of IO interdependency, including competition and cooperation, are partly signaled and managed through the rhetorical repertoires of IO products. Fourth, texts have their own properties, formal and substantive, that are crafted to persuade domestic law-makers.","[Halliday, Terence C.] Amer Bar Fdn, Ctr Law & Globalizat, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Halliday, Terence C.] Univ Illinois, Coll Law, Chicago, IL USA; [Block-Lieb, Susan] Fordham Univ, New York, NY 10023 USA; [Carruthers, Bruce G.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Sociol, Evanston, IL USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Fordham University; Northwestern University,"Halliday, TC (通讯作者)，Amer Bar Fdn, Ctr Law & Globalizat, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",halliday@abfn.org,,,,,,,28,61,64,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Studies show that the most popular method used for prediction of firms' failures are discriminant analyses (30.3% of all models), then logit and probit models (21.3%), which all three are parametric models. The nature, the structure of the current dynamic world and the linkages between all the financial and economical markets around the world make necessary to continuously research for the new methods of bankruptcy prediction. The purpose of this article is to analyze the usage of innovative method-fuzzy logic system in predicting bankruptcy for one year, two and three years before the failure of companies. Additional unique feature of this article is the use of macroeconomic variables in the predicting process. Authors aimed to verify the effectiveness of created fuzzy logic models with the use of not only financial ratios, but also the macroeconomic indicators. To conduct this research authors have used financial statements of 132 stock equity companies (25 bankrupt and 107 nonbankrupt). This research proves high bankruptcy forecasting predispositions of the used method. Presented models in the article distinguish with high effectiveness of predicting the bankruptcy among accessible results in the world literature.","[Korol, Tomasz] Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Gdansk, Poland; [Korodi, Adrian] Politehnica Univ Timisoara, Fac Automat & Comp, Timisoara, Romania",Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology; Polytechnic University of Timisoara,"Korol, T (通讯作者)，Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Gdansk, Poland.",tomasz.korol@zie.pg.gda.pl; adrian.korodi@aut.upt.ro,"Korodi, Adrian/ABG-6348-2021","Korol, Tomasz/0000-0002-7623-3404",,,,,21,11,14,2,22,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Granger causality test is employed in this study to investigate the relationship and causality between the oil prices and inflation for Turkey. The results of Granger-causality test show that the causality is running from oil prices to inflation. Therefore, we conclude that increases in oil prices have had a positive impact on inflation in Turkey over the period between 1983:01 and 2006:05.","[Ozturk, Ilhan] Cag Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Mersin, Turkey; [Feridun, Mete] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Gazi Magosa, Turkey",Cag University - Turkey; Eastern Mediterranean University,"Ozturk, I (通讯作者)，Cag Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Mersin, Turkey.",ilhanozturk@cag.edu.tr; mete.feridun@gmail.com,"Ozturk, Ilhan/B-9431-2009; Feridun, Mete/A-9891-2016","Ozturk, Ilhan/0000-0002-6521-0901;",,,,,27,1,1,0,10,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Given the Bermuda nature of the option, it is not possible to price the switchable bonds using standard simulation techniques. However, the technique of multinomial trees can be exploited. To preserve consistency with the pricing of vanilla bonds, it is suitable to assume that the short interest rate follows a stochastic process in the arbitrage free framework. One of the possibilities for modelling the short rate process is the Hull-White model which involves two parameters not directly observable in the market. We have developed a pricing algorithm based on the Hull White trinomial tree that has the desired properties and calibrated the model parameters to the market data.","[Slamova, Lenka; Chudoba, Martin] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Sokolovska 83, Prague 18675, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Slámová, L (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Sokolovska 83, Prague 18675, Czech Republic.",slam-ova.lenka@gmail.com; martinchu-doba@email.cz,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

This paper examines one of the claimed benefits that countries with flexicurity policies will reduce the stress on employees who experience job insecurity. More specifically, it is argued that more generous unemployment benefits along with active labour market policies to facilitate rapid re-employment reduces the anxiety associated with insecurity. Analyses of two international data sets found little evidence for this moderation of the link between insecurity and well-being in countries that are assumed to be exemplars of flexicurity. The economic rationality behind these claims is questioned, and a psychological approach to job insecurity is suggested as an alternative.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Sociol, Cambridge CB2 3RQ, England",University of Cambridge,"Burchell, B (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Sociol, Free Sch Lane, Cambridge CB2 3RQ, England.",bb101@cam.ac.uk,,"burchell, brendan/0000-0002-8243-937X",,,,,42,31,34,1,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

Such policies have been criticized on the environmental grounds that timber production is emphasized at the expense of other values, and on the economic grounds that policy-makers try to maximize the harvests level without regard for economic optimality (measured by whether or not revenues cover variable costs of production). In a case study from Northern Ontario, we used a spatially explicit harvest scheduling model to evaluate financial outputs for various scenarios. introducing different timber flow constraints, as well as varying utilization policies. We show that current policies do contribute to firms harvesting at uneconomic levels. More specifically, our results show that reducing harvest levels could increase firm profitability (measured in an increase in net revenues associated with harvesting operations). We estimate that to meet the annual allowable cut (AAC) of approximately 375,000 cubic metres (m(3)). the firm loses $500,000 annually (measured by the amount by which total harvesting costs exceed log values delivered at the mill). Reducing the target AAC to just under 300,000 m(3) leads to a reversed situation, harvesting revenues now exceeding costs by $1.2 million annually. Dropping the even flow constraint leads to even higher annual profitability of $3.5 million, with the drawback that harvesting levels show significant variation over the 100-year planning period. Our results also show that the largest factor influencing the level of profitability is attributed to access costs (principally roading costs). In this case, other harvesting policies, such as utilization standards, may not be significant factors affecting costs in this region of Northern Ontario. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Given that the privatization of sales coupled with a tax reduction should lead to a decrease in the unit price of alcohol, one would expect the quantity consumed to increase. While it is of interest to project the impact of the proposed bill on the market for alcohol, another important consideration is the impact that increased alcohol consumption and, more specifically, probable alcohol misuse would have on other markets in Iceland. The only available study on this subject using Icelandic data yields surprising results. Tmasson et al. (Scand J Public Health 32:47-52, 2004) unexpectedly found no effect of probable alcohol abuse on sick leave. A logical next step would be to examine the effect of probable alcohol abuse on other important labor-market outcomes. Nationally representative survey data from 2002 allow for an analysis of probable misuse of alcohol and labor-supply choices. Labor-supply choices are considered with reference to possible effects of policies already in force, as well as proposed changes to current policies. Contrary to intuition, but in agreement with the previously mentioned Icelandic study, the adverse effects of probable misuse of alcohol on employment status or hours worked are not confirmed within this sample. The reasons for the results are unclear, although some suggestions are hypothesized. Currently, data to test those theories convincingly are not available.","[Asgeirsdottir, Tinna Laufey] Univ Iceland, Dept Econ, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [McGeary, Kerry Anne] Drexel Univ, Dept Econ & Int Business, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Iceland; Drexel University,"Asgeirsdottir, TL (通讯作者)，Univ Iceland, Dept Econ, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",ta@hi.is; kmcgeary@drexel.edu,"Ásgeirsdóttir, Tinna Laufey/ISA-3677-2023",,,,,,40,1,3,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The Court's approach to considering the notion of direct effect as a criterion for an action for damages is questioned in light of the Court's own jurisprudence.

In this study of the Beijing middle school open enrollment program, we estimate the degree to which children's school outcomes were negatively affected by the poor choices their parents made during the school selection process. We do this by examining parents' responses to a survey on school choices combined with actual school applications, school admission records, and High School Entrance Examination test scores for 4717 students entering middle schools in Beijing via randomized lotteries. We find that the children of parents who made judgment errors in school selection were admitted to lower quality schools and achieved lower test scores on the High School Entrance Examination. Parents who had less education, whose children performed at lower levels in primary school, and who were less attentive to teachers' opinions about schools were more prone to make these errors. Providing assistance to parents, especially those less prepared to make informed choices about school selection, is consequently important for supporting more efficient and equitable open enrollment programs.

We show that when moving is costly, the variation in housing prices and wages across locations may no longer reflect the value of differences in local amenities. We develop an alternative discrete-choice approach that models the household location decision directly, and we apply it to the case of air quality in US metro areas in 1990 and 2000. Because air pollution is likely to be correlated with unobservable local characteristics such as economic activity, we instrument for air quality using the contribution of distant sources to local pollution-excluding emissions from local sources, which are most likely to be correlated with local conditions. Our model yields an estimated elasticity of willingness to pay with respect to air quality of 0.34-0.42. These estimates imply that the median household would pay $149-$185 (in constant 1982-1984 dollars) for a one-unit reduction in average ambient concentrations of particulate matter. These estimates are three times greater than the marginal willingness to pay estimated by a conventional hedonic model using the same data. Our results are robust to a range of covariates, instrumenting strategies, and functional form assumptions. The findings also confirm the importance of instrumenting for local air pollution.

However. preliminary studies indicate that these very same features, e.g. high chemical reactivity, could entail adverse impacts on human health and the environment. Calls for appropriate regulation and societal formation of nanotechnology developments have been made, resulting in the concept of sustainable nanotechnology governance. The required anticipatory knowledge supporting these efforts seems so far to lack a sound methodological basis as well as an integrated perspective on nanotechnological applications. We present a scenario study on possible future developments of nanotechnology in Switzerland (reference year 2020). The study employed a formalized and functional scenario methodology, featuring system analysis, consistency analysis and transdisciplinary collaboration. The results indicate five different future constellations of contextual aspects, such as public awareness, profit potential and legal regulations, which are assumed to consistently correspond to five distinct market situations for nanotechnological applications. Going beyond the specific nanotechnology scenarios, the article argues for a rigorous scenario methodology as a valuable tool for the sustainable governance of emerging technologies.

Tins article therefore proposes a remedy for WTO agreement violations consisting of monetary damages assessed at the reliance measure of common law contract. Breaching WTO Members will compensate exporters in the injured state in an amount commensurate with their expenditures undertaken in anticipation of liberalized trade, obviating the need for an estimated counterfactual and structuring reparation according to actual individual losses rather than on an aggregate state level. In addition to encouraging efficient breach, this method of setting damages has precedent in international law which should foster compliance, is aligned with the tort-like nature of WTO violations and serves an evidentiary purpose that is reflected in the common law's concept of vesting of third-party rights.","[Collins, David] City Univ London, City Law Sch, London EC1V 0HB, England; [Collins, David] Georgetown Univ, Ctr Law, Inst Int Econ, Washington, DC 20057 USA",City University London; Georgetown University,"Collins, D (通讯作者)，City Univ London, City Law Sch, London EC1V 0HB, England.",david.collins@utoronto.ca,,,,,,,41,2,3,0,2,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

J,"Irimie, DL; Essmann, HF",,,,"Irimie, Doru Leonard; Essmann, Hans Friedrich",,,Forest property rights in the frame of public policies and societal change,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Romanian forests; Property rights/regimes; General settings; Institutional change; Actors; Outcomes,,"Property rights over natural resources became a distinct area of inquiry in environmental economics and policy in the last decades, but their role has not yet been investigated thoroughly. Transition countries represent an excellent material of analysis of various policies and institutional developments concerning the regime of use and management of natural resources. The processes of societal transformation had deep impacts on the forestry sector. entailing land reforms and subsequent changes to its institutional and organisational framework. This paper presents an analysis of the reciprocal relationship between the evolving forest property rights and the conduct of policy and economic actors, in connection with their outcomes. The theoretical framework consists of institutional economics, whose core concept is that patterns of interaction between institutions and actors produce physical outcomes, assessable by criteria such as equity and efficiency. The study concentrated on three distinct periods and the applicable property regimes. Within this framework, the impacts of the characteristics of property regimes and the general framework of socio-economic conditions on the exercise of property rights were analysed. The analysis of the conduct of forest owners in relation to the institutional design was completed by the analysis of the other actors influential for land reforms. Romanian forestry sector, in evolution from the period shortly before World War 11 to present, represents the case of the study. Research data were collected by interviewing/questioning, participant observation and literature review. They were analysed through an integrated method of content analysis and a matrix analysis. An important conclusion is that not only the regime of forest property is determinant for the outcomes of resource use and management, but also the general settings in which they are embedded. Another essential point is that land reforms driven by either efficiency or equity rationales are not mere diversions of the benefit stream, but complex processes with serious implications for the status of the resource at stake.

The implicit framework for exchange rate determination is one in which prices are perfectly flexible (in the long run) so that purchasing power parity (PPP) prevails. Additional treatments allow students to examine the effects of price changes, tariffs, and nontradable goods on the exchange rate and to explore the possible resulting deviations from PPP.

This generates a wage premium relative to the job but a penalty relative to the qualification, and is therefore. A puzzle for human capital theory. A part of this derives from the use of measures of time spent in education for the calculation of overqualification. Analysing data from four European countries, we split years of education into two components, one reflecting certification, another reflecting time. While a qualification higher than required mostly generates a wage premium, time does not. The result is that the combination of time with excess (or deficit) qualification may make overqualification either a major or a minor mismatch. The probability of either outcome varies with the institutional arrangements of different countries' educational systems. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A major endorsement for IK initiatives in the context of participatory development is that these will likely facilitate more Successful interventions. Such research, for example, may inform and better guide scientific understanding and so assist in the formulation of policy in a way that Call relate to local realities. Nevertheless, there are many obstacles to its acceptance within mainstream development. Indeed according to some such research has no future, falling out of favour alongside growing critiques of the misappropriation of participatory ideology and methods. In this paper we explore the challenges facing IK research as it continues to seek real alternatives that advance a prominent place for local perspectives. We address the problems of developing and refining methodologies to facilitate more effective realisation of participatory approaches and consider the possible limits of the IK approach when set within current development ideologies, heavily influenced by politically dominant western nations and their changing agendas. In examining these concerns we envisage possible futures for the IK initiative. We highlight that its growth partly depends oil the continued promotion of a holistic approach through the advancement of interdisciplinary skills, combining the technical know-how of natural scientists with the Cultural empathy of social scientists and facilitating communication and collaboration between all actors. However, bolder steps are required in the future if we are to convince authorities that there are benefits to be gained by giving more opportunity to local communities to determine their own destinies, and to advocate the inclusion of alternative diverse views of development onto the political agenda.

We assemble a new data set of historical land use and prices over 11 sites during this 400-year period; this data set also includes information on changes in agricultural technology, climate and land ownership. A panel model is then estimated that controls for both supply and demand shifts over time. A main result is that prices that act in our model as a proxy for livestock numbers do indeed impact on biodiversity, with higher prices leading to lower biodiversity. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In such a case, the bodies of the clauses involved may be executed in parallel, giving raise to an OR parallel execution. So OR parallelism becomes an efficient method for exploiting alternative solutions in parallel. In section I we concentrated the main problems and limitations which appear in OR parallelism implementation, presenting also the most important result (due to Gupta and Jayaraman) obtained until now with respect to this aspect: the impossibility of simultaneously fulfilling the three criteria which define the implementation of an ideal OR parallel system. In section 2 we presented the main memory management mechanisms involved in a classical sequential implementation of the Prolog language. The analysis and characterization of the OR parallel execution models from section 3 are mainly performed relatively to the types of binding environments (centralized or distributed). We present and analyze also models based on multi-agents systems and methods based on stack operations. Section 4 represents the main original contribution of this paper, building a formal model for OR parallelism implementation and making an analysis of its complexity. The results obtained here formally validate the limitation reported by Gupta and Jayaraman, being also of a significant practical utility regarding possible improvements for OR parallel implementations. In section 5 we present a classification based on the three criteria, characterizing a set of implementations proposed in the literature or being in use at this time.","[Mocean, Loredana; Ciaca, Monica] Univ Babes Bolyai, Business Informat Syst Dept, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Khelalfa, Halim] Univ Wollongong, Dubai, U Arab Emirates",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Mocean, L (通讯作者)，Univ Babes Bolyai, Business Informat Syst Dept, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania.",,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,0,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

One popular method for scheduling irrigation uses volumetric soil water monitoring sensors installed in the root zone under tree canopies. There are several dielectric devices for measuring soil moisture on the market, but many have drawbacks including disrupting the soil during installation and small sensing volumes. We hypothesized that due to the spatial limitations of existing moisture sensors and soil heterogeneity, a representative measure of soil water content under a citrus tree could not be obtained with dielectric sensors. Consequently, incorrect irrigation could cause agrochemical leaching, crop stress and ultimately yield losses, or contamination of groundwater. Intensive soil moisture readings were taken in a Candler fine sand soil under citrus tree canopies with micro-jet irrigation. Measurements were taken with a 20-cm deep Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) moisture probe at 10-cm spacing in a 150 x 150-cm grid sampling area on the same side of the tree as the irrigation nozzle. Using the 225 moisture readings per tree, geostatistics were utilized to map the soil moisture variability under the citrus tree canopies after several types of soil moisture changing events. These included several days of drying, irrigation applications of one hour and three hours, and after rainfall. The data from root zones under the tree canopies was compared with irrigated bare soil in the same grove. Semivariogram analysis showed that the mean horizontal range of spatial dependence for soil water was 40 cm, and coefficients of variation were high (19 to 56%). Consequently, a single point measurement of soil water in the root zone under a citrus tree canopy was deemed highly unreliable and not suitable for accurate irrigation scheduling. Further research is needed to test alternative methods of measuring water status using tree canopy stress or other soil measurements.","[Waldo, L. J.; Schumann, A.

Reporting the outbreak may bring medical assistance but is also likely to trigger trade sanctions by countries hoping to contain the disease. Suppressing the information may avoid trade sanctions, but increases the likelihood of widespread epidemics. In this paper, we model the government's decision as a signaling game in which a country has private but imperfect evidence of an outbreak. First, we find that not all sanctions discourage reporting. Sanctions based on fears of an undetected outbreak (false negatives) encourage disclosure by reducing the relative cost of sanctions that follow a reported outbreak. Second, improving the quality of detection technology may not promote the disclosure of an outbreak because the forgone trade from reporting truthfully is that much greater. Third, informal surveillance is an important channel for publicizing outbreaks and functions as an exogenous yet imperfect signal that is less likely to discourage disclosure. In sum, obtaining accurate information about potential epidemics is as much about reporting incentives as it is about detection technology.","[Malani, Anup] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Malani, Anup] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Laxminarayan, Ramanan] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; Princeton University,"Malani, A (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,"Laxminarayan, Ramanan/ABD-5050-2021","Malani, Anup/0000-0002-2594-5778",,,,,29,8,8,0,13,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0022-166X,1548-8004,,J HUM RESOUR,J.

Intelligent solutions, here, are ways to optimise the capacity, efficiency, safety, sustainability, etc. of an infrastructure system, typically by means of ICT-based information processing. For this, three cases are presented of implementations of intelligent solutions. Viewing the infrastructure as part of a constellation, serving to fulfil a societal need, the problems encountered in these cases are found to be of a similar nature. It is found that intelligent technology in itself is not enough for an intelligent solution, the users and operators need to be involved in a learning process, and the institutions will need to be changed as well. Consequently, the design should not focus on the intelligent infrastructure alone, not only on the end goal, but rather the transition phase itself should be designed carefully, with much attention for intermediate and hybrid stages where sometimes the flexibility gained from the intelligent solution can already be put to use.

These aspects of globalization have offsetting implications that make it unclear whether they spur, reduce or have little effect on standard hours. To explore these possibilities, the paper analyses a survey of establishments in 18 European countries. The analysis reveals significant diversity in how different 'facets' of globalization affect weekly hours. Establishments in sectors facing more international trade and investment have neither shorter nor longer work weeks. But those in net import-competing sectors and having more foreign-born employees tend to have higher standard hours than other enterprises. Finally, collective bargaining over hours may mediate the effects of globalization, particularly trade: establishments without collective-bargaining agreements increase standard hours in response to trade, while those establishments with such agreements are less likely to respond in this way.","[Burgoon, Brian] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Raess, Damian] Univ Geneva, Dept Polit Sci, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland",University of Amsterdam; University of Geneva,"Burgoon, B (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",b.m.burgoon@uva.nl,,"Burgoon, Brian/0000-0002-7300-0541",,,,,46,9,9,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

However, some analysts suggest that by attracting more almost full-paying students through the use of merit aid, institutions will have more financial resources that they can use to increase their financial aid to low-income students and thus their enrollment. Results using data from the College Board's Annual Survey of Colleges and other secondary data sources suggest that the increased use of merit aid is associated with a decrease in enrollment of low-income and minority students, particularly at more selective institutions. Middle and bottom tier colleges may be offsetting costs with tuition increases, as the introduction of merit aid is accompanied by an increase in net costs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Considerable advances have been made in the application of evolutionary biology to health issues in recent decades. Health researchers and practitioners could benefit considerably from an understanding of the basic principles of evolution and how humans have been shaped by natural and sexual selection, even if they are not explicitly testing evolutionary hypotheses. Life History Theory is a powerful framework that can be used for examining modern human environments and developing environments that maximize opportunities for positive health outcomes. Many of the recommendations derived from this framework converge with the visions of current public health advocates. Despite the benefits of an evolutionary framework, the challenges that face those attempting to integrate evolutionary theory into public health are perhaps greater than those in the social sciences. Although considerable advancements in the understanding of health issues have already been made, health researchers with an evolutionary perspective are very few in number and face constraining disciplinary attributes. Advances in medical technology will continue to extend the boundaries of saving lives in danger, however traditional public health efforts may be reaching their limits of effectiveness in encouraging health-promoting behaviors. This may partially account for the current interest in broad social and policy change to enhance health and reduce health disparities amongst sub-populations. Such substantial physical and social restructuring will face many challenges and gradual progress may be enhanced by a strong foundation of evolutionary human science. The slow but eventual integration of evolutionary principles will gradually enhance the effectiveness of health interventions and provide an ultimate explanation for patterns in health outcomes that are otherwise puzzling. The speed at which the field of public health adopts a Darwinian framework has yet to be determined, and several futures are possible. This pace will depend on several factors, including the visible utility of evolutionary theory for addressing the health promotion goals of the field. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

For men surviving to age 81, an extra year of schooling is estimated to reduce the probability of dying before the age of 89 by almost three percentage points relative to a baseline of 50 percent.","[van Kippersluis, Hans; van Doorslaer, Eddy] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [O'Donnell, Owen] Univ Macedonia, Thessaloniki, Greece; [van Doorslaer, Eddy] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; University of Macedonia; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"van Kippersluis, H (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",,"; O'Donnell, Owen/C-1732-2015","van Doorslaer, Eddy/0000-0003-2692-1433; O'Donnell, Owen/0000-0002-6289-1924; van Kippersluis, Hans/0000-0003-3297-5059","NIA NIH HHS [R01 AG037398-01, R01 AG037398] Funding Source: Medline",NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,73,102,110,1,26,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0022-166X,1548-8004,,J HUM RESOUR,J.

The lowest level of unemployment in the last twenty years was double that and long term unemployment, virtually unknown in the 1950s and 1960s, has been a severe problem. In each period there were two major slumps. We examine the progress of each slump and macroeconomic policy responses in each case, in order to search for reasons for this contrast. The priority given to minimising unemployment rather than restraining inflation is the most important difference between the two periods. Other major principles stand out, the most important of which are that in response to a downturn a fiscal policy stimulus is essential and must play the major part of any response; and that implementation must be swift and then followed up by further measures if necessary.","[Nevile, J.

J,"Jöbstl, HA",,,,"Joebstl, Hans A.",,,Do altered prices and logging costs for logs of small diameters affect the optimum rotation of Norway spruce in mountainous regions?,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Norway spruce; Rotation period; Log price relations; Simulation models; Transition problems,,"Rotation as the planned average production period of a management unit within the age-class system, and as a central control value for the forest enterprise, has always been a key factor of forest sustainability. It determines, for instance, growing stock, timber yield, tree dimensions and economic success. As a consequence of changes in sawmilling technology, price relations between dimensional assortments of Norway spruce, which is Austria's most abundant tree species, have altered in favour of small diameter logs at least for medium and low quality timber. This trend has been accompanied by advantages in the efficiency of fully mechanised timber harvesting technology for smaller dimension timber in particular. Sawmills have turned to forestry with the request to provide small diameter logs and reduce the production period. Thus, the question arose as to whether a shortening of rotation would make sense in mountainous regions as well. As early as in the 1990s a first comprehensive analysis of possible consequences of the aforementioned changes for the rotation period of highest income from the forest came to the conclusion that shortening the rotation period would not be recommendable (Jobstl, 1997). A more recent study was designed to consider also the changes of the past 15 years and compare the results with those of the former study. For calculating the net income and its components - contribution margin I (stumpage value; sales revenue minus logging costs) and contribution margin II (stumpage minus costs of silvicultural measures) - the stand development and stand valuation program FOWISIM was applied. The timber prices used were based on forest statistics and expert consultations. Newly available timber harvesting productivity models were integrated into the simulation model. The consequences of changes in the rotation period (decrease and increase) for the sustainability of the enterprise (felling quantities, growing stock, income, etc.) are demonstrated by means of the dynamic transition model FOBSI. Both models applied are deterministic ones with some stochastic elements and cover time increments of 1 or 10 years. The conclusions of the first study - no reduction of rotation periods - have been fully confirmed by the recent study. The model simulations showed only small differences between the net income values around the maximum value, which offers a wide range of two or three decades for the choice of the rotation. The development of price relations for dimensional assortments and logging cost relations tends to reduce the optimum length of rotation, while a decreasing timber price level increases the optimum rotation period. However, the changes of the examined factors (i.e. price relations, price level, and logging costs) over the last two decades have not been big enough to give any reason for decreasing or increasing the rotation period.

We provide evidence that neglecting the issue of properly accounting for the quality of health services can lead to misleading results. Our main finding is that adjusting output for quality has a three-fold effect on efficiency analysis. Firstly, inefficiency explains relatively more of the deviation from potential output. Secondly, the average technical efficiency in the sector is lower, while its dispersion among PCCs is significantly higher.

A principal component analysis followed by cluster analysis was used to establish typologies of households based on livelihood strategies. The result distinguishes five livelihood strategies with different outcomes and levels of livelihood diversification. Both the poorest and the better-off households pursue diversified strategies. However, in terms of income level and food security, business-based and crop-based strategies have better outcomes. Forest income is an important source of cash income and particularly for low income groups it provides opportunity to diversify their livelihoods. Household characteristics such as age of household head and possession of cropland together with geographical factors like altitude and distance from market were found to be the most important determinants of livelihood strategy choices.

By exploiting the generous public subsidizing of private high schools in the province of Quebec, the second most populous province in Canada, we identify the causal impact of attendance in a private high school on achievement in mathematics. Because the supply of highly subsidized spaces is much higher at the high school level than at the grade school level, 94% of transitions from the public to the private sector occur at the end of primary school, we assume that these transitions are exogenous with respect to changes in transitory unobserved variables affecting math scores conditional on variables such as changes in income and child fixed effects. Using 7 cycles of data from Statistics Canada's National Longitudinal Survey on Children and Youth (NLSCY), we estimate the effect of attending a private high school on the percentile rank and a standardized math test score with different models (child fixed effects, random effects and a pooled OLS) and restricted samples to control for the degree of selection. The results, interpreted as a treatment on the treated effect show that the effect of changing schools, from a public grade school to a private high school, increases the percentile rank of the math score between 4 and 10 points and by between 0.12 and 0.36 of a standard deviation depending on the specification and samples.

When both education and skill mismatch variables are included together in the model only overskilling reduces job satisfaction consistently for both sexes.

Also, it has been one of the industries less affected by the crisis, which makes us wonder about its key advantages. At the same time, company sales force is of growing importance, especially when analyzing competitive advantages. Based on prior empirical studies presented in the international literature, this study empirically examines how salespersons in the pharmaceutical industry participate in strategic communication activities. The role of sales persons has expanded beyond the traditional selling function and includes a strong connection to the market, as well as information about competitors' strategies. Therefore, salespersons have come to play a strategic role in gathering information which can lead to change in company strategy. The degree to which company managers accept suggestions and value market feed-back differs from company to company and from market to market. The current study analyses the nature of strategic communication activities in pharmaceutical companies in Romania. As the top twenty pharmaceutical companies on the Romanian market are strongly dominated by multinationals, it is natural to obtain results comparable to those at international level. Still, Romanian companies are highly affected by defective upwards communication, which can generate wrong strategic approaches and ignorance in terms of market trends and competitors' strategies. The study proves that strategic communication activities encourage individual selling performance and can lead to increase in company value.","[Ciulu, Ruxandra] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,,ruxandra.ciulu@uaic.ro,"Ciulu, Ruxandra/AAG-2871-2021",,,,,,18,1,1,0,14,"ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA UNIV IASI, FACULTY ECONOMICS & BUSINESS ADMINSTRATION",IASI,"22 CAROL 1ST BLVD, IASI, 700505, ROMANIA",,,978-973-640-658-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,449,453,,,,,,5,Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BZM22,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000302002900076,0

Then, we quantify and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed hybrid schemes by investigating whether pre-set objectives (enforcement of permit price bounds and reduction of the compliance costs for relevant companies) can be accomplished while maintaining the original environmental targets.

Findings include that men and sexual liberals of either gender are more likely positive toward prostitution and men and women who are conservative or support gender equality are more negative. Holding anti-immigration views correlates with more positive attitudes toward buying, but not selling, sex. Norwegians are more positive than Swedes toward prostitution. Supporting gender equality has more explanatory power in Sweden than in Norway, which may be due to the use of gender equality to frame the Swedish debate.","[Jakobsson, Niklas; Kotsadam, Andreas] Norwegian Social Res NOVA, Oslo, Norway; [Kotsadam, Andreas] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Jakobsson, N (通讯作者)，Norwegian Social Res NOVA, Oslo, Norway.",,"Jakobsson, Niklas/F-8194-2013; Jakobsson, Niklas/AAD-3660-2022","Jakobsson, Niklas/0000-0002-7143-8793",,,,,41,37,45,1,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The significance of the event as an element of a destination's tourist offer reflects in their tourist, social and cultural functions. The tourist function of the event is particularly contained in expansion of the destination tourist market, extension of tourist stays at a destination, building of a destination image and better destination promotion. Apart from attracting investment in a tourist destination, tourist events also represent an important attraction and animation factor at a destination. From the quoted knowledge emanates a need for systematic event research from the aspects of the economic, social and environmental event impacts in the sense of creation of event and tourist destination sustainability. Given the ever-increasing significance of events as an element of enrichment of a tourist choice and one of the fundamental motives for choosing a destination, as well as an ever-increasing amount of research on the topic of event sustainability, in this paper the authors particularly identify events by way of a detailed analysis and the possibility of management impact on raising the quality of a tourist destination. In this work, the importance of establishing the sustainability and responsibilities of events have been described by means of monitoring and measuring of the economic, social and environmental impacts. In order to establish event sustainability and responsibilities, in this work the method of case study has been used on the example of the art event of the Theatre Ulysses, which takes place at the National Park Brijuni, in the Republic of Croatia. Following the conducted case study, the research results show that, from the aspect of event sustainability, the largest part is made up of the social and economic sustainability, while the environmental sustainability takes last place. The research pointed to a lack of awareness by the organiser of the need to monitor the environmental impacts, especially those defined as ecological consumption impacts. In this paper, an attempt will be made to provide practical direction for the monitoring of event impacts, with the aim of answering the question What measures must be taken by the event organisers in order for their events to be considered as sustainable and responsible?","[Trost, Klara] Inst Agr & Tourism Porec, Porec 52440, Croatia; [Milohnic, Ines] Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospital Management, Naselje Ika, HR-51410 Opatija, Croatia",Institute of Agriculture & Tourism Porec; University of Rijeka,,klara.trost@iptpo.hr; ines.milohnic@fthm.hr,"MILOHNIĆ, INES/T-4982-2019","MILOHNIĆ, INES/0000-0001-7487-4286",,,,,31,1,1,0,4,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

For this purpose, we investigated the influence of organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) on individual performance among two groups of employees from the private sector (IT&C and production) in Romania, both in terms of behaviors and outcomes. Taking into account OCB influence on organizational performance, we tested in a regression model if OCB can predict individual job performance.

The Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI) is used. Our results demonstrate that total factor productivity change measured by MPI increased from 2001 to 2005, but thereafter regressed. This is due to a regress in the technical change component of the MPI. The efficiency change component is as strong as before. We interpret this result as an indication that the industry has reached a level of technological sophistication from where it is difficult to make substantial progress. For an individual producer it may still be possible to improve efficiency by catching up relative to the best practice frontier When this possibility is exhausted, the total factor productivity change for the industry may come to a halt.","[Vassdal, Terje; Holst, Helen Marita Sorensen] Univ Tromso, Tromso Univ Business Sch, N-9037 Tromso, Norway",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Vassdal, T (通讯作者)，Univ Tromso, Tromso Univ Business Sch, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",terje.vassdal@uit.no; helen.m.holst@uit.no,,,,,,,29,61,62,1,17,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

First, low-income students in Massachusetts have lower intended college enrollment rates than higher income students but also have dramatically lower skills and attend lower-quality school districts. Second, inclusion of skill controls greatly reduces but does not eliminate this intended enrollment gap. Third, inclusion of school district fixed effects has little further impact, with low-income students eight percentage points less likely to intend enrollment than higher income students of the same skill and from the same school district.

While several studies have shown that students who participate in athletic activities perform better in school than those who do not, it is not clear whether this association is a result of positive academic spillovers, or due to the influence of unobservables.

I find effects of changes in state labor demand on college graduate location choice that are several times greater than for high school graduates.

The results therefore suggest that support for democracy is a social benefit of education in Jordan, Lebanon, and Pakistan. Regarding income, the results indicate that relative to the poor, those belonging to middle-income groups are more supportive of democracy in Lebanon and Turkey.

We use data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) combined with a database on university postal codes to estimate a discrete choice model of the demand for higher education. We show that - controlling for other socio-economic and regional characteristics - distance to the nearest university at the time of completing secondary school significantly affects the decision to enrol in a university.

Measurements of the degree of sensitivity to scope are commonly proposed as a test for the reliability of contingent valuation studies. We evaluate the traditional scope test using neoclassical utility functions that are directionally bounded. We provide a formal definition of sensitivity to scope, and show that directionally bounded utility functions can produce arbitrarily small degrees of sensitivity to scope. We conclude that a failure to satisfy existing scope tests should not be used as a prima fade basis for rejecting contingent valuation studies. This does not imply that small degrees of sensitivity to scope should always be viewed as acceptable. Rather, the results of scope tests should be considered more carefully, with attention given to the substitutability of market and non-market goods. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Our results imply that at least one-third of the gender pay gap might be wage discrimination by profit-maximizing monopsonistic employers.

We document strong evidence that the profitability of a monthly contrarian strategy decreases with industry-adjusted firm size or residual analyst coverage. Moreover, the profitability of contrarian strategies survives for a longer horizon for stocks with slower information diffusion than for those with faster information diffusion. This result holds true even if risk, bid-ask spread, lead-lag effect, inventory costs, and limits to arbitrage are properly accounted for.

We compared the cost-effectiveness of triple immunosuppressive regimens in Germany. Methods A strong micro-simulation model was built comparing regimens based on cyclosporine, everolimus, sirolimus, and tacrolimus. Mean cost per patient, incremental cost per life year gained, and incremental cost per additional year with functioning graft were assessed from the perspective of the German statutory health insurance (SHI) after 2 and 10 years. Results Over the 2-year period, the model predicted mean total costs per patient of 26,732, 29,352, 33,415, and 49,978 (sic) for sirolimus, cyclosporine, everolimus, and tacrolimus, respectively. Focusing on the cost per life year gained, the sirolimus-based regimen compared favorably with those based on everolimus and tacrolimus. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of cyclosporine versus sirolimus is 524,000 (sic) per life year gained. Regarding the cost per year with functioning graft gained, sirolimus dominated cyclosporine and everolimus, while the ICER for tacrolimus compared to sirolimus amounts to 1,788,154 (sic).

With regard to life years gained, sirolimus dominated both cyclosporine and everolimus. The ICER of tacrolimus versus sirolimus was 1,766,894 (sic).

In the 1920s, these companies began to use OTC stock to gain capital for their own development. Initially, transactions were made by emissaries; however, in 1971, NASDAQ (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations) - the first electronic stock exchange - was developed. Projects to create OTC stock in Poland began in 1994 and it was a long time before it became well established. Originally, it was intended that companies involved in the Mass Privatization Program (Program Powszechnej Prywatyzacji) would trade stocks there. However, only a fraction of over 500 companies taking part in the Program ventured to make their debut on the new market. After the initial failure, the role of the OTC stock on the Polish financial market had to be redefined. According to a new concept, the new market would aim at new, small and medium companies with a growth-potential. It was thought to be the GPW's (Warsaw Stock Exchange) breeding ground for the companies which were unable to meet listing requirements for larger exchanges, but which needed to gain capital to increase their activity. This strategy was not very successful either, as enterprises were very reluctant to enter the market. One of the reasons could be the fact that at the time when the Polish capital market was forming, all trading was possible only on the stock exchange. Also, the market was not sufficiently promoted, so small enterprises were unaware that they could gain capital there, instead of issuing shares on the stock exchange. Finally, overregulation might have contributed to the failure of the concept as excessive control hindered natural development and self-regulation of the OTC stock. BondSpot has increased efforts to create a public market for government, municipal and corporate bonds and the market for public utilities. The platform, which enables bond trade on the secondary market Catalyst, has been formed with the primary aim of promoting investments in such bonds in Poland. This strategy seems to be efficient as it fills the market niche. It is in the time of crisis that the bond market may become a dark horse. Enterprises which face problems with obtaining investment credits while having difficulties meeting tough assessment criteria for borrowing capacity and cautious investors who have lost a chunk of their assets during the recent crisis are likely to choose bonds as an alternative to satisfy their needs - convenient for the former and save for the latter. The fear of another crisis and the possibility of the return of downward tendencies on exchanges both encourage less aggressive investments.","[Jonczyk, Agata] Uniwersytetu Ekon, Krakowie, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Jonczyk, A (通讯作者)，Uniwersytetu Ekon, Krakowie, Poland.",,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,WYZSZA SZKOLA BIZNESUNATL-LOUIS UNIV,NOWY SACZ,"ZIELONA 27, NOWY SACZ, 33-300, POLAND",2543-5396,,978-83-88421-65-5,ORG KOMER NIEKOMER,,,2010,,,,,,,201,210,,,,,,10,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE4NK,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000371969900017,0

STR models naturally lend themselves to modelling structural change and may be a useful tool for incorporating asymmetries in the dynamics among different variables. In this investigation, we attempt to explain the returns of the SBI 20 with the help of gross domestic product, interest rates, and other financial and macroeconomic variables. Additionally, it has proven useful to introduce the S&P 500 and FTSEurofirst 100 stock market indices into the nonlinear equation. During different GDP growth regimes, the dynamics of global financial markets impact the Slovenian stock exchange with varying intensity. We can conclude that the up-coming financial crisis is manifested weaker in Slovenia probably due to less intensive exchange of securities with global markets and less developed financial markets.","[Kavkler, Alenka; Festic, Mejra] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Kavkler, A (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Maribor, Slovenia.",alenka.kavkler@uni-mb.si,"PETRE, BREZEANU/F-9468-2012",,,,,,41,2,2,0,14,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Data from a total of 64 fish farms randomly sampled from Oyo State, Nigeria, were used for the analysis. The study employed the stochastic frontier model with flexible risk specification. The empirical findings show that the mean fish output is significantly influenced by labor fertilizer and feed. Fertilizer and feed are found to be risk-increasing inputs, whilst labour is revealed to be a risk-reducing input. This implies that an average risk-averse farmer is expected to use less of fertilizer and feed and more labor compared to a risk-neutral farmer from the study area. Furthermore, it is revealed that labour farming experience, education, and access to market significantly decreases the technical inefficiency of farmers. The estimated technical efficiency shows that the efficiency score is overstated when the production technology of the fish farms is modeled without the flexible risk component.","[Ogundari, Kolawole] Univ Kiel, Inst Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, D-24098 Kiel, Germany; Minist Agr & Rural Dev Alagbaka, Ondo State Agr Input Supply Agcy AISA Akure, Akure, Nigeria",University of Kiel,"Ogundari, K (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Inst Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, Johanna Mestorf Str 5, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.",ogundarikolawole@daad-alumni.de; jidebest2000@yahoo.co.uk,"Ogundari, Kolawole/F-6700-2018","Ogundari, Kolawole/0000-0001-5714-4417","Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (AvH), at Institute of Food Economics and Consumption Studies, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany","Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (AvH), at Institute of Food Economics and Consumption Studies, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation)","Kolawole Ogundari is a Georg-Forster postdoctoral research fellow, supported under the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (AvH), at the host institution: Institute of Food Economics and Consumption Studies, University of Kiel, Johanna-Mestorf-Strasse 5, 24098, Kiel, Germany (email: ogundarikolawole@daad-alumni.de).

J,"Wauters, J; Vandenbussche, H",,,,"Wauters, Jasper; Vandenbussche, Hylke",,,China - Measures Affecting Imports of Automobile Parts,WORLD TRADE REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper reviews the WTO Appellate Body Report on China Measures Affecting Imports of Automobile Parts (WT/DS342/AB/R, 15 December 2008). This dispute concerns a set of regulatory measures imposing a 25% 'charge' on imported automobile parts used in the manufacture of motor vehicles in China. The main legal question in this case consisted of the nature of this charge as either a border charge subject to China's tariff concessions or an internal charge, subject to the basic nondiscrimination requirement of GATT Article III. In our report, we examine the reasoning of the Appellate Body relating to the difference between these two types of charges. We discuss the role and relevance of this distinction in the GATT/WTO legal system in general, and for the purposes of resolving this dispute in particular. We also address the important systemic question relating to the review of a Member's domestic laws for purposes of determining their GATT/WTO consistency. This was an important issue in this case, as China claimed that the Panel misunderstood the meaning of the relevant Decree and requested the Appellate Body to review the Panel's erroneous reading of this Decree. We discuss the Appellate Body's reasoning relating to the review of domestic laws by Panels and the Appellate Body and express concern over the distinction drawn by the Appellate Body between legal and factual elements of relevance in the interpretation of such laws. The 'economic bone' in this case is less straightforward to split than the legal one. In legal terms, the Appellate Body's decision is a time-consistent one, but, in economic terms, it is not clear if it is also a welfare-optimal one. The main reason is that many questions relevant to the case were left unaddressed by the Appellate Body. Due to the lack of factual evidence to substantiate its allegations, the Panel's ruling remains rather speculative on certain accounts. For this purpose, we engage in our own examination of the facts, using mainly a unique dataset of Chinese firm-level data. We analyze issues of ownership in China's car industry, the growth of the import-competing Chinese industry over time, the elasticity of the demand for cars, and duty pass-through, etc. The purpose is to verify more closely who 'benefits' and who 'loses' from the Chinese import duty so as to understand the economic incentives involved. In this respect, we attempt to determine whether the economics support the conclusion that China pursued a beggar-thy-neighbor policy in the car-part industry.","[Vandenbussche, Hylke] Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain,,jwauters@geneva.whitecase.com; hylke.vandenbussche@uclouvain.be,,"Vandenbussche, Hylke/0000-0002-4073-0097",,,,,0,6,6,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JAN,2010,9.0,1,,,,,201,238,,10.1017/S1474745609990334,0.0,,,38,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,586BO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000276876100009,0

MVMC extend over one third of the area of the region. Over the years, MVMC have undergone many changes in terms of ownership and resource management. Such changes have resulted in land tenure insecurity among current landowners, who live in rural areas. The new land uses-mainly related to energy sources-the demographic changes, the role of the Public Administration as a manager of MVMC, the presence of private companies with interests in forests, and the disagreement between forest communities or among commoners of the same community have brought about many conflicts that have gone beyond the limits of forests and have been reflected in public opinion. This paper aims to provide a deeper insight into the level and mode of management of MVMC by determining the level and cause of conflicts associated with this type of forest. To this end, local and regional newspaper articles about conflicts in forest communities were compiled from libraries. In order to find correlations between the different social, economic or environmental variables and the degree of conflict, statistical and spatial analyses were performed. Results reveal a stronger impact of environmental conflicts and conflicts between commoners and government organizations, and a very uneven spatial distribution of conflicts. In addition, this article discusses the interpretation of the higher or lower degree of conflict as a positive or negative contribution to the management of privately owned common land, thus contributing a new methodology to determine the causes and consequences of conflicts over common land management.

Given the intensification of global competition, it is crucial to assess the present status and competitiveness of the Chinese wooden furniture industry, as well as the changes and challenges China will face in competing with other principal trading nations. Based on Balassa's Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) Indices, it can be concluded that China has experienced a transition from comparative disadvantage into a high comparative advantage over the period, and has maintained a strong position in this labor-intensive industry. However, it still falls behind traditionally strong competitors such as Italy and Germany in terms of quality and unit price. It is also experiencing a growing challenge from lower-income countries such as Poland and Vietnam. Moreover, China now faces up more unfavorable macroeconomic circumstances such as rising cost, shrinking international demand, technology gap and escalating trade barriers. Thus, the government, industrial association and enterprises need to quickly take innovative steps coordinately to promote Chinese enterprises transitioning from the original equipment manufacturers (OEM) to the original design manufacturers (ODM), further to the original brand manufacturers (OBM).

To do so, we construct a calibrated general equilibrium model that jointly describes the world economy and the strategic incentives that guide the design of national abatement policies. Countries' decisions about their participation in a trading system and about their initial permit endowment are made non-cooperatively; so a priori it is not clear that permit trade will induce participation in international abatement agreements or that participation will result in significant environmental gains. Despite this, we find that emission trade agreements can be effective; that smaller groupings pairing developing and developed-world partners often perform better than agreements with larger rosters; and that general equilibrium responses play an important role in shaping these outcomes.

We show that a volatility (depth) increase is followed by a depth (volatility) decrease; a market order increase (decrease) subsequently induces higher (lower) volatility; and a limit order increase (decrease) results in more (less) market orders and limit orders.

We document a sharp decline in the FH coefficient from the mid-1990s onward, supporting the hypothesis of increased economic and financial integration. Subsequently, we extend the literature and use a non-linear specification with interaction terms to empirically show that observed decreases in equity home bias (EHB) and increases in trade openness are structurally linked to the time variation in the FH coefficient. Thus, this paper empirically establishes a structural link between three puzzles in international macroeconomics and finance: the FH puzzle, the EHB puzzle and the trade home bias puzzle.","[Kool, Clemens J.

J,"Meer, J; Rosen, HS",,,,"Meer, Jonathan; Rosen, Harvey S.",,,The impact of athletic performance on alumni giving: An analysis of microdata,ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Educational economics; Educational finance,PRIVATE COLLEGES; UNIVERSITIES; SPORTS,"An ongoing controversy in the literature on the economics of higher education centers on whether the success of a school's athletic program affects alumni donations. This paper uses a unique data set to investigate this issue. The data contain detailed information about donations made by alumni of a selective research university as well as a variety of their economic and demographic characteristics. One important question is how to characterize the success of an athletic program. We focus not only on the performance of the most visible teams, football and basketball, but also oil the success of the team on which he or she played as an undergraduate. One of our key findings is that the impact of athletic success on donations differs for men and women. When a male graduate's former team wins its conference championship, his donations for general purposes increase by about 7% and his donations to the athletic program increase by about the same percentage. Football and basketball records generally have small and statistically insignificant effects; in some specifications, a winning basketball season reduces donations. For women there is no statistically discernible effect of a former team's success on current giving; as is the case for men, the impacts of football and basketball, while statistically significant in some specifications, are not important in magnitude. Another novel result is that for males, varsity athletes whose teams were successful when they were undergraduates subsequently make larger donations to the athletic program. For example, if a male alumnus's team won its conference championship during his senior year, his subsequent giving to the athletic program is about 8% a year higher, ceteris paribus.

J,"Peretto, PF",,,,"Peretto, Pietro F.",,,Energy taxes and endogenous technological change,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Endogenous technological change; Market structure; Growth; Energy taxes; Environment,LONG-RUN GROWTH; MODEL; OIL,"This paper studies the effects of a tax on energy use in a growth model where market structure is endogenous and jointly determined with the rate of technological change. Because this economy does not exhibit the scale effect (a positive relation between TFP growth and aggregate R&D), the tax has no effect on the steady-state growth rate. It has, however, important transitional effects that give rise to surprising results. Specifically, under the plausible assumption that energy demand is inelastic, there may exist a hump-shaped relation between the energy tax and welfare. This shape stems from the fact that the reallocation of resources from energy production to manufacturing triggers a temporary acceleration of TFP growth that generates a root-shaped time profile of consumption. If endogenous technological change raises consumption sufficiently fast and by a sufficient amount in the long run, and households are sufficiently patient, the tax raises welfare despite the fact that-in line with standard intuition-it lowers consumption in the short run.
